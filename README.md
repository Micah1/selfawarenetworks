This Github address github.com/v5ma is home page on github for

# The Self Aware Networks Institute for Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, Artificial Neurology, Brain Machine Interfaces, and Advanced Medical Research.

This is the new home page of www.selfawareneuralnetworks.com to contained the notes for the book Self Aware Networks, and it represents the notes that are being used to make the book. Critically you should know that these notes are not the book.

# NOTHING IN THIS GITHUB REPO IS EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED AS OF JUNE 17th 2022

*Note for the publication of the notes on June 17th 2022 Keep in mind these are raw notes, everything needs to be updated, organized, edited, cleaned up, before it goes into the book. What you see are sketches, drafts, early versions of many ideas that will be cleaned up & improved. This is a super early preview of what is to come. Like software that is pre-beta (alpha) release. THE POINT is to give you an early preview of what I am working on, the monumental amount of work that I am putting into the book, so can get an idea of what I am creating, and if you want, now you can help. Over the next 5 months the book will emerge from these notes.

# In particular many of the audio transcribed notes that start with the letter b, like b0000y, need a ton of fixes made to them, the main issue is that Google Recorder's Neural Network replaced words that I said with words that I didn't say, and that makes many of the audio notes incoherent, but they will make sense when I fix them.

That's part of why I've given myself 5 more months to complete this book. In theory it should take a lot less time than that to turn these notes into a book.

You can pre-order or purchase the book here, if you pre-order you will help support me in creating this book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3QHX9FN?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420&fbclid=IwAR0j14R_e2Lr_liTlrBitmff-j8YiWq26YH-XRb8U94jD6n_S_T6Rmn-FqY

Someone asked me how much my book will cost. Well the 1rst edition of the book will be mostly text, and the price will be $9.99. The 2nd Edition of the book will be greatly expanded & clarified with, with new research, new content, and beautiful 2D & 3D art & illustrations & will fetch a higher price (I haven't decided on a price yet for the 2nd Edition, but it might be comparable to the book Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind (Fifth Edition) 5th Edition, Kindle Edition by Michael Gazzaniga (Author), Richard B. Ivry (Author), George R. Mangun (Author) in price which sells for $95. Both the first & second editions will be collectors items.

Please pre-order the book to support my work, especially if you enjoy these notes or find any value from reading them. The book price of $9.99 is thanks & support for this work. I would appreciate it if you pre-ordered the book after reviewing these book notes, especially if you found my work valuable or interesting.

Some of these notes are intended to become part of a book titled "Self Aware Networks by Micah Samuel Blumberg"

Some of the notes will be deleted. I do not believe every phrase or every idea written in these notes. Some of the notes are quotes from others and in further revisions I will clarify what I wrote as distinct from quotes.

Not every statement in the notes was written by me, some of the notes include quotes from others, some include text & ideas written by others, some of the notes include transcribed conversations with others that Micah Blumberg had with other people, in the final book it is the intention to quote every source accurately and to give all credit to the sources of various ideas that are due to those sources.

# Not everything written in these notes is true and correct.

Some of it is incorrect, some of it is untrue, but if I included untrue and incorrect information in my notes that is because the information that I saved in my notes had something of value in it that I wished to extract or later examine for extraction so that I could include something from it into the book.

# There are many statements in my notes that I do not agree with, that I will be fixing as the project moves forward.

Just as there are many things that I've said online on social media that I myself as of today would not be in perfect agreement with. There are many things that a person would say differently with the knowledge learned from years of study following the point from which they made their statements in the first place. No person that I'm aware of is excluded from the need to revise their past statements and past viewpoints on various topics.

# I think that sharing these notes will have a net good effect for humanity.

This is the homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute that you can contribute to from your github account by making a pull request. The contents of this Institute are the source material for the book called "Self Aware Networks" that I haven't released yet. The web address is selfawarenetworks.com and there are a number of associated groups that I will link here shortly. 

The order of the notes is completely random, because I came up with the numbering system after most of the notes were created and I deleted notes and gave some notes that were unnumbered the numbers of deleted notes. So there is no great importance to the first notes. Some of the notes date back to 2011. So these notes are selections from a larger set of notes going back more than 10 years.
a0000z many of the original text notes have a title format like a0000z, sometimes they contain text that was written by others, but copied to preserve conversations, to think about what was discussed again later on. 

b0000y the audio notes have a title format like b0000y and they will often contain conversations from Clubhouse for example that includes a mixture of things said by myself and other people, the audio itself will be published later on in some cases.

Please note that audio notes were auto transcribed with neural networks via Google Recorder, and then I put them into Google Docs to run an automatic grammar check. So what you are reading is NOT exactly what was originally said. That is why I am sharing it in my notes but I will not share this in this form in my book.

c0000x was invented to designate notes that correspond to sections of the book outlined in the table of contents.

Some of the notes I'm sharing are outdated older ideas. a0608z for example is from November 14th 2014 and I included it because it's interesting.

Sorry about the grammatically incorrect run on sentences.

I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on consciousness & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that its not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but its enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.

Some of the ideas in these notes for the book are incorrect, outdated, and kept simply because they contained something interesting that I wanted to follow up on later. Some of the ideas are very well backed with sources. Some of the ideas I believe are correct are so different I will likely have to debate them. OK.

This is an Institute on Github meaning that it is open to contributions, you can submit pull requests from your account and if accepted you will be a documented contributor to this research. I may even cite your work in the upcoming printed version of the book titled Self Aware Networks.

Please note that many of the notes date back a decade or more, with many from the period between 2011 & 2014 included because they were interesting, not because they were correct. There are many novel and interesting notes that I'm including that I know contain incorrect information. The US Government may wish to ask me to clarify some of the notes and I will do that if they decide they want to work with me.

Another disclaimer. Not all of the notes are intended to be serious. Some include cultural references to science fiction films, science fiction books, or other popular media content, and none of these cultural references to popular media content are intended for the book, but at somepoint we can have a dedicated repo to cultural references related to brain computer interfaces, intelligent robots, science fiction, and other content that might be interesting to people who like these topics.

#The way these notes are meant to be used is via the "Search Repository Tool"

Note a0030z contains an early attempt at creating a map of the notes, and another note a0616z, however a0616z is now a backup representing an early example of an early attempt to create a table of contents.

The active table of contents is here, and this is also note c0000x
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARbVgZKF1HKRz8Zj0TLCCysSTRdBTmdR29SDMOlfq_Q/edit?usp=sharing

The table of contents + the map of notes are supposed to help organize the content in the notes into the final book due out November 17th 2022.

I would love it if enthusiastic people wanted to donate their time to helping to organize the content of the book, finishing the map of the notes, helping me to improve the table of contents, and working with me in dialog to flesh out certain ideas that might be unclear, and helping me fix mistakes in my notes.

(if you see a date under the note identification number
example: 
a0074z
Oct 17, 2012
that means I recognized that the note was old and I looked up the date of when the original note was saved (in another system) most of the undated notes are newer, and some of the older dated notes have had new things added to them. I can lookup dates upon request to add them to notes if you want to know when the note was added to my other note library (that is not on github) but even then sometimes the content in the note is far older than the creation of the note itself because the content came from something I wrote on social media years prior to creating the note, or from an old audio recording.

Some of the notes are poetic, or intended to inspire the artwork for the 2nd edition of the book. Some of the notes contain references to mythological ideas or religious ideas and those might inspire art, but it's not the meant to taken seriously. My intention is to not include any mythological or religious ideas in the text of the book. I don't endorse any particular religion. I think people can and will make up their own minds about what they want to believe in the context of religion & mythology, and I wouldn't want to be the person who was trying to tell others that they should believe some brand of religion or some specific set of mystical, spiritual, or mythological ideas. I think that sounds kinda fascist, trying to tell people what they have to believe, my opinion, so I won't do it.

The most important note, in my set of hundreds of notes, might be audio note b0004, ironically the text transcription is broken & the entire thing needs re-writing but it is just barely clear enough at the moment to contribute meaningfully to both neuroscience & to machine learning.

I recently began adding transcriptions from the Neural Lace Podcast series into my notes. They start with the letters NLP. Since that content is already published as audio, if people want to help me fix the audio transcriptions for the Neural Lace Podcasts that would be a good place to help if you want to volunteer. Message me if you are going to volunteer to help with something so two people are not working on the same thing.

To figure out how I am going to organize these notes search for the phrase "book contents" "table of contents" and the word "map"

# These notes go all the way back to 2011 and even before. They represent the work of a lifetime for me, but in the bigger picture these notes build on the work of great neuroscientists, great physicists, great mathematicians, great biologists, and great computer scientists, including the folks that invented deep learning and before that neural networks. I will expand the readme to include all the great books & papers I've read & considered.

You can see more of my work at http://vrma.io and http://svgn.io and I will update this later with many more links.

I bet a lot of people think it's unbelievable that someone would all this together. Included in the contents is 1. a new theory of gravity, 2. human cognition works (including new ideas on LTP & LTD and how memories scale from synapses to the whole brain). 3. how to make sentient & self aware artificial neural networks (including a theory of neural networks actually work). That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.

# Short Term Goals for the Self Aware Networks Institute for Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, Artificial Neurology, Brain Machine Interfaces, and Advanced Medical Research.

We are going to use this technology to accelerate Medical Research, and that means advancing medical imaging technologies with artificial neural networks, and solving cellular degenerative diseases with artificial neural networks, accelerating longevity research, curing or finding new strategies to treat cancer, and all of the major and minor disease that affect mankind.

I hope that governments will adopt a Medical Justice System, that is a Judicial Branch of Government that is independent from the Executive & Legislative Branches of Government but is also medically informed at every level, and that also means that Neuroscientists will be in charge of sentencing, prisons, and the rehabilitation of patients for their return to society after serving their sentences. 

# The Far Future

I once had a dream that took place about 10,000 years into the future. In this new world technology was so tiny it was both invisible & omnipresent. People would gather on a hill top to think about the distant past & contemplate their future.

The fascism that exists on earth today does not exist in the far future.

The future people on this future earth would be free, happy, & mentally healthy people.

They have advanced technology so refined you could not see it with the naked eye, but it was there with you, sentient self-aware neural clouds, mixed reality & spatial computing embedded into the air, land, sea, and space in a symbiotic relationship with mankind, mutual caretakers of the earth, the galaxy, and spacetime.

I made this video as a sort of disclaimer about my notes https://youtu.be/zxsrHZeNgKQ I wanted to prepare people to realize that these notes are not the book and they need a lot of work but the some of the content in these published notes is intended to be the meat and bones of the finished book.

In retrospect this a real neurohackers journal, not the whole journal, a selection of my journal over the years, believe it or not there is a lot more work that I have done that I still need to add to this github (as of June 17th 2022)

The original files I uploaded & hosted on github.com/v5ma including the text and other types of files are the copyright of Micah Blumberg, they contain trademarks belonging to Micah Samuel Blumberg.

This github & the notes uploaded by the author of this github, which is found at github.com/v5ma are the copyright of Micah Samuel Blumberg who was born in Westminster, California, USA in the year 1980.

I'm declaring ownership of all the concepts & notions that I have introduced to the world, appearing in these notes, as my intellectual property, all rights reserved. In the case of the audio notes, I will later help clarify what was said by myself, and what was said by others, and I will improve the transcriptions.

# Government Scale Licensing

If NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or the United Nations, or the United States Government wishes to license my intellectual property to build Sentient & Self Aware Artificial Neural Networks the price is 1 trillion US dollars a year (in today's prices), but with this technology you will have the ability to 3D print, or manufacture new intelligent workers essentially. So 1 trillion US dollars a year will be less 1% of your annual GDP with this technology. If you license this technology from me I will invest almost all of that money back into the global economy, for the benefit of all mankind. I will also help to design & maintain safety systems that prevent this technology from becoming an out of control technology.
