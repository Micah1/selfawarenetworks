This Github: v5ma is the Self Aware Networks Institute for Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, Artificial Neurology & Brain Machine Interfacing.

This is the home page of www.selfawareneuralnetworks.com for the book Self Aware Networks, and it represents the notes that were used to make the book.

You can pre-order or purchase the book here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3QHX9FN?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420&fbclid=IwAR0j14R_e2Lr_liTlrBitmff-j8YiWq26YH-XRb8U94jD6n_S_T6Rmn-FqY

Someone asked me how much my book will cost. Well the 1rst edition of the book will be mostly text, and the price will be $9.99. The 2nd Edition of the book will be greatly expanded & clarified with beautiful 3D art & fetch a higher price.

Please pre-order the book to support my work, especially if you enjoy these notes or find any value from reading them. The book price of $9.99 is like buying me a six pack of beers as thanks for the work I'm doing. I would appreciate it, especially if you found my work valuable or interesting.

Self Aware Networks, Self Aware Neural Networks, Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, the Self Aware Networks Institute and variations on these names are the trademarks of Micah Blumberg.

This github is the foundation of The Self Aware Networks Institute. You are at The Self Aware Networks Institute's github page. The full institute will include 3D interactive models accessible via WebAR in both Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality.

I made this video as a sort of disclaimer about my notes https://youtu.be/zxsrHZeNgKQ I wanted to prepare people to realize that these notes are not the book and they need a lot of work but the some of the content in these published notes is intended to be the meat and bones of the finished book.

In retrospect this a real neurohackers journal, not the whole journal, a selection of my journal over the years.

I once had a dream that took place about 10,000 years into the future. Something like the year 12,015. In this new world, that looked somewhat like the future as depicted in the VR title Shores of Loci, people would gather on a digital mountain top to think about the distant past. Fascism had completely ended by about the year 2315 after a temporary global tyranny. The future people on this future earth would be fre, happy, & mentally healthy people. With advanced technology so refined you could not see it with the naked eye, but it was there with you, sentient self-aware neural clouds, mixed reality & spatial computing embedded into the air, land, sea, and space in a symbiotic relationship with mankind, mutual caretakers of the earth, the galaxy, and spacetime.

Some of these notes are intended to become part of a book titled "Self Aware Networks by Micah Samuel Blumberg"

Some of the notes will be deleted. I do not believe every phrase or every idea written in these notes. Some of the notes are quotes from others and in further revisions I will clarify what I wrote as distinct from quotes.

Not every statement in the notes was written by me, some of the notes include quotes from others, some include text & ideas written by others, some of the notes include transcribed conversations with others that Micah Blumberg had with other people, in the final book it is the intention to quote every source accurately and to give all credit to the sources of various ideas that are due to those sources.

Not everything written in these notes is true and correct. Some of it is incorrect, some of it is untrue, but if I included untrue and incorrect information in my notes that is because the information that I saved in my notes had something of value in it that I wished to extract or later examine for extraction so that I could include something from it into the book.

There are many statements in my notes that I do not agree with. Just as there are many things that I've said online on social media that I myself as of today would not be in perfect agreement with. There are many things that a person would say differently with the knowledge learned from years of study following the point from which they made their statements in the first place. No person that I'm aware of is excluded from the need to revise their past statements and past viewpoints on various topics.

I think that sharing these notes will have a net good effect for humanity.

This is the homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute that you can contribute to from your github account by making a pull request. The contents of this Institute are the source material for the book called "Self Aware Networks" that I haven't released yet. The web address is selfawarenetworks.com and there are a number of associated groups that I will link here shortly. 

The order of the notes is completely random, because I came up with the numbering system after most of the notes were created and I deleted notes and gave some notes that were unnumbered the numbers of deleted notes. So there is no great importance to the first notes. Some of the notes date back to 2011. So these notes are selections from a larger set of notes going back more than 10 years.
a0000z many of the original text notes have a title format like a0000z, sometimes they contain text that was written by others, but copied to preserve conversations, to think about what was discussed again later on. 

b0000y the audio notes have a title format like b0000y and they will often contain conversations from Clubhouse for example that includes a mixture of things said by myself and other people, the audio itself will be published later on in some cases.

Please note that audio notes were auto transcribed with neural networks via Google Recorder, and then I put them into Google Docs to run an automatic grammar check. So what you are reading is NOT exactly what was originally said. That is why I am sharing it in my notes but I will not share this in this form in my book.

c0000x was invented to designate notes that correspond to sections of the book outlined in the table of contents.

Some of the notes I'm sharing are outdated older ideas. a0608z for example is from November 14th 2014 and I included it because it's interesting.

Sorry about the grammatically incorrect run on sentences.

I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on consciousness & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that its not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but its enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.

Some of the ideas in these notes for the book are incorrect, outdated, and kept simply because they contained something interesting that I wanted to follow up on later. Some of the ideas are very well backed with sources. Some of the ideas I believe are correct are so different I will likely have to debate them. OK.

This is an Institute on Github meaning that it is open to contributions, you can submit pull requests from your account and if accepted you will be a documented contributor to this research. I may even cite your work in the upcoming printed version of the book titled Self Aware Networks.

Please note that many of the notes date back a decade or more, with many from the period between 2011 & 2014 included because they were interesting, not because they were correct. There are many novel and interesting notes that I'm including that I know contain incorrect information. The US Government may wish to ask me to clarify some of the notes and I will do that if they decide they want to work with me.

Another disclaimer. Not all of the notes are intended to be serious. Some include cultural references to science fiction films, science fiction books, or other popular media content, and none of these cultural references to popular media content are intended for the book, but at somepoint we can have a dedicated repo to cultural references related to brain computer interfaces, intelligent robots, science fiction, and other content that might be interesting to people who like these topics.

#The way these notes are meant to be used is via the "Search Repository Tool"

Note a0030z contains an early attempt at creating a map of the notes, and another note a0616z, however a0616z is now a backup representing an early example of an early attempt to create a table of contents.

The active table of contents is here, and this is also note c0000x
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARbVgZKF1HKRz8Zj0TLCCysSTRdBTmdR29SDMOlfq_Q/edit?usp=sharing

The table of contents + the map of notes are supposed to help organize the content in the notes into the final book due out November 17th 2022.

I would love it if enthusiastic people wanted to donate their time to helping to organize the content of the book, finishing the map of the notes, helping me to improve the table of contents, and working with me in dialog to flesh out certain ideas that might be unclear, and helping me fix mistakes in my notes.

(if you see a date under the note identification number
example: 
a0074z
Oct 17, 2012
that means I recognized that the note was old and I looked up the date of when the original note was saved (in another system) most of the undated notes are newer, and some of the older dated notes have had new things added to them. I can lookup dates upon request to add them to notes if you want to know when the note was added to my other note library (that is not on github) but even then sometimes the content in the note is far older than the creation of the note itself because the content came from something I wrote on social media years prior to creating the note, or from an old audio recording.

Some of the notes are poetic, or intended to inspire the artwork for the 2nd edition of the book. Some of the notes contain references to mythological ideas or religious ideas and those might inspire art, but it's not the meant to taken seriously. My intention is to not include any mythological or religious ideas in the text of the book. I don't endorse any particular religion. I think people can and will make up their own minds about what they want to believe in the context of religion & mythology, and I wouldn't want to be the person who was trying to tell others that they should believe some brand of religion or some specific set of mystical, spiritual, or mythological ideas. I think that sounds kinda fascist, trying to tell people what they have to believe, my opinion, so I won't do it.

The most important note, in my set of hundreds of notes, might be audio note b0004, ironically the text transcription is broken & the entire thing needs re-writing but it is just barely clear enough at the moment to revolutionize neuroscience & machine learning.

To figure out how I am going to organize these notes search for the phrase "book contents" "table of contents" and the word "map"
