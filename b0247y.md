(audio) Pattern Neurons Metaphors

Let's just say that a brain state is an electromagnetic configuration of all the things you're focused on. Well, you can press three of what you're focused on. So it's like the electromagnetic configuration of your name is what your attention is focused on. So the the positive negative balance is, we're going to shift to the topics that you're thinking about, and that will happen, that can be measurable.

Tend to explain backwards dendritic. The idea is that the you have clusters of I've nodes, with all of their parameters that are basically creating each creating a representation of part of a pattern. And then the the that other parts of the network and the sequence that are taking smaller pieces of the pattern and knitting them together into larger patterns, and this happens with within the clusters of of a neural circuit and also within the clusters of micro columns, and with the clusters of cortical columns and like the super casematic, nucleus is the.

02:10

An example of the that is a like an oscillation of 20 million neurons, right? That are just there oscillating and a loop. So it's a large group of neurons that are sort of like in my in the same also sitting with the same pattern. And so that idea is that this this a cloud of oscillators basically like what can happen is like they all sort of they all sort of like they're known as all fire sort of like at the same time sort of they fire in a regular oscillation tonically with the neurons that they're in a group with.

02:55

So for this super case magic nucleus all 20 million of these neurons fire and the same sort of temporal cadence, okay. So like, you know, if it's like, there's a rhythm, there's a rhythm happening and every, you know, and every beat, there's a beat happening. There's a beat happening.

03:19

I'm keeping the beat, I'm keeping the beat, I'm keeping it beat, and it's like you have a pace maker. You could have a clock, you have a clock, that's keeping the beat and keeping the beat, I'm keeping the beat, right? And so all the all the neurons are like involved in like, the individual neurons are going to be involved in oscillations, that will group together groups of neurons.

03:43

And so I don't know that this is a fast but I would expect that, it's possible that each micro column is going to have an is going to be identified by an oscillation it's body. And then each quotaful column is going to be identified by an isolation meaning, it's body.

04:08

And that is like all the different textures and parts that make up the the surface area and volume much to the volume, sorry the volume area. All the, the atoms that make up the volume of space. Those are considered part of the body, so it's like a volume. The body is like a volume recognizer so wrecking that.

04:38

So, when I say I recognize an object. The first thing is that, I'm recognizing a volume. That's interesting. Yeah. So it's like if you have, if you could, if you could have a known network represent a point cloud, the next question is, how can the neural network, recognize a volume or an object in that point cloud?

05:02

But how can your mind represent? Recognize a neural network, the the volume. How can your mind? Represent a the volume of your.

05:21

How can your mind say? Okay, so it's right. It's a great idea because I, right. How can your mind represent? The the volume of objects and you have this like concept of volume of like this is, this is the space and which the atoms that are in this space belong to this object.

05:42

That is that I'm going to that I can name like I name this object here. This is a this is a surface I and on a higher level of chunking, it's a red surface in a window of a music store. Okay. And to to and then about. But all those different representations had to be represented somewhere because the because it's like representations if they're not physically located somewhere, if they're not written down somewhere, how can they be tied together if they're not maternally existential existent?

06:30

But here's the thing is all your neurons are firing tonically all the time but you're not you not really living the same day over and over and over again. I mean, it like you might assure, if you're the the character played by actor, Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day, then you're then that character was experiencing the same day over and over again.

06:55

And and that made them want that made the character want to go through a character journey. The character is the original went through this dream, they developed as a as a person by living the same day over and over again where they were just, it's kind of like if you could say, well basically reality and a way is like living the same day over and over again.

07:28

It's like in a very like abstract in a very abstract way because you're separating the, what's happening in the world. You're separating that one hundred percent with how you're affecting the world, right? And so you get this, you can sort of like you can understand that the world is is each with each iteration and set up to do the same thing each time.

08:00

But but each time you go into this world, you can choose to play a different way. And so that's what the character did in the movie where it was the world was like reset and he had to live it again, but then it was like, you know, first like I don't know what's happening, this is crazy.

08:25

You know, how do I get out of this time loop? This is horrible. Then, you know, at some point, just like, trying all this, like, serious suicide attempts for waking up back in the same and the same place on the same day over and over again. And, you know, going to basically the place where he was trying to the best day possible you could have, he was trying to do everything, right?

09:06

And treat everyone, right? And be the nicest person and just because that was the day that he wanted. That's what he wanted to live that, that day where he wanted to, like have a day where he was making everybody happy, and solving all the problems saving everybody's butts and giving a noun and enjoying that.

09:30

And in like getting the most out of that day, by being, by living that life, I living that vibration. And so, but that comes from like, yThat's how you, that's how you begin to change, what these metaphors that you're walking through these temple, and spatial metaphors, and visual metaphors, and audio metaphors. You are changing your, I thought pattern, but you're changing thought, pattern is actually also a changing electromagnetic pattern, like, literally an electromagnetic pattern that is changing.

14:49

And so if you have the new pattern, the new pattern is the regular pattern. The new pattern becomes a regular pattern because you have this focus, this focus and you have

15:10

Sort of commit, you've sort of like decided to make it into a ritual. How you get to this focus? I have this practice. That brings me into this focus. It could be like a meditation, practice a yoga practice. It gets it gets you into the focus. You want to be in, it could be going away from certain environments completely and immersing yourself in brand new environments or you don't have to have brand new environments.

15:42

You could just if you're, if you could just go for a long walk in a new area, or a nice area, an area that's like, so you can get away a little bit from other people and you can begin to Doc things through to your microphone and then listen back to what you shared later on.

16:12

So, you can work through some ideas this way.
