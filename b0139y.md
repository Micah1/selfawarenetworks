TPJ and Pyramid of Giza Dyson Sphere Brain Pyramid

00:00
So what if the diary and the sulky like, okay. So here's my question is, are the pyramidal cells closest to the surface of? This of the skull like is the fit. There are six layer closest to the skull and the thoughts of the is it in the forms of the diary and the sole key.

00:28
Underneath them, right? Yeah. And so that I mean there is yeah. The new cortex is folded in on itself, right? That's remembering so it's like a napkin but if you stretch it out it's like a size of large internet. And but instead it's squeezed in on the south and the shape of it is interesting.

00:55
But it's like yeah. Like the I think the six layer is the one that's closest to the scalp, to the skull, the closest to the skull. And that's the layer where the hair metal cells come out with their 200,000 connections and they and a long internurance that joined together regions of the brain.

01:26
It all happens at the the, the massive connections, and then they'll cortex happen. Close to the servers of the skull. It's almost like,

01:47
Yeah, it's weird. It's like, so, it's like, okay, so think about how that similar to the, the retina that sort of like lines the interior of the, the back of the of the eyeball, right? Because it's like you have basically the sort of webbing that's lining the interior of the skull in the brain, right except this 
folded.

02:18
And so I saw the article about, you know, ancient, the ancient pyramid in Egypt that sort of focuses, electromagnetic energy. And I thought, well, what if the what if there's some sort of mechanism like that inside the human brain?

02:45
What if the smatter since three cortex was like an inward pointing and upside down pyramid that was pointing and towards the temple parietal junction at its peak is the peak of the parietal, cortex and the reciprocal cortex reach pointing towards and and the audio auditory cortex in the temporal cortex role pointing towards the TBJ, like the TPJ was like the top of the parent for each of these pyramids or each of these brain sections.

03:30
And just I'm just respecting like yeah, it is a higher but like maybe the TPJ is a sub hierarchy for this for for the incoming sensory for the primary sensory for the three primer since we're areas and play areas and maybe it continues to be like, yeah maybe it's the inner the brain areas that are in between on the inside serve as sort of like the peaks of the parents where and it and maybe there's some sort of like electromagnetism is

04:22
Somehow focus didn't work by the shape of the skull and concentrated in the center. So they like your magnet energy could be the strongest, the most concentrated in the center of our brain. And that's where the strongest. If that's true. Then that's where the strongest, electromagnetic waves would animate from.

04:55
But then they would be you know downshifted and moduated in all directions but almost in them, almost perhaps reflecting the pyramidal shape, not sure the inverted pyramid will fake where the that'd be like pyramids on a, on the inside of a Dyson. Serial right. So they're all pointed towards the it's like so Dyson.

05:23
Spares like if you could build something around the sun that was designed to maximally harness solar energy. So if you build something that's like the distance of earth away from the sun but it went all the way around the entire sun so that you could be at about earth distance, Oregon Sun but there'd be this massive that's the fear really basically be like the sun is inside Dyson sphere, right?

06:07
So the destroyers artificial platform and the sun is inside of it and the super so big that you're the distance of the that if the sun. When the sun is perfectly in the center of the Dyson sphere that the distance each to to the nearest wall of the Dyson sphere, while the serial self is the same distance between the center earth.

06:30
So in that sense, like you, perhaps somehow, I guess you could have, it could have an atmosphere and that could be life going on it. And and in beginning sunlight 24/7. So, it would be different. But you could definitely with solar could definitely be like the cheap source of whoever

07:08
And wondering how how plants and people will be different and we had 24/7. Some like if the sun if you're just facing this at all the time, That's great.
