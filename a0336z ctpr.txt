Emotions & Qualia & ATP rewards
my idea is that like particles and like brainwaves, emotions inside the brain are something neurons as a group detect as large scale phase patterns in certain frequency ranges 

the patterns in your brain are distinct to you because of their sequence order in time, their phase rate, and their spatial configuration over time. So every pattern from emotion, feeling, thought, touch, sound, vision, taste, smell is a pattern that is encoded in phase differentials inside spatial patterns over time with mechanical wave force, and the electromagnetic force is helping to bi336nd memories, stimulate ATP release to reinforce memories, connect neurons that fired close together (spatially or temporally), grow new connections via dendritic spines, and dissolve connections 

I think about the hippocampus acronym for memory  encoding & retrieval 

Separate Phases at Encoding And Retrieval (SPEAR)

so the emotion of fear might be a large scale frequency pattern in the hippocampus-entorhinal-thalamic loop that is fast or slow, large or small
with temporal-spatial characteristics

the VR headset in your brain, the places cells in the hippocampus might represent the orientation & position of your head in any space, the space might be represented by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, and so I am imagining that the front seat of consciousness is accomplished somewhere in the trinity of the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the entorhinal cortex, with the neo cortex serving as utility to extend the resolution of your mental experience, so you have higher definition sound, visuals, language, the ball sack (under the occipital lobes), the cerebellum, with its excitatory neurons associated with balance, speech control, motor control, and ataxia, is perhaps good for maintaining high definition rhythm, and what I am suggesting is that these larger brain areas are giving us a higher resolution, or higher bit rate of cognitive function, or a higher def reality than animals with smaller brains, so we experience everything with much greater clarity, and we are less confused by noise and more likely to deduce essential and critical distinctions in extremely complex patterns.

It's interesting that a tiny insect can manage high speed flight, I've seen pigeons plot amazing flight trajectories that involve predicting the direction and velocity of the vehicles around it, such as the speed and direction of myself on a bicycle, other birds, and other vehicles. Bird flight in a big city is beyond self driving car technology, the bird needs a prediction-model of everything in its environment, the orientation, velocity, and mass of every object around it, and a prediction model of itself, its own orientation, velocity, and mass, so that it can correctly predict a successful flight path.
