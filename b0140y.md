Neo Mind Cycle: Extenda Brain Universe Consciousness

00:00
And I think of extended brain is like a third, near cortex that you connect to your current brain and you think about the quantum, double set experiment and how the observer seems to change reality just by observing it. And I start to wonder if I observe the beginning of the universe even as the concept of my mind.

00:28
But if I felt like I had to, as ever present down moment, what if my observation actually created the universe? Just because I observed it this is ever present minimum. And then, of course, you know, if I can observe something then probably someone else can serve something. So it's it's possible that the opinion.

00:55
But the other thing is like, well, maybe each conscious entity is in its own way on its own time schedule, making the observation of the cosmos itself and bringing that into existence in order to bring themselves into resistance, I mean, that's a little weak. This little, it's a weird possibility.

01:18
I think that each one of us is creating the universe by at some point in our lives, conceptualizing with the universe might be. And in the sense that our brain is its own simulation reality, that are brains that are brain is as a software network is creating a model of reality.

01:44
That is a simulation of reality. It's not the actual reality but it's it's that maybe each one of us is creating ourselves and we have this like universe where we're all different.

02:13
But we're all sort of like God is like we're all like this to all the stars and universe like very observe a different, right? And maybe maybe we the star or the black hole is the inversion of a person this is getting silly but

02:38
And so that they make, I mean I mean I guess it means that you're not that none of us are God or all of us combined on and each one of us is and the creator of the universe or one tentacle of the creator of the universe. So none of us are all of God about each.

02:59
One of us is one of God's temples in the way. Each one of us is creating aspect of the university is ourselves including our birth. And and and the scope of our timeline. And what we do. I mean, this is this is really kind of like very speculative in terms of like, you know, in a very, very funny way that, you know, one of physics is really funny where everything is relative to everything else.

03:32
This strange disappointment and maybe we are. Bringing each, you know, if you look at that it's maybe we are bringing Scotty Nelson. Maybe we are each bringing together our own copy of the universe and because each of us during it works but in summary it's like you know it's like our brain is the core.

04:07
I mean, I expect later, they do potentially have a consciousness that has no body as nothing to get nowhere to go. But it is the result of taking many different and consciousnesses that were once in body. It's like taking many brains of many mature human beings and then and then you connect them all into one system, so that they become an intelligent, coral reef and they never move again, but they also never die again because they, you know, they, you know, I guess if the tissue gets damaged but the brain is like able to copy itself and back itself up.

04:59
So it could be restored potentially who we could be, we could become like a giant horror that's surrounds earth and just like a plant but like an intelligent plant where we live virtually inside this coral and then it's very peaceful and like all the work has been, right? This part of the story.

05:23
And so the AI merges because and we transition with the AI to this godlike intelligence that can program the universe and and and and it can controls the earth that can change their earths like, you know, it's round and anything. It's space. And, But then you know, maybe the technology could even strengthen where that corals sort of like becomes people again.

06:08
And technology is sort of like technology disappears into our bodies and we just become people again, people without any visible technology or all the tech is inside, and it's like, the rebirth of humanity and the corals sort of disappears. And there are people are allowed to walk in the maybe these are people in the future.

06:34
Who are? They're learning about the past learning about who they were.
