# SciSummary (CHATGPT) & EDITED by Micah
The scientific article discusses the idea of atoms & particles combining to form hidden structures with oscillating patterns. The author hypothesizes that these oscillations create beams or lanes in spacetime, which in turn extend the gravitational effects of a mass out into space in a predictable way that more intuitively explains the rate of the dissipation of the gravitational effect & time dilation.

The article explores how the concentration of vertical movement in atoms & particles caused by the curvature of spacetime results in the formation of gravitational lanes or beams. The author also discusses how gravitational forces and attractive forces play a role in the movement of particles within these oscillatory patterns.

The article delves into the concept of time expansion and how it is related to the number of possible paths a particle can travel in.

The author suggests that the curvature of space is defined by the expansion of time, in spacetime, in a given area of space, which from a particle or atom's perspective causes a gravitational effect.

The article also touches on the idea of oscillators synchronizing and desynchronizing, and how this can impact the overall oscillatory pattern.

The author suggests that there is a magnification effect similar to a photocopier when it comes to the influence of neurons firing and affecting other neurons.

The article explores the relationship between bad points and oscillatory patterns as they might relate to gravity and or to neuroscience.

The article concludes with discussions on AI processing and its potential applications, including voice recognition and image rendering in virtual reality.

The author highlights the importance of neural rendering and the potential impact of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in improving AI capabilities in devices.

The article ends with the author expressing excitement for advancements in AI-driven features in devices such as phones and VR headsets.

# For reference:
Consider the interesting patterns that light formulates while moving through sugar water. This is helpful to imagine how the flow of particles such as light, can exert forces on other particles, creating structures in space at the quantum scale that may be seen or may be unseen.

Also for reference Visualizations of Earth's Electromagnetic Field, the lines of which illustrate paths that particles might travel close to the earth. B0102y explores the idea that Gravity, a distortion of time, is also creating paths for the flow of particles, but this idea is not as much about the spatial location of lines so much as it is about the temporal lines or lanes that affect the properties of particles waves, such as their frequency, and their magnitude or wave shape. The effect of gravity from mass at the particle scale (and at all scales) is measurable in terms of time dilation, and the gravitational force, the idea of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation lanes extending above the earth into the atmosphere and beyond is consistent predicts that time dilation at any given point in space fluctuates, gravity lanes shift & move with turbulent flow of particles, so the rate of time dilation or frames of time will fluctuate with the movement of gravity lanes.

The Lithospheric magnetic field visualization is interesting because the way the earth’s surface is divided into positive & negative charges is illustrative of how I visualize the areas separating gravitational lanes at the surface of the earth. Imagine that the positive areas represent the vertical lanes, and that the negative areas represent the horizontal lanes, but the further you move away from the surface of the earth the more space is dominated by horizontal lanes, and the closer you get to the center of the earth the more space is dominated by vertical lanes. The lanes then change the odds of particle movement in each area of the volume of space inside and or near the earth, such that you end up with a perpetually extreme concentration of particles at the center of the earth, and a continually dissipative concentration of particles at the edges of earth’s atmosphere. Note that the lanes only change the odds of the direction of particle movement with each interval of spacetime, because the vertical (positive) lanes in spacetime represent accelerated frames of space they have an attractive gravitational effect on all other particles in space that becomes more concentrated the closer a particle is to the center of mass (because the concentration of vertical lanes is increased in the center, and decreased linearly furthest from the center of mass) as such gravitational lanes will without a doubt influence the location & directional development of electromagnetic fields while continuing to be a separately identifiable & measurable phenomenon.

Let’s go further and speculate that a positive charge has a greater window of time relative to a negative charge? This would mean that for an electron to stay as part of an atom with a positive nucleus it would have to skip frames of time. Let me rephrase that, imagine that the proton, positively charged, has an area in time that is four times larger than the electrons area in time. This means that for every four frames of time, the electron only has enough time area to exist in 1 of the 4 frames of time. Therefore, it is not always present, and cannot always be present, it skips through time, because it has enough charge to be present ¼ of the time, in this example.

Taking this idea further imagine that when any particle is in super position, it is outside time, because relatively speaking the amount of area in time that it has is less than that which is measuring time, but when the measurement of the particle happens it is gaining mass, or bringing its charge, position, and momentum into that frame of time for when it is being measured, thus it changes it’s interference pattern because it’s gravity changes, it becomes more positive or it becomes heavier in time relative to it’s state while in superposition.


This ties into the strong nuclear force, because the greater time area created by the wake of the  positive proton is going to increase the odds that neutral or negative particles move towards it. The proton has a mass that can attract the neutron and the electron by creating a wake in it’s path that is the area in time that essentially the neutron & the electron become more likely to fall into.

Positive & Positive charges are being pushed apart in space, in part because the space around their combined charge is increasing too rapidly in time area,

Same thing with the negative negative combination, the amount of energy it takes to combine electrons, or negative sides of a magnet is great because their combined energy is accelerating frames of time or increasing the area of space around the combined charge which creates the repulsive interaction or repulsive force.

Whereas the combination of positive charges & negative charges has a strong magnetic pull that unites positive & negative because the area of time displacement, or time area, or the quantity of time frames around the positive/negative pair is reduced relative to the increased amount of time frames at the center of the new mass, it's like a magnetic lego brick made of waves, since the waves alternate frequency, one is positive and one is negative, they can combine without exporting their time area.

One interesting consequence of QGTCD, my unique & novel unified field theory, is that the Higgs Field isn’t required to give particles their mass. In fact the universe functions just fine without a Higgs Field in my theory.

After I had this idea about the atom being a, about atoms combining to form like a ball or a planet and then that planet having like a beam forming oscillation.
Like if the entire, like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic so that it vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating patterns in the phase field that are, it's going to, that's going to disrupt how many horizontal patterns are available.
And that sort of beam forming property, so I'm saying oscillations form beams because attract, the power bands converge, right? Like you have a bunch of, if you have oscillatory activity emerging from the same place, they're going to converge together.
And so you have space squeezing together when you have oscillations increasing around around vortices around atoms and molecules so the space so space-time is squeezing only because squeezing together or because the in terms of like the number of different waves that a particle can travel, there's an increase in vertical travel, but waves also oscillate, so like if the particle travels a plane consistent and then that knocks another particle and then that travel and that particle travels and so and so on but anyway that that's like what I called like a lane is that in in the Bose-Einstein condensate that is a beam as a beam.
So that's that so I just hypothesized there could be a lane from the concentration of vertical firing, oscillatory vertical firing.
Actually it doesn't matter if it's oscillatory like there could just be like a concentration of vertical firing that just that flows down horizontal firing and so because it takes longer for um because it's less because it's less likely that a neuron is going to travel then that um that something is going to travel horizontally than it is going to travel vertically right because it's like it's like there there's more to going vertical the closer you are to that atom, the more stuff is like by chance going to go vertical than horizontal.
And so basically like, well, actually, so I'm not sure if that works because it means that the closer you are to the atom, the more likely it is that you're going to get sucked into a vertical lane or attracted to the atom and bond with it.
If you can't go any closer.
All right, so it's like a gravitational force would be like an attractive force.
It's just like the odds of Moving towards the atom or towards the oscillator are going to increase the closer you are to it So you might be bonded to the critical, but that So in that case there are actually fewer horizontal lines for the travel, so stuff that's traveling horizontally might travel a lot faster, relatively speaking.
And if you get stretched out from that oscillator, then the beams are going to be spread out.
They're going to disperse, like sunbeams.
They're going to disperse.
And so that means that there's a lot more potential, but relatively speaking, there's a lot more potential for horizontal travel.
So horizontal travel is going to have to.
.
.
horizontal travel is fanned out because relatively speaking, the horizontal is would be expanding between the beams that are shot out by the between the vertical beams and so the the distance that a particle would have to travel horizontally is increased relative to distance the particle has to travel horizontally if it's closer to an oscillator like an array.
So if a particle has to travel a greater distance because the beam is relatively of space that makes travel, makes particles travel shorter distances to orbit.
So if there's a shorter distance for a particle to orbit, then time, then the amount of time or the interval of time is shorter.
And if a particle has to travel a longer distance, which is a higher orbit, then the interval of time is longer, right? Because it has to travel more horizontally.
There's less vertical, there's less chance that something is going to travel vertically the farther away it is from the center of an oscillation.
So that sort of explains why relatively speaking there's more space.
It doesn't explain why space is created actually.
So I have to rethink that.
I guess, no, no, no, so I guess I'm not arguing that space is created by the oscillator because that actually doesn't make sense.
I'm arguing that the curvature of space is defined by the oscillator which gives, so that would give you the relative distinction of space.
So space would be relatively slower away from the oscillator, the center of the oscillator, and it would be relatively slower.
And so space would appear to be expanding in a sense because the amount of time, the amount of time between intervals is relatively greater than the amount of, than the amount of time, at the, at the horizontal movement between oscillators.
than the amount of time, the horizontal movement between oscillators is going to be relatively greater than the horizontal movement close to the oscillator.
Far from the oscillator, it's like time slows down.
You know, the interval, the time interval between points of space, right? For a particle to have one point of space for another.
And maybe the particle represents sort of like an interval in time.
Right? And it's defined by where it lands even if it's even if where it's going even if it's like Ah, it's complicated Well, yeah, so but like for space away from atoms is just going to expand and it's going to expand in a sense because, I don't know, maybe in a sense there's like a sort of like inverse pressure from the vertical waves.
That's sort of like, I'm trying to imagine how I have to revisit.
.
.
taste signals with sensor arrays, just with higher fidelity than a human being can.
It can simulate physics to process those signals in exactly the way a human being would.
Sorry, not in exactly the way, but to produce the exact same signal results it's Functional isomorphism, so like if you imagine with Imagine like with category theory let's draw a straw map Okay, so we're going to have My draw map and it's going to it's going to use the note flow about.
I'm going to use the note flow and I'm going to draw like A, which is the signal So, it's like the array could be your retina, your hand, your tongue, ear.
So, signal capture, so we have A.
And then let's make this smaller.
Here we go.
So then we also have like, um, uh, or, or microphone, camera, Camera, other sensor device, other sensor, sensory arrays, other artificial sensor arrays.
initial tensor arrays.
Right? And then we have A.
Okay, and then so A goes to, just draw an arrow.
Draw an arrow to B.
A to B.
And then we're going to point an arrow from A down to C.
Okay, and then we're going to point an arrow from A down to C.
And then we're going to draw, sorry, A down to C.
Let me highlight this.
OK.
Delete.
Let's draw a C this time.
So OK, so you have the letter A, and it has two arrows.
And one points to the A's right, and that points to B.
And the other goes from A, and that points to B.
And the other goes from A and it goes down, points down to C.
Now C is going to point to the right, to D, and B is going to point down to D.
So you see, the point that I'm trying to make is, so A is the sensor array or artificial array.
And this is going to, so B is going to, so the morphism between A and B, Let's call this real physics.
And then we will call C a four-dimensional.
C is 4 dimensional.
.
.
C is.
.
.
It's kind of funny.
C is 4 dimensional.
.
.
It's funny because I'm putting the letters C4D together and that references a 3D program, but it's not intentional.
So C4D signal processing And B is B is also 40 signal processing.
Okay, so then we See the transformation between B and D is.
.
.
Pattern Scaling.
And
.
.
With.
.
.
With rendered.
.
.
Rendered Inner Mappings.
with rendered inner mappings.
And then we have motor outputs.
Motor or signal outputs.
Motor signal outputs.
And then over here we have pattern scaling with rendered inner mappings so these are functionally isomorphic functionally isomorphic functionally isomorphic processes.
So, let's pause it.
So, when an oscillator kicks other oscillators, some of them become synchronized and some of them become desynchronized.
And, so, your intuitive sense of what's going to happen is just not going to lead you to the right answer.
You're just seeing chaos.
It's like, it's hard to imagine what's going to happen because some stuff is slowing down and some stuff is speeding up.
And I guess it's kind of like what's happening in the atmosphere right now.
Some parts of the earth are getting colder and some at times and some are getting hotter and it's confusing to people and they don't like we have all these increasingly chaotic climate events and it looks like the climate is desynchronized uh desynchronizing further so we have more extreme heat and more extreme cold, and it kind of looks like there's a desynchronization process happening in the climate, in terms of extreme weather events.
But it is, it might be, the thing is like, there could be something counterintuitive happening in that these different systems are oscillating systems in the weather, and eventually the wild divergences and weather events will slow down and the weather will become oscillating together.
That is provided that the sources of new energy to the atmosphere stopped, otherwise the perturbations, the tribulations might continue indefinitely.
You'd have to actually stop introducing new energy to the atmosphere to explore it to eventually settle towards an equilibrium.
But simply adding in new energy to the oscillators in Earth's climate is going to cause lots of cascading energy transformations on all the different weather systems that really are driven by the influx of new energy.
So we can say, I mean I guess the argument is that it is about methane and carbon dioxide, but more generally speaking those are, maybe you could consider those as the carriers of new energy into the climate ecosystem.
So it's a.
.
.
think of them as spikes in an oscillating system.
Which is kind of interesting, because it's kind of like, well, by removing energy from the atmosphere, regardless of whether it's carbon or methane or, I mean, it might be that those are the only two options, but I mean, maybe there's a third option for something that could be removed from the atmosphere that would cause the atmosphere to calm down.
We wouldn't have high extremes and temperature extremes.
So imagine another way.
So imagine like the weather just weighs more and therefore it bounces harder between streams.
And I'm imagining like it's too much out there.
But like, yeah, but like if we could change the oscillations in the atmosphere.
I mean, it seems like maybe we can argue that the oscillations are being set by the molecules and chemicals and gasses of the gasses, of the methane gas and the carbon gas.
That is creating sort of a heaviness in the air or an oscillatory power.
It's like you're releasing many cyclones with every gas that gets released, because it consists of, first of all, atoms, right? Atoms that are spinning in a way that causes increased collisions, I'm just trying to imagine, aside from capturing carbon and aside from capturing methane, let's say that all the human beings died and the planet's atmosphere moved towards equilibrium, even if that ultimate equilibrium isn't plausible.
Let's say it moved towards equilibrium, so, yeah, all the fish in the sea are going to get wiped out from the heat.
And the plants, and the land will burn so the plants can't, can't even grow.
So what I'm trying to understand is, as I'm going back to the book sink, and I'm trying to understand, did he say that the doss letter was like a photocopier or like a magnifier? Because I think that's what I thought he said, and it's like the principle to how either a photocopier works or how image scaling works and I'm now like, well, wait a second.
I'm not sure that that's what he said and I'm like, oh, wait a second.
Well, how could you scale then you know, like What exactly? Um Like if my like if the basis of my idea Isn't here in this book, then why does it work? And what is the basis of my idea then if it's not this? How could it be a misunderstanding and still work? So I'm rereading chapter two and chapter three to see if I can figure out what the real story was.
What was the real story? Like the patterns in the game of life that grow over time oscillators like they absorb other oscillators as the many oscillators absorb other oscillators until in that when they like This it's a it's a characteristic description when they like this it's a it's a characteristic description or viewpoint on what happens when two oscillators become synchronized it sort of like looks like they become one it looks like they merge they've merged together and so like you can imagine like you know, when patterns clump together in the game of life, or appear to clump together, that is sort of like a growing configuration that eventually stuff becomes really, in the game of life, eventually stuff becomes really clumped together.
Well, I mean, I should say that there's a lot of different possible outcomes in the game of life, but seeing clumps emerge all over the place is pretty typical, I guess.
So in the book, Sank, How Order Emerges from Chaos, what he says is if you.
.
.
He says that basically.
.
.
so a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point, the whole system doesn't reach oscillation, right? But he's saying the bad points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle, that bad point moves to, moves from one oscillator to another and no absorption happens in that one point.
and no absorption happens in that one point.
And so in effect, basically that point has to be ignored from the actual process of.
.
.
It's like the actual set of points that are absorbable can't include that, so the actual set excludes.
.
.
so let's say that you had three neurons, right? Let's say it's three plus one bad point, right? So the bad point moves around.
So there's four neurons and or there's four oscillators, okay? Four oscillators and they're each kicking the other oscillators in turn.
And the bad point is like a box that moves that never gets absorbed.
Whereas the other three neurons in one interval of time have good points, and when they kick the other neurons that don't have bad points, the point is being absorbed.
And so the argument then is like, well, basically you have a smaller area now for the oscillator.
So the bad point is removed from from the area so the fourth neuron is which is not which is which is you know sometimes it contains a good point sometimes it contains a bad point but it's like there are three good points and so the area of the oscillatory pattern is three good points and the fourth point the bad point point, that's just ignored.
I guess that implies that the three good points will reach equilibrium with the bad point if there's just one of them, I guess.
I don't know but like I am a little bit confused by that but like yeah so like you know it's weird because in the example of of a like a is always fixed zero so that is kind of like a bad starting point sort of right zero voltage but the others, but it doesn't affect the rest of the oscillator from eventually coming into equilibrium, but it's weird to say, okay, now, well, wait a second, what if you have two bad points, so that are, you know, permanently, like, in bad, like in bad, in polar oscillations that don't get absorbed, right? It's weird because you're kind of, there is kind of an argument that if an oscillator has a bad point and energy cannot be absorbed by that oscillator for that interval, then in each interval it transfers on and it maintains the same amount of energy as if it wasn't there.
So what is there in terms of.
.
.
What is there?
.
.
it's like you have an area that is only represented by the good points or the phase changes.
Phase changing areas.
And so the phase changing area is a subset of the larger possible set.
If the whole set of possible areas for points was filled with good points, then you'd have an area of four points.
And if there's a bad point in there, then you have an area of three points.
And the bad point can't take up any of the area of the synchronized oscillators for those three points.
And I guess, in theory theory the other three points could eventually match the oscillation of the theoretical bad point, I guess.
That's the part I'm a little bit confused about, but what surprised me is now that the, you know, he's, okay, so what I want to understand is how the, that the, you know, he's, okay, so what I want to understand is how the, um, how having a smaller set, a smaller area is actually like the enlarged function of the photocopier.
That's what I want to understand.
So he's saying that the transfer, the operation from before to after, works like the enlarged function of a photocopier.
The idea is that, um.
.
.
I don't understand why he's saying that all sets get expanded in area, but it's like, it's like, um.
.
.
Okay, so the argument is that if you have a terrible point that leads to an oscillation not reaching equilibrium, then what happens is somehow the oscillation by itself is like the enlarged function, where every point in the oscillator becomes larger so I have to understand this but that would mean that the bad point becomes larger and that its area becomes larger and that is seems like a paradox but the so so the argument is that the inhibit and hit inhibited set is like photocopier because it is Enlarging the effect of a single neuron to several neurons simultaneously That would be like taking a positive pixel positive light pixel and capturing its negative light as a difference.
So while the neuron is faster, the oscillating set becomes slower.
But therefore it becomes distinct from the rest of the oscillator.
So it becomes a distinct pattern. It becomes distinct from the rest of the oscillator.
So it becomes a distinct pattern that the rest of the oscillator encounters.
But it's a magnified pattern.
So you start off with a small pattern, and that one pattern, which is the single neuron firing, and then it becomes a larger pattern because a single neuron causes a set of neurons to become inhibited, or for one signal to be sort of like passing a charge to a lot of others, and then for some of the others that it passes to to fire randomly, the ones that fire together, I'm sorry, the ones that were inhibited together, are there, well, they're desynchronized from the ones that didn't, that didn't, were inhibited together are.
.
.
Well they're desynchronized from the ones that didn't inhibit together, I guess.
Their time has been.
.
.
But the other interesting thing is now, maybe, the neurons in that set that were inhibited together are going to basically find out that the next time they fire, they're in sync with, they're in temporal sync with new neurons.
So their temporal sync has been shifted from being connected to some neurons to now being connected to other neurons.
But in any case, I'm suggesting that there's a magnifying effect similar to the enlarging effect of a photocopier.
I mean, I think that the other foot to drop is that we do see fractal patterns at small scales becoming fractal patterns at large scales.
And so I think that there has to be a process for which small scale patterns can become large scale patterns, but also how large scale patterns can also become-scale patterns, but also how large-scale patterns can also become small-scale patterns again.
So it has to be a reverse process also, I think.
Or.
.
.
So it's like, why isn't the StyleGAN used to render each frame of a VR perspective? Given the head position and orientation, StyleGAN rendered the next frame.
That's what I would like to do.
.
.
At some point you could just talk to GP3 and program it to do VR.
So it predicts the camera angle and radius and what the camera would see from that angle of perspective and renders that to the display, which gives you a sort of liquid VR experience.
But imagine that we put this in a robot's head.
So the robot is moving around, and it's basically where its eyes are.
It's a combination.
It's the same process to be occurring for the robot and human being on some level, in terms that, or sorry, the robot and the VR headset on some level, in that, or sorry, the robot and the VR headset in some level, in that the VR headset and the robot are both going to basically be using StyleGAN to combine, it's really, it's not just the head position and the orientation, but it's also the incoming bits from the head position orientation.
So your expectation of what you would see when you turn to the right, your micro-expectations in your visual cortex, that's going to help, should help in the rendering process for combining your vision with your head movement, with your head orientation, and your head's position, so that you're, so that you, all three of these things are helping your brain to complete the picture to your right or to your left, when you look over to your left, of what you're seeing.
And, you know, so I asked John Carmack, why isn't the StyleGAN being used to render each frame of a VR perspective, given the head position orientation? StyleGAN rendered the next frame.
So John Carmack responded on Twitter.
He said, there is an emerging field of neural rendering, but it is very resource intensive and it's not close to being commercially deployed.
And that's a great response.
I think about the fact that there's a huge jump in terms of how much AI processing can be done on an edge device.
A lot of the AI processing that you see with the StyleGAN demos, these are done on massive multi-GPU systems in some instances.
Or in some of them on, you know, at least like a GPU that's like, you know, like an RTX 2080 or 3090, at least one really powerful GPU.
That's a lot more than what you're more than what's in your phone essentially.
But you can see there's a huge leap in, if you look at the Pixel 5 versus the Pixel 6, there is a huge leap in the TPU processing core being added to that phone.
It's going to have much better voice recognition, much more accurate voice recognition.
The AI can be used for.
.
.
There was this, in 2020, NVIDIA released an article about how they had.
.
.
They released the technology, basically, the deep learning basically, the deep learning with GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks, the story was they can reduce the bandwidth required for sending video.
And that includes sending video to a VR headset, basically sending a frame to a VR headset, and that the bandwidth required is reduced by 90% because you can send a lower resolution video and then essentially upscale it with a neural network when it's received.
And so the trend in phones is, yeah, Google's like, yeah, let's put a TPU inside the phone, and that's going to help with voice recognition.
And when we all have these Tensor Core processing units or TPUs in our VR headsets or VR classes, we're going to have next generation AR performance.
So yes, that improves voice recognition.
But it also improves hand tracking.
It improves position tracking.
It improves 3D semantic segmentation so that the device can recognize, oh, this is a table, this is a chair, and then it can transform the chair so that it has a different pattern now.
But the same dimensions.
So you can skin your chair while you're looking at it, and it's a different chair.
But it still has the same dimensions, so you can still interact with it the same way.
It just looks, you know, its textures look different, textures and materials.
And, you know, and this is also going to bump up the video resolution of what's on the device, I guess, similar to how, what is it called, you know, like super scaling you know, like super scaling or denoising or real-time ray tracing, those processes are all similar in the sense that a neural network is basically trained on high resolution images so that when you feed it low resolution images it can remove the noise or improve the image fidelity.
It can upscale a low noisy resolution to a higher res denoise image.
denoise image.
You may not get it.
.
.
it's not that you're going to get more details, I think, it's that you might get some clarity.
You might get some.
.
.
it's like.
.
.
I mean, I guess it's similar to the enlarge function on a photocopier, right? But it sort of cleans up the noise around the, you know, around the.
.
.
It's sort of like the AI can infer some details that can improve, you know, between things like interpolation.
It's like, yeah, if you like, if you made everything, if you made every pixel bigger in the array, but then you interpolated what is, or you made every pixel bigger, but then you made every pixel smaller and you interpolated the likely connections between different pixels.
Like if you could classify the image and interpolate what must be there, if you could fill that in just a little bit, then perhaps, perhaps, you could produce an image of higher quality.
But it's sort of doing that by inferring things that were not there in the original image.
So that's a bit tricky.
But that's like, if you saw a tail and you saw a cat, but there was a pole in front of the tail of the cat, well, you might infer that the tail belongs to that cat and the machine, AI, might be able to teach it to also infer that the tail belongs to a cat.
But there is, at the very least, the remote chance that that tail belongs to another cat and there's some sort of optical illusion happening.
So sometimes inferences can be wrong.
And so if an image is designed in such a way that it could mislead a human being about the truth of events in that space, it could also mislead a computer about the truth of events in that space.
It could also mislead a computer about the truth of events in that space.
So, you know, a computer might fall to optical illusions, basically.
However, you know, it's like, that is sort of like the point of, or it's like the value of moving around the object and seeing it from different angles.
Because in essence, by having more angles on what's on the object that's being observed, there's sort of like tomographic construction of a model that is robust enough to resist, you know, the model being, the model, you know, like over, like overfitting when you're trying to take a neural network that doesn't have the sort of capacity to understand the complexity of the model that it's perceiving, and so it starts forming bad conclusions about what's there.
Anyway, so there's overfitting, but ideally, idea but ideally like you know there's so then you know there's this gradient descent which you know maybe can help um sort of fix the overfitting problem if we could somehow um you know correct if it but but i think that you know when you're when you're dealing with 3d and when you have a neural network that has sufficiently high fidelity in terms of each node being able to have the ability to correct itself.
You know, when a neuron fires to its adjacent, to its exit terminal, the exit terminal set, it inhibits a set of its exit terminal set.
So, in some cases it's inhibiting a set, in some cases it's exciting other neurons, in some cases it's adding charge, and in some cases it's opening more potassium receptors which don't inhibit the following cell but have the effect of changing the action potential shape of another cell so that the gate of the action potential opens more slowly.
So basically, the firing of one cell is changing the phase states of a large group of cells simultaneously.
In terms of exciting, there's a set of cells that get excited to go past the threshold and they fire, and there's a set of cells that just get a bump towards reaching their threshold.
There's a set of cells that basically they lose a bump because.
.
.
I mean, sorry, it's not that they lose a bump, it's that they.
.
.
because, I mean, sorry, it's not that they lose a bump, it's that they, they're, so they're, like, if you open the calcium channels, I mean, sorry, if you open the sodium channels much faster than the potassium channels, so like there's more, so if more calcium channels open and very few potassium channels are open at the same time, then that means the rate of potassium filling the sac, because it's the potassium that repolarizes the body of the neuron after the sodium depolarizes the body of the neuron by causing a separation of charges.
So if fewer potassium channels are opened, then that means that the action potential event is going to take longer to close, so the duration of it is going to be longer.
And that will affect how many vesicles get released.
So a longer duration or a longer duration, so I'm still trying to figure out if a longer duration of the action potential means a phasic burst.
I think it does.
Like a longer duration of the action potential represents a high frequency phasic burst.
like a longer duration of the action potential represents a high frequency phase-effort.
I think.
I mean at least it implies that the calcium channels opened up a lot faster than the potassium channels because more were opened more more sodium channels got opened and fewer potassium channels so there's that yeah it's hard to yeah my mind around the map there but so but but you know I guess we're gonna see the tensor processing unit which which is different from the graphics processing unit because it just sort of like the tensor processing unit, which is different from the graphics processing unit because it just sort of like the tensor processing unit focuses on matrix multiplications, which is if you're trying, if you're trying, like if each node's output is a vector in a deep learning, it's a vector in tensor space when you're doing deep learning, then it would help to have a tensor processing unit that's just focused on processing vectors.
And vectors are, you know, processing vectors is processing matrices, right? So if you just focus on, you know, the entire GPU, TPU thing to specialize in doing matrix math and multiplying matrices, then you are at the point where you can do deep learning really faster.
So I think that the logical trajectory is that all of our home devices from our phones to our AR glasses or VR headsets to our tablets and our computers, they're going to have much more powerful TPUs in them in the future because of the advantages for improving all of these technology experiences.
I am using Google.
.
.
I'm going to get a Pixel 6 right away because I make a lot of use out of Google Recorder, which is only on the Pixel 5.
And unfortunately, the accuracy isn't that great.
I mean, compared to what I believe it could be.
I mean, there are times when I'm like looking at the real-time transcript of myself, you know myself speaking out loud.
And I'm like, I, you know, it struggles with, you know, when I'm talking about neurophysics, neuroscience, I'm talking about, you know, really biological concepts, dendrites, synapses.
Right now it seems to be doing really well.
I like watching it.
Let's see, calmodulin.
So then it's spelled calmodulin like calmodular.
Let's see, calcium, potassium, sodium, okay, so, but in any case, it seems to be doing well today.
I feel like it's been getting better over time, and maybe it has been, like I've been learning my voice.
But it would be nice to experience an even more perfected version.
And I wonder if, even if I play back some of the earlier conversations in which like oh yeah it's like this is obviously messing up the voice tracking voice tracking is obviously messing up and and it's guessing that i'm saying things that are different from what i'm actually saying and to like see it get it right the second time around by playing back the old recordings would would just be really interesting.
I would love to see that.
So I really am excited about the Pixel 6.
For that reason, having a much more powerful on-device AI is going to really open up what phones are capable of.
So the so, like, yeah, so like the idea that, you know, your Oculus Quest is basically going to have, like, really powerful TPU, and maybe your Oculus Quest 3, your Oculus Quest 4, I don't know, but it's going to be, like, at some point, you're going to, you know, there's already, um, in the, the chip set that's in it right now is already designed to be really good at doing AI.
It has a specialized chip in there already for that.
But we'd love to see advances.
I'd love to see next generation chips that can do a lot more.
Give us a lot more precision across multiple AI driven features.
You know, the hand tracking.
