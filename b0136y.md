Fractal Water Canvas Dipoles Neurons Brain

00:02

So with the soccer's book, read the most of the brain and 2006. He talks about the fractal nature of EeG readings and multiple scales. Whether you're measuring whether you're measuring electrical fields that are they represent a few hundred neurons in depth in the cortex or your measuring millions of neurons.

00:31

Recorded by scalp electrodes with the EG. The the power spectra is essentially identical and there's a sort of scale invariance or self-similarity self-similarity at different scales. That is, then that is the decisive characteristic of fractals such as river bed is, and this is, this is again from stockies or rhythms of the brain.

01:08

So you can talk about trees. You talk about different kinds of fractals. And so there's a fractal pattern there in the EEG. And in electrons, efficient from measured outside of scalp and from electrodes inside the scalp. But also from, for measuring the mat, the magnetic and dipoles, or with energy.

01:31

So the ET measures the electric dipole. The energy is, is a machine that measures the magnetic dipoles of the brain, which are different from the electric dipoles. So, you get a different sort of image with energy, and which interesting is that, you know, recently, there was an FMRI study, I believe it was at a Princeton where they discovered, fractal patterns in regional, brain activity at multiple scales Again.

02:07

So, now we have blood flow, we have the magnetic dipoles, we have the electric dipoles also impractical patterns and there's also, you can also make an argument there that there are fractal. Functional isomorphic patterns in the, in the India and anatomical function from from the way. If you consider, how is a neuron like a hand, how is a dendrite like your fingers?

02:37

How is the palm of your hand? Like a soma, how is the? How is like imagine that the interior eyeball? The retina is, is like, it's like your hand, right? And that, and that the axonal necessary that the optic nerve is like your arm, right? And and then when it reaches when, when your arm reaches the, the, the the lateral genetic?

03:13

The LGN cluster of your thalamus that that it's like here arm is plugging into the socket of your shoulder. So so what I'm arguing that that, although your arm doesn't, it doesn't look exactly like a dendrite that it has a fact that the anatomy has a fractal, functional isomorphism to your eye and to a neuron, and to your brain is the whole.

03:46

And so there's a self repeating pattern in terms of like how your anatomy functions that multiple scales, that you can see that you can identify in terms of, like, physical sort of, physical outline of of how things are signals are moving. But also, there's, there's their effective functionals and in the electric readings of the body and multiple scales.

04:11

So, for peanut patterns, and the magnetic readings and multiple scales, and in the readings of your of your blood flow, tracking activity in your brain regions, fractal, functional isomorphins morphisms exist in multiple domains, or multiple modalities simultaneously. And,

04:40

What's also interesting about that is that your your neurons are your brain is capable of tracking, all that your brain is capable of tracking patterns at multiple scales because it's for the same reason that neurons can recognize a line you have you have again you have some of the ganglion neurons.

05:02

Just only only seem to respond to things moving from the left of your vision, to the right of your vision and they don't respond with things are going from above you to below you. So they're like tuned neurons. Become tuned to only responding to certain types of patterns. They're doing a sort of basic pattern recognition based upon their previous, They're previously learned configuration Their initial configuration, it might be random or closer right now which is really useful for a connectivity reasons.

05:40

In a graph network, the more the the right. They're maximally randomized, connections, are, and a graph. The, the fewer the number of paths a signal, is to take to travel from one point to another point. And so random initial can conditions in terms of the starting point are really useful for networking.

06:11

If we could live forever, would that mean that over time the our brains would become increasingly tuned to certain information patterns and thus less what the best less random unless able to to adapt to new information. It's almost, it's almost like to sort of, like, recycling of the human brain from one generation to another.

06:48

In my that might be a very useful for for the from an evolutionary standpoint, basically reproduction as a way to and wipe out the the less usefulness of having the development of rigid non-random patterns over the course of a lifetime. So the idea of the brain, as a canvas, or the brain is having a canvas, is really is really shaky because things are constantly moving.

07:41

The, the body is physically moving constantly, there's constant vibrations as constant reverberations. I mean we're talking electric but vibrations and reverberations mechanical vibrations from reverberations chemical, vibrations and reverberations and magnetic. Vibrations reverberations. All of this movement is happening all the time different. The canvases is this huge schedule of different?

08:20

Frequencies in different locations playing out in different ways over time. And so if you imagine that this is like a notebook. You have to imagine this is the worst fucking notebook because today, I mean, no what I'm saying is like, imagine. Like, instead of a piece of paper that you, you are trying to write on water, you're trying to write.

08:46

You're trying to paint on water or paint on the sky. So if you imagine like the jets, flying the flying above and they're releasing a water trail, and it makes a line in the sky and they make, they set the jets start to make pictures. But as they do this, the wind is causing the patterns to dissipate constantly.

09:05

So you have a line but it's only like a line for a few moments for it starts to spread out and dissipate in the atmosphere, thereby the the same thing of trying to like you could you can, you could add some chemical to the water or temporarily to create a line.

09:24

But very quickly, the movement of the water is going to dissipate that line and that's kind of like that. Seems like it would be a terrible notebook for like keeping knowledge for a while and on top of that it's like so yeah. So so maybe you have some the neuroanatomy some of your neurons will represent that line but then there's neuronal drift then then the what happens what represents that what seems to represent that pattern could be a different set of neurons.

09:56

So, it's like it's it's not only that it's constantly moving. It's it's it's like hard to say, well, where it's like, well, like that would be like if you write the letter t, not only doesn't only last for like a second. But but the next time you try it, write the letter, t it appears in a different place, right?

10:21

It's like it's like now, I'm writing the letter t and I'm trying to write it in the same place. I wrote it last time but it's actually appearing in the notebook somewhere else somewhere that I didn't didn't intend for it to be and so you have this pattern sort of patterned drift and this is really confusing for people.

10:42

Trying to figure out how the brain works. But that's that is kind of like that's kind of that's kind of if the fact that that happens is kind of good because for a couple reasons and one is that you know, you don't want a pattern to stick around to long because you you maybe you need to maybe.

11:05

So, imagine you're looking at something in front of you and so about about five feet in front of me, there's a door handle on a door. That's the doors is for the south end roaming club and as I move my head around the room, there's now there's different things in front of me now.

11:27

So imagine I look into my side where there is a chair. Now, imagine, I'm looking at the chair, but I can still see the door handle, because the door handle stuck. No, no, no, that's bad. You don't want to be seeing a door handle still. When you're looking at a chair, you want things to dissipate you want things, you want images that your brain is rendering to dissipate and you want things to be able to move.

11:54

So that the door handle could be represented on my left now. Instead of all my right, you want there to be a sort of like sort of flexibility and so that and so that is what I'm sort of arguing is that we have a sort of like a flexibility between where where the, the canvas the canvas is being drawn.

12:21

And so patterns have to have to be in a sense, automatically disappearing, even though you remembering them, they have to be sort of like fading away so that you can accept new patterns and have to be kind of virtualized. So that so that they're not so that they're so that different parts of your brain.

12:43

Can re represent the same pattern especially if the part of your brain that was representing the pattern. Previously is now occupied representing another pattern. Well, guess what you, if you, if you have, if you, if you were stuck, if you didn't have virtualized patterns, that would mean that if part of your brain was, was rendering your, the socket of a light switch or, or I guess you should stick the part of your brains, rendering a door handle and and now it's busy, you know, rendering a chair.

13:22

It what I'm getting is that you need to have some flexibility in terms of like, if you're if you're if the neurons that are rendering, one thing are busy doing something else and they can't do two different things at the same time. So you're gonna have to have another group of neurons help out because it's like neurons or not gonna be, you know, there's a certain, there's only a certain amount of activity that they can do simultaneously.

13:52

They're going to need their neighbors to help out sometimes because it's like, yeah, it's like, you have one guy who's he's lifting, he's lifted a box and maybe two boxes and but, but but, you know, if he's, but how can he lift 10 boxes? You need other others to lift?

14:15

Those are the 10 boxes and if and if the one guy that if you were using for lifting the box that contains a rendering of the door is busy. He would be really useful if you had a neighbor who could step in and help out instead and and and handle that workload, and so having virtualized patterns of sort of virtualized pattern recognition and the brain will really be helpful to the workload that not neurons face every day.

14:51

And and again this the idea that patterns can be virtualized or that they are virtualized. Sort of like works really well with idea that the canvas is like, riding on a liquid or writing on a gas. It's it's it's it's okay that they canvas is like a liquid or like a gas for like mind like water when when the patterns are virtual to begin with.

15:23

Because see now it's like, it doesn't matter as much, which part of your brain is rendering. What because and it doesn't matter exactly where things are are being rendered and that that affords you with the flexibility of you know you you don't have just a flat notepad in the first place.

15:52

You know have a regular notepad in the first place. You have the most wishy washing notepad the most. It's like almost like, I mean, it's yeah, it's like this, it is. But here's the thing is you say, well, how can we, how can we even have straight lines? If the notepad is so wishy-washy, how can we have straight lines?

16:15

Why is it that that the world that we see, isn't this mushy squishy ball? Like, how do we have this? Like like how do you like? How is everything not shaky all the time, right? How is the, how is how I'm able to hold my head steady, right? And see the world and sort of like, a study steady almost solid like pattern.

16:47

And so I think that the answer to that, is that the neurons are able to register very precise face changes. Between the tonic firing the inhibition, the dark inhibition patterns, and the light basic firing that allows to know to maintain a precise canvas, a solid world representation. And what would otherwise have just appear to be a squishy liquidity gashes canvas with virtual patterns.

17:29

It's the fact that individual neurons are encoding and passing along phase changes to other neurons fade multimodal, phase changes, that leads, to fact that the brain is able to have a really solid and precise prediction model prediction-based model multi-sensory, model of the world that seems solid and interactable. While the brain is, is moving around and and and being modified by all the patterns.

18:12

So you have this like flexible sort of like substrate, that's almost that that is fractal and multiple scales. Which again is like that is it's something that if you think about like, you know, Galileo and the, the I think about the first lenses, right? How do you make a lens?
