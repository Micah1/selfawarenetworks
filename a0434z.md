Hopfield argued that recurrent neural networks could have attractors or nodes that drive oscillations, causing patterns to loop. The concept of attractors is essential to my idea about how active memories encoded & developing live in a brainwave can drive human choices.

In this talk there is a slide called "Cortical-Wide Neuronal Assemblies" he has a chart to show where brain activity has changed, and these changes were tracked with MEG Magnetic Encephalography, but interesting the chart looks like a sparse distributed representation SDR but also it might remind you of information theory, because the number of changes are small, rare, or sparse, which means they are more meaningful because of their sparsity or rareness, the same idea works with a single cell, and it's receptors, a small percentage of its receptors might meaningfully identify a pattern that the cell has learned.
In a slide about Data Processing he talks about extracting the amplitude from cortical current dipoles (assuming as measured with MEG, MEG dipoles are different from EEG dipoles) so he is talking about high level variations in points measuring dipole activity with MEG and that is what makes up his chart that reminds me of a sparse distributed representation, at a high level of abstraction variations in Magnetic dipole activity represent some sort of brain state change or memory state change at highest level of abstraction representing massive neural assemblies that include major brain areas, cortical colums, major junctions, but the important part to keep in mind is that this is just one level of brain state representation in a multi-scale heirarchical brain state. So what happens at the single neuron level or at the cortical column level matters for storing memory patterns that are not in focus at the moment. By looking at the macroscale brain activity with EEG, MRI, MEG or with some other tool you can begin to guess at what is happening at the microscale, ie which areas of the brain are more active, when this happens in EEG studies they call it "EEG Source Localization" EEG also captures high level dipole activity, but the source of that activity can be localized as deeply as the thalami, which is about is about as deep as anyone needs to go into the human brain.

Human beings haven't even begun to unlock the powerful capabilities of non-invasive medical imaging. You are gonna be shocked when you realize what's possible! 

John Hopfield talks about metaphors on cell assemblies. He talks about memory as a point in high dimensional space, a memory being a stable point in activity of the brain's neural network. However Hopfield is not saying that the brainwave is literally where the attractor point of the memory is stored, but the brainwave oscillation is a perfect place for storing a live state of active human memory, in each interval of time.

making memories and retrieving them
The hopfield network and attractors



each iron atom forms a dipole, a miniature magnet with one positive and one negative end

heat unsteadies these atoms flipping their magnetic poles around at random.

we should test an electron spin with applied heat to see if we can flip its spin

on a microlevel, this means many tiny magnets, each exerting a force in its own direction

but as these forces work against each other their net effect become negligable

when you zoom out this mass of mini magnets has no magnetism at all

as the temperature dips below 770 C Celsius / Fahrenheit 1,418 F however something changes, the direction of each atom is less likely to switch, with its dipole set in place the atom begins to exert a constant pressure on its neighbors, this indicates to them which direction they too should be facing, atoms with different directions vy for influence over the local group, and eventually everyone falls in line one way or the other. The net force is strong. The previously inert block of iron becomes a powerful magnet.

Philip Warren Anderson who won a nobel prize wrote a famous essay titled "more is different" the behavior of large & elementary particles it turns out is not to be understood in terms of the properties of a few particles that is the collection of many small particles, only through their local interactions can produce a function not possible in any of them alone
physicists have formalized these equations and used them to explain the behaviors of glass, metal, and ice

In the late 1970s John J. Hopfield,
saw in these mathematicals of magnetism a structure akin to the brain

Hopfield used this insight to bring under mathematical control a long lasting mystery
the question of how neurons make and maintain memories 

Richard Cmond wrote 2 books on the science of memory
In contrast: Cmond proposed that memories acquired by an animal could be passed down

Richard Semon's Theory of Memory
DANIEL L. SCHACTER, JAMES ERIC EICH, AND ENDEL TULVlNG
University of Toronto
In the first decade of the 20th century, Richard Semon put forward a theory of memory that
anticipated numerous recent developments in memory research. The theory is discussed both in its
historical context and with reference to modem ideas. Semon's theoretical concern for retrieval
phenomena is particularly noteworthy. Several reasons are suggested why the theory is virtually
unknown today.
