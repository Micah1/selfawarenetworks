Oscillators

00:00
So the brain is manipulating the quantum phase field, the quantum field brings method in the quantum field because the phases produced by the action, potentials are

00:19
Manipulating the face field of space and the brain is also detecting your changes in the face. Feel space. And so the face field to becomes the canvas of consciousness and the pace field itself is being shaped to to become the rendering that the brain is perceiving. And the perception of this face field is the is the inner representation of the of the patterns learned from the ecosystem and they the brains understand from the brains.

01:04
So, on body of causation that is this muscular structure, right? And it's pain is right. So it's like there is that the self in the self-awareness is that you know some you know some like half your signals are like sensor signals and the other half are motor signals and like you can divide the brain into, basically two types of signals, they're either sensor, sit a signal circuits or their motor signal circuits and and it's very interesting and that there's they they both go both kind of circuits go everywhere.

01:50
But it he kind of means that maybe not not exactly everywhere. I mean there's incoming there's incoming sensory areas which go to the the thalamus for most of them and then some of them and go to the temporal lobes first and then to the thalamus and other brain areas.

02:19
But the like the orbital frontal lobes and entering a cortex and the hydrogen amygdala and the founders. And so yeah. So, there's basically like a lot of interesting neurosurgeon pathways, but the incoming sensory pathway is like most of the rest of them. Like, you know, the I have the ears, the I have to look into my the tongue and touch like the all go to from from the sense, organ to the thalamus first and then they go to the bottom of the knee of the new cortex.

03:10
And then they go up through columns and that part of the primary sensory cortex that they correspond to with, you know, touch and taste in in these somatosens through court. Smashes your cortex and and an envision going into the opposite of loves first. And then the prior loads, which is where it starts to make a lot of connections with that with the inputs from there.

03:45
The temporal prior junction is a place where a lot of inputs converge and then includes imposed from the ear to the to dedicate, to a thalamus. And then to the auditory cortex, or I like to call the audio cortex.

04:08
For yeah. So I mean, essentially, the brain is creating patterns in the face. Field was facetime and that's what other neurons are detecting and phase field then becomes the, the etching or the brain's notepad of consciousness, because it's only transmitting phases. It's transmitting phases potentially on an electric field.

04:33
A magnetic field and mechanical field like audio is right or mechanical or and a chemical field because sending chemicals with and and also a a thermal heat field, right? Because because there is some. There is some thermal signaling that happens. When when neurons activity, picks up you have all of these signals can like I mean it's it's a really interesting question like imagine what matter how try to imagine how LTP happens in the innocence where there's whether two neurons fire at the same time and they're close, but they're not connected like somehow.

05:37
A connection has to grow in between them and they could be too. They could be a thousand neurons apart from or, you know, it could be. It's it could be, they could be billions of neurons apart, and still form a connection that didn't exist before because they both find same because they both started oscillating.

06:02
The same at the same time it was a resonating also hanging right because they both had fired responsive. At the same pattern is sort of represent different aspects of the same pattern on different different errors of the brain. Like, it's like, you might have part of a pattern represented by by what you're holding and part of the patent representing by what you're seeing that, what that is, what you're holding and part of a pattern represented.

06:29
By the sound of what you're holding. As you bang it on your knee or something. And so you, you have basically the the concept of the pattern and the orientation of the pattern, and each of these modalities that is being represented in in each of these brain areas and all three brain areas are firing together and wiring together even if they're even if like their initial connections are random they're now firing together and wiring together in neurons a fire at the same time across these vast distances.

07:14
They they start to form right? Like specific connections. Like eventually there's, there's a very specific connection that, that, that, that farms just because dent. Because because spine's grow and at the same time when when spines grow, the we take, they take energy away from, I mean, okay? So this is part of a little bit weird because I mean I was I was saying that my man had bought.

07:52
This is that is that for

07:59
For a decoup like a decoupling, like you could have and like there's a difference between display state and a decoupling. So it's place a as when there's sort of like almost a perpendicular. Perpendicular coupling is the way I think of it. It's kind of weird but like they're not like like they're not firing at the same time but they're firing in alternate time.

08:31
Like it's there's it'd be like there's the most amount of distance between the start and the and the end of the firing sequence is possible. So like basically the way it works is when one fires about half of a halfway after a halfway after the time and it fired, that's when the next one fires and then when it's about halfway through, it's it's fine.

09:02
That's when the first one fires again, or

09:08
Yeah, it's like the cycle. It's like a cycle. It's like, they're there. Instead of being a line their they're like they're like gears that are aligned at being misaligned, right? Like they're like almost at a cross shape in terms of their alignment. Like they'll like one will fire and then halfway through before, that one resets, the halfway through the time between the firing and the resetting that that halfway time is when the next one fires.

09:45
And so they each fire each other's halfway time. That's the best way to say. Yeah, that each fire each other's halfway time and that way they never fired the same time but they're also like sort of like right in the middle. It's

10:06
Yeah.

10:11
And so,

10:16
It's it's like that. It's like there or it's like positive and negative orbiting each other, right?

10:53
But but anyway, that's a space date. So space date is like the odd couple of oscillations. It's it's a, it's an, it's an offs. It's an oscillation possession, observation.

11:14
Yeah, that's weird. Anyway, but but yeah, that's like the, it's it's almost like you think about that, the, the idea of a space day and you think about it in terms of

11:37
Let's see. A space state is basically. Yeah. This alternation between to oscillation that is an alternation between toasts instead of a synchronization, but at the synchronization, my by alternation, right?

12:01
And and I think there is an alternate there's an alternation dynamic I play between, I suspect that it's between like the reason, like the reason we can we can either detect a particles momentum or it's, I mean, as I mean, a particles location or it's velocity, we can either detect a particle location or it's velocity, but not both of the same time, right?

12:27
Something like that. I have any to look this up, but the idea, but I'm just saying, like, well, maybe this because it's oscillating between having a location and a velocity like between a state as we have a having location would be, like,

12:50
I don't know. That makes sense, though. Because you're sick, because you're because they yeah, I'm oh, that is the week. That's always part shit. So, when neurons fire together, the, they are modifying, the phase field of space. When you're, as far as the same time, the face feel the spaces changing they the line that is directly connect directly between two neurons that fire.

13:23
At the same time, there's a line between them or space is moving faster. Because basically spacetime is moving faster because the space time is hotter between them and air between them because they're both because they're heating it from two sides. And so the area directly between them is between two, oscillators is hotter than the, then the area that's that is not directly between two oscillators and the further you are sort of like, okay?

14:02
So if you draw a line between two oxlanders and then you go to the midpoint between two oscillators and you draw line is perpendicular going up or down. Just it's a perpendicular line and so the idea is that the the further you are away from on the if you're on line that is perpendicular, when it's going up and down further, you are on that line, the greater the greater the rate is, you are away from the horizontal line that

14:43
Then.

14:47
The court, then the cooler you you want and and it's kind of interesting because

15:06
The okay. So I mean it's it's it's almost it's almost like the face field is going to have cold spots that are that are defined as the has the the the boundaries of the the the bubbles of in between hotspots, right? It's almost like this sounds like a checker pattern right see where hot war hotspots linked together and in between the hot spots or dark spots and him turned it dark spots or hospitals So it's like a checker pattern If he's feel the brain is like a checker pattern in a sense With dark spots and cold spots.

16:01
But but the what happens is that oscillators and oscillating sensor are transmitter ray which is like a column which is like a which is like oh sorry it's like a row. It's like a layer inside. A column that sensor array is going to formulated pattern that consists of neurons, a fire that also inhibited other neurons and that carves a pattern out of the tonic firing rate.

16:35
So normally on the, the oscillators all fire tonically until their disturbed physically which causes some of them to become inhibited. Anyway, in any case, it creates the whole array becomes a pattern that is pursued by the next array, which receives the changes in the face pattern that are created by the first array.

16:55
And then the next array basically has a learns a and magnify it perspective. That is.

17:16
It's, it's like

17:25
Is learning a picture rendered by the first layer starting a patterning, like, every neuron is learning a pattern based on Which based upon is it's it's it's correlation firing correlations with other neurons. Every neuron is learning a firing pattern because it recognizes the five different ways from other neurons of fire.

17:59
So when they're on fire is a transplants. A mechanical wave a chemical wave, a wave in terms of a disturbance in the electric field. A wave interior. In terms of the surface of the magnetic field and a wave in terms of heat and all five of those ways are traveling across the brain heating up space.

18:19
But also, they are beating up space time because heating up space is the same as speeding up space time. And so the, but then some of space time is also slowed down because inhibited, so it's frequency is slower, but it's at the same time, it's amplitude is higher so it's a habitated inhibited but it takes up a lot of space.

18:51
A much larger manus space than when the faster space time and so it's like space has different configurations either. It's very spread out and high amplitude, which is like the space in between galaxies or it's very compressed and crunched together, which is the, which is with the, which is a space inside the galaxies.

19:22
So the space outside galaxies is very, very expanded outwards, like a balloon. It's like it pushes yourself apart and the part that's pushing it apart is the sort of like horizontal. These are the horizontal triangles that fit inside the the basically, the lines between spheres. So let's say you have three spheres, right?

19:55
That represent the sun, the moon and earth and there's there's a front, there's always a triangular line. And each interval of time is always a triangular line between the three different. Okay. And that triangle line is harder than the rest of space. It's basically like the direct line between the earth, the moon, the center of the earth center of the moon, in the center of the sun.

20:20
Those lines, the direct lines between every planet. Those lines in space are hotter, then the rest of space time, right? So the line between the earth and the moon is hotter than the rest of the space time and also time moves faster in between the earth and the moon, then it does in.

20:46
And if you draw if you trying to midpoint between the earth and the moon and draw a straight line between two straw straight line from the center of the earth, to the center of the moon and you find a midpoint between the earth at the moment and you draw a perpendicular line, okay?

21:02
And the further you go out along the that line away from the perpendicular line away from the line that goes in between earth. And the moon, the cooler spaces until that line is between the earth and the sun. So in a sense, the earth is and the sun attracts attract each other's heat.

21:43
They yeah, they attract each other's feet and they heat up space around them around each other and the space between them as harder than the space. That is is not directly between them. So the hort the space that is like, but it's like if it's like there's a radius, right?

22:08
There's a radius of effect, which is like if you take the center of the earth in the center of the sun and you draw, parallel lines, that intersect the sun in the earth at the same time, but the lights have to be parallel and they eat to go through the center of the sun and the center of the earth.

22:27
See. So just, you just have parallel lines, right? And the idea is that see about doing this.

22:54
And an idea. Is that the why did what are the rings that again? So you have idea is that the diameter of the earth and the diameter of the sun.

23:27
I'm just thinking about the radius of the gravitational effect. Obviously, there's not an earth or close enough to each other to that they're locked in orbit with each other, which is why we're alive. If they were not locked in orbit with each other and we wouldn't be talking, of course,

24:04
In space. Everything. Remembers because an oscillator encodes the memory with a change in its spin. Like, if I feel an electron spin changes that change is, is a pattern that changes in space, and so space time itself can change can store memories as changes in spin or changes in in phase like if an electron if electrons and a positron combine the common neutron, right?

24:45
It's there's a new phase happening and

24:57
Right? So those are particles that condense specially about expanded temporary land. And so I'm thinking that there's an inversion between expanding temporarily and expand expanding spatially, right? So that means that planets are space. That has expanded specially at space, is based on the has expanded temporarily. Now, I did a backwards space is space, that has expanded.

25:51
Horizontally. And, Planets are space. That has expanded vertically, okay? So the idea is that the the planet represents and and asked, and a group of oscillations I have become merged together and they're slowing space down and that, and the slowing of space tent of space time relative to the expansion of space means that their configuration is that space is dense and and material prayer.

26:39
And by implication, then the opposite of dense and dense material is is as far as energy like space time is like sparse energy.

26:58
Yeah, and so space time review, they're dense material or sparse energy. And so, so light and photons, and electrons, and entire elect spectrum. At the particles level at this, individual particle levels that are not oscillating in atoms. They're just particles like that, that part of space time, just that it just keeps that expands and it expands relative to, because it's slower.

27:38
So it's it's expanding in dimensions in the dimensions of space that represents

27:51
The inversion of the expansion into space time, like space represents slow it down, space time because it's like

28:15
It's like the mass of energy. Now, it's like the volume of energy, the volume of energy, and really volumeless. It's a huge volume. The volume of energy is this vast distance? That's inverted to the speed of mass.

28:46
The volume of energy time of energy is inverted to the speed of mass. Does that make sense? Yes, yes it does. Yes. It is. Because what I'm saying is like the idea of math is that mass is much more slower and frequency. So the volume of energy is inverted to the speed of mass, the slowness of mass is inverted to this.

29:25
Then, mmm volume better. Do the bridge and slowness of mass?

29:34
The volume of energy, the volume of energy is big because the the volume of mass is the is the as the contraction of energy, the volume of mass is the contraction of energy, the contraction of space time into an also tory configuration. It's like, oscillating, eating other oscillations. So, the volume of space time and energy and the mass of space time.

30:25
Is.

30:30
Time. So I mean, it's like, okay, so it's like, no. It's, it's that it, okay. So the idea is it's a convergence of space time. So it's like space time. That is.

30:56
Okay, but think of it as like it's like there's an inversion of there's an exact amount of matter and antimatter, right? It's like there's exact, there's an exact amount of

31:13
Mass like think of masses like muscle and think of of Of space is like fat, right? So muscle has three times the the density of fat like so a pound of muscle is one third the size of a pound of fat because it's more dense. And so because so basically it's just like saying that planets are dense points in space, but the dense points in space are the hot points.

32:03
And so they're hot and dense, hot and dense and the hot, the heat. And the density and excites the heat and the density correlates with excitation in the and the electric in the electromagnetic fields and in the face, the face feels the space time, right? So the face feels the space time magnetism and electricity and chemicals, and heat, and vibrations, our sound waves, like all of those are in essence.

32:55
Sort of.

33:02
Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.

33:36
But they don't have to go anywhere. In fact, they're going to, they're going to, it's going to be situations where you have oscillators essentially like attract oscillators.

33:56
It's weird to think that oscillators could be 50% of space. The weird. I don't, I don't know what that makes sense. Because idea is that space, all slaves at one point. And then you have increasing extra bead and increasing entropy at the same time. And the answer, the idea was that space time goes from a state of maximum extrapy to towards maximum entropy, but it isn't really making any sense right at the beginning of space time.

34:38
Why would there be a lot of order? But that, I mean, I guess ideas like yeah, so like space time was undifferentiated. So I guess that in a sense that's like that's very orderly. Like if there's only one oscillation that's very orally, that's very orderly. If it's only one oscillation and so like increasing entropies like space becomes increasingly disorderly.

35:08
And so the idea is like, if everything is disorderly, that means that like instead of there being like a single pattern at defines all space time, then space time becomes divided by patterns that maximumly oscillate randomly, right? And if you have a situation, that's maximally oscillating, randomly and playing scale to, I don't know, whatever.

35:45
The, that's the weird thing. It's like okay well if there's a plank scale, right? If there's a minimum distance that particles have to jump through,

36:02
It's a space is like a honeycomb, right? If there's a minimum distances basis, like a honeycomb, particles have to jump because they can't go out shorter than the playing scale.

36:24
It's just it's just weird, right? Particles. Can't occupy the same space. Right. That's what that was. We understanding, but you have situations where the column, you know, positive positrons and electrons. And and when they there the pot, the anti-particle the electron is the positron. And when they combine, they become a neutron.

36:55
So the faith. So two particles that represent that represent opposites opposite charges of the same space. Same frequency, same frequency, but opposite charges, right? Positive space and negative space. And when they combine, they become a neutron because that makes sense because it's like, you have two, two particles that combine and they be in the enter a different face state, so they become a different particle.

37:43
The brain is making changes to the face field but it's collectively. Sensing that changes to the face field because oscillations, that oscillate together. I have a. The actors as an amplified array like this since together like anything, that disturbs one of them, distributes all of them. And so they they form, they can hear each other in a sense and they have this tonic expectation of firing.

38:20
And so whenever firing is inhibited or excited around them, they notice, they notice that they physically notice it, and they array physically tracks a patterns, we through through reactions that ricochets through all the oscillators in the array and but the act as a single array. So they all become aware of whatever, ripples them, they all react or whatever.

38:51
Ripples done. They are they're combined oscillator. Something that combined fact. And think that they're moving that they're that there ought to be there, they're essentially orbiting each other and that's that is causing space to expand in time and it's causing
39:38

That's right. That's causing contracted space to expand in time, but it's causing energy to expand and volume in. In a relationship with it's causally the expansion of the volume of energy, which is the space around. So, the energy is a space energy. So the volume of energy around a mass is relative to that mass, but essentially the volume is like if space is a single sheet, okay?

40:18
Then imagine that a mass is crunching. Space up. And if the fact in effect that could look like, if you push on a sheet, really hard, right? And you have basically, but if you push on a sheet between two, different spheres between two different oscillators, okay? Then then the, the line between them is relatively more sunken than the lines that are not between them, right?

41:02
And that's idea that
4
1:10
Oscillators warp space because they heat space because they are faster because they're hotter space. They're faster relative to slow space and that means that slow space.

41:32
Needs to travel along time before it completes an interval. All right? So fast space because it's crunched together. Say space is the sphere. Every point in space is constantly going back and forth back and forth, right? Like just constantly moving every point in space constantly living, it's face space, right.

41:57
And that essentially when you have contracted space and in dense maths contracting space, it's like things are. It's a lot of movement. That is ricocheting. A lot of basically, like a lot of collisions are happening, right? A lot of collisions are happening really fast and that's part of why space is heating up.

42:30
There is a two part of the two ways to describe the same thing. Space is heating up and it's heating up and it's colliding a lot. Those are the same thing, right? So, it's heating up and it's colliding a lot. And inside mass and a collision step with the collisions are

43:01
They're causing heat but heat is causing is like time is moving faster. And so, the time that moves more slowly right has to is time that moves more slowly is literally time than traveling a longer distance. So the further away time is from spheres and from the lines between spheres.

43:40
I mean, the further that a point in space is that is between oscillators and the points and and oh, the furthest point away from the lines between oscillators, that point is going to be this slowest. And that means that space is relatively expanded because time is really more slowly.

44:14
And in there and the time interval between a particle moving from from one state to another is sort of the time interval of particles, maybe from one state to another town of particles moving from one state to another, into a particles moving from one state to another,

45:02
Well.

45:18
I'm just trying to, like, think of what is it? What is really right? Because you're like, okay.

45:35
So a particles are frequency, which is in the frequency is like

45:47
It's like frequency and distance. All right, so space and time are

46:01
Frequency and distance.

46:06
Oh shit, space and time are frequency and distance. So essentially what I'm saying is like the distance as is a space frequency, distance is a space frequency, share? Okay, it's a frequency and and which spaces more slow. And slowness is distance and and, and it's called. But but where space is more dense.

47:01
It's hot, and it's it's it's not over gold. So this is bases. Maybe space is neutral spaces, neutral distance, but identity is hot or cold. It's, let's say it's thermally chaotic, right. Density is thermally chaotic because Hits. Smoothing faster in time. And so,

47:55
But it but overall it's hotter overall, it's hotter. So, overall entropy is as I guess happening faster around mass. And so,

48:25
Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.

49:09
So, it's like either there's a lot in space or there's a lot in time and so the warping of space time is like, when there's a lot in space time is moving more slowly. And when there's a lot in time, space is more crunched. And so space time is I guess magnetically polarized, right?

49:43
Like positives.

49:48
Attract, I guess, right?

49:58
Okay. Is that right? Okay, so since I've overlooked some things so that idea. Is that the if the oscillation is increasing in energy, then it's going to then it's going to have a positive electric field, which means it's going to

50:26
It's going to have a gravitational effect.

50:33
That.

50:38
Attracts. And another sphere that has a and negative electromagnetic field.

51:01
So that's interesting, so but this interesting because it's kind of like so what if

51:19
What air?

51:33
Because either in Ios you still have the same sort of vertical lines. So you could have so earth could have a positive button so earth. So what I'm saying is like so shit because he was thinking if Earth has a negative elect magnetic field

52:22
I guess that could be an orbital way, right?

52:39
The earth is going to have like if negative feels can have both positive innovative right. You know the positive is not the North Pole is very positive in the south post gonna be negative, right? My back wall, I joined that like a janko out the dipole or quadruple or whatever.

53:01
And top is going to be positive. In the bottom is going to be negative. Second magnet.

53:16
Right. And then, and

54:16
And neutral object still consists of atoms. And therefore charges the possession of these properties allows us to look at the relationship between the positive and negative charges positive, negative, and neutral objects exhibit. A few key properties towards one. Another first property was the same objects. There's the first property is the same charges objects, propel and opposite.

54:47
Charges attract. Seems that two positive charges in two. Negative charges will repel each other.

55:06
So what if the negative charge is like and a perpendicular phase or a phase? Let's place it. Would it a negative charge in a space state relative to a positive charge? Right. There's a is positive charges, okay? So,

55:44
Positive and there because right? Because it's academia. Attraction is okay. So that's okay. So, why do positive negative attract?

56:01
Right. Because they're, they're

56:58
So there was something to do with like cool titles. That's writing sound, right? Where the two is two objects. Collide.

57:15
There.

57:30
That they were on different trajectories.

57:39
And a client.

57:48
It's like, okay, we're now

57:53
How do the after that collision? What happened next?

58:21
Shit. All right. So what if we consider a positive and negative charge is like, as the

58:36
Like a positive charge would be like the sun would be positive because it is at the point where it's still releasing more energy to the surrounding environment. It's releasing a lot of energy starting environment now. So, so the planets say they're all, they're all in an advanced stage, you're cooling.

59:05
They're all a lot cooler than the sun. There's not as much energy thing with this, in fact.

59:16
One can imagine that when the planets have lost efficient energy that they become the basically decaying the basically becoming negative because they're

59:32
He came, it's an oscillations or decaying as opposed to the oscillations increase, but relative to the observer, right? And oscillations are increasingly decaying so it's like a negative. So negative charge is like a decreasing conservation and a positive church, like an increase in oscillation, This is releasing more energy because more energy is going to put into it.

01:00:04
The sun is more positive, right? And, and earth is more negative than the sun is not as not as hot. So it's a, it's a relatively relatively positive and relatively negative. And the interesting thing is,

01:00:42
So interesting thing is, so you're saying that the space is warped between stars, for example, It's worked between galaxies, It's working between planets, This were between any oscillator, right? Whether that oscillator is positive or negative space is working between them. So there's heat between them even if one's positive one, negative or even if they're both positive.

01:01:16
I mean and sense, interesting. Okay, no wait a second though. So say positive positive and negatives.

01:01:32
Are like decaying or increasing oscillators?

01:01:41
Right. And,

01:01:48
That means that. So okay.

01:01:57
So each officer is expanding space, causing space expand

01:02:07
HR Center is a contraction of space that is causing space time. Her. Yeah, because it's it's causing space time to iterate where it's hotter faster.

01:02:35
Having space time to it's putting a drag on space time. So it's causing space time to and be faster closer to the center of the oscillator and slow down further away from the center of the. Also the curvature space time starts from the center of any oscillator and the this the the mass of the oscillator, the combined oscillator.

01:03:17
Warps space time around oscillator. So create space time around is later. But okay, so but in a sense, what I'm saying is that it creates a

01:03:34
It creates the temporal temporal surface area. A temporal surface area. Means that that particles that are moving in random directions will more will be more likely to move towards a temporal surface area because it's additional directions relative to the rest of the direction. So a hot area space has a additional pass along a temporal dimension, relative to slow modern space and so you have space time as the expansion of time because of oscillations the expansion of time because of oscillations Causes the relative appearance of the expansion of space as a, as a direct consequence of the total equilibrium are positive and negative charges in the universe.

01:05:03
So that if you have a certain amount of space, it's positively charged. You have to have a certain amount of spaces, negatively charged. And so, if you have space contracting it or to be mass-like, then you have to them. Then a greater amount of area has to exist for space.

01:05:23
That's not contracted relatively speaking. And so the relative appearance of control of expanded space from contracted space.

01:05:41
Is what gives rise to the curvature of space time, but also the dimensions of space time and the

01:05:58
The positive and negative charges are like oscillations that are increasing or decreasing orbiting is essentially possible, but

01:06:20
A decreasing orbit. Let's see or say that increasing our decreasing because I'm trying to think they're a good reason why to negative oscillations were might repel each other, right?

01:06:52
Because and negative and positive.

01:07:09
It doesn't make total sense. It doesn't make sense wrong. So it's like okay, so if if two negatives formed a sort of spaces,

01:07:34
If a negative positive or opposite but we're opposite oscillations, right? Where is that? Because you, you're trying to think of like,

01:07:45
You're trying to see if you can somehow describe the attraction of opposite particles and electromagneticism. In terms of planetary, in terms of the movement of plants where bodies. And I think that is just it's too much of a stretch, the idea of positive and negative oscillations, right translations, that are increasing.

01:08:15
That sounds good, right? Isolation is there's more energy moving into the oscillation or more energy being released from the oscillation then it's gonna have a positive electromagnetic field which means it's gonna be sentence.

01:08:33
It's going to be causing the land. The electric lanes to be sending out. The collision is the collisions and the also is very questions and space is to be on vertical lines and both positive and negative spheres. Both of them will be expanding space regardless whether or not they're positive or not.

01:09:05
Okay. Well, there are so if you think about it the plan is do collide, right? So there aren't situations from two plans collide and our situations and plans orbit.

01:09:25
So maybe the phase

01:09:38
Maybe also. So face is also going to be like velocity and of planetary bodies through space, right?

01:09:58
So we're not moving directly towards each other, the path. The the path we're going to keep missing each other. This sort of like sort of like the configurations space and so maybe there repelling, so maybe plants are positive and they're repelling to make sense.

01:10:41
No.

01:10:50
Gladiator. They're falling towards each other, makes sense, and that they're warping space between each other, because, but they're working space between each other but they're velocity as greater.

01:11:09
Then then there attraction to each other.

01:11:22
Maybe the velocity is greater than or not and they're not on a not an equation course because

01:11:40
Because the amount of pull that they have on each other is

01:11:49
Actually weak. So they're just slightly altering each other's paths, right? Their.

01:12:06
They're in and also squirting pattern, that is

01:12:15
There's a moon in our synchronized in terms of the moon. Doesn't is the moon's rotation is as align. So, a certain side of the motor is always facing earth, right? Is the kind of synchronization.

01:12:41
But okay, but here's the thing is that? So the the earth is going to have a positive and negative dipole, okay? Positive North Paul like a battery, right? I think and maybe I need to look this up. Okay, so think about the, the rate of the spin as something that is accelerating, the

01:13:15
The distortion of space, right? So, the idea is that

01:13:27
Something like the earth is emitting both positive and negative vertical lines. That's where it. Yeah. So I guess we would have positive layers from one side and negative lasts from another side. Let me see if I can make that makes sense.

01:14:05
Right? Because that would mean that.

01:14:23
So objects that have both positive and negative charges or new tools. So, at earth's earth would be as a planet would be an interesting planets would be neutral towards each other because they have bold positive and negative charges. So positive and negatives split apart and started. And when they went when they went, and when it went to collide again, it's like split apart.

01:14:56
When it was quiet again, what happens is that?

01:15:08
Two positive charges or two. Negative charges question each other apart, right? And space expanded at that point. And at the moment that space expanded because two positive charges collided or two negative charges collided and pressured by product. These don't want them together, right? Please don't follow me then. What happened was the at the same time, somewhere else, a positive, a negative charge.

01:15:48
That didn't belong to another combined. Okay, but they combined, but they're they combined. But because they were of different services by the oscillated. So, it's like a positive and negative a different phases combined, because they're, they're not compatible, they can't couple. So they also each other. So they attract

01:16:25
That was also attracted to them but because once positive in the ones negative, the they're out of phase and they can't combine but the resulting activity of them wrapping around each other, is their attractive. Retailer is the densification of space. And the fact that there's now positive charges elsewhere that are pushing to their part that is the death matter.

01:17:01
It's like space is pushing each other supposed pushing itself apart because to positive charges almost collided and then they bounce off each other. They push their flying apart, a lot of horizontal movement. So space expanding, but the expansion is, is like the reaction of to positive two or two like chargers, right?

01:17:34
And the contraction is the orbitings of incompatible positive and negative charges. So you're orbiting a state of combining. All you need to combine is for two particles to like a positron and, and life, because they're the same phase, they can combine they being the. Same phase means that they are.

01:18:15
Firing at the same time and because they're firing an oscillation together. They are talking to each other but if two particles are not firing at a same time, they're not enthused together which means that that they fly towards each other, but never directly add each other. And so they orbit each other and it's totally shit.

01:18:46
Turn it down. So that's why we have. We're negative electrons. Orbiting positive neutrons is these. These, there's those oscillators like absorb each other but they can't fully absorb each other if they're not missing. They and, and they can't attract each other and thus, unless they're, but with some, but some, but a neutron has both a positive and a negative.

01:19:31
Okay, a neutron is brought a positive and a negative electron.

01:19:42
So is a considered yes meaningful, right?

01:20:08
But in essence neutrons are far larger. So,

01:20:20
Say that one in the positron and the electron component and space.

01:20:29
He can lower frequency and mass increase.

01:20:41
Actually, the diversion of frequency and and amplitude. So masses, the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.

01:20:58
Is it masses? The amputee. That's inverted to the frequency of energy because mouses energy moving out more stories and masses. So mass is the energy.

01:21:19
By dancing with energy for they to the frequency of

01:21:32
To have to relate to the frequency, and positive, two planets for. So planet, that rotates is ultimately flashing positive and negatives.

01:22:04
Charges into charges and magnitude so it's ultimately attracting and repelling in a sense.

01:22:25
So, that would be like,

01:23:06
I'm just, I'm just trying to picture, I'm trying to picture as a plant or this.

01:23:14
Oh, wait a second then. So the rotational planet that isn't that like the isn't the dipole positive going to be at the North Pole, right?

01:23:34
So like to spend on the earth is and along the axis of the positive and negative poles, right? So you can also see the positive and negative as the, you can see the negative as attractors of a single oscillation because the positive charge flows into the negative charge, right?

01:24:12
So the positives are going to be more attractive negatives because they are repellent, there pushing out energy and and negatives are pulling in energy and two negative charges are

01:24:55
Average humanitarians would know each other.

01:25:43
Okay, well, I should be able to look that up, right?

01:28:13
So feel this and I'm kind of object, it takes value. Every point is based on every moment.

01:32:34
Right here.

01:42:46
So the positive and negative charges are perpendicular. Oscillations. And that's why they attract because they're creating.

01:42:58
An electromagnetic field. That is horizontally improper thick of their airline and that is causing the attraction because the

01:43:23
Has interesting because it's like,

01:44:13
Because it's like a spicy and so,

01:44:25
A split explain states have

01:44:33
It's the space theaters like the oscillation is reports but but it's for post along a different access.

01:44:49
Right. And this case. So if it's oscillation is esophilation between a positive and a negative charge is like a space state, then their perpendicular and they attract because they're not pushing on the same space they're pushing on poor space in the poor way. So it's like so think of it as like you have Legos that that fit together a certain way, but they but otherwise they they bounce off each other, right?

01:45:38
And gosh, this is off obviously retrospect, but like to it, like two spheres are going to attract each other. Okay. I mean to us later is gonna attract each other because also there's a couple but they're going, but if they are moving it.

01:46:23
Tosses and I talk to other but if the oscillators are, it's offsiders or the attractors. So like one oscillator is an attractor in a larger authority, like every oscillator is an attractor and a larger obstacle and

01:46:55
Because it's all because of some level. It's all single oscillation that's becoming increased. It's a single singular space term. That's becoming increasingly.

01:47:15
Singles. I guess, I guess it's like imagine that one of them is blowing the wind.

01:47:35
I'm trying to explain why? They why they attract each other and it's that, they're

01:47:54
It's kind of, I think of, like receptors, you know, how like receptors like you can only have 30 receptors and potassium receptors, and they're designed to only accept the one kind of, they're just like, if either gonna accept sodium, or is it gonna accept calcium or it's gonna accept tassium?

01:48:13
It doesn't, it doesn't do goals. It just does one thing, and it keeps out the eye outs that are like, like, if you put a potassium ion near 30 mi on, it's not supposed to be grabbing this tattoo, I'm not sure exactly how it works. But,

01:48:39
The idea is that positive and negative charge or attract, because the

01:48:54
Because one of them is and keep saying, one of them is sending signals for horizontally. Okay. Look. Okay. So okay. Okay, think about this. Okay, so if you have to heartless and there's a line between there, that's the shortest path, but let's say that.

01:49:41
Okay, so rotate it. So that if you have two of them and they both have a positive and negative charge, then they're gonna have a stronger pull on each other because it's like one is pushing space in a horizontal axis and one is pushing space in the vertical axis, right?

01:50:12
And that.

01:50:27
I still look at it, I'm almost there. Okay, but I look, it's like, okay, so you have. So in the case of, if you have two masses that are firing at each other, all right, so one planet sends another light. So, the light from the sun is knocking, earth and pushing earth away, right in theory or or something else is happening.

01:51:02
But anyway, it's like it's knocking earth and maybe it's causing right to spend, I don't know. And it's doing a combination of pushing earth and spinning or the any case. It's a knock a light from the sun is not as knock and in some sort of physical reactions is happening from that, it's nothing to prevent the sun from pushing earth away except that the signal is this understanding are pretty weak.

01:51:30
So I argue that gravity that that because it's heating space, it's creating time and that's causing the earth through towards the sun. But the same time the earth's being are pushing away.

01:51:51
And this is a combination of force is where there's like up, there's a there. The son of the earth are both pushing each other away.

01:52:05
They're both sending, you know, a knock sign together and with with their emissions, their light emissions in particular. So the light emissions are in a cause like a subtle push, but it's in a very subtle part. So, these little push, so they're pushing each other away. It just a little bit but they're also curving space so that they sort of fall for each other.

01:52:31
A little bit, not enough to collide with their falling for each other. A little bit. They're not aligned and terms and they're not an aligned in their trajectories in a way that would allow them to collide very soon. The trajectories are not aligned but right in a winning it's like they are.

01:53:08
And away. I'm already doing that, right? If you have,

01:53:17
So the idea is that two positive lines, we push each other away. The Earth is rotating, so that they're, it's gonna exert a push, but not like a perfect push. It's gonna insert like a push. It's like, it's gonna cause a spin right instead of a perfect brush. So I'm going to just maybe direct is not, it's not direct because the line because they're both moving through space, right?

01:53:50
So the line is not even to. Actually, there's they're pushing any trailer, but they're pushing each other reserting portion each other and they're causing. But there's also moving through space at the same time so there and so they're not. So the trajectories are not online. So that question time, space and they're heating each other up.

01:54:20
And which is part of the attractive forces by causing their respective particles to fall toward each other, but not exactly towards each other. And there are also being a lot of time. Electromagnetic. Drum. The idea is that attraction, component is just

01:54:52
That positive and negative charges are inversions of each other that want to

01:55:11
The oh it's that the Knox are.

01:55:21
As place they see a slave state. So if if it's a perfect LTD is like a space state because it means that the the oscillations are perfectly decoupled in space time. I mean, they're like so do couple. They're like their cannot in sync there in alternation. And so there ultimately decent.

01:56:01
Other deepthroater. Their the decent along, a perpendicular axis. And so the brain work we're saying okay. The causes growth between causes of spine is to grow for us saying that spines deteriorate between LTD or an elbow. And we're saying that LGD is a space state, the error, we're saying that ideal, the ideal LPD act, I do access of LTD is like a space video, right?

01:56:39
Where the most lines are going to be drawn between firing between states, that are firing at the same time. And the most, the most decay is going to happen. Between you knows that are in a space, they firing ultimately so that most decaying links are going to happen. And so in a sense a system, it's moving towards a place.

01:57:15
State is one that's decaying and perhaps collapsing. Because it's going to say, as soon as they decided towards class because I guess it's placed state represents high entropy, and Particles that are

01:57:52
Still not quite right because I'm sure that I'm almost arguing. That the that displays state is, I think it's display status between positive and negatives. And that positives and negatives are inverted because they have vertical or horizontal direction. And actually. So I'm imagining that that if you combine electrons together a lot there, they're going to repel because they're

01:58:39
There. Here each other. They're accelerating. They space creating each other and that the potential isn't increasing if they if they collide. So, they

01:59:08
Here. Repel instead.

01:59:39
Seven. So, maybe charge is

01:59:46
Like spin in time. The charges like, increasing or decreasing.

02:00:27
And so, so what the charges? I increase my decrease.

02:00:39
Okay, but real quickly, I just wanted to say that I was thinking of the forcing electrons together, this critical here. And so space time, which is why this bit, why it appears to spin as separate from the charge, is it space time has become as is being pressed apart towards deco here.

02:01:12
It's becoming decoherent or things like the, it's like the yes, the stress part and be searched for the same as deep, where is

02:01:34
Numbers in the rotation of the cargo translation of the particle brains together, spend and

02:01:50
Here. So space time.

02:01:58
The dimensions. Establish the decided dimensional coherence is space. Time is established by the oscillation. And so if you've forced to positive charges together, they are going to they're going to repel because they're hitting each other. So they're going to have a diagnosis going to crack.

02:02:39
But and they're gonna hide each other. So they're gonna cost us other to spend like like oscillators that are attracting each other but also repelling each other in colliding. Oscillators can collide and cottager has been or each collision is causing a change in the orientation and the spin and the angular velocity.

02:03:24
And so the charge is like, increasing.

02:03:54
Right? So it's something about this. So, like the atom represents, the convergence of

02:04:05
You remember?

02:04:11
The oscillation is combined this fighting.

02:04:25
Is been playing with the summer here. It gets where the concept of proportional. Vertical, set of proportionality, depends on both the mass.

02:04:54
Is.

02:05:02
Spend a regular momentum. Vector. Rich buyers push minorities around.

02:05:34
Space train a positive and a negative chart.

02:05:43
Is shaped in such a way that

02:05:56
That one. Particle forms and so imagine. If okay, so imagine if you're if the charges perfecticular, if charges are perpendicular. Okay? So, if you have two charges in their perpendicular to each other, right?

02:06:19
So they're each pushing space away from one another, right? So these things basically away from them. So, like so the particles if they're there facing each other, they're too positive orthopedic negatives. But if they're perpendicular, then that means that they are there in a space state because it's oscillation points are happening at different intervals.

02:07:00
And the result is that they're pushing space away from each other instead of towards each other, which is, which is why they are attracted to each other. Because they're, like, tooth is like, they're both pushing space away from each other and set of pushing each other. So either, so if if they're both negative, then they're both pushing space.

02:07:34
Along the same axis, which causes them to push it apart and if they're both positive, they're both pushing space all in the same access, which allows them to push each other apart. But if one is positive and when it's negative, then that's place today. So that means that the the charges are perpendicular to one another, in phase space.

02:07:59
And that means that they that's faceobok contract between the positive and negative charges because it's being. Okay, in. It's because of, okay. So you previously, argued that LTD is like a space state, right? And the space is, is going to

02:08:28
And his place. So this place date is the opposite of an oscillation and it means that there's the opposite of attraction happening. Okay, so the problem is that in this place they that you're describing in the brain.

02:08:51
Saying in the brain to oscillations of fire together are going to attract are going to cause some signals each other which is going to cause growth growth to happen. But because there but there are also, but that's also going to yeah, that's going to excite each. Each each one of them to grow towards each other.

02:09:22
Okay, but with LCD display state. And so, you're going to have the opposite where the field in between is coldest, and it's going to in everything is going to move towards the. Everything is going to grow towards the heat or it's going to grow towards the activity. The temple activity, personal growth towards the, the increasing temple opportunity surface area, increasing temples are surgery is the direction, the heat and growth and the energy shape of the alignment of the electromagnetic fields and of the electric field in the night and the magnetic field, I guess even maybe there maybe just the magnetic field.

02:10:17
I'm not sure guess I need to read more about the electric field. The difference between the conversions inquire. Yeah. The fact that there's an electric field there magnetic for other children. It's the measuring electrical measuring, the magnetic field, resulted in different.

02:10:39
Different things is interesting. I guess the magnetic field is a different frequency range compared to the electric field. Maybe has created here. Then mechanic works have even greater skip.

02:11:10
That's greater amplitude.

02:11:16
But in the case of the brain because of integrity, the

02:11:29
The place a doesn't create attraction. It creates dissonance it. Creates some basically. It's like when you try to combine electrons together and there and they because with this positive electron is reports each other, if you combine them into a space, then they're positive and negative charges, but they're there.

02:12:02
Spaces, D is becoming decent and so decoherents and decoherential. Space through decoherent. Oscillations is going to cause forgetting. It's going to cause rain to forget through an ideas. The decreases space time, cosmetic coherent oscillations. And so, in principle, decoherence is like a positive integrative native, charge and two. Decoherent signals are going to attract each other.

02:12:41
No, no, not a tractor. They're going to replace decoherence so they're going to repel each other, right? But because they're combined they're confined to the brain because of 10 segregation. There's going to be a coherence pattern between two neurons that are firing an opposite oscillations and that creates LTD but for electricity

02:13:13
Because it's just the the configuration space is different, electricity in space is not.

02:13:31
So just so accurate. Okay. So it's just the case that positive and negative charges are going to repel each other if depositing language. We just certainly threshold, right?

02:13:49
And this is the case.

02:13:54
I mean, I mean, if the positivity and negativity is going to relative positive, neurology negativity is displaced through sufficient degree just too much part, too much positive buildup and the dryer and

02:14:28
Always a

02:14:37
And there's too much negative outside this out.

02:15:08
So the energy is going to be electromagnetically pulled through the cell towards

02:15:23
The negative space created by the receptors.

02:15:41
So, I mean, so I'm going back to that idea, that the negative space

02:15:54
So there's negative space in the same absence, right? So maybe the positive charge relative to the negative space in the same as is causing the movement of the positive charge towards the towards the, the cleft.

02:16:28
Towards the exit terminal.

02:16:39
Too much positive charge and

02:16:47
So has so far too deeply, so

02:16:53
Is a magnetic moment where positive charge, otherwise about it, for some positive charge has a large enough signal. That it can have an interaction with the negative, charge is on the cell fires. Otherwise the salads is too negative to fire. I mean themselves displacement is out. The summer is too negative to fire.

02:17:28
So the summer has to have build upon the positive charge relative to the the accent terminal, participates the charges. And so it's the neurons charge dissipates, the charge built up because the positive charges are crushing each other apart and

02:18:13
But then they build up and then they have to be. Put they all like they're collective. Configuration has used enough threshold to force the act of force. The to push against the electromagnetic membrane to disrupt the, tensile of the neuron. So, the tense, I read threshold This range. And so this act of force is finally the combined force of all the positive charges enough to push them up to a lot of it to push the part.

02:18:52
So they flow towards the negative space. They dissipate essentially towards negative space and the. So in that innocence the positive, the positive charges are pushing each other, a part cards. More negative and they're gonna push each other apart but they're gonna move towards my negative space.

02:19:38
And more negative space.

02:19:48
So you've got the forces there but with the negatives space. Okay. So the negative spaces.

02:20:02
So the okay, so if the tuners are firing at the same time, they're gonna go towards each other. And if they're firing like in and a space, they called if they're firing, ultimately, then they're going to wire apart. Because the line between them when they're firing apart, is according to become a line of decoherence and the face field, and the lines between the part of the same time, are lines of coconuts.

02:20:44
Okay, these are coherent patterns and so decoherence patterns are lines between oscillators that are that are applying ultimately and

02:21:02
They are in a system that is bound together like integrity system or a bundle of oscillators you're going to cause decoherence among also. It is just and that's the basis of LTD, oscillators with the combo because of the line because of a decoherence line in and fixed space. And and oscillators will couple because of coherence line of basements.

02:21:38
Some things. So alternating oscillators will create decoherent assigns and facepace in which space is moving apart and a couple of oscillators will create conversions lines and phase space. Where space is moving together and converging. And so the convergence lines emanate from particles in, they magnify between particles, so they evident from planets and and they magnified a train planets, but they was a reverse is true.

02:22:34
Is that between the lines between planets? So, okay. So we're interesting is like some decorations, so the idea is

02:22:55
How like I'm not trying to imagine that there could be an instance of declarance in space.

02:23:06
Because you have two oscillators.

02:23:12
Sorry, I guess I'm arguing. That that negative space is attractive because negatives negative space. I mean, the space between positive and negative space is is collapsing.

02:23:37
Because it's growing towards because that's space is growing towards the oscillators and the oscillating lines between all stators and the deep, the the alternators the alternating oscillators are decoupling face, space between them because that face space is moving towards oscillators that are in the sink and it's moving away from oscillators that are that are decent.

02:24:32
But,

02:24:37
If a clump of space is the convergence of aligned oscillators.

02:24:49
I know it's a convergence of

02:25:17
It's the code. Here is the coherence of of space into.

02:25:28
Momentum into angular momentum like

02:25:46
Okay. So, what's interesting is that both songs?

02:25:57
That's so that the exchanger to identical part of the total menu concerning the chain of two identical particles, a total of many particle, wave function is anti-semitic performance and symmetric proboscis. This means that if the, this is from Wikipedia to spin and it's if space and spin coordinates of two, identical particles are energy.

02:26:25
Change. This means it's space and spread are to add to identical part of our energy and the total wave function changes. It's signed from pharmia that does not change for both onions. So okay, so photons can. So, for instance, photons produced by a laser or atoms and on both science and condensing.

02:26:50
So that is the any number of identical bows on. It's not occupied the same column. So,

02:27:16
As the two in front of the same state,

02:27:30
Just interesting. So it's like okay so it's almost like photons have this sort of like ability to combine oscillations temporarily which is why they're combining and the person and condensate and heating up space but

02:28:05
Formulas are not able to combine temporary but and unable to oscillate in. So and when, okay, so what I'm saying is that they're able to say both ones are able to can occupy the same quantum state, be able to oscillate together and time because

02:28:45
All right, but the

02:28:51
Electrons at the front. So, the Fermion's are like,

02:29:10
Decorate space and so they can't oscillate together.

02:29:45
As pleasant looks like at this. All right. So think of it as positive and negative charges sending alternate, alternating oscillatory signals through space. So,

02:30:05
If you have 10 secretary, then they're bound together and the heat of space between them. And so things grow between them, but

02:30:37
If they are declared and space time between them is decoherent. So they're so they're their oscillating. Ultimately, and that means that the energy of space can be between them is like the, you know, in the quantum levels of experiment. How there's stuff there are lines that particles move towards and there's life.

02:31:11
I just went away from. All right. So it's a clear space is like a black lines.

02:31:26
So,

02:31:33
So, the magnetic force of a single oscillator is going to disappear over distance, which means that the beam is basically, the beam of light is being fired is basically spreading out as as the is the, as energy space. Because space, but the throwing another oscillator is going to add energy in the system between the off layers and so the space heats up between them.

02:32:10
And so that's going to pull collect times through one other double space.

02:32:20
And it's gonna make the part of the. So it's almost like it's, it's all it's a sort of like the huh.

02:32:39
So so so I made the argument that display state would cause attraction between two articles in space because it's like positive and negatives because they're

02:32:59
Because the positive charge isn't in the brain, positive oscillations are

02:33:12
Heating up space, because there's more collisions, they're not moving apart because of 10 segregated, but they're heating and space because there's more collisions and that's why space is growing. Between them that the deeper patterns are cooling off, space, bigger, hair, patterns pattern of this place. Later cooling off. Space between them.

02:33:41
Stuff doesn't grow, but more than that stuff becomes a space because deep coherent. So stuff actually moves, is pushed apart, stuff is pushed apart between them, because the oscillations are they want. They also in in. So because it's like a positive with a negative sentence in that the the now these two points are targeted because of 10 segregated.

02:34:16
They can't move towards each other. It's really because that because I was arguing that the convergence of positive electrons in a confined space is an issue of then decor sharing each other because they can't go to the park because they're caught in the Canada part, right? And so the question is like okay, why is it my exercising back here?

02:34:53
Like a larger and one thing for the brain and one thing for? But I think it's like okay. So in a case of like a phosphones, they combined the way I'm imagining like oscillators couple and they're combining and arguing that they're combining in terms of time their oscillating in time which is increasing, which is increasingly

02:35:30
But the idea is that both songs can also stay together in time.

02:35:39
And that's why they can, that's why they can combine.

02:35:49
And create lasers. And so forth is a laser a space heating up because it's oscillating in time, but

02:36:06
Confirming arms, the pain.
