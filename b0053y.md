# 1. Summary

The main idea presented is that the brain interacts with the quantum phase field of space, effectively manipulating and detecting changes within this field. This quantum phase field acts as the "canvas of consciousness," shaped by the phases produced through neuronal action potentials. These phases influence the brain's perception by creating inner representations of learned patterns and bodily states.

The brain's signals are categorized into sensory and motor circuits, which traverse various neural pathways involving structures like the thalamus, neocortex, temporal lobes, and others. Sensory inputs from different modalities (vision, hearing, touch, taste) follow specific pathways, converging in regions such as the temporal-parietal junction to form integrated perceptions.

A key concept discussed is that neurons firing simultaneously, even if not initially connected, can form new synaptic connections—a principle summarized as "neurons that fire together wire together." This synaptic plasticity allows for the formation of patterns across different brain areas, representing various aspects of sensory experiences.

The phase field transmits signals across multiple domains: electric, magnetic, mechanical (sound waves), chemical, and thermal. These signals contribute to the brain's ability to create and perceive complex patterns within the phase field, essentially serving as its notepad for consciousness.

The discussion also delves into oscillatory dynamics, such as splay states—where oscillations alternate rather than synchronize. There is an attempt to relate these neural oscillations to quantum phenomena, like the uncertainty principle, and to larger cosmic patterns involving space-time, mass, energy, and entropy.

By drawing parallels between neuronal activity and cosmic events, the idea suggests that the interactions of positive and negative charges, the expansion and contraction of space-time, and the behavior of particles at both quantum and astronomical scales may be fundamentally connected to the brain's function and the emergence of consciousness.

So, the brain is manipulating the quantum phase field, the quantum field, the brain is manipulating the quantum field, because the phases produced by the action potentials are manipulating the phase field of space, and the brain is also detecting the changes in the phase field of space.
And so, the phase field becomes the canvas of consciousness, and the phase field itself is being shaped to become the rendering that the brain is perceiving, and the perception of this phase field is the inner representation of the patterns learned from the equation.
And the brain's, and the patterns learned from the brain's body of causation, that is its muscular structure, right? And its brain.
So, it's like, there is, the self, and the self-awareness is that, you know, some, you know, some, like half of your signals are like sensor signals, and the other half are motor signals.
And, like, you can divide the brain into basically two types of signals.
They're either sensor, uh, signal circuits, or they're motor signal circuits.
And, um, and, um, uh, and it's very interesting.
Um, and that there's, they, they both go, both kinds of circuits go everywhere.
Um, but it, it kind of means that, um, I mean, not, not exactly everywhere.
I mean, there's incoming, there's incoming sensory areas which go to the, the thalamus, uh, for most of them, and then some of them, uh, go to the, uh, the, the temporal lobes, uh, first, and then to the thalamus, um, and other brain areas.
Um, but the, um, like the, like the orbital frontal lobes, and the enterinal cortex, and the, and the hypothalamus, and, um, and the thalamus.
And, so, yeah, so there's basically, like, a lot of interesting neural circuit pathways.
But the incoming sensory pathways, like most of, the rest of them, like, you know, the eyes, the ears, um, uh, the,
I have to look into the tongue and touch.
Like, they all go from the sense organ to the thalamus first,
and then they go to the bottom of the neocortex,
and then they go up through columns in that part of the primary sensory cortex
that they correspond to, with, you know, touch and taste in the somatosensory cortex.
And envision going into the occipital lobes first, and then the parietal lobes,
which is where it starts to make a lot of connections with the inputs from the temporal parietals,
junction, as it is a place where a lot of inputs converge,
and then it includes the inputs from the ear to the,
that it go to the thalamus and then to the auditory cortex,
or I like to call it the audio cortex.
So, yeah, so, I mean, essentially, the brain is creating patterns in the phase field of space-time,
and that's what other neurons are detecting,
and that phase field then becomes the etching, or the brain's notepad, of consciousness,
because it's only transmitting phases.
It's transmitting phases, potentially, on an electric field, a magnetic field,
a mechanical field, like audio waves, right, or mechanical, or, or, and a chemical field,
because it's sending chemical waves, and, and also a, a thermal heat field, right,
because, because there is some, there is some thermal signaling that happens when, when a neuron's activity picks up.
Um, you have, um, all of these signals can, like, um, I mean, it's, it's a really interesting question,
like, imagine, imagine how, try, try to imagine how LTP happens, uh, in an instance where there's no,
where there are two neurons fire at the same time, and they're close, but they're not connected.
Like, somehow, a connection has to grow in between them, and they could be two,
they could be a thousand neurons apart, or, or, you know, they could be, um,
they could be, they could be billions of neurons apart, and still form a connection that didn't exist before,
because they both find the same, because they both started oscillating at the same, at the same time,
with a resonating oscillating, right, because they both fired in response to the same pattern.
They sort of represent, um, different aspects of the same pattern on different, different areas of the brain, like,
like, um, you might have part of a pattern represented by, by what you're holding,
and part of a pattern represented by what you're seeing, that, that is what you're holding,
and part of a pattern represented by the sound of what you're holding as you bang it on your knee, or something.
And, um, so you, you have basically the, the concept of the pattern, and the orientation of the pattern,
um, in each of these modalities that is being represented in, in each of these brain areas,
in all three brain areas, are, um, are firing together and wiring together, um, even if they're,
even if, like, their initial connections are random, they're now firing together and wiring together,
and neurons of fire, at the same time, across these vast distances, um, they, they start to form, um,
like, like, like, specific connections, like, eventually there's, there's a very specific connection that,
that, um, that, um, that, um, that forms, just because, because, because spines grow,
and, um, um, at the same time, when, when spines grow, um, they, they take, um, they take energy away from,
from, from, I mean, okay, so, this, this part is a little bit weird, because, I mean, I was,
I was saying that my main hypothesis is that, is that for, um,
for, a decouple, like, a decoupling, like, you could have, like, I'm, there's a difference
between a splay state and a decoupling, so a splay state is when there's, um, sort of, like,
uh, almost a perpendicular, perpendicular, uh, coupling, it's the way I think of it, it's kind of
weird, but, um, like, they're not, like, um, like, they're not firing at the same time,
but they're firing in alternate time, like, it's, there's, it'd be, like, um, there's the most
amount of distance between the start and the, and the end of the firing sequence as possible,
so, like, basically the way it works is, when one fires, um, about half, about halfway after,
about halfway after the time that it fired, that's when the next one fires, and then when it's about
halfway through, it's, it's firing, that's when the, the first one fires again, or, um,
yeah, it's, it's, like, the cycle, it's, like, a cycle, it's, like, they're, they're, instead of
being, um, aligned, they're, um, they're, like, they're, like, gears that are, um, aligned at being
misaligned, right, like, they're, like, almost at a cross shape in terms of their alignment,
like, they'll, like, one will fire, and then halfway through, before that one resets, the
halfway through, the, the time between the firing and the resetting, that, that halfway time is when
the next one fires, and so they each fire at each other's halfway time, that's the best way to say
it, yeah, they each fire at each other's halfway time, and that way they never fire at the same
time, but they're also, like, um, um, sort of, like, right in the middle, it's, um, yeah,
and so,
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, like, that, um, it's, like, they're, it's, like, positive
and negative orbiting each other, right?
I don't know.
Anyway, that's a splay state.
So a splay state is like the odd couple of oscillations.
It's an oscillation.
Oscillation, oscillation.
Yeah, that's weird.
Anyway.
But yeah, it's almost like you think about that,
the idea of a splay state,
and you think about it in terms of...
Let's see.
A splay state is basically,
yeah, this alternation between two oscillations
that is an alternation between two oscillations
instead of a synchronization.
But it's a synchronization by alternation.
And I think there is an alternation dynamic at play
between, I suspect that it's between...
Like, the reason we can either detect a particle's momentum
or its...
I mean, a particle's location or its velocity.
We can either detect a particle's location or its velocity,
but not both at the same time.
Right?
Something like that.
I need to look this up.
But I'm just saying, like,
well, maybe it's because it's oscillating
between having a location and a velocity.
Like, between a state...
So having a location would be like...
I don't know if that makes...
I don't know if that makes sense, though.
Because you're...
Because you're...
Because they...
Yeah, I'm not...
I'm...
Oh, that is the weak part.
That's the weak part.
Shit.
So when neurons fire together,
they're modifying the phase field of space.
When neurons fire at the same time,
the phase field of space is changing.
They...
The line that is directly connect...
directly between two neurons
that fire at the same time.
There's a line between them
where space is moving faster.
Because...
Basically, space-time is moving faster.
Because space-time is hotter between them
and the area between them.
Because they're both...
Because they're heating it from two sides.
And so the area directly between them
is...
Between two oscillators
is hotter
than the...
Than the area that's...
That is...
Not directly between two oscillators.
And the further you are...
Sort of like...
Okay, so if you draw a line between two oscillators
and then you go to the midpoint between two oscillators
and you draw a line that's perpendicular
going up or down...
Just...
It's a perpendicular line.
And...
So the idea is that...
The...
The further you are away from...
If you're on the line that is perpendicular
when it's going up and down...
The further you are on that line...
The greater the greater the greatest you are
away from...
The horizontal line...
That...
That...
Then...
Then the cooler you...
You are...
And...
And...
And it's kind of interesting because...
Because...
The...
Okay, so I mean...
It's...
It's almost...
It's almost like...
The phase field is going to have...
Um...
Cold spots...
That are...
That are defined...
As the...
Um...
As the...
Um...
The...
The...
Boundaries of...
Uh...
The...
The...
Um...
The bubbles of...
In between hot spots.
Right?
It's almost like this...
Um...
It's almost like a checker pattern.
Right?
See, we're hot...
We're hot spots linked together...
And in between the hot spots are dark spots.
And in between the dark spots are hot spots.
So it's like a checker pattern.
The phase field of the brain is like a checker pattern.
In a sense.
With dark spots and cold spots.
But...
Um...
But...
The...
What happens is that...
Um...
Oscillators...
An oscillating sensor...
Or...
Transmitter array...
Which is like a...
A column...
Which is like a...
Which is like...
I'm sorry...
It's like a row...
It's like a layer inside a column.
That sensor array is going to...
Um...
Formulate a pattern that consists of neurons that fire that also inhibited other neurons.
And that carves the pattern out of the tonic firing rate.
So normally the oscillators all fire tonically until they're disturbed phasically, which causes
some of them to become inhibited.
In any case, it creates...
The whole array becomes a pattern that is perceived by the next array.
Um...
Which receives the changes in the phase pattern that are created by the first array.
And then the next array basically has a, um...
Learns a, um...
A magnified, uh...
Perspective.
That is...
Um...
It's...
It's like...
Um...
It...
Is learning a picture rendered by the first layer.
It's learning a pattern.
It's learning...
Like every neuron is learning a pattern based on, uh, uh, uh, which, uh, based upon it's,
it's, um, it's, it's, uh, correlation, firing correlations with other neurons.
So every neuron is learning a firing pattern because it recognizes the, the, the five different
waves from other neurons that fire.
So when they're on fire, it transmits a mechanical wave, um, a chemical wave, a wave in terms
of the disturbance in the electric field, a wave in terms, in terms of the disturbance
of the magnetic field, and a wave in terms of heat.
And all five of those waves are traveling, uh, across the brain, heating up space, um, but
also, um, they are speeding up spacetime.
Because heating up space is the same as speeding up spacetime.
And, um, so the, um, but then some of, uh, spacetime is also slowed down because it's
inhibited.
And so its frequency is slower, but it's, but at the same time, its amplitude is higher.
So it's inhibited, inhibited, but it takes up a lot of space.
A much larger amount of space than the, than the faster spacetime.
And so it's like, um, space has, um, different configurations.
Either it's very spread out in high amplitude, which is, um, like the space in between galaxies.
Or it's very compressed and crunched together, which is the, um, which is what's, um, the, which is the space inside galaxies.
So the space outside galaxies is very, um, very expanded out, outwards, like a balloon.
It's like, it pushes itself apart.
And the part that's pushing it apart is the sort of, like, horizontal, these are the horizontal triangles that fit inside the, the, the, um, basically the lines between spheres.
So let's say you have three spheres, right, that represent the sun, the moon, and the earth.
And there's, there's a, there's always a triangular line.
In each interval of time, there's always a triangular line between the three of them.
Okay?
And that triangle line is hotter than the rest of space.
It's basically, like, the direct line between the earth, the moon, the center of the earth, the center of the moon, and the center of the sun.
And, um, those lines, the direct lines between every planet, those lines in space are hotter than the rest of space-time.
Right?
So the line between the earth and the moon is hotter than the rest of space-time.
And also time moves faster in between the earth and the moon.
Then it does in, in, um, if you draw, if you draw, if you find the midpoint between the earth and the moon, and you draw a straight line between, if you draw a straight line from the center of the earth to the center of the moon,
and you find the midpoint between the earth and the moon, and you draw a perpendicular line, okay, and the further you go out, uh, along, um, the, that line, away from, the perpendicular line, away from the line that goes in between earth and the moon,
uh, the cooler spaces, until, um, that line is, is between, uh, the, the earth and the sun.
So, um, so in a sense, the earth is, and the sun attract, attract each other's heat.
They, um, yeah, they attract each other's heat.
And they heat up space around them, around each other.
And the space between them is hotter than the space that is, is not directly between them.
So, the whole, the space that is, like, um, but it's, like, it's, like, there's a radius, right?
There's a radius of effect, which is, like, if you take the center of the earth and the center of the sun,
and you draw parallel lines that intersect the sun and the earth at the same time, but the lines have to be parallel.
And they have to go through the center of the sun and the center of, of the earth, see?
So, just, you just have parallel lines, right?
And the idea is that, um, let's see if I can, look at this.
Um.
And the idea is that the, um, why did I, why did I bring this up again?
So, you have, um, the idea is that the, the diameter of the earth and the diameter of the sun, um.
I'm just thinking about the radius of the gravitational effect.
Obviously, the sun and the earth are close enough to each other to, that they're locked in orbit with each other.
Um.
Which is why we're alive.
Right?
If they were not locked in orbit with each other, then we wouldn't be talking.
Of course.
Um.
In space, everything remembers.
Because an oscillator encodes the memory with a change in its spin.
Like, if the, if, um, if an electron's spin changes, that change is, um, is a pattern that changes in space.
And so, space-time itself can change, uh, can store memories as changes in spin.
Um.
Or changes in, in phase.
Like, if an electron, if electrons, uh, and a positron combine with a common neutron.
Right?
It's, there, there's a new phase happening.
And.
Right?
So, so those are particles that condensed spatially.
Um.
But expanded temporally.
Right?
And so, I'm thinking that there's an inversion between expanding temporally.
And, and expanding spatially.
Right?
So, that means that planets, our space, it has expanded, um, spatially.
But space, it is a space-time that has expanded temporally.
No, no, no.
I did it backwards.
Space is space that has expanded, um, uh, horizontally.
And, um, uh, planets are a space that has expanded vertically.
Right?
So, the idea is that the, um, the planet represents an, an os- and, uh, a group of oscillations that
have become merged together.
And they're slowing space down.
And that, and the slowing of space-time, of space-time relative to the expansion of space
means that their configuration is that space is dense and, and material.
Right?
And by implication, then, the opposite of dense and, of dense material is, is, um, is, is sparse
energy.
Like, space-time is, like, sparse energy.
Um.
Yeah.
And so, space-time is either dense material or sparse energy.
And so, so, so light and photons and electrons and the entire electromagnetic spectrum, um,
at the particles level, at just individual particle levels that are not oscillating in atoms.
They're just particles.
Like, that, that part of space-time, just, that, it just keeps, that expands.
Um, and it expands relative to, because it's slower.
So, it's, it's expanding in, in dimensions, in the dimensions of space, that represent, um,
the inversion of the expansion into space-time.
Like, space represents slowed-down space-time.
Because it's, like, um, it's, like, the mass of energy.
No, it's, like, the volume of energy.
The volume of energy is really voluminous.
It's, it's, it's, it's a huge volume.
The volume of energy is this, um, vast distance that's inverted to the speed of, of mass.
The volume of energy, the volume of energy, the volume of energy is inverted to the speed of mass.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does, because, I, because what I'm saying is, like, the idea of mass is, like, the idea of mass is, um, much more slower in frequency.
So, the volume of energy is inverted to the speed of mass.
The slowness of mass is inverted to, ah, this, that, mmm, volume of energy is inverted to the slowness of mass.
The volume of energy is, um, the volume of mass is the, um, is the, um, is the contraction of energy.
The volume of mass is the contraction of energy, the contraction of space-time, into an oscillatory configuration.
It's like oscillations eating other oscillations.
So, the volume of space-time is, uh, is, uh, time.
So, I mean, it's like, okay, so it's like, no, it's, it's that, it, okay, so the idea is that, um, it's a convergence of space-time.
So, it's like space-time that is, um, but, okay, but think of it as, like, it's like, there's an inversion of, there's an exact amount of matter and antimatter, right?
It's like, there's an exact, there's an exact amount of, um, mass, uh, like, think of mass as, like, muscle, and think of, of, um, of space as, like, fat, right?
So, muscle has three times the, um, the density of fat.
Like, so a pound of muscle is one-third the size of a pound of fat, because it's more dense, right?
So, because, so, basically, it's just, it's just, like, saying that planets are dense points in space.
But the dense points in space are the hot points.
And so, they're hot and dense, hot and dense.
And the hot, the heat and the density, and, uh, excites, the heat and the density correlates with excitation in the, in the electric, in the electromagnetic fields.
And in the phase, the phase fields of space-time, right?
So, the phase fields of space-time, uh, magnetism and, uh, electricity and chemicals and heat, um, and vibrations or sound waves.
Like, like, all of those are, in essence, um, sort of, okay, and the density excites the heat, and the density correlates with excitation.
Oh, yeah, so, right, so, right, the density of the planets excites and heats space, but, um, the density means that space is moving really fast.
It's the same as, like, a beam.
So, like, a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, right?
Like, but if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator, but they don't have to go anywhere.
In fact, um, they're going to, they're going to, um, there's going to be situations where you have oscillators that essentially, like, attract, um, oscillators.
Um, there's, um, it's weird to think that oscillators could be 50% of space.
That's weird.
I don't, I don't know if that makes sense.
Um, because the idea is that space oscillates at one point, and then you have increasing extropy and increasing entropy at the same time.
Um, and the, and so the idea was that space-time, uh, goes from a state of maximum, uh, extropy to towards maximum entropy.
But that doesn't really make any sense, right?
At the beginning of space-time, why would there be a lot of order?
But, I mean, I guess the idea is, like, yeah, so, like, space-time was undifferentiated,
and so I guess that, in a sense, that's, like, um, that's very orderly.
Like, if there's only one oscillation, that's very orderly.
That's very orderly if there's only one oscillation.
And so, like, increasing entropy is, like, it's, like, space becomes, um, increasingly disorderly.
And so the idea is, like, if everything's disorderly, that means that, like, instead of there being, like, a single pattern that defines all space-time,
then space-time becomes divided by patterns, um, that maximally oscillate randomly, right?
And if you have a situation that's maximally oscillating randomly at the Planck scale to, um,
I don't know, whatever the, the, that's the weird thing.
It's, like, okay, well, if there's a Planck scale, right, if there's a minimum distance that particles have to jump through,
um, and so space is like a honeycomb, right?
If there's a minimum distance in space is like a honeycomb, particles have to jump,
because they can't go shorter than the Planck scale.
Um, it's just, it's just weird, right?
Particles can't occupy the same space, right?
That's what, that was the understanding.
But you have situations where, um, they call them, you know, positive, uh, positrons and electrons,
and, and when they, they're, the pot, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron,
and, um, when they combine, they become a neutron.
So the phase, so two particles, that represent, that represent, um,
opposites, opposite charges, of the same, um, phase, same frequency,
same frequency but opposite charges, right?
Positive space and negative space.
And when they combine, they become a neutron.
How does that make sense?
Because it's like you have two, two particles that combine,
and they, and they enter a different phase state.
So they become a different particle.
The brain is making changes to the phase field, um,
but it's collectively sensing the changes to the phase field.
Because oscillations that oscillate together, um,
uh, have a, uh,
they act as a, as an amplified array.
Like, they sense together.
Like, anything that disturbs one of them, disturbs all of them.
And so they, they form a, they can hear each other, in a sense.
And they have this tonic expectation of firing.
And so whenever firing is inhibited or excited around them,
they notice, they notice it, they physically notice it.
And the array physically tracks, uh, patterns,
um, through, um, through reactions that ricochets through all the oscillators in the array.
And, um, but they act as a single array.
So they all become aware of whatever ripples them.
They all react to whatever ripples them.
They are, um,
they're a combined oscillator.
So they have a combined effect.
And
I think
that they're moving
that they're, um,
that they're ought to be there.
They're essentially orbiting each other.
And that's, that is, um,
causing space to expand in time.
And
it's causing,
um,
that's, sorry, that's,
that's causing, um,
contracted space to expand in time.
But it's causing
energy to expand in volume.
in,
in a relationship with,
it's causing the,
the expansion of
the volume of energy,
which is the space around,
so the energy,
so space is energy.
So the volume of,
of energy
around a mass
is relative to that mass.
But essentially,
the volume is like,
if space is a single sheet,
right?
then, um,
imagine that a mass
is crunching space up.
And
the effect,
in effect,
that could look like,
um,
if you pushed on a sheet
really hard,
right?
And you have,
basically, um,
um,
but if you push on a sheet
between two different spheres,
between two different oscillators,
right?
Then,
then,
the,
the line between them
is relatively
more sunken
than the lines
that are not
between them.
Right?
And that's,
so that's the idea,
uh,
that,
um,
um,
oscillators
warp space
because they
heat space
because they are
faster,
because they're
hotter space,
they're faster
relative
to slow space.
And that means
that slow space,
um,
needs to
travel
a long time
before it
completes an interval.
Right?
So fast space,
because it's crunched together,
let's say it's spaces,
let's say every,
every point in space
is constantly going
back and forth,
back and forth,
right?
Like,
just constantly
moving,
every point in space
is constantly moving,
that's phase space,
right?
And,
um,
that essentially,
um,
when you have
contracted space
in,
in a dense mass
contracted space,
it's like things are,
um,
uh,
it's a lot of,
uh,
movement that is
ricocheting,
a lot of,
basically,
like,
a lot of collisions
are happening.
Right?
A lot of collisions
are happening
really fast.
And that's part of why
space is heating up.
There.
There's a two,
there's a two part,
there's a two,
there's a two,
there's a two ways
to describe the same thing.
Space is heating up
and it's heating up
and it's colliding a lot.
Those are,
those are the same thing.
Right?
So,
it's heating up
and it's colliding a lot.
and,
um,
inside mass.
And the collisions,
though,
but the collisions are,
um,
they're causing heat.
But heat is causing,
is like,
um,
time that's moving faster.
faster.
And so,
the time that moves
more slowly,
right,
has to,
is,
time that moves more slowly
is literally time
that's traveling
a longer,
uh,
distance.
so the further away
time is from
spheres
and from the lines
between spheres.
Um,
I mean,
the,
the further that,
uh,
the point in space is,
uh,
that is,
um,
between,
um,
um,
oscillators
and the points,
and,
and,
oh,
the furthest point away
from the lines
between oscillators.
um,
that point is going to
be the slowest
and that means
that space
is relatively expanded.
Um,
because time is moving
more slowly.
And,
and the,
and the time interval
between a particle
moving from,
uh,
from,
uh,
one state
to another
is
sort of
the time interval
of particles
moving from
one state
to another.
time interval
of particles
moving from
one state
to another.
Time interval
of particles
moving from
one state
to another
Um, well, I'm just trying to like think of what is it, what is really, really, really
um, right, because you're like, okay, so a particle is a frequency, which is, and the frequency
is like, um, it's like, uh, frequency and distance, right, so space and time are frequency and
distance, oh shit, space and time are frequency and distance, um, so essentially what I'm saying
is like, um, the distance is, um, a space frequency, distance is a space frequency, shit, right,
it's a frequency in, in, in which, um, space is more slow, and slowness is distance, and it's
cold, but, um, but where space is more dense, it's hot, and it's, um, it's, it's not, it
could be hot or cold, so let's say space is, um, maybe space is neutral, right, space is
neutral distance, but, um, but density is hot or cold, it's, uh, let's say it's, um, thermally,
uh, chaotic, right, density is thermally chaotic because, um, it's, uh, it's moving faster in
time, and so, um, but it, but overall it's hotter, overall it's hotter, so overall, um, entropy
is, uh, is, uh, I guess happening faster around, um, mass, and so, um, entropy is, like, the
dissipation of mass into energy, and, um, which is, like, so, um, dissipation, entropy,
does that make sense?
Into this energy, and so, the universe is either mass or, or, or energy, but the universe is
really, like, either mass or frequency, or the universe is either, um, distance or frequency,
or the universe is either, um, amplitude or frequency, like, distance and amplitude, right,
so it's, like, either there's a lot in space, or there's a lot in time, and so the warping
of space-time is, like, um, when there's a lot in space, time is moving more slowly, and
when there's a lot in time, space is more crunched, and so space-time is, I guess, magnetically polarized,
right, like, positives, uh, attract, I guess, right, um, right, is that right?
Okay, so it seems I've overlooked something, so the idea is that, um, the, um, if the oscillation
is increasing in energy, then it's going to, then it's going to have a positive electric
electric field, which means it's going to, um, it's going to have a gravitational effect, that, um,
attracts a, another sphere that has a, um, a negative electromagnetic field.
So, that's interesting, so, but that's interesting because it's kind of like, like, so what if, um,
what if, uh, because either, in both scenarios, you still have the same sort of vertical lines,
so you could have, um, so Earth could have a positive, but, so Earth, so what I'm saying,
it's like, so, shit, because here's the thing, if Earth has a negative electromagnetic field,
throughout the radio.
Um.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um.
Um.
I guess there could be an orbit either way, right?
And the Earth is going to have like, its negative field is going to have both positive and negative, right?
It's going to have the positive, the North Pole is going to be positive and the South Pole is going to be negative, right?
Like a dipole, like a giant dipole or quadrupole or whatever.
The top is going to be positive and the bottom is going to be negative.
It's like a magnet.
Right?
Um, and then, um...
...
...
...
...
Thank you.
Thank you.
The first property is the same charges objects repel and opposite charges attract.
It seems that two positive charges and two negative charges will repel each other.
So what if a negative charge is like in a perpendicular phase?
What if a negative charge is in a splice state relative to a positive charge?
Right?
Or is it positive charges?
Okay, so here's the thing.
So, um...
Positive and negative, because the idea of attraction is...
Okay, so that's...
Okay.
So, why do positive and negative attract?
Right, because they're, they're, um...
Right, because they're, um...
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
So there was something to do with pool tables, let's write this down, where if two objects
collide, they were on different trajectories.
And they collide.
It's like, okay, well now, how do they move after the collision?
What happened next?
Shit.
Alright, so what if we consider a positive or negative charge as the...
Like a positive charge would be...
Like the sun would be positive because it is at the point where it's still releasing more energy to the surrounding environment.
It's releasing a lot of energy to the surrounding environment.
Now, so the planets, let's say they're all in an advanced stage of cooling.
They're all a lot cooler than the sun.
Right?
There's not as much energy being released.
In fact, one can imagine that when the planets have lost sufficient energy that they become...
They're basically decaying.
They're basically becoming negative because they're decaying.
Their oscillations are decaying as opposed to their oscillations are increasing relative to the observer.
Their oscillations are increasing or decaying.
So it's like a negative...
So a negative charge is like a decreasing oscillation and a positive charge is like an increasing oscillation.
It's releasing more energy because more energy is being put into it.
The sun is more positive.
Right?
And Earth is more negative than the sun.
It's not as hot.
So it's relatively positive and relatively negative.
And the interesting thing is...
So you were saying that the space is warped between stars for example.
It's warped between galaxies.
It's warped between planets.
It's warped between any oscillator.
Right?
Whether that oscillator is positive or negative.
The space is warped between them.
So there's heat between them.
Even if one's positive and one's negative.
Or even if they're both positive.
I mean...
In a sense...
Interesting.
Okay.
Now wait a second though.
So...
Let's say positive and negatives...
Um...
Are...
Like...
Decaying or increasing oscillators.
Right?
Right?
And...
That means that...
So...
Okay.
So each oscillator is expanding space.
Right?
Are...
Like...
Decaying or increasing oscillators.
Right?
And...
That means that...
So...
Okay.
So each oscillator is expanding space.
Causing space time to expand.
Each oscillator is a contraction of space that is causing space time.
Or...
Or...
Yeah.
Because...
It's...
It's causing space time to iterate where it's hotter.
Faster.
Um...
It's causing space time to...
It's putting a drag on space time.
So it's causing space time to...
Um...
Um...
It's causing space time to...
It's causing space time to...
Um...
It's causing space time to...
Um...
It's causing space time to...
Um...
Be faster.
Closer to...
Um...
Um...
Be faster.
Closer to...
The center of...
The...
Oscillator.
And...
Slow down further away from the center of the oscillator.
So...
The curvature of space time...
Starts from the...
The center of any oscillator.
And...
The...
The mass of the oscillator...
The combined oscillator...
Um...
Um...
Warps space time around the oscillator.
So it creates space time around the oscillator.
But...
Okay, so...
But in a sense what I'm saying is that it creates, um...
A...
Uh...
Um...
A...
A...
It creates, um...
A...
Uh...
A-
It creates, um...
The...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
It creates, um...
The...
The...
The temporal...
A temporal...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
A temporal surface area needs that, um...
that particles that are moving in random directions will be more likely to move towards a temporal surface area
because it's additional directions relative to the rest of the directions.
So a hot area of space has additional paths along a temporal dimension relative to slower moving space.
And so you have space-time as the expansion of time because of oscillations.
The expansion of time because of oscillations causes the relative appearance of the expansion of space
as a direct consequence of the total equilibrium of positive and negative charges in the universe.
So that if you have a certain amount of space that's positively charged, you have to have a certain amount of space that's negatively charged.
And so if you have space contracting in order to be mass-like, then a greater amount of area has to exist for space that's not contracted, relatively speaking.
And so the relative appearance of expanded space from contracted space is what gives rise to the curvature of space-time, but also the dimensions of space-time.
The positive and negative charges are like oscillations that are increasing or decreasing.
Is essentially possible, but a decreasing orbit, let's see.
Let's say that it's increasing or decreasing, because I'm trying to think of a good reason why two negative oscillations might have either taken place.
two negative oscillations might repel each other, right?
Because
it doesn't make total sense. It doesn't make sense at all. So it's like, okay, so if
if two negatives formed a sort of splice that
if a negative or positive were opposite oscillations, right? Why are you saying that? Because you're trying to think of like
you're trying to see if you can somehow describe the attraction of opposite particles
in electromagnetism in terms of planetary, in terms of the movement of planetary bodies. And I think that is just
it's too much of a stretch, the idea of positive and negative oscillations, right?
Oscillations are increasing.
That sounds good, right? Oscillation is, is there's more energy moving into the oscillation or more energy being released from the oscillation,
then it's going to have a positive
electromagnetic field.
Which means it's going to be sending,
it's going to be causing the electric lanes to be
um,
sending out
the collisions,
the oscillatory collisions of space will still be along vertical lines
in both positive and negative spheres.
Both of them will be expanding space
regardless of whether or not they're positive or negative.
Okay, well there are, so if you think about it, the planets do collide, right?
So there are situations when two planets collide.
And there are situations when planets orbit.
So maybe the phase?
Maybe, so, so phase is also going to be like, um, velocity and, um,
of planetary bodies.
Maybe, so, so phase is also going to be like, um, velocity and, um,
of planetary bodies through space, right?
So maybe, so, so phase is also going to be like, um, velocity and, um,
Velocity and of planetary bodies through space, right?
So...
They're not moving directly toward each other. The path where they keep missing each other is sort of like the configuration space.
And...so maybe they're repelling?
So maybe planets are positive and they're repelling?
Does that make sense?
No.
The idea that they're falling toward each other makes sense.
And that they're warping space between each other.
Because they're warping space between each other but their velocity is greater than their attraction to each other.
Right, the velocity is greater. And they're not on a collision course because...
Because the amount of pull that they have on each other is actually weak.
So they're just...
Slightly altering each other's paths.
Right?
They're, um...
They're in an auditory pattern.
That is, um...
The Earth and Moon are synchronized.
In terms of the Moon doesn't...
Is...
The Moon's, uh...
Rotations is...
Is, um...
Aligned so that a certain side of the Moon is always facing Earth.
Right?
It's the kind of synchronization.
But, okay, but here's the thing.
Is that, um...
So the...
The Earth is gonna have a positive and negative, uh, dipole.
Right?
Positive North Pole.
Like a battery.
Right?
I think.
I mean, maybe I need to look this up.
Okay.
So...
Think about the...
The rate of the spin as something that is accelerating the...
Um...
The distortion of space.
Right?
So the idea is that...
Um...
Something like the Earth is emitting...
Both positive and negative vertical lines.
Um...
That's weird.
Yeah, so I guess it would have positive lines from one side and negative lines from another side.
Let me see if I can...
If that makes sense.
Right?
Because that would mean that...
So objects that have both positive and negative charges are neutral.
So...
Earth...
Earth...
The Earth...
Would be...
As a planet would be neutral.
So planets would be neutral towards each other because they have both positive and negative charges.
Right?
Right?
So positive and negative split apart.
And started...
Um...
And...
When they went...
When they went...
And when it went to collide...
Again...
It's like split apart.
When it was to collide again...
When it was to collide again...
When it was to collide again...
When it was to collide again...
When it was to collide again...
What happens is that...
Um...
Two positive charges...
Or two negative charges...
Um...
Pushed each other apart.
Right?
And space expanded...
At that point.
At the moment when that space expanded...
Because two positive charges collided...
Or two negative charges collided...
And pushed each other apart.
Like these don't collide together.
Right?
These don't collide together.
Right?
These don't collide together.
Then what happened was...
The...
Um...
At the same time...
Somewhere else...
Uh...
A positive and a negative charge...
Um...
That...
Didn't belong to...
To one another one.
Combined.
Right?
But they combined...
They're...
They're...
They combined...
But because they were...
Of different phases.
Right?
They...
Oscillated.
So...
It's like...
A positive and a negative...
Of different phases...
Combined.
And because they're...
They're not compatible...
They can't couple.
So they oscillate each other.
So they attract each other.
Because oscillators attract each other.
But because one's positive...
And one's negative...
They...
Um...
They're out of phase...
And they can't combine.
But the resulting activity...
Of them...
Wrapping around each other...
Because they're attracted to each other...
Is the...
Is the densification of space.
And the fact that there's now...
Positive charges elsewhere...
That are pushing each other apart...
That...
Is the...
Is the densification of space.
And the fact that there's now...
Positive charges elsewhere...
That are pushing each other apart.
That is dark matter.
That's like, space is pushing itself apart because two positive charges almost collided and then they bounced off each other.
They pushed, they were flying apart. There's a lot of horizontal movement.
So space is expanding.
But the expansion is the reaction of two positive or two light charges.
And the contraction is the orbiting of incompatible positive and negative charges.
So they're orbiting instead of combining.
All you need to combine is the two particles, like a positron and an electron.
Because they're the same phase, they can combine.
Being the same phase means that they are firing at the same time.
And because they're firing in oscillation together, they are attracted to each other.
But if two particles are not firing at the same time, they're not in phase together.
Which means that they fly towards each other, but never directly at each other.
And so they orbit each other.
And, um...
Holy shit.
I figured it out.
So that's why we have negative electrons orbiting positive neutrons.
Right?
Is these...
Is these...
There's...
Oscillators, like, absorb each other.
But they can't fully absorb each other if they're not in the same phase state.
And, um...
And they can't attract each other unless they're, um...
But a neutron has both a positive and a negative, right?
A neutron is both a positive and a negative electron.
So...
So...
Is it considered...
Yeah, it's neutral.
Right?
Um...
But, in essence, um...
Um...
Neutrons are far larger, so...
Um...
Let's say that when the positron and the electron combined, that space...
Became lower frequency.
frequency, and mass increased, right, because of the inversion of frequency and amplitude.
So mass is the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
Mass is the amplitude that's inverted to the frequency of energy.
Because mass is energy moving out much slower than masses.
So mass is the energy, or density is energy,
or the frequency of density is the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
So a planet that rotates is alternately flashing positive and negative charges in the magnetic field.
So it's alternately attracting and repelling in a sense.
So that would be like...
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
So thank you.
I'm just, I'm just trying to picture it, I'm trying to picture it, as the planet orbits.
Oh, wait a second, so the rotation of the planet though, isn't that like, the, isn't the dipole
positive going to be at the north pole, right?
So like the spin of the earth is, is along the axis of the positive and negative poles,
right?
So you can also see the positive and negative as, you can see the negative as, um, attractors
of a single oscillation, because the positive charge flows into the negative charge, right?
So the positives are going to be more attracted to negatives, because they are repellent,
they are pushing out energy and the negatives are pulling in energy.
And two negative charges are, um, why would two negative charges repel each other?
The pressure cams out to not settle down and then if people get distracted, if people
take charge of desires to souther than unless they are running fast, who are still
in a directionooo.
And then if people keep in mind that they can uh, how they may prove theacer right?
So there is no doubt about tree in blood, if people get to follow the crochets that make
their face um, where the power of S kruss, who get to cover it?
And the pressure of anything they can be
