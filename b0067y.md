LTD Neurons Signals Pattern

00:00

The one thing that I want to note that I am taking away from the discussion of how firefly SYNC in in the book SYNC by Steven Strogatz. I guess there's different ways of fireflies can can SYNC and different species that can sink where they all fire in a sequence right after it one another. (Isn't it true that all species that flock together or swim together or work together are synchronizing in a valid sense? Yes I think so. Yes I SYNC so!)

00:26

But then they're all silent for a period of of time. It looks like synchronous firing or firing one after another (in rapid succession, like tiny variations between Alpha Brainwave wave patterns for example) and I'm kind of making the argument that this amplifies the receptive field of the organism or creates an inceptive field that includes all the parts of the organism to alert the entire organization because they have a synchronized sensor/transmitter system (cells: neurons & glia).

01:11

They're all going to notice faster (statement applies to fireflies and or to neurons and or to flocks of birds). When one of them falls out of sync, like that would cause a change to the regularity of the entire pattern, like something that would normally that would cause a rippling basically. Yeah. Yeah. Like a rippling pattern because the syncs are based upon thresholds being reached on a regular basis.

01:54

And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.

# "How the hippocampus orchestrates memory consolidation"
A team led by Thomas McHugh of the RIKEN Center for Brain Science has been interested in how another hippocampal region, CA2, contributes to sharp-wave ripple activity in CA1. CA2 is thought to be mainly involved in forming memories related to social interactions. "However, some data—including from our lab—suggests that CA2's role extends to other domains of memory," says McHugh.
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-hippocampus-orchestrates-memory.html

The Sharp wave ripples, or what I call Phasic bursts I first learned about in Peter Tse's book
# "The Neural Basis of Freewill Criterial Causation"
Peter Tse, known for his work at Dartmouth University, discusses the interplay between tonic firing and phasic firing. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neural-basis-free-will

Compare that to the link above about how the Hippocampus orchestrates memory consolidation with sharp wave ripples, that I argue represent high phasic bursts, that inhibit local neurons, creating inhibitory waves that magnify the memory that neuron represents via it's connections, and then put that idea into a container and compare it to Jeff Hawkin's description of the neo cortex being self similar everywhere, and the description of the hippocampus as like a special cortical column and you can extrapolate the idea that high speed phasic bursts in the hippocampus between layers CA2 & CA1 are happening also in the neocortex, and everywhere in the brain.

02:37
You can also think of the oscillating group of neurons as sort of like allowing the emergence of higher level receptive (dendrite)/inceptive field (exit terminal), that is like a shared computation. It allows it allows the bugs to basically have collective mind that is not really a mind, so much as it's a collective sensor that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so, each of them can help create this sort of collective sensor.

03:22

And so they're so. So, the weird thing is that it's not actually just living animals that can do this, like sync happens with that with dead things, with things that are not organic, right? Things that are just dead, right? But essentially, you could have robots that can send signals to each other to reach a threshold that they dissipate to other robots or send other robots, but in increasingly smaller amounts, like it (a node: neuron or bug or animal) gets a signal, it absorbs some of it,

04:06

and then it sends some of it onward, or it's stopped from sending a normal signal.
So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.

04:34

So any disruption is a phase change (triggered by a) coincidence pattern. Any of the fireflies in a group of fireflies they're all going to notice when any of their phases are disrupted. Each of each of them effectively

05:03

fires at a slightly different interval than they were firing before. And that phase signal difference is going to cause a change (in the physical substrated of the entity) in the artificial structure or in the (natural structure) of the organism of the (firefly or neuron). This process could also happen to a machine that is made of dead parts.

05:42

That's the key distinction: The reason that machines can be conscious is that the the nature of the oscillation is taking a bunch of separate parts but allowing them to affect one another like a bunch of tuning forks or a bunch of drums that can that when you hit one drum, all the other star vibrating, right?

06:21

And so what you have normally is like they're all sort of like (oscillating) like one of them will hit and then and then all sort of like react to that one that got hit, right? There's this reaction that happens in the brain. What happens is one gets hit.

06:40

There's this attention schema where if one gets hit that inhibits a lot of the others in its own array, focusing the brain on the memory that was hit (In this case by "hit" I am referring to the neuron action potential event), that inhibits a lot of others in his own array, then it's probably sending excitatory signals to another array. (In the audio I said gustatory cortex, I was probably thinking about the olfactory cortex or the Piriform Cortex, but the point is that something in a subsequent array gets excited, while things in the first array are inhibited)

07:19

So I would imagine that when a signal goes from the olfactory bulb to the

07:36

temporal lobe that signal is going to be like it's gonna be an exciting signal, right? (Forgive the anatomical description that might be incorrect, this was meant to be an example of how neurons in the first layer around the neuron that fired might be inhibited and then a subsequent layer or array of neurons would be excited.) What might happen is that one of the neurons in Layer 1 of the Temporal Lobe (T1?)

08:11

Imagine the first layer of cells, they're all going to be sent an excitatory pattern that bumps, all of them up a little bit (meaning their receptors are flooded with sodium ions, and they all move closer to a firing threshold), but one of them fires first reaching its threshold before the others, and then it sends out an inhibitory signal to all of the other ones that were also receiving an the excitatory bump, inhibiting it's fellow neurons in the same array or layer.

08:38

The neurons that get inhibited are the same ones in that first layer (or that first array if the array is not confined to a layer spatially). The array that fired is going to pass excitatory signals into a couple of different directions. It's gonna pass signals to the thalamus and signals will be sent towards the pyramidal cells in the upper layers. Signals go to and from the thalamus to all the regions of the brain, such as towards the orbital frontal lobes, but there are also signals that go from the temporal lobes directly to the orbital frontal lobes. Of course there is also the thalamus hippocampus entorhinal loop, and as my hypothesis states elsewhere the signals of evoked memories & memory predictions are going to ripple all over the brain, like waves from rocks dropped in a pond.

Perhaps we might imagine how the waves in a pond have both inhibitory & excitatory effects as part of their rippingly patterns, meaning you will get rows of excited neurons firing interspaced with rows of inhibited neurons. So the inhibition & excitation in the brain might alternate like waves in a pond, up and down. That sounds right.

09:10

There's multiple paths that brain signals travel in, so there's like a circuit being created, where the information is divided up, one part of the information (from the Olfactory bulb) goes to the thalamus, then to the Piriform Cortex & The orbital frontal lobes then the Prefrontal cortex (not sure if this is correct), and then the other 4/5ths of the Olfactory skip a direct path to the thalamus and go goes directly to the neo cortex (Piriform or Orbital Frontal lobes not sure of the exact paths at this moment.)

09:38

And so that situation is one where

09:47

you have you have signals that went through the thalamus, which may modulate the signals (or pass signals through itself without modulating them). The thalamus is not simply a network router of signals. (the audio corrected I'm referring to Thalamic Circuit Diversity: Modulation of the Driver/Modulator Framework https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26793068/ )

10:16

The thalamus (in some instances) changes the signals passing through it. What is the thalamic modulation of signals adds robustness to the signals to learning to learning those signals by having them sort of like travel through one path.

10:41

get modulated and then get sit back to rejoin the rest of the signals that traveled a different path. (I came up with this idea I think after reading about how imaginary numbers can protect AI from real threats "Imaginary Numbers Protect AI From Very Real Threats" https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/imaginary-numbers-machine-learning ) I'm suggesting that by having signals travel through multiple paths, and being modulated by the thalamus, it is like adding complex numbers to the data traveling through the brain, adding robustness to your perception of reality.

Quote from the article linked above "“The complex-valued neural networks have the potential for a more ‘terraced’ or ‘plateaued’ landscape to explore,” Yeates said. “And elevation change lets the neural network conceive more complex things, which means it can identify more objects with more precision.”

That added capacity allows gradient regularization neural networks using complex numbers to find solutions just as fast as those trained without the extra security. In his research, Yeats shows that image classifiers aimed at recognizing house numbers from Google Maps and different clothing items trained on his approach are more secure than standard methods while performing at the same level."

I'm suggesting that modulation via the thalamic circuit plays with the concept of gradient regularization in artificial neural networks complexifying and or expanding the human brain's ability to recognize patterns in the world and playing into the idea that the brain is using it's branching signal paths to compare incoming data sources, to validate it's perception of reality and remove errors or mental illusions.

Rephrasing: I'm suggesting that the different paths of signals allow for comparisons, and modulatory circuits in the thalamus take us beyond the concept of the thalamus as a simply relay or router of signals, and extend it's operation to one of enabling the recognition of more complex patterns with the Hippocampal-Entorhinal loop serving as comparative system to the content moving between the neocortical-thalamic loop.

"Hippocampus as comparator: role of the two input and two output systems of the hippocampus in selection and registration of information" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11732710/

I'm not exactly sure how the neural wiring is except that it's probably different for every it's it's going to be different for every person's brain. So you might have.

11:06

So, I'm not sure like I guess initial connectivity, there's some amount of randomness in the initial connectivity and then the changes to the connectivity would reflect that that person's experiences would be one kind of reflection of that person's experiences.

11:29

But the so the changes in connectivity were sort of like encode a long-term potentiation or long-term memory. 

I would say the firing sequences are going to oscillate they're gonna cycle and what's going to set those firings sequences are incoming sensory patterns, novel incoming sensory patterns.

12:18

You're going to have novel incoming sensory patterns that are going to oscillate in the brain. They're going to oscillate several times before they (dissipate into the tonic oscillation) because there basically they're firing faster than the rest of the neurons and the rest of the neurons are going to slow them down. They're going to slow them down slowly like because because the rest of the neurons are firing at a slower rate so that neuron is like gradually calmed down (with each interval or cycle of oscillation.)

12:50

It's like a decaying oscillator or a resonator is another word for it. So it's like a drum that is like you hit the drum and the sound is loud, like, boom. But then it like it's it's not just boom, but it's like, it's like boom and then there's a smaller boom, because it oscillates around.

13:13

But in a sense it's energy is being drained by the rest of the oscillating group of cells. I say in a sense because the other cells are passing signals to & from it. Those other signals are going to bring it back into sync with the rest of the oscillation because that's what oscillators do.

13:37

Whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their energy across other neurons (oscillators).

An oscillating neuron is going to like repeat it's signal, but if it doesn't. so if there's like a high phasic signal, like I recognize a pattern that's going to fire, right?

14:05

But then the recognition of that pattern is going to fire again and it's going to loop. So that phase sequence is going to gradually loop in time and gradually fade out. That would be (essentially the same process) for anything that you can think of. Like if you are looking at something, the pattern of what you're looking at, very intensely is going to be like this high phasic (sequence of) bursts of spiking activity, interspersed with inhibitory waves.

# "Reduced inhibition of hippocampal neurons impairs long-term memory recall in Rett syndrome"
""An optimal balance between excitatory and inhibitory input is critical for the proper formation and retrieval of contextual memories," said Lingjie He, postdoctoral associate in the Zoghbi lab and first author."

Evidence that Sharp Wave Ripples (from action potentials) inhibit tonic (theta) oscillations.

# "Newly discovered brain cell sheds light on the formation of memories"
""We have found that this new type of neuron is maximally active during SWRs when the animal is awake—but quiet—or deeply asleep. In contrast, the neuron is not active at all when there is a slow, synchronized neuronal population activity called “theta” that can occur when an animal is awake and moves or in a particular type of sleep when we usually dream,” Professor Marco Capogna says. 
Because of this dichotomic activity, this novel type of neuron is named theta off-ripples on (TORO)."

Now, you can look at anything else if you want, but you're probably still gonna be thinking about that one thing that you were looking at intensely periodically for, for a little bit longer. And I think of that as short-term memory, I think of that. It's like that's like it.

14:50

It's like a an imprint on your mind, that is fading like a fading imprint, like, I guess, if you've seen, like, you can press your hand into them material, like a soft foam. And then if you let go, the foam doesn't immediately return to being flat.

15:13

And it instead, it's sort of like, like for a while, a represents your hand, but that representation becomes flatter and flatter and flatter until it fades away, right? It's like, it's like it's like the the foam representation now. That means that short-term memories are just going to fade away into nothing.

15:38

They're going to sort of cease to exist. But what happens though is that the short-term oscillations. They're going to change this synaptic connections. They're going to cause synaptic connections to grow towards them, and they're going to grow towards other neurons that fired fast fast.

16:10

They're going to grow towards the neurons that fired the fastest, and or at the same time, because it's like, if you have two....


16:43

It's like a plant growing towards the sun that something that's growing is accelerating in time and it's in it's growing. That is, it's like accelerating in

17:01

oscillation rate, but also as a periodic strange attractor or a chaotic strange attractor, that that oscillates because it oscillates faster in that, and in a particular direction, it oscillates faster

17:26

so relative to other things it grows faster. It grows faster when it fires, it grows spines when it fires, but it's also going to be attracted (and attractive) to other spines/neurons.

So there is there is there's there's was really interesting idea

17:59

by Richard Feynman. Let me look this up about configuration space because this idea that particles will sort of like, the trajectory of the particle is going to be like the shortest possible distance between two. 

# See note a0041z.md on Richard Feynman and the Path Integral.

I'm arguing that the path of plant grown between two oscillators is in part determined by time dilation, or that time dilation is essentially changing the odds of which direction a particle moves in randomly. Which is why plants grow towards the sun and why neurons that fire grow towards other neurons that fire. In both cases quantum time dilation is changing the shape of space from a particle's perspective.

18:30

When a neuron fires it inhibits a lot of other neurons that could have fired from firing in it's own layer. So that's like the first neuron. It's like, it's like, okay, so imagine.

18:53

Imagin that the whole layer of cells is oscillating together (or perhaps a layer of cells can be defined as those cells that are oscillating together at some interval within a larger oscillating group that is oscillating in a time step before or after the layer we are talking about). The hole layer is oscillating together and one of them fires and a lot of them are inhibited by the one that fires okay? Imagine it's one bright light with a lot of darkness and I say 

19:16

its like a lot of darkness because usually the oscillator has this one pattern that they all light up at the same time. They're all dark at the same time and now this pattern has (via the action potential) an interference pattern. They're not an oscillation anymore. Now there's a slowdown in some of them, and there's a speed up in a smaller number of them, but it's interesting.

19:43

It's like a sparse and distributed representation in a sense. It's very efficient because the amount of energy to represent a pattern, or part of a pattern is one neuron sped up balanced out by all the neurons that it slowed down by inhibiting it's own array or layer.

20:10

There's like that one neuron simultaneously speeds up and the rest of them get inhibited. Then it passes its own excitatory of signals to the second layer (or the next array). The one that fired first is now effectively transferring its synaptic pattern to the next layer. It's synaptic

20:51

pattern is the reason why it's cells filled up first so the synaptic pattern.

Oh shit. This is really good. Okay, let's try to go over this one more time. So you have so one neuron fires and it inhibits a whole bunch of others. Because there is a tonic (oscillating brainwave) field, all of those neurons are coordinated together.

21:22

So basically the neurons signal is looks like one tiny noise, but it's slowing down a whole bunch of neurons. So the neurons that slow down represents it's pattern.

21:51

So what I'm saying was that a neurons memory is stored in it's synaptic connections. I didn't invent that idea. That's the prevailing idea, okay? That's where that that synaptic connections are where the memories are stored. And that's because the synaptic connections they form in response to cells firing at the same time and they unform inresponse to cells firing out of sync.

22:27

And so a cell that is inhibited is going to

22:39

be out of sync with a cell that fired. So in some sense that means that if you look at the oscillating group, as a whole, neurons that were wired together before will become sort of like... 

I'm trying to, like, understand what, why like this mechanism a little bit more precisely.

23:11

But so something inbetween when the neurons fire out of sync, the spines that were growing beneath them will be deconstructed.

23:36

They'll stop linking to each other, they will atrophy (perhaps the cell body is being recycled by the glial cell), and that's is...

okay.

So I had this idea that, you know, it's like a splay state, right?

# "Splay States in a Ring of Coupled Oscillators: From Local to Global Coupling"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220403160_Splay_States_in_a_Ring_of_Coupled_Oscillators_From_Local_to_Global_Coupling

The splay state means the oscillations are now on opposite intervals. The area between two oscillations in a splay state is going to be anti-attractive for (synaptic or plant) growth, or relative to the areas between oscillators in sync.

*That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation).

24:08

SKIP LINE

24:26

I'm trying to imagine the decay process like, is it is it analogous to the cell wilting or atrophying? Is it because nutrients are being deprived from that spine to be shifted towards where the cell is growing?

24:47

That's sort of like saying that....

So imagine that in space in the dark that a plant can grow in any direction at any given time, but because there is a stimulus in one of the directions that is sort of like changing the likelyhood (of the direction of growth)

25:21

It's speeding up time (quantum gradient time dilation). It's speeding up time in that direction. So there are now more possible paths in the direction, in which time is accelerating faster. It's like if time is accelerating faster in one direction, then you have like, one, two, three or more paths in a quantum gradient time dilation accelerated direction for every one path in a non-time dilated direction.

25:53

It's in one direction life is moving at 60 grams per second, very fast, and in another direction, it's moving at 30 frames per second. That means that you have, there are in a sense twice as many directions for that particle to go towards.

If it's gonna randomly move by nature. If the chances that it moves in any particular direction are like completely random or gaussian, then it's more likely (if you increase the number of possible paths in one direction via the acceleration of time in one particular direction)

LINE EDITED OUT

26:33

If two of the three possible directions, at any given interval of time, are the same direction (because of time dilation being faster in one direction vs another), then the chances that it grows in the direction time moving at 60fps is 2x as likely as it growing in the direction of time moving at 30fps. As we speed up or slow down time we increase or decrease the chances that particles move in any particular direction, thus teasing out a particle trajectory (between synchronized oscillators), which is like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just it's just the direction with higher spacetime frame rates.

27:15

The greater activity is a greater interval of time happening, which multiplies spatial dimensions (from an atoms perspective) the number of possible paths that growth could happen in. Growth is happening faster in cells that are firing, because growth is happening more slowly in cells that aren't firing (at the same rate)

27:48

then energy of the plant stops being sent to, to the spine, is to the spine that are not being used, right? It's in and I think they must be decaying like way of plant decays (the process involves glial cells removing the spine) when it doesn't receive nutrients, right?

28:14

The nutrients are going in the direction of where it's firing. That would be LTD, which is long-term depression, or Long Term Forgetting, the opposite of LTP Long Term Potentiation or Long Term Memory. Which is when the plant is not growing in a particular direction (or when the plant is decaying in a particular direction and spines are removed by the glial cell). Since signals are not using that path

28:31

that memory fades away. It gets like etched away over time, with each passing oscillation where it's not being used, but since so many cells are involved with learning patterns (it's the oscillating group of cells that is learning the patterns) it can take a really long time to really get rid of an old memory, and it will be much easier for the brain to strengthen that memory again if it existed at least once in the network of the brain, because it is going to leave a trace in the brain's network even after the process of LTD.

Okay.

What I want to get at is the synaptic pattern of the neuron that fires first.

28:57

This is a pattern that I think is going to resonate again a few times, because it resonates a few times there's time to stimulate the growth of cells, with a continual pattern of synchronous signals oscillating over time. Imagine that synaptic spine growth between cells is actually connections growing between patterns, connecting small patterns into larger patterns. It's like they can grow a little with interval of each oscillation, and they need/use another stimulus/another signal to grow little more and then another stimulus to grow a little more.

29:28

If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)

29:57

As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

This triggers some ideas for amplifying the human sense of smell, by considering how the shape of a dog's olfactory bulb, and the rates & types of its signal pathways are different from the human nose. I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

As memory grows almost like a tumor or like a plant.... If something is really important to you.

30:28

it's neural correlate might be a multi-neuron cell assembly with a ton of powerful synaptic connections driving the memory & concepts of what is important to you.

30:44

It's like how psychedelic medication excites your whole brain and that causes a lot of cell growth. A lot of new connections between neurons causes an increase in your brain activity, right? The same. It's kind of think that's what I need is like some psychedelics (laughs).

31:32

I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

The excitatory/inhibitory wave rippling from a fired cell is helping to magnify memories that single cells represent via their connections scaling such patterns to the whole brain.

Mental Patterns in the brain are being created by the total representation of the sparse distributed representation in the oscillating cell group (The neural network turned sparse representation in spreadsheet which gave me an idea). Imagine the cell assembly as a spreadsheet, and the excited areas, and the inhibited areas are like marks on the spreadsheet, or lit pixels on a screen (that the next array of cells will read)

So the sparse distribute (spreadsheet ;) ) representation in the oscillating cell assembly (reference to Donald Hebb's Cell Assembly (in pictures) is not just what fired but it's also what was inhibited.

32:04

Those are just distinct from cells that are still firing tonically.

# Multiple layers of representation with multiple levels of sensitivity.

So there's multiple layers of representation, right? And then because there's like gamma and high gamma like there's there's definitely I would say there's a range of....

32:30

There's a range of pattern representation that's four bits. That's basically inhibited, tonic, phasic, high phasic.

But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. That's important because it's like how much does this pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are we gonna be paying attention to?

34:07

That's where the pattern is resonating the most. Where our attention is to. I'm talking about temporal resonation so it's like, yeah, so it's like patterns are resonating in our heads, right? And and over time and but they peak for a time and then they fade out and then they come back.

34:40

Because the whole brain is oscillating, so they come back again and they peak and then they fade out again, right? The brain is a little bit like a robot in a loop, but the loop changes just a little bit every time. The strange loop I am describining is consciousness.

It's like a loop. It just loops and loops and loops and loops. The thing is it's also like all of the all of the move all of the changes to its movement are are sort of like causing changes to ripple through it that adjusts its movements. And so, it's (the brain) is literally just reacting to physics, right?

35:35

Like human being is just literally a bunch of particles that are reacting to physics. Even beings literally just a bunch of (quantum) particles that are reacting to physics. That's what I'll say. This allows the entire oscillation to represent a unique pattern code that represents the synaptic arrangement of one neuron.

But a synaptic configuration of when you're on because that's the only neuron. Like if that neuron fires, whether the it's going to create a pattern that is distinct that to it's itself because it's going to inhibit its neighbors. It's going to cause basically a disruption to the pattern that that is distinguished itself in a large way by inhibiting

olther neurons from firing and by selling them down. So it's speeds up in a slows down a whole bunch and that magnifying pattern that energy efficient magnifying pattern.

Changes.

# Like that's like a paint brush on a canvas. And the entire array is that canvas.

So you can have maybe multiple firing patterns simultaneously in different areas of that one, ray and they each inhibit a different area to magnify themselves, and so you're going to have like you're going to have a few light up and a lot of them are going to be dark that you kind of detect the dark ones as a difference from the tonic firing rate from the regular.

(Rephrased: The above paragraph describes how the oscillating cell assembling has light and dark areas, light areas are the fired neurons, dark areas magnify the neuron that fired with a larger pattern that represents some part of the exit terminal on the inhibited nearby neurons, the inhibited area is detected as a phase change from the tonic oscillation pattern, so both the inhibited areas and the excited areas paint the picture of what is happening for the next array of neurons to see)

(I can't figure out what I meant in this last paragraph so don't worry if you can't figure it out either: "It's like the growth, it's like relative to you. So think about it this way. The growth relative to you, is that the growth declined and it's like the growth declines is you get older right? And it's faster when you're younger." huh???)
