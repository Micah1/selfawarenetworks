LTD Neurons Signals Pattern

00:00

The one thing that I want to note that I am taking away from the discussion of how firefly SYNC in in the book SYNC by Steven Strogatz. I guess there's different ways of fireflies can can SYNC and different species that can sink where they all fire in a sequence right after it one another. (Isn't it true that all species that flock together or swim together or work together are synchronizing in a valid sense? Yes I think so. Yes I SYNC so!)

00:26

But then they're all silent for a period of of time. It looks like synchronous firing or firing one after another (in rapid succession, like tiny variations between Alpha Brainwave wave patterns for example) and I'm kind of making the argument that this amplifies the receptive field of the organism or creates an inceptive field that includes all the parts of the organism to alert the entire organization because they have a synchronized sensor/transmitter system (cells: neurons & glia).

01:11

They're all going to notice faster (statement applies to fireflies and or to neurons and or to flocks of birds). When one of them falls out of sync, like that would cause a change to the regularity of the entire pattern, like something that would normally that would cause a rippling basically. Yeah. Yeah. Like a rippling pattern because the syncs are based upon thresholds being reached on a regular basis.

01:54

And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of of a fireflies.

02:37

And as sort of like allowing the emergence of higher level receptive field, that is like a shared computation. It allows it allows the the bugs to basically have collective mind that is not really in mind, so much as it's a collective sensor. That's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so, each of them can help create this sort of collective sensor just because and it in ends.

03:22

And so they're so. So, the weird thing is that it's not actually just living animals that can do this, like sync happens with that with debt, with things that are not organic, right? Things that are just dead, right? But essentially, you could have robots, that can send signals to each other to that, that they to reach a threshold that they dissipate to other robots or send other robots, but in increasingly smaller amounts, like it guesses, it gets a signal and then, and then it absorbs some of it.

04:06

And then it sends some of it onward. So it's so or or it's stopped from from sending us normal signal, so they would have. So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast and that's their synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.

04:34

So any disruption is like a phase change or coincidence pattern. And so any of the fireflies in a group of fireflies, there they're going to notice. They're all going to notice when any when when any of their phases is disrupted, right? And so they're in. And because each of each of them has to each and effectively.

05:03

Now fires at a slightly different interval than they were firing before. And that difference is going to cause the cause of thank a reaction or a change and the an artificial structure or in the organism of the book. So this could also happen to a sort of machine. That's completely native dead parts, right?

05:42

And that's and that's the key distinction. Is that the read is at the reason that machines can be conscious? Is that the the nature of the oscillation is taking a bunch of separate parts but allowing them to affect one. Another like like like a bunch of it's like it's like having a bunch of of tuning forks or a bunch of drums that can that when you hit one drum, all the other star vibrating, right?

06:21

And so what you have normally is like, they're all sort of like vibrating like one of them will you will hit and then and then all sort of like react to that one that got hit, right? There's this reaction that happens in the brain. What happens is one gets hit.

06:40

And there's this, there's this attention schema that this, this effect, that that is described very well with the tension, schema where it one gets hit and that inhibits a lot of the others in its own array, and that one that I fired hits a, it probably hits a lot of others in his own array, but then it's probably sending excitatory signals to, to the secondary cortex in the case of the story cortex.

07:19

So I would imagine that when a signal goes from the olfactory bowl to the, to the

07:36

Temporal lobe that signal is going to be like it's gonna be an exciting signal, right? So what, so what would happen is one is you might have one at one of the the neurons and oscillator of the layer. One of the separate is going to, I'm sorry of the not the answer though, is the temporal lobe.

08:11

So like the it's like I meant like what I think is like imagine like the the first layer of cells. Like they're all like sort of like sent up an excitatory pattern that bumps, all of them up a little bit, but one of them fires first, which is this threshold before the others, and then it sends out and inhibitory signal to all of the other ones that were were receiving the excitatory.

08:38

Like those are the same ones in the in that first layer. And then, what then would pass is? It's gonna pass at some point. A sickness gonna pass signals and a couple different directions. One of them is towards the thalamus and the other direction is towards the, and in the signals, go from the thalamus and they go towards the orbital frontal lose, but there's also signals that go from the temporal lobes to the orbital frontal lobes.

09:10

So, there's two paths that the signals travel is, so there's like a circuit being created, a sorts where the information is divided up one, one part of the information, goes to the the thalamus. And then to the front, to the, the frontal lobes, the orbital frontal lobes, and then the other part goes directly to skips thalamus and goes directly to the orbital from the lobes.

09:38

And so that situation is one where?

09:47

As that's when we're you have you have signals that went through the thalamus, which will modulate the signals in some way. It's not, it's not just, it's not it just a, it's not just gonna just pass signals through itself without modulating them. It's not just a, you know, like a Cisco router as was once I mentioned, you know, it's not enough, it's not networking router.

10:16

That doesn't the passes things without making changes to those things and it changes the signals. But then in like I'm imagining like oh what if that's like what if that's sort of like what the ads kind of robustness that to the signals to learning to learning those signals by having them sort of like travel through one path.

10:41

Get modulated. And then get sit back to rejoin. It's the the rest of the signals. Okay. I'm not exactly sure how the neural has it. How the wiring is except that it's probably different for every it's it's going to be different for every person's brain. So you might have.

11:06

So, I'm not sure like I guess initial connectivity, there's some amount of randomness in the initial connectivity and then the changes to the connectivity would reflect that that person's experiences would would be, would be one kind of reflection of that person's experiences.

11:29

But the so the changes in connectivity were sort of like encode a long-term potentiation or long-term memory. And then, but the I would say the firing sequences in terms of like you know, in terms of like firing sequences are going to oscillate they're gonna cycle and what's going to set those firings sequences are incoming sensory, patterns novel, novel, incoming sensory patterns.

12:18

And so you're going to have novel incoming, sensory patterns that are going to oscillate in the brain. They're going to oscillate several times before they because there basically they're firing faster than the rest of the neurons and the rest of the neurons are going to slow them down. But they're they're going to slow them down slowly like because because the rest of the neurons are firing at a slower rate so that neuron is like gradually calmed down.

12:50

So it's like a decaying. It's like a decaying oscillator or a resonator is another word for it. So it's like a drum that is like you hit the drum and you the sound is loud, like, boom. But then it like it's it's not just boom, but it's like, it's like boom and then there's a smaller boom, because it oscillates around.

13:13

And, but as it's, it's bit, it's energy, is being drained by the right by the rest of the oscillator, and it's in one sense, because they're passing signals to it. That are and going to bring it back and sync with the rest of the oscillation because that's what oscillators do.

13:37

Whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will what dissipate their energy across other neurons, but be better and so they'll disappear their energy across this neuron. And so it's going to like, repeat. It's it's signal but so if it doesn't, so if there's like a high physic signal, like I recognize the pattern that's going to fire, right?

14:05

But then the recognition of that pattern is going to fire again and it's going to loop. So that face sequence is going to loop in time and gradually fade out just like so it's like and that would be true for anything that you can think of. Like if you are looking at something, the pattern of what you're looking at, very intensely is going to be like this high phasing first, right of activity.

14:31

Now, you can look at anything else if you want, but you're probably still gonna be thinking about that one thing that you were looking at intensely periodically for, for a little bit longer. And I think of that as short-term memory, I think of that. It's like that's like it.

14:50

It's like a an imprint on your mind, that is fading like a fading imprint, like, I guess, if you've seen, like, you can press your hand into them material, like a soft foam. And then if you let go, the foam doesn't immediately turn to being flat return to being flat.

15:13

And it instead, it's sort of like, like for a while, a represents your hand, but that representation becomes flatter and flatter and flatter until it fades away, right? It's like, it's like it's like the the foam representation now. So that means that the that the short-term memories are just going to fade away into nothing.

15:38

They're going to sort of cease to exist. But what happens though is that the short-term also the short-term oscillations. They they're going to change this synaptic connections. You're going to cause the, they're going to cause synaptic connections to grow towards them, and they're going to grow towards other neurons, that fired fast fast.

16:10

They're gonna go towards the neurons, that fire, the fastest, and a sense at the same time, because it's like, if you have two, if you have two it, if you have like, so. Because it because like like I think in one sense like yeah. So being so for a neuron to I'm trying to I'm trying to say that the argument that I did I created before was that?

16:43

It's like a plant growing towards the sun that something that's growing is accelerating in and it's in it's growing. That is, it's like accelerating in.

17:01

It's oscillation but it it. But like, as a periodic strange, attractor or a chaotic stranger tractor, that that oscillates because it oscillates faster in that, and, in a particular direction, in

17:26

It allows its faster so relative to other things, it grows faster so it grows, it's fine when it fires and but it's also going to be Sort of like attracted to other spines and so. So, I mean, there is there is there's there's was really interesting is in the

17:59

By Richard Feynman. Let me look this up about configuration space because this idea that particles will sort of like the trajectory of the particle is going to be like the shortest possible distance between Between two. Hang on. I need to look this up and

18:30

So, all right, so I'm just gonna say that. Well, a neuron is like, is this? So when a neuron fires, it creates this, it inhibits a lot of other neurons that could have fired from firing and it's on layer. So that's like the first neuron. It's like, it's like, okay, so imagine.

18:53

It's like the whole oscillator oscillating. The whole layer is oscillating together, right? The hole layers oscillating together and one of them fires in the rest of them are in a lot of them inhibited by the wind of fires, okay? So, that's like imagine that's a, it's a one bright light with a lot of darkness and I say that's a lot.

19:16

It's like a lot of darkness because usually the oscillator it has, this is one pattern that they all light up. At the same time. They're all dark at the same time and now this pattern has a parent's pattern. They're not, they're not an oscillation anymore. Now there's this, there's a slowdown and some of them and there's a speed up and a smaller number of them, but it's interesting.

19:43

There's so there's like a, it's like a sparse and distributed representation and one sense. And that, and that it's very efficient because the amount of energy to represent is to represent. The pattern is to represent part of a pattern is one neuron plus that sped up balanced out by all the neurons that it slowed down by inhibiting.

20:10

So there's like that one neuron simultaneously speeds up and the rest of them get inhibited. So, it's like they the But then but then it passes its own excitatory of signals to the second layer. So that sort of like create some, the one that fired first now, is effectively transferring its synaptic pattern to the next layer because it's an optic.

20:51

Pattern is the reason why it's it's a it's sells filled up first so the synaptic pattern. Oh shit. This is really good. Okay, let's try to go over this one more time. So you have so one neuron fires and a inhibits, a whole bunch of others. But because there's a tonic field, all of those neurons are coordinated together.

21:22

So basically, the, the neurons signal is it looks like one tiny noise, but it's slowing down a whole bunch of neurons. And so, that is also the, so, the ones that. So the neurons that slow down, it's is kind of like that that represents like so the neuron so a neurons.

21:51

So what I'm saying was that a neurons memory is stored in? It's synaptic connections. I didn't invent that idea. That's the prevailing idea, okay? That's where that that synaptic connections are where the memories are stored. And that's because the the synaptic connections they form in response to cells firing at the same time and they they unform and response to sales firing out of sync.

22:27

And so, a cell that is inhibited is going to

22:39

Be out of sync with a cell that fired. And so the link and so, in some, in some sense. Like so that means that if you look at the oscillating group, as a whole that neurons that were wired together before we'll become sort of like, and they will, I'm trying to, like, understand what, why like this mechanism a little bit more precisely.

23:11

But so something in between when the neurons fire out of sync, they the the spines that were growing beneath them will be sort of deconstructed.

23:36

That they'll, they'll stop linking to each other. And that's that is okay. So if you have like, so the so I had this idea that, you know, it's sort of like the it's like a splice day, right? This play state is now that the, the oscillations are opposite and so they're gonna like.

24:08

So that means if that one neuron keeps is the one that is gonna fire first. Then it's gonna inhibit the others. And so, the

24:26

I don't know, I guess it's kind of like, I guess it's, I'm just trying to match, I'm just like, trying to imagine the decay process like, is it is it analogous to selling? Is it because nutrients are being deprived from that spine to be shifted towards where the cell is growing?

24:47

Because that's sort of like saying that that the the it's like imagine that, okay. So imagine a plant can grow in any direction and ending in any given time, like, but because they're stimulus and one of the directions that is sort of like changing the, the likelyhood like that.

25:21

It's adding. It's adding like, it's speeding up that time. It's speeding up time and that direction. So there are more possible paths in the direction there more possible past in the direction of, and which time is accelerating faster. It's like, it's like if time is still learning faster in one direction, then you have like, one, two pass for every one path.

25:53

It's like it's like in one direction. Life is moving at 60 grams per second, very fast. And in another direction, it's moving at 30 frames per second. So that means that you have. There's there are there are innocents twice as many directions for that particle to go towards. And so if it's gonna random, if it's gonna like if the chances of that it going in, any particular direction are like completely random or gaussian, then it's more likely, it's then it then it make row and it may go in any different direction, but the chance to chances are the chances that it goes in the direction.

26:33

But if but so but if you have, but if two of the three possible directions are the same direction, then the chances that it grows in one direction are our two times, the chance that it's growing in the other direction. And so that increased chance, sort of like teases out a tracheary, which is like like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just it's just the greater activity increases.

27:15

The the or the greater activity is as a greater interval of time happening, which multiplies, the number of possible will pass that. That growth could go to that growth could happen. And and growth is happening faster because in cells that are firing and so because growth is happening, more slowly and cells that aren't firing.

27:48

Then the the energy of the plant sort of like pulls, like, it's not stops being sent to, to the spine, is to the spine that are not being used, right? It's in and I think they must be decaying like way of plant decays when it doesn't receive nutrients, right?

28:14

And then because the nutrients are going in the direction of where it's firing and that's why. So is it? So that would be healthy LDT, which is a long-term depression, which is when the plant is not growing in a particular direction, the signals are going, not going in a particular direction.

28:31

And so, that's the memory phase fades away. It gets like etched away over time. Okay. So what I want to get out is that the the pattern of a neuro. So the pattern we know that the neuron that fires is the one. It is like so so it's like the neuron that fires first.

28:57

So so a pattern that I think is going to resonate again a few times because it resonates a few times. There's time to stimulate the growth of cells and in between those patterns, right? It's like they can grow a little and they need another stimulus to grow little more and then another stimulus to grow a little more.

29:28

Okay so so if it resonates a lot and the growth can be a lot and so it's like energy just like a lot of energy can flow insert towards certain patterns and those certain patterns connect patterns that have dense connections. I have a lot of attractive power.

29:57

Their their combined as a combined oscillator. They are a more but their a more powerful attractor to smaller oscillators. And so they can so like as a memory at. So memory, like grows almost like a tumor, right? If something is like, if you're there, something's really important to you.

30:28

Then you like have all of these like powerful connections will help you.

30:44

It's like how it's like how psychedelic medication is like it excites your whole brain and and that causes a lot of cell growth so you're so a lot of a lot of new connections between neurons that causes your, your an increase in your activity, right? The same. It's kind of think that's what I need is like subsequence, but

31:32

Basically, I wanted to say that the the LCD is creating a pattern and the the it's helping a single cell to create a to magnify as pattern. So that a patterns are being created in terms of by the total representation of the spreadsheet. So the spreadsheet representation is not just what fired but it's also what was inhibited right?

32:04

Those are just distinct from cells that are still firing tonically. So there's multiple layers of representation, right? And then because there's like there's like gamma and high gamma like there's there's definitely a I would say there's a range of

32:30

But I'm sure it makes saving a pattern representation, there's a range of pattern representation. That's four bits. That's basically inhibited tonic.

32:50

Basically, bright and brighter. And and you could also say it's like silent regular sound and and then allowed and louder, right? And so but and then you could have for touch. You could have different intensities of texture, right? There's like light touch. There's heart attack like in a mechano counterrotecher.

33:22

There's, you know, the tactile sensations, there's heavy touch, just like card grips, you know. Like you can have a hard handshake, It's like hard grip and, you know, you can have like, basically different different levels of sensitivity detection. That are senses can process. Like, you know, we can have to different sensory sensitivity.

33:47

But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. And that's important because it's like, well, how much does this pattern one? Or do we just pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are, what are we gonna be paying attention to?

34:07

That's that that's where the pattern is resonating. The most is happening, is what that's where our attention is to. I'm talking about temporal resonation so it's like, yeah, so it's like patterns are resonating in our heads, right? And and over time and but there but they they like they peek for a time and then they fade out and then they come back.

34:40

Because the whole brain is oscillating, so they come back again and they peek and then they fade out again, right? And, but then, you know, you just it's like a robot in a loop, but the loop changes just a little bit every time, you know, like, you know, it's like it's the loop is, the loop is of consciousness.

35:03

It's like a loop. It just loops and loops and loops and loops. But the thing is it's also like all of the all of the move all of the changes to its movement are are sort of like causing changes to ripple through it that adjusts its movements. And so, it's it's literally just reacting to physics, right?

35:35

Like human being is just literally a bunch of particles that are reacting to physics. Even beings literally just a bunch of particles that are reacting to physics. That's what I'll say. This, this lasts the entire oscillation to represent a unique pattern code that represents the synaptic arrangement of one neuron.

36:04

But a synaptic configuration of when you're on because that's the only neuron. Like if that neuron fires, whether the it's going to create a pattern that is distinct that to it's it's itself because it's going to inhibit its neighbors. It's going to cause basically a disruption to the pattern that that is distinguished distinguishes itself in a large way by inhibiting.

36:32

Other neurons from firing and by selling them down. So it's speeds up in a slow set a whole bunch and that magnifying pattern that energy efficient magnifying pattern.

36:46

Changes. Like that's like a paint brush on a canvas. And the entire array is that canvas. So you can have maybe multiple firing patterns simultaneously in different areas of that one, ray and the agent inhibited different area to magnify themselves. And so you're going to have like you're going to have a few light up and a lot of them are going to be dark that you kind of detect the dark ones as a difference from the tonic firing rate from the regular.

37:23

It's like the growth, it's like relative teeth. So think about it this way. The growth relative to you, is that the growth decline and It's like the growth declines is you get older right? And it's faster when you're younger.
