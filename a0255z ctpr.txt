an electronic network

phase,
the final curve
the condesator
it tilts the phase its in by a particular degree
it could look like zero
a resister tilts to 90 to the others
the pieces you put in that phase can be tilted
you can chain the phase together
or resistors
neurons tilting phase of 
at some point you don't measure anything
between an electronic network and current

so what if the homochirality of protein can be compared to the homochirality of a battery or a magnetic
chirality of an electron, and an electrical network
a radius and degree
does the chirality help positive & negative 
there is a bidirectional affect between electromagnetic waves and neurons

can an electromagnetic wave reversely affect sodium potassium and calcium ions in neurons
you always need change or movement
electromagnetic field buids up as a reaction to change, 
or the magnetic field is moving
