Map: Peter Tse, (criterial causation, observer) 
"What I like about Peter Tse's book at the end is he frames the question in terms of whether thoughts are passive or whether they have an active role in decision making. It's like are your thoughts just a result that the observer is observing? Or is the observer and the thoughts taking place active in the feedback cycle of decision making, playing a role in the activity instead of being a passive observer of the activity. The idea that the observer is a passive observer I think stems from the idea that the mind is seperate from the body, maybe, the idea that the observer, the mind, and thought are some how seperate from physics or causality or above physics and above causation. I think Peter Tse is not trying to prove that we have choice because of random noise, he is trying to say that information has casual power in the brain, because neurons literally read and write information patterns which allows information to drive neural activity and the brain.
