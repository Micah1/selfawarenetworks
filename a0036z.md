Imagine that the VR headset image, game engine, is what is rendered in the persons visual cortex, but the music is in the auditory cortex,

Alien existed once time was sped up, as if the many distributed parts of the alien became the whole alien when combined

Westworld robots had to search through a maze to find themselves to become self aware

Their inner voice replaced the external voices

Imagine that a dog could model your inner voice within themselves, use that model to develop their own self awareness and continue developing that model even in your absence through inner neuronal chat. 

What I have been thinking about in terms of the Pyramid of Giza that might interest you is not only how the boundaries of the tetrahedron might reflect electromagnetism from its external surfaces back towards its center but also how the dome in the Vision Agencies Samskara experience may also be concentrating electromagnetic energy in its center and how the human mind might be concentrating electromagnetism in its center areas.

but in retrospect I wish I had spent more time in the exact center of the Samskara dome to meditate on the potential energies resonating from all the people in the dome against its surface and back toward the center

but it would be interesting if the walls of the dome were particularly engineered to be reflective of the EM field in the human spectrum

similarly a dome engineered to reflect acoustical energy & electromagnetism & perhaps light would be an experience. Specifically calibrating the emissions of light and sound around a person in VR so as to simulate a real life dome or tetrahedron effect would be interesting

what is ultimately the meaning of being physically inside a concentration of electric, magnetic, acoustic, and light energy?

and vibrational mechanical oscillatory energy on top of that

The effect of concentrating/focusing electromagnestism, magnetism, electricity, acoustics, noise or light or vibrations in central areas may serve to amplify & merge resonances, converge streams of information.

perhaps the shape of the skull serves to help concentrate minute amounts of energy, electromagnetism, electricity, to somewhat central areas of the brain such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, the TPJ, Werneck & Broca's areas, as well as the brain stem.

Perhaps supporting the bursting of chemical stimulus such as dopamine bursts in the entorhinal cortex and connected systems

In my humble opinion I think there are hard limits on what tv, news, and social media can do to program people because human beings are for the most part self-programming based on the action perception cycle. Or in other words what you choose to pay attention to is what your mind becomes made out of. This means we don't have to worry that much about what people are trying to make everyone think from their television news studios and their social media platforms, they can try to influence us, but at the end of the day people make up their own minds.

Everything we are each saying is a kind of programming sure but I was thinking that we all have some natural immunity to what we say to each other based on this concept from this book "Action in perception" I think it helps explain why we do not automatically believe what other people tell us.
