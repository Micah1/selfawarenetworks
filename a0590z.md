a0590z ctp what needs to be worked out, with regard to dendritic computation, is how the firing of a pyramidal cells ultimately results in the network level detection of the neuron that fired as a representation of its connections

neuron row 1 a neuron first fires
neuron row 2 dendrite spines grow towards first neuron, a new neuron fires inhibiting several others (that magnifies the information rarity information theory)
neuron row 3 the phase rates across the oscillations change, resulting in the eventual deduction of the patterns represented the previous layers fired neurons

many types of teacher cells in the thymus

use dna to max training for tcells

teacher cells use all of their genes at once,
the deluge of protein of protein molecules challenges the t-cells to produce more receptors
training consists of being bombarded with protein molecules that train them to build receptor types that can distinguish learned bad shit while not harming normal human cells

Antigens and affinity
a molecule that can trigger an immune response is an antigen

normal molecules are self antigens
they tell t-cells this cell has no problems

t-cells need to recognize self-antigens or else they will attack normal human cells leading to tissue destruction & auto immune diseases

the thymus exam is moroe subtle than turning a switch on or off or providing a yes or no answer about self antigens

t cells have to be attracted to human cells to maintain communication while not attacking
