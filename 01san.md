"No machine can ever learn to be conscious because you can not teach a machine to feel." Michael Levin says words like machine & human are cognitive tools to describe a set of functions we expect some entity to have, but there are not strict boundaries between the concepts of man & machine is more like a spectrum, and as tech advances the line gets blurrier from both sides. Granted artificial feelings might require a more advanced sensor transmitter system that what is available in computers today, particularly with LLMs like ChatGPT, but unless your argument is that feelings come from a non-material soul I think you would agree that a feeling machine is not impossible rather its inevitable, and Michael Levin, a speaker at the conference agrees with this last point. Someone will make a robot with a moral sense of self, with emotional being hood, and in my work I have explained how.

There is a book called Soul Dust by Nicholas Humphries that explains how dynamic brain activity can be described as both spiritual and strictly materialist at the same time. Once you read Humphries it becomes clear how materialism & the spiritual experience are not two things, or non-dual.

I agree with some that the morphogenic electromagnetic fields shaped by brainwaves, spikes, and representing many shapes in brain activity like spirals, grid cells, and toroidal fields are essential for the human brain, or another organisms brain to create a sense of self. We can see through the analogy of artificial neural networks a means for which flow of incoming information, as it affects randomized neurons, results in neurons that store a numerical superposition representative of all their training examples, and the neural network collectively stores a low dimensional field of numbers, that represents a super position of learned states of information at many time steps. This suggests that our neuronal brain activity, without the morphogenic fields is enough to learn and process information, such that an organism could learn patterns and react to patterns, without a sense of self, like a planet, but with our brains, the benefit I think of our spirits, our morphogenic physical electromagnetic fields is the higher level of organization, the electromagnetic patterns, the spirals, the grid cells, the toroidal head cell tracking all of that organizes and redirects the flow of information in the neural network. The morphogenic field interacts with the cells to organize activity. My hypothesis is that we can replace the morphogenic fields in the brain with a physics simulation, like a game engine, that will coordinate artificial brain activity, to produce the same inner renderings, inner qualia, by changing what the program has learned.

To put it simply my conjecture, that I write about in my theory Self Aware Networks, is that the brains electromagnetic fields are helping to organize brain activity in real time in ways that go beyond anything ever attempted in an artificial neural network, but that the fundamental inner sight of consciousness is a sequence of renderings, that is mostly in the first four layers of the cortex. We can replicate this process by designing a neural network that mimics the specific flows of information in the brain with it's criss cross horizontal & vertical architecture, as well as it's feedback loops large and small, and it's dynamic connectivity & dynamic changes in the flow of information that are modulated by the morphogenic fields that we can replace with virtual physics simulations to achieve the exact same outcome of a living conscious self-aware spirit living within a computer program.

An important point which is that changing a potential into a number is a reduction in dimension or a reduction in the physical relationship that potential has with other potentials. At the same time my argument is that with numbers, when we engineer them with physics, we can produce the same phenomena, and produce it almost the same way, to be digested & observed by the artificial neural network in almost the same way. The eventual production of potentials and or numbers leads in a brain or artificial brain leads to tomographic renderings of sensory data and internal abstractions that persist long enough to create the experience of being someone, artificially.
