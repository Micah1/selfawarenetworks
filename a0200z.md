(oscillat, emotion, vector) fast flows and slow flows, slow is stable, 
the unstable fixed point, when you have many arrows you go fast

In dynamical system theory,

a second axis

what if we had an imaginary axis, where we could plot a flow between stable oscillation that returns to a center slow and stable and unstable oscillation

the oscillation between a positive oscillation and a negative oscillation

what I am seeing are the changes between tonic firing neural oscillations, and phasic fast unstable firing patterns

but perhaps the patterns are pulled in two directions

the idea is that in order for reality to have real time impact on my brain the new sensory information has to materially change my brain tissue to create an update for each new piece of information in the rendered environment.

so if my sense of the complexity of the environment is something I am thinking about then my brain tissue is also rendering this environment in real time.

Eventually then an educated person because to model the whole of the earth and space beyond earth just in their mind, in their brain tissue.

People can start to develop emotionally when they stop watching tv and movies.

What I like about the Fast & the Furious is that it has that feel like the Dukes of Hazard had before I understood what racism was.

 Do you see?

Gaussian distribution creates a linear system with a stable distribution point.

The brain selects a mostly guassian distribution pattern of energy to have the most stable brain oscillations most of the time, the brains delicate oscillations have the ability to turn the brains oscillations into renderings that are equal to version of the human experience of reality.

Does a neurons positive oscillation have some temporal cadence with a certain point in it's negative oscillation flow? is there an equilibrium between the high point and low points of the oscillation flows.

I like that he is adding in imaginary vectors in order to plot the changes in the data in increasingly higher resolution

imagine a computer calculating how the incoming signal pattern renders a vast grid of representations

when are we uncoupled.
