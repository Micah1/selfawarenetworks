what you see is a perspective rendered between sequences of sensor arrays, that is spatially and temporally distributed pattern in a changing phase field that consists of patterns rendered by your brain to your brain.

that is the same for all sensory representations
all manner and variety of thought feeling idea sensation, its all tempo-spatially distributed phase decoherence patterns and oscillating substrate to serve as the canvas of observation and the awareness of self as the canvas of observation

an oscillation is a sensor and transmitter at the same time, because it is disturbed by anything that disturbes it and it transmits whatever disturbes it by changing its phase up or down

but even though its a sensor transmitter it doesn't have a memory, or a permanence, and without memory its patterns have no context, so information is not informing anything, 

inside certain molecular structures like the networks of the brain it is possible for the oscillators to form molecular memories, or memories that are encoded on the molecular structure of the brain by electrical wave patterns, magnetic wave patterns, mechanical wave patterns, and chemical wave patterns.

What makes this amazing memory structure self aware, or able to learn a model of itself, down to exactly how it's brain works,
