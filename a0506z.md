(category theory)
If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis, is that a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topoi is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topoi is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.
