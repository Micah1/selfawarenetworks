neo mind cycle 2 (electromagnetism, synap, metaverse, oscillat, field)
So imagine it starts in 2012 with neo mind cycle

goes through discussion of a ton of bci interfaces

ends talking about AR and VR mixed reality combining with AI neural rendering

my interpretation of my kundalini awakening was like seeing the whole capacity of my mind as like a lake of electromagnetism, this has been somewhat depicted in art by many others

but etched in the phase field are layers of the same images scaled to different resolutions, projected from synapses onto oscillations

I'm arguing that https://doi.org/10.1021/ja00093a003

plus my thoughts on the metaverse
touching on Tony Parisi's 7 laws of the metaverse

Oculus Quest 4 with a discreet TPU, all the existing games look better, their resolutions upscaled with neural rendering, the tracking perfected

so imagine that 

I think what if

poll: do you see the world heading towards a global climate apocalypse yes or no? If yes

do you see that all people in sum, a sum that includes all, but especially all the current leaders of the world, that in summary everyone is doing a bad job right now, do you agree that collectively the world is heading to a climate triggered natural disaster apocalyse?
