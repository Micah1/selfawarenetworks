I'm an author, a programmer. I am Creole & Jewish, Neurodivergent, Autistic, He/Him pronouns, vrma.io

I'm a matrix hacker (math, code, physics, webxr, neural networks). A neurohacker (writing code for brain machine interfaces, I design new brain computer interface technologies, and I write about the quantum physics of neurophysics, quantum gravity, and I design space warping sentient self driving vehicles.) I'm a book author (in progress), a patent creator (in progress), a science institute founder (in progress), a software architect.

I am currently writing a patent application for conscious robots, brain machine interfaces, and space warping vehicles.

I am writing a book about the quantum physics of neurophysics, how human phenominal consciousness works, how to hack the human mind with technology, the book includes a new extension of Quantum Gravity.

I am this year (2021) starting a new science institute.

I work on climate change, global economic issues, I help to resolve international conflicts, I'm a consultant for governments and corporations on advanced technologies, I support artists and cancer research.

I've been writing code with javascript since 2010, I create VR and AR applications with WebXR, Aframe, Threejs, and other related code libraries since 2017. I have been a community organizer who has in the past hosted coding meetups, talks about neuroscience, the metaverse, vr ar tech, and artificial intelligence tech.

I am also currently architecting code designs for novel new self aware neural networks.

Always seek wisdom, continually improve, learn from mistakes & successes, goodwill towards others is the best path to long term success, fight to do right!
