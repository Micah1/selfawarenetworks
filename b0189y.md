One thought is interview and expert on oscillations and physics especially in terms of like how oscillations really to other oscillations and really like strange bizarre oscillation dynamics. And like I think I need to finish rhythms with the brain to see what else in there, but I definitely need to dive deeper into the theoretical properties of the of oscillators.

00:30

Okay. Okay. And then I want to dive, I want to do a deep dive into. How how tommography works will. Do like all the different kinds of demography in terms of like how to market works throughout medical imaging in terms of like electrical impedance demography, but they won't do track, targety and then we'll do four years, slice projection, theorem.

00:57

And then we'll have to the point is to like discuss all the different ways. Then this included at the topic of like choreography but also like it's all about, it's really about all the different ways that that we can do imaging. Now that are causing huge advances in like light are, there's like light are RGB fusion, there's deep learning, on light.

01:29

Our RGB fusion in terms of like 3D, semantics segmentation of objects plotting, the velocity of objects for self-driving cars, the velocity, and momentum have objects. There's yes or this. This is like this is really important because it goes into how out of many parts. How many pieces from many different angles.

01:58

Sensory data can be collected in combined and formed and and then we need to like dive deep in from to go from medical imaging into neural networking in terms of like you know the neural network is is putting together really massive images. But also translating apparently, apparently we're transmitting of virtual portraits meaning information about both sensory data and and motor data all over the brain like throughout the neural networks at high level from from.

02:39

And I say high level because I'm talking about like one cortical area to 2000 make bridge to another cortical area. That's a high level transfer because because most of the traffic coming in from the sense is going to go up through the bottom columns and it's not, it's like it goes up to the bottom columns.

03:01

It's not it's it's columnized traffic, it's traffic has been narrowed down to a column and and the stuff that goes, you know, between columns that's that's less common data, that's at the peak. That's like the, this one. You get to the six, the fifth and six layers of the neocortex and you find the apical.

03:23

You find a fair middle.

03:30

The perimeter cells and criminal cells are linked together. Different cortical columns and these critical columns are not just sending information across to synchronize this one another, but they're sending actual sensory and motor information back and forth. All right, so they're all in. The majority of them are modulated majority of the of the talented bridge.

03:56

Pathways are actually modulating the sensor motor activity and so I hypothesis here. You know we have hey if simultaneous projector between the like what I'm saying it's like you have you're saying so for data. So it's like you're sending flexending the light of a projector back. So you had to ability to capture enormous images and concepts spacially and then transmit them like translated like five rocks, right?

04:33

You're transmitting since the information through through them out, the landmark bridge between portable areas and you're sitting like sensory information. The sensory information is like projector information, right? It's, it's information. Signals discrete patterns information signals encoded in the font and the firing activity of neurons. It's being transmitted across regions, so that's like, it's almost like fiber optics, right?

05:04

It's like fiber optics between computers. It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like we have this. It's like imagine each neuron. Is its own recognition, pattern, recognition, pattern creation system, but they can work collectively with other neurons to to create larger patterns. So patterns that have distinctions temporally and spatially and physic differences, okay?

05:35

And so these patterns are contained, basically, it's like saying that the brain captures reality bottles it and then virtualizes it. So it can flow all around the brain and as the flow, is as reality flows around the brain, then you picking up on and you have different that you different areas of the brand that are recognizing that and coordinating their their responses.

06:06

But the key thing is that they have to coordinate the responses for your brand to work. And in order for them to coordinate their responses, they have to listen to what's being created and that is the whole key to why it works the way it does.
