Neo Mind Cycle

In a Neo Mind Cycle session we use EEG to capture a live sample of the subjects brainwaves and import the readings into the computer where use a program to add tracks of light and sound effects to those sample brainwave patterns, this allows a subject to see and hear reflections of some of their brainwaves and it creates a powerful meditative trance like experience the properties of which are malleable through the customization of the light and sound effects but also are dependent on the subject because the subjects own brain learns to drive the changes in the light and sound effects.

Participants in this program will learn to become increasing conscious of their brainwaves, or at the very least they will gain a sense of how their thoughts and feelings are effecting the light and sound effects. The audio visual effects also incorporate brainwave entrainment via isochronic beats.

Neo Mind Cycle combines the proven benefits of Neurofeedback, with the proven benefits of Brainwave Entrainment. So that your brainwaves are driving an isochronic stimulus which sort of massages your thinking in a broad range of frequency patterns specifically for peak moments in gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta brainwave activity.

Your EEG waves combined with the isochronic beats drive the light and sound effects and this is thought to trigger large numbers of neurons in matching or similar firing patterns. This experience for some people can result in strange recollections and creative new ideas. Effects vary a lot from person to person, and your experience may be unique.

As you begin to recognize how your internal feelings, thoughts, and modal sensory representations are effecting the light and sound you can begin to have some very minor control over the light and sound changes. This experience can be thrilling but also dissappointing because it's not perfect, although that may be in part due to the limitations of EEG and or limitations of the software.

Ideally when the light and sound is removed, you can continue to experience some increased sense of control over your inner state, perhaps in a way that is new to you. You may experience a sequence of Eureka moments in the weeks that follow the Neo Mind Cycle experience.

The isochronic stimulus makes this happen faster, because neurons that fire together wire together, it begins to create links in the mind between brain regions, combining the visual, the auditory, the feeling, and any internal representations or thoughts you are having while using this technology.

To create real lasting change a person with Neurofeedback a person might need to do it on a regular basis, maybe once a week, for 10 months or more. Trying this experience a few times shouldn't have any long term effects, leaving aside the remote possibility that this could trigger an upsetting and painful Kundalini Awakening in a small percentage of the population who were perhaps headed for that experience anyways.

The technology works fast, it's noticeable the first time (for most folks), and you might be, for example, extra creative on the first night after you use it. One person that I met felt like she needed to clean her house the night she tried it, and the next day she was very surprised by how much cleaning she got done.

So you can expect this experience to stimulating for up to a few days after, usually with positive results, and the potential for long term benefits.

You might suddenly have a great idea, that is really convenient for your life.
