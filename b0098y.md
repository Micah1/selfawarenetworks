Photocopier Oscillator Neurons Graph

00:00

What I want to know is that the the it's possible that they the dendrites. Synaptic postnat, postnaptic configuration? I mean, no not the Denver. It's possible at the exit the exit terminals configuration, you know, I guess it's weird. It's like, you know, we have to consider you have to ask a question is, is the configuration of this synapse going to, in real time, in the external?

00:37

I'm going to real in real time match the pattern of the synapse. And my guess is that the answers know that the that the that the exit terminals pattern is not going to have the same number of connections to the same number of places to represent the same kind of pattern.

00:57

What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?

01:23

So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.

01:42

In the case of cereal and then you know that is that that's either going to tell the the neuron on the receiving end of this and as in the post analytic membrane to either like speed up slow down fire, or be inhibited like those are the four different messages that the perceiving neurons could hear.

02:04

But yeah. So like it's either speed up, slow down and it went by speed up is the same as like, yeah, you hear, you get more electrical charge or it, you know. But see what matters is even though there's like this sort of like four different messages of like speed up slowdown, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not necessary up to the neuron that's beneath.

02:31

Because sending sending a three might have an inhibitory effect or sending a one might have a spiking effect and that's just because like a three, like a three is like an inhibitory amount. It could be any, well, it could be an inhibitory amount, right. But in terms of opening up the potassium and causing like, the potassium is to flood out really fast, which would make it harder for the cell to fire.

03:10

It would like that would be like a slow down message or an inhibitory message. If, if it prevents itself from ever flying in the first place. And then sending like, opening if you sent if if the no transfer were sent to a synapse that was like mostly calcium receptors and that cell is going to be excited.

03:28

It's gonna like a speed up message and and then, possibly, the cell could be, could fire if it gets a lot of those at least two. So we decided on earlier to speculating that a bit of information is, is a coincidence in space time. It's a coincidence of two or more neurons either, you know, space either firing at the same time because because they have a temple relationship or close to one another with it like a few milliseconds or within a certain like, you know, physical distance.

04:12

Like it's, it could be a spatial related ship and could be a scale based relationship. Like you can have a scale environment relationships where two patterns of existed different scales that the brain can can relate them together and even convert like, you know, patterns from small skills to our skills and back to small skies again.

04:44

And but I primarily see, I primarily see the the well I mean the learning mechanism is is fact or learning system, but it has multiple scales of processing, they positive. So I imagine that, you know. So basically, like what I have is a hypothesis for how synapses are related to human memory, both short-term and long-term but also how oscillations?

05:18

Amplified those memories or they amplify like whatever, so, whatever signal the

05:30

The, as a terminal outputs, right? That's that is a signal that. Means something slightly different each one of the neurons connected to each one of the receiving sides of the synapse. And, but it might be, it might be linked. Like like there might be like, yeah. So so either like the other neurons are like listening to a pattern that includes that signal or they're not listening to impair that includes a signal and so it'll get through or it has or, you know, that that postsynaptic neuron has several different potential patterns that can part that can that can use that signal and then another signal has to be provided by some other neuron so that could be part of us.

06:31

It could be part of a signal or it can be, you know, and you know, I could have the result of inhibiting, some some, some neurot The reason I thought I was scaling, very computing, was in, in part from thinking about the brain is faculty for years and the practical was easy, trying to with everyone recently.

06:55

The faculty with EG for many years and energy for many years. And in the human body, you can think of the fact that also my experience with perceiving, the universe is impractical with the new mind cycle. Those are all reasons for why I thought of well, well, maybe it's, you know, this part of like, you know, why is what, why is perhaps the, the brains activity, magnifying, a pattern.

07:34

Where the neuron, it wasn't. It wasn't it. Kind of wasn't until I was reading the book snap by, I mean sink book sync. I that mathematician that I sort of like he mentioned, he's talking about oscillators, right? So also there's this book called rhythms of the brain by and major scientists measure the major influencer sign, a neuroscientist and Giorgio Brusaki.

08:07

And he, he's talking about the, the rhythms or the oscillations of the brain. And then this book started, this book sink to have more about oscillations after reading the talk about because he didn't like he started to go and that but he didn't go into super death and how authors work and this book Saint does which is very eliminating.

08:33

And but they mentioned that, you know, the the idea he mentioned that in the context of like there, he says they were trying to figure out sort of like the paradox. They're trying to prove that the that that a bad spot which is like if you start, if you start the, the oscillators, if your group of random austers, in one of them has a bad bad spot.

09:05

I mean it doesn't absorb and then what's being passed around and the neurons don't reach equilibrium. I mean actually just to make it more more simple. It's it's yeah, all things are all three of those things are. True is it doesn't, but the two things are true is that it's the first neuron that you start with that.

09:26

Just that kicks the other neurons and the the group of neurons is not end up in oscillation with each other. So that, I mean that could happen. Actually, if you have, you know, a neuron, that's just too far apart in terms of it's it's it's, it's awesometory properties. Like maybe it's a really big neuron and it just doesn't, it just takes too long to come to an isolation and so nothing can sync with it.

09:55

But the the idea of like so I guess. But it's, it's like, well, you so you can only consider something that is part of the awesome. The part of the potential oscillating unit is all the, the number of neurons that actually could belong to that oscillating unit or something like that, which again, it doesn't, it doesn't like it.

10:22

These are like, you know, descriptions in mathematics. Like, I don't know if the supplies to like a little brain, but, but he was saying that basically, like if you had a bad spot and this is very abstract, Matthew stuff. Like, I don't know. What what a what exactly a bad spot is in the human brain like like because it couldn't be just a neuron.

10:43

That's so it's not but in this in a scenario it's not the bad spot is not in neuron, it's not a physical location. It's more like a point that doesn't get absorbed. So it's like a point that gets transmitted so it's like it does get kicked from one neuron to the next.

11:03

So it is. So, the neurons are receptive, you're receiving it, but it's not decreasing. And so that would mean that the neurons that are like, I guess absorbing good spots, they're moving towards equilibrium bypassed by kicking, you know, some other extra energy down to the next one, causing the next one to speed up or slow down.

11:29

And and eventually they all they all like just they you know like like as if it was is this oscillator was just like water in a cup. Eventually they all sort of flatten out with the same surface. It's no more perpetration. It's pertubations on the surface of the water anymore.

11:51

No more sloshing around of liquid. All of the neurons are firing and sink. A really close to being sink like within, you know, milliseconds of each other, right? And and and and even even the you know that that's presuming that they're not too different from. When we went from one another and not too far apart, they can exert this kind of sort of oscillatory influence and this is this is the same basic principles of life through our thought to apply to biological oscillators and not and non-biological oscillators alike.

12:27

I mean from what was described in the book I I'm thinking maybe there's there's actually not a lot of study on biological oscillators in terms of like you know what unique properties. They might have that a physical oscillator doesn't have, there's lots of interesting ideas, but but the keep it, but.

12:49

So in in the book think he said something like, you know, if the bat spots occupy

13:02

Some of the space that belongs to the neurons that can or equilibrium a technically has no service area because you think that? Well so the outside of the there's a can sort of like get in sync become like the new the new set or the new area that points can can exist in that the points can exist in because they're absorbable.

13:27

And so that so it's like there's a new set of neurosod oscillator that doesn't include whichever known. Has that bad point at any given point in time and I don't know. I think I'm still it's like it's so confusing and so abstract that I'm not like, I'm not 100% sure that I'm understanding this correct.

13:53

This concept friendly of bad spots but anyway it's a so it's just like he mentions like that if you if you have a smaller set then their fits inside the bigger set. It's like, the, the fitness, you know, the person in fitness who has like a, like, their thinner, and after three months fitness training, because they actually lost weight, but they fit inside the, the set of the previous previous body which their body had more volume.

14:29

So, like, it's like it's a shrunken down version of the same set, but he says something like the, the area is something like the area for the for each part of the new set where it have to be like, like each each each this isn't he said, the new set was sort of take up more area because it's like the photocopier enlargement function.

15:15

I was like, what is like what do you mean if photocopier function is an oscillator like, like a photocopier like and but not just photocopy, but in a large, it enlargement function isn't making an image bigger. I thought this video was saying, and it's not and apparently this not what he was saying, but it was such a good idea, but he was saying something.

15:36

Like the photocopier enlargement function is sort of like, if you considered the subset of the set, that is the set of all things that do not have bad spots. On them that said in it has a smaller area but then he was saying something like but then it has a larger area as it.

16:07

So if you took each and every point or maybe he was saying like hypothetically if we use something like a photocopier to take every every point in the area, right? And basically magnify it. So it's like if you have a maybe a digital photocopier is a better example, but you have basically like you've turned the entire page into an array of dots that either have, you know, some degree of color on them or white or you know, like blue sort of the primary colors, blue, yellow, and red or blue, green, and red for the computer.

16:44

The primary colors are or the greener, right? So you see on the screen but for the real life as they all are, instead of going, right? But you have this, these You have these sort of

17:12

We have started. I mean it imagine just a black and white photograph. Right. So you have some black dots from some white dots that represented the pixels on the piece of paper. And and you if you you know if you separate all of them by exactly the same amount and then a large what each of them has if it has a dot on it and that is a marsh.

17:34

Then you end up enlarging the whole picture without really changing the picture. You just magnifying it. And so, so that I think they're saying that in that example, like the, the area of the bad spot would increase from would potentially increase from having a mini school area to having like a significant area.

17:57

So we could go from something that you couldn't accidentally trigger because you could only you could only land on you can only land on that. The good points can only like associate with a subset of the whole set. I mean they they can't like the bad points, can't be absorbed and they can't become good points so they can't.

18:21

So they're not really considered an ultimate like abstract calculation of how a point. So you're always like one point last and this total number of points that you as you have if there's a bad point. So it's not considered, but at the same time, if you magnify all the points, that would mean that at that point would take up a significant amount of space.
18:46

Other, I don't like like if if a multiple if a multiplier could apply to it. I mean, if you could multiply every space by by by one, every space by two or just a magnifying, then the one has bad space in. It would then have more area and somehow, that's a contradiction to it.

19:04

Having more area being able to fit inside the set that I came with be a contradiction, unless it had zero area. The first place that that, is that like a little confusing sort of argument? Like, I'm not. I still like, I still like I am wondering, if I will get to a point where I'm just not like feeling very confused about how abstract that argument is.

19:33

But like, I think so, I think, eventually it's gonna be easier, but, but I'm feeling like the so I feel like I had this idea that, you know, the, you know, going back to the brain having fractal patterns at multiple scale that have been identified with EEG medical imaging with the EG and in, and energy and FMRI.

20:01

Then the idea that there's a photocopier enlargement function associated with an oscillation, which is hand flooding, and the in eye sort of like, you know, in thinking about this book, think about exactly book and think it also about this book sink was that, you know, that the oscillating group of the whole neural oscillator is not going to oscillate at the same time because you have first of all, if you have a bunch of neurons that are going off and sending signals to the extra terminal that's going to cause the set of the of its external to become inhibited.

20:42

Instead of it's an external will receive a signal. It is is as if it's being instructed to slow down because that's what this what it's going to do. Because maybe it's potassium channels open faster or something or this or the the sodium channels are inhibited something and then you have this other situation where you know a faceobok first happened and either attack either sodium channels open up a lot faster or potassium channels.

21:19

Open up a lot faster depending on what receptors are over there. And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.

22:08

And then that's going to affect further versus, you know, whether the receiving neuron is going to be super excited and that's like enough signal which, you know, from that one. Not from other neurons that it has, we just threshold it fires or it just gets a bump and says, okay, well you need to go a little bit faster even if it's not your threshold this time or it gets in, you know, or gonna go a little bit slow or or just become completely inhibited.

22:35

So, these are like the force sort of signals and that neurons might be sending each other. Probably, you know multiple signals are happening signals. Multiple signals are having salmon simultaneously in terms of like and all 


has to do is pass on the phase. The face pattern that it has, that sort of has average the the face patterns that it is perceptive to because it's constantly intercepted field is constantly changing based upon, it's synaptic connections and in the dendrites.

23:14

And but it's receptive. Output is like, okay, can I just transmit my phase to to a whole array so becomes like, one LED and an array and it's brother. Neuron is going to be. I might might become a spot of darkness or the, you know, in that same sort of like array that seen by many different neurons.

23:39

So if like if it's possible like it seems like it's obvious that that the enlargement function of a copier makes sense here. But if it didn't make sense the idea of a the next best idea who could be that of an imperfect copier, it's making an imperfect copy and so that wouldn't like as far as how the brain scales.

24:19

Things scales ideas. I mean you're gonna need another, another explanation I guess, but so I at the moment I'm like I'm in favor of the idea that I the oscillator has behaves like like the enlargement function on the photocopier for another set of cells to watch a movie and internal movie.

24:49

And and the whole brain, basically oscillates, like the oscillatory patterns of the whole brain. The brainwave patterns, they act as a sort of central decentralized observer network and that is observing with the face state of the brain and at as a as you like almost like a computer rendered or neural network rendered experience of reality when literally, there's like four dimensional renderings of where sounds are coming from that are get associated with visual renderings and hearing renderings and all sorts of lakes you know sensory rendering of sustainers together but the you know different.

25:48

So I mean, the brain is like, I when I look at it, it's, it's not not a graph. Now that work I just set, you know, right now like graphing on networks. Don't have this sort of like notice it is a graph known network in a sense, but it's also like a multi scale graph.

26:10

Now network with, but internal representations, that sort of overlap at multiple scales. And then and then sort of like feedback on each other sickly please, so that they can make sense it in human timeframes. The sort of like the biological self where network? Yeah, that's positive. It has a lot more structural complexity right now than graphing, all that works.

26:50

But essentially, it's it's it is in part a kind of graphing on network I guess.
