Question to Dr Boris Konrad @boriskonrad .com Memor

00:02

And many people. In the 70s can be better than they ever were literally if they just used their brain correctly using for example the money techniques.

00:17

Is that regardless it doesn't matter. Years the method of low side it can first and benefits as long as there's not a physiological impediment such as amyloid plaques that we see from Alzheimer's is that correct see? I used way too many words.

00:48

I'm all for that hey I just want to say I love the people in this room so many incredibly great questions. I've benefited from everyone's questions thank you so much we are now going to go to hot and joy go ahead if you have a question or comment. I totally have some quick questions.

01:12

I could send a doctor Conrad. It's mica this is mica here. All right so um so I was I was I have a few rapid fire questions so one is what about the possibility of because I've heard that attention deficit disorder has sometimes there's like less blood activity and the the frontal cortex or the prefrontal cortex are part of the brain and a frontal lobes and what what I meant is it.

01:46

I've also heard that it's been compared to Alzheimer's in terms of Alzheimer's and in ADD or ADHD are both memory. Disorders and so so I've also heard that so creatine there's some studies to say creatine can improve memory and blood flow and then some people are saying if you get like a 40 hertz vibration plate that can improve your your blood flow and perhaps your memory, so I wanted your feedback on that and I don't know if you need to write this down because it's a lot to remember but what about also new tropics and there was a study that came out about Alzheimer's and said that new protein synthesis animals treated with the chemical to induce more.

02:28

New protein synthesis, we're able to recover some of their memory and so I'm curious about you know is is is new isn't is is are there chemicals that can that can that that we can use that can improve our our protein synthesis to improve our long-term memories and probably the last question is are there really like lots of different types of memory because I think that's like episode of memory and and all these other types of memories, it's like it's, It's you have long you've long-term potentiation.

03:08

Long-term potentiation and you have a long-term depression and you have short-term memory, which is the activity of neurosurgeons and I think that's about it and the rest is like, I don't know, maybe it's a just ideas anyway, those are my questions. I'd love to hear your your thoughts.

03:32

And. So you started if I'm right this ADHD at all times, so I'm just because they have a big row. Context has been growing most of these doesn't necessarily need their are related so yes you guys are free from the cortex is where we think memory student planning happens, we're working memory has the seeds in a way it's always networking and therefore different diseases that the fact you attention as well as your memory have effects in there or the other way around if you see damages or issues which prefrontal cortex it's so surprising the different memory of focused functions might be effective but there's no links.

04:16

So far between these two diseases, so I need to know studies didn't found for example people was ADHD developing Alzheimer's more often than others, so I hope that answers of creating and learning about shows this is something I'm not too confident with a good answer on that so it's certainly well interact with each other but I'm not aware of any studies looking into creating supplementation for any memory process at least you ask about others as well, well, I need to study which I found really interesting together.

04:51

Me or it was a looked into various forms of which you guys looked into where responsibility.

05:05

Actually treatment could take would be it purely training-based strategy often in your tropics you found that they helped only those begin with deficit so high performance typically do not tend to benefit even from things like retelling if you start from some form of attention deficit which might not be diagnosed but might be there effects to show up.

05:40

But in high performance they are relevant at best if not full therefore. I'm not also aware of anything that my diabetes to my knowledge. I think proteins are theory is just like the one model of information this is more similar more following as an interested reader of doing myself, so I would need to keep it short here but I'm not aware of anything we could do sorry yes.

06:09

I really assure the other members at least more. So important forms of memory. I would say there is sensory memory but just the time scale and if you look more closely the long-term memory, for example, we see by people who have. They have full bars with strong informing episodic memories.

06:43

Versus extremely famous case of patrons patient. HM where research and decided to remove physical camp by due to an epilepsy and couldn't form any new long-term memories in terms of interview graphical memory anymore, but in crystal learn movements such as making hitting a golf ball which shows that different forms of memory are actually different members systems.

07:08

Fantastic and like that. And we are going to end on the hour. Bar memory challenge where we are actually I am going to give Dr. Conrad a list of 30 mostly single digit numbers to memorize and see and put his method of loci to the test so for that we are going to try to I'm going to ask that if we can just.
