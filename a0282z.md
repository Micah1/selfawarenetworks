# The simplified version of Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
which can also be called: Neural Array Projection Slice Phase Oscillation Tomography.

Do you remember when you were a kid and your thought that your eyes were projecting light out into the world, well in a sense your eyes are projecting light into your brain, and you are seeing the world inside out, (and upside down), so your eyes are literally projecting phase pattern signals from light into your brain which is where your world is modelled. You are seeing reality inside out.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory_(vision)

"The model of vision as we now know it first appeared in the 16th century, when Felix Platter proposed that the eye functions as an optic and the retina as a receptor. Light from an external source enters through the cornea and is refracted by the lens, forming an image on the retina—the light-sensitive membrane located in the back of the eye. The retina detects photons of light and responds by firing neural impulses along the optic nerve to the brain.
There’s an unlikely sounding quirk to this set-up, which is that mechanically speaking, our eyes see everything upside down"

To explain this concept I need to write the chapter on fractals, how the brain is a fractal of an eyeball, the grey matter on the outside would be like the retina of the eyeball, the midbrain would be a focal point like the back of the eyeball, the repeating fractal at different scales serves to make the brain a giant lens, a fractal of how the eyeball is a lens

I want to create art that shows a grid of eyeballs each with an led behind them, creating an image for the next grid of eyeballs, but then explaining that the neuron is like the fractal of an eyeball, the dendrite is the sensor, the axon is like the cable, and the exit terminal is the light.

Imagine that your eyes are shining light into your brain, now this is not the case, photos bounce off proteins in the retina, causing them to flip which triggers those cells to spike, triggering cascades of neural activity, waves of electric & chemical signals that affect your entire brain.

In note a0569z from 2012 I wrote about an experience with psychedelic mushrooms that may have happened between 2009-2011

"Micah Blumberg Another time I traveled through a parallel dimension of spacetime, into another universe. To visit some amazing new people, who I had connected with because psychoactive mushrooms had become the gateway between realities, and as I walked Berkeley and San Francisco with these men who were both born assigned women, I was in three layers of reality at once, and reality was breathing, and I saw people who had seemed like individual before, but I realize that they were like 200,000 people all at once, each person was like another parallel reality of the same person. They all said "I am" as if they were all unique, but all of these unique individuals were all the same, sharing a quality of their personality. I realized the personality was transcendent, the personality was driving them and not the other way around."

in audio note b0100y I went into much more detail about that experience 

I said:
"think it was The Holographic Universe. The first couple chapters of that book are really great. After I began reading that book I began to hallucinate from the mushrooms. I could see multiple versions of the universe overlapping one another like layers in a 3D virtual reality photoshop that was reality. As if reality was a transparent onion with many layers. Each of the layers was slightly different, as if they were distinguished by tempo-spatial distinctions, or slight differences in their scale, their properties, or their position in space.

"01:18

:The differences were so slight however that I could barely sense their phase shifts, the differences in their phase shifts.
If you imagine that you are basically experiencing, like when you look around in reality, that you're experiencing a compounded pattern, that is lots of different patterns that your brain is individually rendering are vibrating, oscillating, patterns that are harmonically unifying to create your whole experience.

"01:51

"I would say these are like oscillations that have been imprinted with neural patterns, but these are decoherence patterns, decoherent phase patterns, inside the oscillations normal sync."

For the ear, there are still neurons involved, but we will replace the imagery with grids of ears, and on the back of the ears are speakers, but each ear represents a dendrite, and each speaker represents the exit terminal of that neuron, and behind that grid is another grid of neurons that also have ears on them, and speakers behind them.

The grids of eyes with lights on the back, the grids of ears with speakers on the back, are really just arrays of dendrites from neurons with exit terminals going to other grids or arrays of dendrites with exit terminals going to other neural arrays or grids or cortical columns.

So NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography means that your "Neural Arrays" are Projecting an Oscillating Phase Pattern that other Neural Arrays perceive and then Project, and all the arrays are bound together in space & time via oscillation to collectively Sense & Render, Sense & Render, Sense & Render your perception of reality.

So you might have the intuition that your eyes are projecting light into the world, because in a valid sense your eyes are projecting light information into your brain that your whole brain is sensing & rendering and putting together a tomographic rendering of reality, that it can parse, segment, and understand in a distributed way.

If we consider that your eyes are like cameras, what is in the eye? neurons, and neurons sense with the dendrite. Then the same neurons send a signal, that signal a transmission. So neuron is a device that senses something and transmits something. The neurons in your eyes sense images and transmit them to the brain. The neurons in your ear sense sounds and transmit them to the brain.

Whether these sensor transmittors are located in your eyes or in your ears they are still just nerve cells, sensing with the dendrite, transmitting with the exit terminal, and the neurons they are transmitting to are also sensing with dendrite and transmitting with the exit terminal.

The interneurons, the neurons that are not in contact with the world directly, they also have to sense images or sounds or some tactile information or some other kind of information pattern.

What matters is what kind of information pattern is moving around the brain between these nerve cells, that could carry information.

Phase variations can carry information, and that is what passes between neurons, changes in phase patterns, from the normal oscillating tonic pace setting current, to high phasic phase changes resulting from spikes, to mid level plateu phase burstlets, to inhibited neurons.

Phase variations between neurons across the networks of the brain are enough to carry the information of the mind, a mind that can render a pattern of what you are looking at, what you are feeling, hearing, tasting, smelling, standing on, balancing, moving, planning to move, or inventing next week.

Phase variations in the oscillating networks of the brain are the substrate of the mind, they are the computational rendering of reality as you and I know it.
