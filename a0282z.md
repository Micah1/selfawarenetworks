# The Mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute

The research of The Self Aware Networks Institute leads to technology that can inhale gasses like carbon & release other gasses like oxygen (like plants). 

Plus tech that can absorb clouds of nuclear radiation following an atomic blast. Imagine we could manufacture carbon dioxide & methane absorbing trees 10,000 times faster than it takes to grow trees.

Thatâ€™s part of the mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute! Please share advice on how The Self Aware Networks Institute can get 
funding. It is critical to life on this planet we focus on this project full time & recruit others to help!

We will solve climate change. Sentient Self Aware Artificial Neural Networks. 3D printed life, artificial lungs, artificial plants that can selectively absorb gasses. Dog level sentient construction robots. Sentient vehicles. Next generation antigravity propulsion technologies.

Developing next generation Synthetic Biology, for things like artificial photosynthesis, and machines that eat radiation like fungi are among the goals of research of The Self Aware Networks Institute.

I am imaginging windmills that power atmosphere filtration systems that consume carbon dioxide, methane, even radiation.

Such as a machine that eats radiation like Chernobyl Fungus only faster.

Also we will build next generation Sentient AI based targeting systems for missile interception that can work with GPS or independently from GPS like a bird that hunts only much much faster than a bird.
