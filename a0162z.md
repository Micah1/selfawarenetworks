The famous double slit experiment, has been analyzed by many, reproduced many times, by independent teams. The particle has a wave pattern unless you observe which slot it went through. I think I know. I will explain in the book.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment

Its that the oscillator that represents the configuration of the observer has a strange configuration space that attracts particles and energy from other oscillators

a beam of light moving through space at the speed of light is equivalent in gravitational power to an oscillator

so basically the observation of a particle warps space between the observer and the particle, it warps the spacefield because time moves faster in the line between the oscillators the observer and the observed

this causes the potential wave pattern of one powerful oscillator to be replaced with a particle that represents accelerated space between two oscillators within range of each other

the consequence is that light has a gravitational effect

so we can joke that light is the gravitational particle, but its a joke because all particles are gravitational in physics.

I overheard some say that Flash was ahead of its time that it has mesh UDP for video streaming

I said what is that? 

Imagine polygon mesh UDP! Each point, line, and triangle surface is send seperately as vectors over UDP with a neural network on the recieving end reconstructing the message. This is like that Nvidia  ai video streaming speedy

okay so my great business idea 

was that to use neural networks

the idea is to do an array swap with a variable GNULL when the user grabs an item from the array

when the user lets go it drops, a timer goes off, and the animation block that is GNULL initiates a retrieval and then is swapped out at which point it does nothing since its invisible

but if the user grabs another item while GNULL is active then 

okay lets say no array swap happens

but just that after the items are done animating they are free to pull
