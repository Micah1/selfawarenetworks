(field, vector, tomography)
lets combine the list of tags with the list of topics & list of chapters & list of arguments

imagine that when you put your coffee cup down on a counter that is a phase field in your brain representing your hand, the coffee cup, the counter, and the room you are in, and that its rendered in sequences with your eye movement and headmovement, like an image being rendered to a tv screen except that only the tv can see it, the tv's neural network I mean, that is doing its own graphical rendering of reality with its chemical body.

integrated information theory could be renamed the localized & connected but also informative information theory, or the brain has information theory

or the synchronized & desynchronized information theory

I am arguing that the brain has graphical information representing each of our senses in a four dimensional vector graph

with the concept of space not being fundamental to cognition but instead learned through neural tomography.

some phi will be about the graphical resolution of your internal representations, and how much complexity your patterns can have in your waking memory simutaneously, like the different between video games from pacman being like your brain when you were a baby, to street fighter having the complexity of your mind when you were in grade school or elementary, the ninja turtles when you were in 7th grade, 

so imagine that a dogs understanding of reality was more like the game street fighter 2 compared to your reality that might be closer to grand theft auto 5 then street fighter 2

I think perhaps that the phase field is a prediction of reality a few steps forward in time, so that our actions can become aligned with our movement through space, or so our muscles are aligned with the environment. So the reality I am seeing is a rendering of the near future by a small amount lets say by one millisecond.

It is like I am rendering one millisecond of reality in each interval of time as I perceive it.

The timing is a match for how fast I can coordinate my muscle movement.
