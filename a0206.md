When it comes to who you are, in the context of neuroscience, I think György Buzsáki is correct that people are not born as blank slates, the human body has natural preferences. I agree with Yann LeCun that humans have specialized intelligence not general intelligence.

Yet looking at the story of Phineas Gage or reading Oliver Sacks & Michael Gazzaniga's work on Split Brain Patients you know that personalities do change. You may not be able to change yourself with willpower as that's a paradox, but that doesn't mean you won't change over time.
