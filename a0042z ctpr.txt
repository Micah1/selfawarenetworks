Electric Field of a Sphere

The electric field strength is measured by two charged spheres causing each other to turn towards each other, the visible torque

because there is a charge being added to it, because charge is increasing in the center of the earth it has a magnetic, electric, a mechanical vibrational field, and a chemical field

the scale of the space around a sphere is about how much positive or negative charge is inside that sphere because that defines the efield strength or the scale of the effect

the inverse square of the radius means that the larger surface area of the sphere the more the field strength is diffused across the surface

(in the moment that a neuron fires, it expands, increasing its size, its radius, and its gravitational force, attracting electric particles, vesicles, neurotransmitters, and waves of various types from neurons that are also firing in that moment. This is a key mechanism establishing the LTP dendrite spin growth between neurons)

but this means that spacetime will curve according its distance from the center of the sphere because the field is 

but that also spacetime is really stretched out to begin with, but energy that is being released by fusion for example inside stars is going to increase the radius of space

I have a novel hypothesis for how we might create warp drive engines like in Star Trek with fusion reactors! Lol. We can travel through space really fast. I also have a novel idea for how the teleportation of information can work at great distances. Quantum Field Theory stuff.
The weird conclusion I have is that the shape of the spaceship is relevant to this. How Gene Roddenbery put all this together in his day is amazing, but I think he was right.

The thing is that the surface of a sphere is where the electric field is going to dissipate because of the inverse square of the radius

so that is where the brainwaves would be delta, at that level Gamma would be smaller the 40hz Gamma, that means theta is close to delta but in a smaller sphere? alpha and beta close to the center of the brain with high gamma being closer to the center of the brain
