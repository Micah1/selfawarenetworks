Before the end of 2022 We will have self-aware sentient AI robots

remember how I showed you the video with lidar and radar, its a story about using neural networks to bridge the differences between the different sensor data divergences, they have a plant to create special training material that will prepare and teach the neural network to track the real world, and then associate ithe points its getting

so for a human being I imagine emotion as a series of points in a field, and I also imagine what I can see as a series of points in a field

you can imagine the pressure of water from a tank through a fire hose out onto a building,
how all the water molecules individually played a role in how that water moved from point A to point B.

the collective action of tiny particles contributed to that outcome

imagine with Bose-Einstein Condensation the bosons, specifically photons are increased in density relative to one another, multiplied with mirrors, and a tiny fraction of that escapes and we call it a laser,

consider the laser as like the firehose for photons instead of water,

and then if we try to do the same thing with fermions, electrons & atoms we call that a fermionic condensate

what's interesting is that the electrons have been described by some as like little bar magnetics, with an up or down spin, that is supposed to be intrinsic except you can separate an electron into 3 parts, a spinon, a chargon or holon, and an orbiton. So the spin is intrinsic except you can flip it with a magnet, or when you put it into a super cooled fermionic condensate of rubidium atoms 10 microkelvins you can put it into super position, where it loses its spin, or its spin is neither up or down, until it's observed or until it encounters a magnet or until it warms up. Similarly super hot iron atoms at above 700 C can also enter a state where the magnetism of iron is lose, because the electron spiin alignment is frustrated by too many other electron magnets in close proximity that are causing it to flip restlessly. 

What's interesting is that this flipping in a hot or cold particle condensate is like a chaotic oscillator, surges of energy fluctuate randomly and as it approaches a temperature where things slow down that liquid starts to crystalize, 

is there a functional isomorphism between something that is super hot and super cold?

what if I could make something so hot it became cold in an instant, and visa versa what if I could make something so cold it instantly became hot?

what if there is a place where the extremes of heat and cold equal the same thing?
