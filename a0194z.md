freedom is not some abstract concept but your very nature. unbounded, infinite, void of self. awaken to this.

Micah Blumberg
I think perhaps "the void of self" is a redefinition of what people call the "I am self" nothingness, or no self is another way of referring to that which is, or isn't, might be, or is sometimes, or is always even if we are not always aware of it.

Mike Dow
it is simply awareness that there is no independently acting self. no where.

Micah Blumberg
yeah, so like there was this scientists, at the dog park, telling me he once advised Nasa Astronauts on how to quit smoking. Going into his theory, he said something that made a lot of sense. There is energy, and there is information. That's it, energy, and information. So body/brain/mind is the energy, and it's label is the information, it's properties are the information. We can label it "awareness" we can label it "no self" and we can label it "self" the only thing you've changed is a label, changing the information. So if someone saids this experience here, this energy, is awareness, then ok, no right perspectives, just perspectives, if someone says this is myself, then ok, no right perspectives.

Mike Dow
that is a bunch of words :) i'm too lazy to type that much right now. i'm not labeling anything. just recognizing cause effect cause. and watching it all unfold.
but i like your style
ok. i'm inspired. words define, give meaning, help communicate. if you say i am anything there is self there is identification. no self. simpler. more direct. identify with what you like. your going to anyways ;)

when people are born, their family trains them into a social contract, one in which they learn to repeat a pattern of identity, these are my eyes, my ears, etc... it's just a pattern that is part of our social contract. 

Mike Dow
oh, i'm aware my friend. don't interpret me as saying i have found the end all be all.

Micah Blumberg
The original illusion is just as valid as any higher realization, because there are no right perspectives

Mike Dow
still, i disagree that no self is a social contract. this would only be if it was understood as a dogmatic truth, not a living reality. it isn't something that has been gained but something that has been lost.
if i'm not mistaken tozan completes it all with the marketplace. like chop wood, carry water. i get that.

Gained or lost are just motion-based metaphors. To your brain, there's no practical difference between something gained and something lost. The whole idea that a group of people can vet your enlightenment isn't right, because we can't judge the enlightenment of other human beings without bringing in our own neurosis to the picture, or our groups neurosis. Enlightenment & Ego are not things that can be gained or lost. Either self exists or it doesn't, there is neither gain or lost that is even possible. Everyone is either enlightened or every is not, because enlightenment is a collective truth, a realization of that which is already true. If the whole universe including everyone else, including yourself is enlightened, then that's enlightened. To think some people are enlightened and other people are not enlightened is shadow neurosis. (unconscious projection)
freedom is an abstract concept unfortunately
either we all have it, or we all don't
At night I walk on an atomic cloud, my dogs and I are also made from this atomic cloud so it's ok. I try to think of a story that will explain my grandfather who is now a great grandfather to my niece. A story that will explain the silence, like something is being with held. It's as if one day my grandfather was in his garden, and he discovered a human head, not just any human head, but his own head, and it was growing out of a plant, a plant that had roots going into the ground, a plant that had branches and leaves like any plant. A plant that was growing a duplicate of my grandfather's head. With working eyes, eye lashes that blinked, that looked at you, silent, blank look. As if there was nothing to think about, it just was. Like we just are. Something that grew from an egg, was pushed out of it's mother, in a rather upsetting ordeal called birth. What are we if not fractal shapes, things that just are, the humming bean, or human being.
