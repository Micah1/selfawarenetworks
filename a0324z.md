In this note we discussed The Neural Correlates of Psychedelic Experiences and how the Module the Phenomenological Consciousness

Months after our conversation this paper (below) appeared.

# The neural basis of psychedelic action
"Psychedelics are serotonin 2A receptor agonists that can lead to profound changes in perception, cognition and mood. In this review, we focus on the basic neurobiology underlying the action of psychedelic drugs. We first discuss chemistry, highlighting the diversity of psychoactive molecules and the principles that govern their potency and pharmacokinetics. We describe the roles of serotonin receptors and their downstream molecular signaling pathways, emphasizing key elements for drug discovery. We consider the impact of psychedelics on neuronal spiking dynamics in several cortical and subcortical regions, along with transcriptional changes and sustained effects on structural plasticity. Finally, we summarize neuroimaging results that pinpoint effects on association cortices and thalamocortical functional connectivity, which inform current theories of psychedelic action. By synthesizing knowledge across the chemical, molecular, neuronal, and network levels, we hope to provide an integrative perspective on the neural mechanisms responsible for the acute and enduring effects of psychedelics on behavior."

"Psychedelics Open a New Window on the Mechanisms of Perception"
This next paper (below) is relevant to our discussion of how psychedelics influence phenomenological consciousness, but it is more general and it illustrates how cognition is something that involves many different observable scales of brain activity, from receptors, to large scale network activity between brain regions.

# Mapping neurotransmitter systems to the structural and functional organization of the human neocortex
"We found that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting-state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncovered a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we found both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical abnormality patterns across 13 disorders. We replicated all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization."
"Receptor profiles shape oscillatory neural dynamics
Given that neurotransmitter receptors modulate the firing rates of neurons and, therefore, population activity, we sought to relate the cortical patterning of neurotransmitter receptors to neural oscillations."

In this transcribed audio note we discuss Acer's Y. C. Chang paper "Information Closure Theory of Consciousness" with Acer Chang.

Some of the first topics in this 6 hours dialog had to do with the Neural Basis of Emotions.

Acer's idea of virtual consciousness: Acer describes Consciousness as virtual, and I compared his work on Virtual Cognition to Engrams and added my thoughts to it. Would virtual brain activity have virtual correlates?

Acer's Y. C. Chang paper was about

Note: My conjecture is that Acer's Non Trivial Information Closure NTIC violates Acer's Information Closure theory, because if Y1 has knowledge of S1, its trajectory is affected by that knowledge. The basis of this argument comes from the book Sync, when Scientists thought that there was no signal passing between synchronizing clocks, but when they removed the possibility of a signal traveling through tiny vibrations in the wooden floor the clocks stopped synching. For Y1 to have knowledge of S1 means that information about S1 has passed to Y1, and that means that Non-Trivial Information Closure isn't a Closed Information System. My conjecture is also that it is impossible for Phenomenological Consciousness to be informationally closed to the environment. Macroscopic brain activity is driven by microscopic brain activity but microscopic brain activity is also driven by Macroscopic brain activity. The simplest illustration is the dynamic between incoming sensory signals, brainwave oscillations, widespread network synchrony, and the thalamo-cortical feedback loops that self-modify brain activity in the cortical columns via thalamic loops. Brain activity is both top down and bottom up, not one or the other.

Information Closure Theory imagines that phenomenological consciousness is an information closed macroscopic brain function that is separate from the microscopic process of signals being transmitted between cells. The argument is that while microscopic processes change the macroscopic process the macroscopic process doesn't need to know about the microscopic process in order to predict its own state.

Self Aware Networks theory differs in that I argue that phenomenological consciousness is not a closed information state, and that it represents the aggregation of microscopic processes, it is not a separate process. When you look around you are seeing the aggregate renderings represented by synaptic frequency states as they change in response to incoming sensory information that passes through neural arrays.

Self Aware Networks theory is similar to Predictive Processing but also different from Predictive Processing in we can argue that inferences are rendered to internally distributed neural arrays and are made conscious through the aggregation of similar isomorphic phase wave differentials, I say similar isomorphic as a phrase to make it clear that the isomorphisms between phase wave differentials are not exactly the same, never the same, but when they are similar enough, and recurrently rendered enough, they become like a persistent object in the environment of the brain, and the persistent tempo-spatial rendering of phase wave differential patterns is a key part of what makes a predictive processing machine a phenomenally conscious machine. The other part is that the rendering of consciousness is a differentiated pattern compared to a baseline tonic oscillation, that is to say that consciousness is a rendered pattern that is different from its own baseline, and it's different from reality without consciousness, it's a distinctly rendered pattern that is tomographically stitched or bound together with the physics of oscillation. That distinction is what makes consciousness exist the same way a painting exists, the brain is rendering the experience of phenomenological consciousness as a substantial material thing. It is not, as Daniel Dennet might argue, an illusion that simply seems to be, but it is temporary like an illusion, and it is virtual in the computational sense that renderings have a temporary existence as an output on a screen, and it is virtual in the sense of virtual particles in that it's individual states exist for a very short period of time. The screen I argue is the configuration of synaptic frequencies at least, but in a sense the brainwave patterns as attractors for changing the synaptic frequencies could also be argued as containing the some component of the screen function, that could be described as a cyclical update function. More precisely one would have to divide the synapse in half with the presynaptic terminal being the inceptive field screen (transmitter), and the postsynaptic receptor being the receptive field sensor.

Self Aware Networks differs slightly from Numenta's description of Sparse Distributed Representation, and the prior description of Sparse Distributed Memory, in that we are arguing that the projections or outputs of a Neural Array constitute a computational rendering.

The brain's neural networks in Self Aware Networks are doing Sparse Distributed Memory-Prediction-Rendering, in dynamically branching neural pathways, inside hierarchical cortical-thalamic, and cortical-cortical feedback loops.

In this talk at 16:55 Acer present's a slide called "The scale problem of consciousness. It's pretty great. To recap he has five levels in his map from high to low:

5. Multi-agent interaction

4. Whole Brain

3. Neuron Population

2. Single Neuron

1. Subcellular Structure.

# What does it mean to discuss EEG as being course grained?
"Coarse-grained modeling" wikipedia
"simulating the behavior of complex systems using their coarse-grained (simplified) representation"
"at various granularity levels."
"In these models, molecules are represented not by individual atoms, but by "pseudo-atoms" approximating groups of atoms,"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarse-grained_modeling

Visually Conscious renderings are coarse-grained graphical representations of reality that are different from a rendering of reality that is atomically precise.

Coarse grained modeling is akin to working with a high level abstraction. The alternative to coarse grained modeling is Atomistic resolution models, which are never going to be efficient enough to handle large system sizes and simulation timescales.

In essence almost all modeling is coarse grained modeling, and even atomistic modeling is technically course grained when compared to physics simulations that model particle collisions.

Therefore the term coarse grained is pretty much implied by default in every kind of modeling, from EEG modeling to molecular modeling, and as such it's a redundant term.

There is a really interesting conversation about epilepsy, and the specific motor outputs that happen during a seizure.
