deep thoughts hmm... how about your thoughts are predictions, memories that become predictions, formed through a process of hebbian learning via the principles of neural plasticity, when neurons fire together they wire together, and so if you can imagine that any object you sense is a great current of electromagnetic wave ossilation richoceting around the mind like an attractor vortex and the messy nature of this three axis heterarchal system means that thoughts are delusional maships of live data from multiple senses, just approximate enough to be useful, for coordinating movement, so that the dna continues to exist in some form. at this point you could probably write off the three types of people as another delusional partition the mind makes, or keep it, shrugs

around a chemical ball, vast networks of electro-chemical reactions, utilize electric and chemical networks predicting, adapting, balancing, and optimizing a whole ecology of electro-chemical interactions, reacting to the electromagnetic waves generated by other chemical balls in a particle space of a looping relationship between increasing complexity (including mass and dissipative systems) and increasing entropy
stars are increasing and decreasing in density, space is electromagnetic indensity
