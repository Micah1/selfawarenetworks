Brain Structures Request

So with mind uploading, I'm like, okay instead of needing to copy the brain. Exactly. We can query the brains data structure from some point in the network one to understand the protocols of networking and and the data structures. So you wouldn't need to copy the brain perfectly. You would just need to, I mean, you would need to scan it, you would, or you could, or you could, I mean, you could potentially scan it through queries like like HTTP requests, you know, FTP requests.

Oops. hmm I left something out when I recorded this

adding to this I'm thinking of bouncing TMS through the brain, to capture the thresholds states of

One of the central problems in neuroscience is the characterization and understanding of the neural code. In 1968 Perkel and Bullock defined four key functions for a candidate neural code: stimulus representation, interpretation, transformation and transmission. Although the first three have been studied extensively, surprisingly, the fourth has been largely ignored in experiments. Yet, signal transmission is a vital functions for a neural code in ensuring communication among highly specialized brain regions.
