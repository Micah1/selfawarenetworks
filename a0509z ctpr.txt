Includes an equation for neurons
(cereb, cortex, neuron) Electronics and psychology.
do you like neurophysics?
do you know a lot about electricity?

how much do you know about neurology? for example
the action potential
in a neuron
if it was similar but different to a lightning strike
well the question is about the electron wave/particle

It basically comes down to what the molecules ionic charge is.


3 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
yes


3 hours ago
H.V.
Most molecules are stable in nature, meaning they have an equal amount of protons and neutrons, thus making them ionically neutral.


3 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
the ionic charge in the dendrite becomes more and more negative, and the ionic charge in the branches leading to the synapses become more and more positive, and then the action potential is the electral surge

H.V.
Electricity, simply put, is the transfer of protons and neutrons between molecules. Often times, the molecules will fuse, creating an entirely different compound.

is the action potential, do you think, equivalent or different to the difference potential of a lightning strike?
is "action potential" a "difference potential"?


3 hours ago
H.V.
I believe it to be differential. Whereas the action potential is dependent solely on the dendrite and it's branches, lightning that occurs in nature is free to strike wherever the proper amount of inequal electric charge exists.


3 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
different? or differential?

H.V.
Most meteorologists would say that lightning takes the path of least resistance to discharge; this is quite untrue, actually.

Micah Blumberg
do you know differential calculus?


3 hours ago
H.V.
Lightning not only strikes based on the fastest route to discharge, but also along the route that offers the maximum potential release of energy. The greater the instability in molecules along a lightning bolts path, the more likely it will follow that route.
Yes, I took calculus in high school.
I took it alongside trigonometry.

It was a boring class, except for my teacher. He kept it pretty exciting.
I also took AP chemistry that year, as well.
I have since focused my primary research on genetics and psychology.

what if the neuron was a differential equation, where the topology of the dendrite branch was a change in X, and the topology of the synaptic branches were a change in Y, and the action potential was the divider / that together defines the topology itself as a memory that tracks changes. As if a neurons topology spelled out a differential equation like this: change Y / change X

The greater the disparity between the two, the greater that particular dendrite would fire, triggering the associated memories and actions that go with it.


3 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
with lightning there are return strikes


3 hours ago
H.V.
The greater the chance that particular dendrite would fire, I mean.


3 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
your making perfect sense
and then after the dendrite has triggered the axon too fire the disparity is equalized or is it just closer to being balanced?


2 hours ago
H.V.
Recoil lightning is a result of the effects I just mentioned above. Sometimes when lightning choose the path of greatest electrical disparity, it becomes uneven upon the discharge, and the recoil lightning is triggered to balance out the reaction.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
and there is no chance of that happening in a neuron?
It seems that most of the information in the brain is traveling towards our senses, far more than what is coming in from our senses
it puzzles many people
it's as if it's saying that your thinking is so much bigger than what your actually perceiving

Are you familiar with the sensation of "phantom pain" or "unnormal/irregular pain?"


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
sure


2 hours ago
H.V.
I believe that to be due to recoil fire in dendrites. Most practitioners attribute it to muscle memory, but there are people that experience phantom pain years after losing that limb/nerve ending, and irregular pain cannot be attributed to muscle memory due to it's nature.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
phantom limb pain came up during a neuroscience talk
it has to be in the brain, because the limb isn't there
recoil fire in the dendrite
wow
you really do belong in my neurophysics group
wow you


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
that's an awesome idea


2 hours ago
H.V.
There is a feeling associated with certain memories and when a dendrite recoils due to a greater than anticipated disparity in differential charge, it has the potential to trigger dendrites that are otherwise inactive due to the lack of the nerves it controls being present.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
hmm...
your right
so when the axon charge flows backwards that's pain?


2 hours ago
H.V.
Recoil lightning, and consequently, recoil fire of dendrites, is nothing different than a domino effect. One reaction triggering another due to the proximity and force of the first discharge. It stands to reason that inactive dendrites can thus still fire, if a significant enough charge occurs in the dendrites located in and around the inactive one.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
you said recoil in the dendrite, but not the neuron as a whole?
I mean...


2 hours ago
H.V.
There is essentially no difference between normal and recoil fire other than the direction in which the charge travels. Thus, recoil fire can have a variety of effects, since it is not being determined by what we perceive; it is instead changing our perception. Recoil fire is likely responsible for night terrors, flashbacks, phantom and irregular pain, involuntary nerve response (twitching, RLS), and hallucinations (tactile, auditory, and visual).

Have you ever done brainwave entrainment?
Mind Machines?
Neurofeedback?


2 hours ago
H.V.
That is why my current research into psychology involves studying patterns of behavior to see if the same response is generated each time. If I can successfully prove that each time a person does or thinks a given thing, that they always experience the same involuntary reaction due to a recoil fire, I can prove that these effects can be treated medically through EST. Furthermore, it would give credence to my theory that not all symptoms are a result of chemical imbalance in the brain.

Otherwise commonly referred to as binaural beats.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
yes
youtube now has all kinds of free brainwave entrainment, binaural and isochronic beats
a friend of mind is using neurofeedback to drive the brainwave entrainment 
it's a isochronic light and sound feed back loop, he calls it Neo Mind Cycle 
it's like your brainwaves are driving the entrainment beats

Bejeweled 3 comes packaged with binaural tracks for playing through the zen mode, and I am testing it's effects combined with the game on a small group of people currently.

you know all about NLP too don't you?
many in AI research make the argument that choice is an illusion

H.V.
Choice is an illusion. One cannot elect "not" to choose something. By not choosing to do anything, one is, by default, "choosing" to do nothing.

Imagine the whole brain as a differential equation like the neuron. The Apple represents a change in X, and then your insight into Apple's behavior is the difference potential, and your new understanding of Apple is Y, along with a tiny a corresponding difference in the topology of your brain.


2 hours ago
H.V.
If Apple's actions = change in X (X) and my perception of Apple = change in Y , the result would be my new perception of Apple, which = Z. The equation would thus be stated (X)/(Y)= Z. The greater the disparity between Apple's actions (X) and my perception of them (X) would result in a greater change in my new perception of them (Z [(represented as "did they act as I perceived they would?")]).

Stupid Facebook. That thumbs up should be ( Y ).


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
Okay so if a neuron is (X)/(Y) what is Z? the next neuron it's connected to?
See the idea I had was that Y is your perception
and that when your perception changes it's now Y+1 or Y-1, or something like that
it's a different Y
however Y can also be associated with other perceptions about Apple which may be represented by other cells
Can Z describe the new topology of the neuron as a whole?
What I mean is, if Apple changed it's behavior, and a neuron fired to represent one part of the Apple that you are considering at the moment.
Scratch that.

Z is the result of X over Y, it is an ever evolving equation. Once Z is calculated, calculate it again. Repeatedly. Infinitely.


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
Oh I got it.
Z represents the change in the neurons topology.


2 hours ago
H.V.
Z changes depending on both the actions of Apple (X), and my perception of them , and when you combine my perception of them with what they actually did, you get Z. Z then turns into Y, because it is no longer my "new" perception, it is my current one. X is entered back into the equation over Y whenever Apple acts again, and Z is recalculated. Following me?


2 hours ago
Micah Blumberg
yes
brilliant
your brilliant


2 hours ago
H.V.
So yes, Z is the topology of the neuron AFTER Apple performs an action (X). X is combined with Y to generate the new topology.

Micah Blumberg
so it's like our neurons are memories, and yet the vast majority of electrical information is flowing down toward the senses, not up away from the senses, what do you make of that?
do you buy the idea that ht cerebral cortex is a hierarchy?

H.V.
What we perceive to be real is a combination of things we already feel to be true and what we are currently experiencing. Obviously, what is actually happening cannot change; it either is happening or isn't, thus, misconception about the world is generated from the one source that CAN be altered; our own mind.

Take frostbite, for instance. Frostbite is a result of the cold. Most people are aware of this circumstance when they get frostbite. But imagine if a person, for some reason, was not able to verify that it was indeed cold and got frostbite. They would feel pain associated with being burnt, and due to their misconception of the actual conditions, would thus believe they are being burnt.
