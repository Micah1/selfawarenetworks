# GRAVITY

00:02

Ask myself. What is reality? I asked myself and think about it. Imagine all these 3D waveforms.

What is reality? Reality is reality.

01:27

So, I had this, I have, I've had another idea about how the particle LANES electric and magnetic fields emerging from, from the large body, like a planet like earth

, they they're they're creating electric and electromagnetic fields in space right in, but those fields are going to create force. That that is going to, they're going to create an electric field.

02:05

Between this particle lanes are going to create changes to be electric field in between because part of the lands that are going to be creating directional force on all the particles moving through those lanes.

And so like, you know,

I hypothesize in my gravity equation that there's going to be like, there's going to be like a lot of particle collisions that will be going vertical between like directly to the planet and directly to space.

02:45

But then imagine like the fanning out of lines, right.

Where there's there's if you go to, you got, if you connected two different points on the surface of the sphere, which you had been each one is 90 degrees away from the surface, the surface is as the horizontal, right?

03:08

And 90 degrees away from the horizon so that that's called vertical but it. But if you go, you know, if you go a mile over the vertical direction from the sphere into space is a different direction, it's a different direction because it's because it's because really, it's dark from the center of this sphere and then the lines projects outwards away from .

03:34

And so, if you are, if you're basically like, he go over a little bit, maybe a mile on earth, and I'm just like, for, for the sake of convenience and like, I feel, let's go to imagine a sphere, the size of the earth and a mile over. It's gonna be a perpendicular line is not going to be parallel to any other adjacent perpendicular line emerging from the center of the earth. It's going to be fanning out, right? And so the idea was that these lines are going to be lanes for for particles, you know, like, electromagnetic lines in space and that in between them there. They're going to be shaping the the they're going to be shaping the statistical behavior of all particle to pass through that field.

04:41

So let's say that it particles have a random walk, just like the intro to neural computation talks about how you know particles have a have a drift that is Square of the amount of time. They have a drift so they move very slowly. They would they move at a rate?

05:08

That's just that is use it. You take the amount of the time interval and you find the square root of it. And that's the amount of the particle has drifted. So, the square root, I guess that means you need to take a number of times. Another number to get time.

05:31

So if time equal was equal to 4 and that would mean that the square root 4 is 2 and 2x 2 is four, right? So if if you had so if time is for then and the particle has drifted by two by amount of by distance to

05:58

Or and in that. So in that case, it's it's it's it's moved by about half. So if the particle, if the time was 9, then you would say well it's square, root of time 9. Intervals of time is is going to be 3, 3 times 3 is 9, right?

06:22

So you can say well it it's moved by about a third but the point is that. So, let's say that there's that's that's like the in the random walk is like we're talking about the distance because, you know, the particle could move in any given direction. Randomly could randomly move to the left, or to the right.

06:45

It's not, it's not likely to move on to straight line, because because it's because it's, it's movement is like,

06:59

It's almost like the flip of a coin. It's almost chance. 

It's a chance. It is. It's a chance like mechanism where the particle doesn't have a deliberate direction to go in.

So it will go in any random direction as it diffuses. So this is the, this is, but we're talking about.

07:16

This is the essence of like the rate of diffusion of of an ion in a in a cell. So this is different from like the rate of diffusion of rate of diffusion of of an electron in space. This is, I don't know. That is going to be, I don't know that it's not going to be, you know, the moving at 

diffusing in the space that a rate that is square root of time.

07:55

But I think my height. My my hunch is that that it can is it's totally different. Depending on like the you know, what's going on in the quantum gravity field. So what I'm thinking is that the closure you are to plan it to earth to or to the center of the earth then they have more.

08:28

Basically been, you're going to have more and its face is going to be more excited, right? It's going to be a lot more particle. Collisions. And then like as you sort of like, you know, head up into the atmosphere, the instead of like, you know, the chances of of space of movement, right?

08:56

It are in a, in a horizontal invertical and a horizontal versus vertical direction, and our effectively is being split apart. So at some point, the chances, like some point when you're close to the center of the earth, the chances of moving horizontally or vertically in any given direction are about the same.

09:23

If you're close to the center of this of a planet or singularity or orbital star, black hole, but the farther you get away from the center the the more you're going to have a sort of like separation and the in and the odds of a particle moving and vertical or horizontal direction.

(sorry I think I had this in reverse when I first described it, the odds of a particle moving towards the center of the earth increase the closer the particle is to the center of the earth, but the further from earth the odds of a particle moving in a vertical direction vs a horizontal direction will decrease)

09:54

And so some more high up in the atmosphere like you're going to be Let's say that there's going to be like if you're in a, if you're in a vertical particle lane that and then movement and a vertical direction up or down is going to be faster and movement to the left to right is going to be slower.

10:26

And in some of that is because the collisions because there are there are more excited collisions happening and the vertical direction. So they may. So you might have two different particles, colliding and bouncing off in a vertical cascade, at a slightly higher frequency than, you know, then a horizontal cascade.

(the increased frequence of vertical collisions heats up space in a vertical way so that the random walk of particles now has a preference for moving in the direction of the vertical path, but in addition, the increased quantum particle activity coming from the direction of the earth is increasing the relative intervals of spacetime in the direction of the earth, so that instead of a random walk that is equal in all directions the direction of particles now preferentially is moving towards the earth)

10:49

But I'm just talking about in general, like the trends are, you are gonna have particles moving in all directions, no matter what. Especially when it comes to particles colliding, but you're gonna potentially have more trends of. And so, you're basically creating in space, you're creating basically almost like the equivalent of having two metal plates in an aqueous saline solution that we wish right where you have basically between the two plates between the lanes, you're creating a an electric field that is applying force to all particles that are moving through that field, all particles at all scales.

(Imagine that there are special effects happening at the particle scale between these vertical activity lanes emerging from a planet that are dissipating with distance

insert an exploration of electron tunneling that dissipates at a distance, and a consideration of macroscale 

"Heat Transfer Induced by Electron Tunneling Between Two Metal Plates " https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-abstract/IMECE2019/59452/V008T09A032/1073437

"et be the potential between the two plates, we know that F = -∇U, where U is the potential energy and U = E*q*d, but E varies with inverse square of the distance ie the whole quantity vary with inverse the distance so if the electron is very far, -∇U will be very small and so the electron will feel less force, another way the think of it is that the electron is far force the electric field source so F will be small,"

Consider the possibility of Bose-Einstein condensates & Fermionic Condensates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermionic_condensate emerging in space inside planetary bodies with the effects extending outside planetary sized bodies via these verticle particle lanes that I am describing, with the effects dissipating at a distance so the forces dissipate at a distance.

# *These Gravity effects between particle lanes emerging from planetary bodies would be places where virtual entities (see my note mentioning virtual entities. See note a0130z.md ) similar to the concept of virtual particles emerge to exert forces between particles that increase time in the direction of the earth causing particles & atoms to fall toward the earth.

11:33

So this got this, this this is applying it's going to apply a physical force, all particles at all scale, so that means atoms as well. And so you're going to have. So, electric in magnetic fields are going to apply physical force to atoms because they are, in fact,

(note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

12:00

Because that's

12:05

That's analogous to drift caused by an electric field inside and neurons and we're talking about part of a drift.

we're talking about the movement of sodium, not just ion but but also sodium and potassium. ????

I think that the, the electric field is going to electric field, if it

# 12:48

*So that's essentially it's happening in muscles, the electric field. Is causing the and the it's causing it's a force that is causing something to walk across the muscles that are contracting & tighting the muscles. The current is creating physical force that causes the muscles to cause us to contract. but specifically that force is accelerating time in a way that creates a gravitational effect at the biological scale contracting your muscles with gravity or with time dilation, or with the acceleration of time caused by electron movement that causes your muscles to crunch together.

This is a new hypothesis about the effects of gravity at the biological scale! LOL! Is it correct? IDK. It's AWESOME IDEA though LOL! #Gravity #Biology Your cells manipulate gravity! #Science #Physics

13:37

But I also it's interesting because I think about how the action potential when, when it curves up, I think it's like they think that is like a multiplication because it's like, it's like multiplication in the sense that you have a cascading effect of of an of an acceleration of particle movements that results in a rapid turning on of current right from of from a from if you have you know the voltage.

14:12

If the voltage is sufficiently displayed, the depolarization is coincident depolarization is coincident with with the neuron turning on briefly but it's it's interesting in the hot and how it's gonna hugs later. Sort of suggesting that the the sodium basically is decaying rapidly but there's a delay in the onset of of the what's called the activation, and this in this activation of current.

14:57

And but that delay doesn't match what's going on in the human being in terms of like that. The squid and the giant squid near on the the disactivation the activation, and this activation. There's a there's a mechanical delay in it. That's not true for the human for the met from the million neurons.

15:23

So it was I guess we're talking about like, you know, the brains of rats, right? But it's not true but perhaps it's it's because there are different those different sizes. Perhaps, there's different professors. You should see like the rapidity of the sodium decline.

15:54

It's is, it's considered to be a special feature of sodium, but it's doesn't, but it doesn't match, but it doesn't. But what's happening with the decline of the electric charge in the squid, neuron doesn't match the the delay in the and the delay for the for the rise & fall of activation

16:13

Activation and doesn't match human neurons. And I guess I had it when I'm what I'm getting at is this is that it's not a feature of the sodium itself, but there is a in the Hodkin & Huxley model, there is a coincident event happening, the ancient infinity event, which is the closing of sodium channels.

16:35

So it's, it's like imagine that the sodium channels turn on but immediately the they're just on and then they immediately, they run out of charge, right? So immediately but at same time immediately as soon as they turn on the dissipation happens and then the sodium channels that all opened up simultaneously, all start to close simultaneously.

17:02

And so the argument is that that I that I am taking about is that the, the eight because ancient infinity starts at the same time, basically it starts the those sodium channels open up in a cascade and I'm multiplying. It's I think of it as a multiplication effect because there because the cascade is like this same pattern is now being repeated multiple times where all these sodium gates open but then they all immediately, basically they all start closing.

17:40

So they all open very briefly in, they all start closing. And that that's that's almost like, you know, it's like imagine, you know, a bunch of gates are just releasing but then closing back up again, right? Just there all but all opening up in a cascade at the same time, like, oh, an event happens, we're all gonna open up.

18:00

And so that's it starts when it stops, but the rate is not consistent because it's not a feature of sodium. But instead, it is a feature of of channels closing right after they open. So it's a feature. It's a future of the structure of the purchase structure. Perhaps, and that's interesting because the Yeah, I didn't.

18:34

I so I don't know why. So sodium, but why, why was with? So, like, if you didn't have the channels closing, it's kind of like the question is, would this sodium current continue? But regardless, if it appears that that it does stop and in but the current is continuing because there's a potassium current, that's happening, that's different from the sodium current.

19:04

But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?

20:08

Zero one, two and three. And so that is going to. So, going back to how, you know. So, the idea is that

20:29

The neurons shape, which is defined by its connections. The neurons shape (what I mean is its information configuration established by its connections in the network, its shape in the network its synaptic connections in the network) would be known to the network because it's, it's like, it's if it fires, it's like, well, what is what parts of the network are listening to when it fires. And so you have the distinction between through your neurons is that to each speak to the network differently.

21:01

And but you're gonna have multiple, so you have to have multiple. So you have many different nerves that are connected to both of those units of fire. But each one of those are on to when it fires is in some sense, a representative of its connections because when it fires there's only some neurons that are going to fire and that's going to .....

21:27

And just so you're going to have and you're gonna be changing the whole oscillating array of patterns by by each neuron. It does fire this because that is each one is sending out. It is the sending out. It's it's a its own representation to the collective. So in a sense of the neuron is communicating its connections to the network.

22:00

If it fires, it's communicating it's existing connections to networking fires. And that's how it's, that's how each and every year on is distinct, is that from from any other neuron? So each neurologist capable of producing a distinct pattern. But you're also going to have situations where, you know, basically like sort of like the network has learned pattern invariance.

22:31

So you can have different types of you could have. You could have different types of modalities in different regions of the brain, or even in the same same cortical column playing back, the same melody with different notes that for the network could recognize because it can recognize patterns invariant from that, has grant from which pianos playing those patterns.

23:00

So, you have a piano that has represents a different neuron, that sounds different, but it could play the same pattern as the original. And so, in effect, you have messages that are that can be, they can be sort of like, stored as tempo-spatial oscillations of unique network knows that are unique because of the connections to the network.

23:29

And so, the, the neuron is has expressing a note (like a piano note) to the network. That is, it's, it's learned connections and it's learned to connections are the entities that are perceiving that note, but it's in fact, but becausethe energy of signals dissipates in a cascading fashion across all of the oscillators.

24:09

The, the patterns are the patterns that that each area of the brain. Learns or are essentially transmitted all over the place, transmit it to everyone. So the so it's the idea of all the fireflies if they're oscillating, they means that the the energy differences between them are basically, he basically dissipated until the fireflies are in sync again. Once they are in Sync they are acting again as a single sensor/transmitter, or a single considerator/actor. This means that a person, as the entification of harmonically oscillation cells, is a single entity, that considers information & acts, as a consequence of oscillator physics in biology that can be simulated computationally.
