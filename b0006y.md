So I had this I have I've had another idea about how the particle lanes

Electric and magnetic fields emerging from

From a large body like planet like Earth

They they're creating electric and electromagnetic fields in space, right and those fields

Are

Going to create force

That that is going to

They're gonna create they're gonna create an electric field between this particle lanes are gonna create changes to the electric field

in between

Those particle lanes that are going to be

Creating directional force on all the particles moving through those lanes

So like you know, I have hypothesized in my gravity equation that there's going to be like

There's gonna be like a lot of particle collisions that will be going

Vertical between between like directly to the planet and directly to space

But then there's gonna be like basically like like imagine like the fanning out of lines

Right where there's there's if you go to if you go if you can't get two different points on the surface of the sphere

But you had and each one is 90 degrees away from the surface

Is this the surface as a as a horizon right 90 degrees away from the horizon so that that's called vertical, but but but if you go, you know

If you go a mile over

the vertical direction

From the sphere into space

Is a different direction. It's a different direction because it goes because really it starts from the center of

the sphere

and then projects outwards and so

if you are if you're basically like

You go over a little bit maybe a mile on earth

And I'm just like for the sake of convenience. I'm like, okay, let's go

Imagine a sphere the size of the earth and a mile over it's gonna be a

perpendicular line is not going to be parallel

to

Any other line that's perfect. It's perpendicular to the earth to the center of the earth

It's gonna be fanning out, right?

And so the idea was that these lines are gonna be lanes for

for particles

You know like electromagnetic

Lines in space and

That in between them, they're they're they're gonna be shaping the

The

They're gonna they're gonna be shaping the the statistical behavior of all particles that pass through that field

So let's say that particles have a random walk

I just like the intro to neural computation talks about how

You know particles have a have a drift

That is

Square of

amount of time

They have a drift so they move very slowly. They move out of a way. That's just that is

You take the amount of the time interval and you find the square root of it and that's the amount the particle has

Drifted the square root. I guess that means you need to take a number of times another number

To get time

So if time equal was equal to four and that would mean that the square root

Four is two is two times two is four right, so if if you had so

If time is four then the particle has drifted

by two by

By distance to

Or in that so in that case it's it's it's it's

It's it's moved by about half

So if the particle if the time was nine

then you would say well, it's

Square root of time

nine

intervals of time is is going to be

Three three times three is nine right so you can say well it's it's moved by about a third

But the point is that so let's just say that there's that's that that's like the in the random walk

It's like we're talking about the distance because

You know the particle could move in any given direction

Randomly could randomly move to the left or to the right

It's not it's not likely to move in a straight line because because it's because it's its movement is like

It's almost like the flip of the coin it's almost chance

second it's a change it's it is it's it is a chance like

Mechanism where the particle doesn't have a deliberate direction to go in so it will go in any random direction

As it diffuses, so this is this is this is but we're talking about this is the essence of like the rate of diffusion of

An ion

In a in a cell so this is different from like the rate of diffusion of

the rate of diffusion of

Of an electron in space this is I don't know that it's going to be I

Don't know that it's not going to be

You know the

Moving at

Diffusing in space at a rate that is

Square root time

but

I think my hi at my my hunch is that

That

It it can it's it's totally different depending on like the

You know what's going on in the electric field

So what I'm thinking is that the closer you are to planet to earth

To or to the center of the earth then they're more basically then you're gonna have more

Space is going to be more excited

It's gonna be a lot more particle collisions and then like as you sort of like, you know head up into the atmosphere

the

Instead of like, you know the chances of

Space of movement

Right it are in a

In a horizontal and vertical in a horizontal versus vertical direction

Are effectively

Speaking splitting split split apart

So at some point the chances at some point when you're close to the center of the earth the chances of moving

horizontally or vertically

in any given direction are

About the same if you're close to the center of this of a planet or singularity or

Black or star black hole, but the farther you get away

from the center

the

the more you're going to

Have a sort of like separation

And and the odds of the particle moving

in a vertical or horizontal direction and

So somewhere high up in the atmosphere

like you're going to

Be

Let's say that

There's gonna be like if you're in a point if you're in a vertical particle ways that and then

a movement in a vertical direction up or down is going to be faster

And movement to the left or right is going to be slower and and some of that is because the collisions

because there are there are more

Excited collisions happening in the vertical direction. So they may say you might have two different particles colliding and bouncing off in a vertical

cascade at a slightly higher frequency than

horizontal cascade

But I'm just talking about in general like the trends are you're gonna have particles

Moving in all directions no matter what especially when it comes to particles colliding

But you're gonna potentially have more trends of

And so you're basically creating in space you're creating basically

Almost like the equivalent of having two metal plates in an aqueous

Salient solution right where you have basically between the two plates between the lanes you're creating an electric field

That is applying force to all particles that are moving through that field all

Particles at all scales. So this guy this this this is applying. It's gonna apply a physical force to all particles at all scales

So that means atoms as well

And so you're going to have so electric and magnetic fields are going to apply a

Physical force to atoms because they are in fact

Because that's

That's analogous to drift

Caused by an electric field

Inside and they're on

And we're talking about particle drift, but but I think that

We're talking about the movement of

Sodium not just ions, but but also sodium and potassium. I think that the the electric field is going the electric field if it's

That's essentially what's happening in their muscles is the electric field. It's causing the

It's causing

It's a force it's causing the I forget what it's called something to walk across the muscles that are

contracting or tightening

the muscles

The current is

is creating a physical force that causes the muscles to muscles to contract

But I also it's interesting because I think about how the action potential when

When it curves up, I think it's like they think that is like a multiplication because it's like it's like

multiplication in the sense that you have a cascading effect of

of an of an acceleration

Particle movements that results in a rapid

Turning on of current

Right from a from a from a if you have you know the voltage if the voltage is sufficiently displaced

The depolarization

Is

Coincident depolarization is coincident with with the neuron turning on briefly

But it's it's interesting in a hot in a hot skin and Huxley. They're sort of suggesting that the

The sodium

Basically is decaying rapidly, but there's a delay in the onset of

What's called the activation in this in this activation of current

And

But that delay doesn't match what's going on in the human being in terms of like

the squid and the giant squid neuron the

the dis activation

The activation of this activation there's a there's a mechanical delay in it. That's not true for the human

For the met from the million neurons. So I guess we're talking about like, you know, the brains of rats

right, but

It's not true, but perhaps it's it's because

There are different those different sizes, perhaps there's different

We should see like the the rapidity of the

Sodium decline

It's is it's considered to be a special feature of sodium

But it's doesn't but it doesn't match, but it doesn't but what's happening with the decline of the electric charge in

The squid neuron doesn't match the delay

The delay for the for the rise and fall activation

Doesn't match human neurons and I guess I did

What I'm getting at is this is that it's not a feature of the sodium itself

But there is a in the Hodgkin and Hutchley model. There is a coincidence event happening the H infinity event

Which is the closing of sodium channels. So it's it's like

Imagine that the sodium channels turn on

but immediately the

They're just on and then they immediately they run out of charge

Okay, so immediately but at the same time immediately as soon as they turn on

The dissipation happens and then which the sodium channels that all opened up simultaneously all start to close

simultaneously and

so the argument is that

that I that I am thinking about is that the

the

H because H infinity starts at the same time basically it starts

Those sodium channels open up

In a cascade and I'm multiplying it's I think of it as a multiplication effect

because they're because the cascade is like the same pattern is now being

Repeated multiple times where all these sodium gates open

But then they all

Immediately basically they all start closing. So they all open very briefly and they all start closing and

that that's

That's almost like, you know, it's like imagine

You know a bunch of gates are just releasing but then closing back up again, right?

Just they're all but they're all opening up in a cascade at the same time like oh an event happens

we're all gonna open up and

So that's it starts and it stops

but the rate is not consistent because it's not a feature of sodium but instead is a a feature of

Channels closing right after they open so it's a feature. It's a feature of the the structure of the protein structure

Perhaps and that's interesting because

The

Yeah, I don't I so I don't know why it's so sodium

Why why would so like if you didn't have the channels closing

It's kind of like the question is would this sodium current continue?

But regardless it appears that that

It does stop and but the current is continuing because there's a potassium

Current that's happening. That's different from the sodium current, but but at the at the at the

So the potassium current is

Sort of gives us the

Decay time

of

the action potential

Which is going to determine the the the magnitude of

The of the neurons signal to other neurons

Right, so it's this potassium

rate

Potassium diffusion

So

So here we have a

Potassium diffusion rate that can produce basically

One of one of four different possible

Realities per action potential right that zero one two three

So that is going to

So going back to hot hot, you know, so the idea is that

The neuron the neuron shape, which is defined by its connections

Narn shape would be known to the network

because

It's it's like

It's if it fires, it's like well, what is what parts of the network are listening to when it fires?

and so you have the distinction between two different neurons is

that they each speak to the network differently and

But you're gonna have multiple

So you'd have multiple

So you have many different norms that are connected to both of those notes of fire

But each one of those notes when it fires it is in some sense a representative of its connections because

When it fires, there's only some

neurons that are going to fire and

That's gonna in the end. So you're gonna have

You're gonna be changing the whole oscillating array of patterns

by by each neuron that does fire

Because that is each one is sending out it is sending out it's it's a

It's own representation to the collective. So in a sense of the neuron is

is communicating its connections

to the network if it fires

It's communicating its existing connections to the network and fires and that's how it's that's how each and every neuron is

distinct

Is that from from any other neuron? So each neurons is capable of producing a distinct pattern

But you're also gonna have situations where you know basically like

Sort of like the network has learned

pattern invariance. So you could have different types of

You could have you could have different types of modalities in different regions of the brain or even in the same

Same chord column playing back the same melody with different notes that the network could recognize because it can recognize

patterns invariant from

That whose

Variant from which piano is playing those patterns you have a piano that represents a different neuron that sounds different

But it could play the same pattern as the original and so in effect you have messages that are

That can be that can be sort of like stored as

Tempo spatial

Oscillations of unique network nodes that are unique because of their connections to the network and so

the neuron is

is

Expressing a note

That that is

to the network

that is it's

It's learned connections

and it's learned connections are what are the

Antities that are perceiving that note, but it's in fact but because

The signal the energy of signals

Dispensates in a cascading

fashion across all of the oscillators that

The patterns are the patterns that that each area of the brain learns or are centrally transmitted all over the place

Transmitted to every now so the so it's the idea of

all the fireflies if

They're oscillating that means that the the energy differences between them are

basically

I basically
