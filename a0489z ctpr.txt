(criteria, causation)
Choice is actually something physical we have done and taken ownership of. Every action one takes is a choice as soon as you take ownership of it. You can't really be consistent and at the same time say that one action you take is choice and one isn't.
all physical actions that take place among our cells like any other choice and no different than that.
It is a valid perspective to see that choices do happen at the level of cells, and whether we own that or not depends on our cells to eventually realize that is true and to own all of our cellular choices.

The only difference between what you acknowledge as your choices, and what is the result of luck and or determinism is that your choices are owned by you. That's the story you went with, choice is not otherwise any different from luck or determinism.

Choice is a physical action you take ownership of, nothing less, nothing more. If that sounds ridiculous read this science book http://www.amazon.com/The-Neural-Basis-Free-Will/dp/0262019108
