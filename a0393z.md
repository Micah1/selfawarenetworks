(perception, graph) the tools that I have include a graph of five frequencies of brainwaves overtime, gamma, alpha, beta, theta, and delta
I have another tool called 3d brainwave activity visualizer, but really it's just an interpretation of the numbers
The eeg sensors are only picking up numbers representing when waves peak, so the graph is best
other technology like fmri measure changes in blood flow so they "interpret" what brain-"wave" activity could be.

you don't mention the words quantum, phenomenon or perception,

you say you are measuring waves, electrical patterns, brain activity, to collect information and that you have a scientific process to "make original discoveries" they don't need all the same details to help, they don't even need to know the big picture of what you are really doing, they only need to know their own small part, you needed data, for science, so they if they want to help they have to do this, and we give them a list of easy steps to follow.

what they get is a simplified version of a the project that leaves out the complex stuff and just focuses them on what they can do to contribute
I can understand the whole project, and help pick out the parts that they need to know
