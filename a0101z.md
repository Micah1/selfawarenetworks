atp affects the brains reward system
so weakly interacting osc magnetism in the brain
a ~> b -> c
flavins oxidation
cell growth death ltp ltd spine growth decay
new memory tied to = reward system
endorphins are just a reward area, not a reward chemical
its that each type of neurotransmitter is reinforcing memories & rewards
with atp
D -> E
Another major breakthrough idea that is actually in a whole other category related to essential biology function that is on par with some of the other new hypotheses having to do with bio function. THIS IS MAJOR! It's that D->E transformation link in the chain.
the frequency that you do something drives its own reinforcement
changing large long term scale behaviors is about mentally practicing them

Imagine your whole brain is X
It has sensory arrays/edge communities
It magnifies/scales/transforms
Virtual memories
Stores patterns in connections
Reinforces memory & rewards with life

The preferences of neurons, low contrast, high contrast, its set by the firing of neurons which excites the mitochondria to release more atp exciting cell growth
