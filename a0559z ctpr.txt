(Neuralink, neuron) Flawed Assumption
One of the points: Neuralink has one fundamentally wrong assumption and that is that the only way they can measure a real time action potential is with an implanted electrode that is 2 microns away, but I believe a real time action potential can measured from outside the brain with near infrared light imagining and the reversal of the refraction of the light, because the neurons body physically changes size when it fires.
