oscillating functional fractal isomorphism

All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 

A microtubule would likely contribute to a small charge to contribute to an action potential in a significant way, and if it was designed to tip the balance of sodium 

Space is particles with either energy or mass, and the energy state is the frequency of light speed times mass, frequency and ~~amplitude~~ magnitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.

So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

Space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to oscillators, this space is simultabeous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales

but space is not really expanding, its just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking and space is staying the same. This would make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are shrinking and becoming more dense gaining mass as they move through space attracting new particles through collision lanes

spacetime is the frequency 

spacetime is the length of an interval between two oscillations that the cosmos is making when particles shift in and out of existence between having a location or having a velocity,

spacetime is like a stretched velocity that is warped around an oscillator, while the oscillator has a location the velocity can't be found anywhere but instead of velocity we get space

when oscillators run out of energy, velocity should resume and location vanish

sonce space is full of a fractal of oscillators, it would not seem to be a stretch therefore for spacetime to be a 4D interval between oscillations

in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator

as space relatively expands so does time, so over time the earth gains mass from space, the total amount of time increases as space expands, what we experience as a forward interval in time is somultaneous with the expansion of space, and so the expansion of time adds a new interval of scale dependent time (time slows or gets more intervals in space vs on earth

The new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating particle collision lanes. Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to quantum physics,

that helps explain why Quantum physics looks confusing its because spacetime at quantum scale is moving faster relatively, because of oscillators

mass, density, and scale are 3 factors that combine to produce phase space fields that produce time

Rewrite; Tonight I came up with what I think is a novel idea for how spacetime exists and why time seems to move forward from our perspective. Adding this to the book because its related to the perception of time in a counter intuitive way.

since spacetime is expanding everywhere atoms are spacetime is also expanding inside our brains, so our brains are experiencing the expansion of time, because the brain is literally expanding as its atoms oscillate and warp spacetime

If my memories are attractors then it means that I am, through my memories, literally creating myself, creating my simulation of reality, as the oscillator I am also literally creating spacetime, so each oscillator its creating its own relative space phase field, relative to itself, so it being smaller than its space, and shrinking as dissipative systems do over time as they run out of energy well

So my prediction is that humanity is about to have a huge global awakening. Society is about to be transformed by radical new technologies, based on radical advances forward in science that are going to blow many people's minds and change the world as we know it.

The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 

So if space is like an oscillation it goes from being all quiet to being all noisy and back again

this means the entire universe will over time have a sort of heat death, the loss of energy from all oscillations and following that time restarts as the heat death oscillates or divides again into a new oscillation.

the uncertainty of whether the universe exists is the key distinction, or the first oscillation, that makes space time possible, and perhaps each new oscillation can be considered to be like a division of the first oscillation, which reverberates for a seeming infinity creating a relative spacetime seemingly for an infinite time with seemingly infinite space. This expansion creates a cascade of new space & time expanding vortices, until the heat death of all vortices/oscillators, which leads back to the initial state of no time or space.

Basically spacetime is going collapse when the last oscillation runs out of energy.

So inbetween no time and no space there is a seemingly infinite expansion of spacetime, and perhaps then the cosmos repeats infinitely.

So the singularity moment is only an expansion of space from a point of view, from another point of view mass is shrinking instead of space expanding, but that is also only a point of view. Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which is sort of outside time, but moving relatively faster than space at larger scales.

This book is about starting a conversation not ending them, I wanted these to be in print however before I began to distribute them. In part because I want to make it easier for other people to reference all the ideas for discussion, and learn about adjacent ideas, to save myself time from creating a new map for each person one at a time.

The book is a map between ideas across books, papers, videos, but also its a book about ideas across industries from the fields of neuroscience, neurology, neurophysics, computational biology, deep learning.

The main new idea with Orch Or is that it might store acoustic wave form memories that alter wave forms as waves travel into its tunnel, encounter previous patterns, and come out again like a reflector bouncing a signal back as a new pattern

we know also that the alignment of the neurons magnetic dipole changes with each action potential event, and so there are multiple clues that point to the neuron changing its configuration in multiple ways, the microtubule to store memories of mechanical or acoustic vibrations, that alter the wave shape of the AP with their reactions that affect the acoustic wave shape, the magnetic dipole change might also encode memory, at least temporary memory, by making changes in the magnetic side of the electromagnetic phase field, the possible interactions between magnetic fields is going to allow them to influence one another in interesting ways. However the meaning of the phase changes is like different internal modalities happening simultaneously in each place with each neuron at each scale. (thalamic neocortex or macro scale, cortical column, neural circuit meso scale, dentride, neuron, synapse or micro scale, and possibly quantum scale as well.) So a fractal of the magnetic modality co-occuring with the electric modality and the mechanical modality. The three potential paths for memory formation might represent different temporal or spatial scales for sensed stored and transmitted information. The at various meso and macro network scales the same three modalities cooperate to simultaneous develop the brains phase field which creates the reflection of you with its memories.

It is as if the reflection of you, is your memories, and those memories are driving your choices at all scales based on Peter Tse's criterial causation framework.
