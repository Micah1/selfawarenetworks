oscillating functional fractal isomorphism

All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, via Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, this note explores some of the original ideas in Q.G.T.C.D.

Oscillators define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime.

~~Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's~~ 

Space around atoms expands spatially because all particles have to oscillate, and the increasing time means greater oscillation travel times for particles (relative to or compared to travel times for particles at the center of a mass where the frequency or density of mass is higher) The way this is represented in a per interval moment of spacetime is with the relative appearance of expanded space, but expanded space is spacetime that has a greater oscillatory interval.

It's like if each particle in space was the pendulum of a metronome, the expanded spacetime around the atom is like the bottom of the pendulum that swings out the widest.

The center of mass is like the top of the pendulum, it has the highest frequency which is also the highest mass density, and because it's frequency interval is higher it is like extra spatial surface area that is hidden in time dimensions, essentially a time crystal.

See notes on Quantum Gradient Time Dilation, which I am now calling Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.

With Quantum Gradient Time Dilation or
Time ought to be moving more slowly at the center of a particles mass and faster in the spacetime field created by that particles mass.

Thee fast movement of an electron mass in space ought to accelerate time around the electron which is what I think the magnetic field is, accelerated time, that has an attractive interaction because of quantum gradient time dilation, while what is outside a particle mass is attractive, what is inside a particle mass might be repulsive, and that implies that the inside of the earth might be repulsive, but I guess the density of earths crust is technically repulsive in effect isn't it? We think of that as pressure, so could the center of mass in an electron be considered to have pressure and does the pressure inside an electron increase when the electron is accelerated?



Space appears to consist of a harmonic oscillating field of particles that can be classified as either energy or mass depending on their frequency or speed.

The energy state is mass times the speed of light squared, in other words particles classified as energy have a faster apparent velocity.

 frequency and ~~amplitude~~ magnitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.

If energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space.

Dense volumes of space, such as the center of mass, are warming the electromagnetic field & simultaneously increasing the relative intervals of time.

My conjecture is that this creates broad vertical particle traffic lanes emitted from the center of mass.

One hypothesis I have comes from imagining a visual symmettry to these verticle particle traffic lanes, that emerge from the excited, heated, time accelerated space at the center of mass is that there are increasing horizontal particle lanes that move inbetween the verticle particle lanes that balance out the symmetry of particle travel in space, so that there is an equal number of particles moving in each direction, but mass defines the pattern of particle travel. The further you get from the center of mass the larger and longer the horizontal particle lanes get. These verticle and horizontal particle lanes create the effects of time dilation by shortening or lengthening the amount of time that it takes for a particle to travel in one direction or another.

Space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to atomic oscillations in densified areas of space, 

The expansion of space, relative to mass, is simultaneous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales.

Space is not really expanding in the absolute sense, its just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking and space is staying the same.

This idea could make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are shrinking and becoming more dense gaining mass as they move through space attracting new particles through particle collision lanes emitted from mass.

Suppose that Spacetime as whole is a wave with a frequency pattern.

I'm considering the idea that spacetime is the length of an interval between two oscillations that the cosmos is making when particles shift in and out of existence between having a location or having a velocity.

I imagine that spacetime is like a stretched like a particle that has a high velocity that is warped around an oscillator, because the oscillator is pulling it, attracting it.

While the oscillator has a location the velocity around the oscillator can't be found anywhere and instead of seeing a particle with velocity we get the void of spacetime with an area magnitude that is relative to the density of the oscillating volume of mass.

I imagine that if the atom oscillation runs out of energy, velocity that appears as spacetime might collapose into a particle with a location.

I argue that spacetime, including mass & energy, is a fractal of oscillators. It does not seem to be a stretch to consider that spacetime is 3D time interval between oscillations, with the magnitude of the 3D space at each interval of time being flattened time.

In a fractal cosmos it would make intuitive or visual sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms & galaxies, and a frequency interval that is 'an expand spacetime void' relative to the combined density of the oscillator.

As space relatively expands so does time, so over time the earth gains mass from space, the total amount of time increases as space expands, what we experience as a forward interval in time is simultaneous with the expansion of space and in theory the increase in the relative density of earth (because earth as an oscillator is attracting particles, atoms, objects, and anything around it, earth is eating space, but that causes the void of space (and the duration of time) to grow in area paradoxically.)

The expansion of the spacetime voice adds a new interval of scale dependent time (time gets more intervals in space vs on earth, so the clock interates faster the further it is from a dense mass. Yet the higher frequency or density of mass creates an invisible surface area in time that tips the odds of particle travel.

There are more directions for that clock that iterates faster in space to travel in the direction of a dense mass than there are in any other direction. Resulting in the gravitational effect, which is a statistical effect, calculating the odds of particle movement per interval of time given all the possible directions a particle can travel at each interval of time with the area in the direction of dense mass having extra surface area from the clock's perspective. So the clock falls toward the earth.

The new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating particle collision lanes. Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to what is happening at the scale of quantum particles.

Could this add light as to why observing what is happening at the Quantum scale is counter intuitive?

~~it looks confusing because spacetime at quantum scale is moving faster relatively,~~

Thought experiment: Suppose that oscillating mass at the quantum scale is warping space in a way that makes the human experience at the multiple cell scale iterate faster in spacetime, the human experience then ought to be iterating in time faster than a particle iterates in time. So in theory our observation of particles would be one where they appear to be slower, unless their relative velocity, the speed of particle movement is much higher compared to the speed of communication between cells across the whole brain.

The center of mass is where the intervals of time are slowed down, but around a particle time is sped up, so what that particle emits is going to create the quantum gradient time dilation effect of increasing the odds of particle movement in the direction of any other nearby particle. If particles have a compatible oscillatory frequency they will clump together, because their quantum gravity time crystal dilation effect allowed a clustering to happen, an an atom forms, then a molecule.

Spacetime at the quantum scale ought to be iterating more slowly, but only if particles are moving at the same rate as cellular communication across the brain. 

Since the human experience extends across many cells at a greater scale the human experience ought to iterate faster in time relative to the intervals of time at the atom scale.

What confuses the issue is the question of the relative speed of the particles being observed, if the particles we are observing are moving much faster, from having lower mass & higher velocity, compared to human cognition, then we have the reverse time dilation effect, where I can again make the argument that perhaps what is happening at the Quantum scale is counter intuitive because the speed of particle movement is faster than we can intuitively grasp.

To rephrase: Just like the clock in space is iterating faster in space the further it is from mass, so the human experience ought to be iterating faster than what happens at the particle scale unless the particles are moving at a much faster velocity and then special relativity would help us understand that the time dilation effect is reversed to what it might intuitively be with gravity alone.

The frequency of mass in a volume, or the density of atoms in a space, produce the 3D volumetric spacetime field as we know & experience it. What I suppose is that the spacetime field & mass alternate in existence, taking turns with one being spacetime energy while the other is a mass, or a vortice in spacetime, like a never ending pendulum, when one vortex (atom) breaks a part, the energy that is released causes another to exist somewhere else, in a never ending cycle.

Rewrite; Tonight I came up with what I think is a novel idea for how spacetime exists and why time seems to move forward from our perspective. Adding this to the book because its related to the perception of time in a counter intuitive way.

I was thinking that since spacetime is expanding everywhere. Since atoms are spacetime. That means spacetime is also expanding inside our brains. Our brains are experiencing the expansion of time.

Another thought is that while spacetime is constantly expanding, it is constantly contracting in equal measure, somewhere that it's not expands. It makes more sense to me, that as oscillators our brains are actually growing, expanding in mass, which is the contraction of space actually, absorbing particles, food, energy, oxygen etc...

If my memories are attractor states, in synaptic connections, it means that I am, through my memories, literally creating myself, growing my mind, and building via new protein synthesis my simulation of reality.

# "Attractor and integrator networks in the brain"
"Thus, it is now possible to conclusively state that the brain constructs and uses such systems for computation. Finally, we highlight recent theoretical advances in understanding how the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and capacity and between structure and flexibility can be overcome by reusing and recombining the same set of modular attractors for multiple functions, so they together produce representations that are structurally constrained and robust but exhibit high capacity and are flexible."

As an oscillator I am in a literal sense ~~creating~~ modifying the spacetime environment around the mass that is myself.

Each oscillator it ~~creating~~ modifying its own relative space phase field, relative to itself, so it being smaller than its space, and shrinking as dissipative systems do over time as they run out of energy well.

# A radical prediction for the future of humanity

My prediction is that humanity is about to have a huge global awakening. Society is about to be transformed by radical new technologies, based on radical advances forward in science that are going to blow many people's minds and change the world as we know it.

The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe?

Perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states: 1 existing somewhere like mass or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 

So if space is like an oscillation it goes from being all quiet to being all noisy and back again. (or perhaps just alternately in both states but in alternating areas)

Does this means the entire universe will over time have a sort of heat death? Or the loss of energy from all oscillations? Following that will time restart? Will the heat death oscillate? Will it divide again into a new oscillation? Or is it the case that neither a heat death nor a big crunch ever occurs or will ever occur, because spacetime as a harmonic oscillating field is perpetually spinning up oscillating vortices (particles, atoms, planets, stars, life, galaxies, super clusters, black holes etc....) and all that stuff just happens eternally in endless cycles. I think the latter situation is more plausible.

The uncertainty of whether the universe exists is the key point to comtemplate I think.

Imagine that the first oscillation is the one that makes space time possible, and perhaps each new oscillation can be considered to be like a division of the first oscillation, which reverberates for a seeming infinity, and perhaps for an infinity, creating a relative spacetime seemingly for an infinite time with seemingly infinite space. This expansion creates a cascade of new space & time expanding vortices, until the heat death of all vortices/oscillators, which leads back to the initial state of no time or space.

Either spacetime exists in perpetuitity or someday it is going collapse when the somehow the last oscillation runs out of energy. Unless there is no such thing as spacetime running out of energy.

So inbetween no time and no space there is a seemingly infinite expansion of spacetime, and perhaps then the cosmos cycles through different forms infinitely?

Perhaps the singularity moment is only an expansion of space from a point of view, and from another point of view mass is shrinking instead of space expanding.

Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which iterates slower time with greater density, and that which iterates faster in time with less density but more spatial magnitude.

# A Random Thought inserted?
On Orch Or: My currently hypothesis is that a microtubule would unlikely to contribute to an action potential event in a significant way. 

The interesting idea with Orch Or is the idea that a microtubule might store acoustic wave form memories that alter wave forms as waves travel into its tunnel, encounter previous patterns, and come out again like a reflector bouncing a signal back as a new pattern, but I still do not see how that could affect the flow of ions in a significant way, unless a signal from a microtubule can inhibit or excite a receptor.

The alignment of the neurons magnetic dipole changes with each action potential event, and so there are multiple clues that point to the neuron changing its configuration in multiple ways.

If the microtubule can store memories of mechanical or acoustic vibrations, that alter the wave shape of the AP with their reactions that affect the acoustic wave shape which might change the duration that calcium channels are open, or send a message that tells the neuron which types of vesicles to release, which neurotransmitters to send out.

"How Does A Neuron Stay Polarized"
"One of the major issues is tracking the specific vesicles that are needed to transport each specific component to its exact polar destination. Protein regulation is needed to produce these vesicles—budding from a membrane, transport and then fusion at the destination."
https://jonlieffmd.com/blog/neuronal-plasticity-blog/how-does-a-neuron-stay-polarized

It is interesting to contemplate whether or not the magnetic dipole, of a single neurons, might also encode a kind of memory, at least temporary memory, by making permanent changes in the magnetic side of the electromagnetic phase field, the possible interactions between parts of the magnetic field may going to allow them to influence one another in interesting ways. Resulting in consequences like stimulated mitochondria, inhibited or excited receptors or ion channels, and contribute to unexplained cellular behaviors.

However the meaning of the phase changes is like different internal modalities happening simultaneously in each place with each neuron at each scale. (thalamic neocortex or macro scale, cortical column, neural circuit meso scale, dentride, neuron, synapse or micro scale, and possibly quantum scale as well.)

So a fractal of the magnetic modality co-occuring with the electric signals, mechanical wave signals (the force of neurotransmitters + soliton wave vibrations affecting mechano sensitive potassium receptors with ankeryn repeats).

Those three potential paths for signal transmission in particular (there are others, some neurons can sense heat, light, pain) might represent different temporal or spatial scales for sensed, stored, and transmitted information.

At all scales from micro, meso to the macro brain network the different scales of transmitted waves of information may cooperate to simultaneous to develop the brain's tonic brainwave phase field, which creates the reflection of you with its temporally oscillating expectations that define the canvas of human awareness.

It is as if the reflection of you, in the canvas of tonic brainwave oscillations, is your oscillating memories, your expectations, and those memories are driving your choices at all scales, as you get new information, from your senses.

# The Tonic Mind
Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.
