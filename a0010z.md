oscillating functional fractal isomorphism

All human beings are fractal functional oscillations abstractly, but in a more perceptible sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create or manipulate the volume of space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity effects and force interactions, via Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, this note explores some of the original ideas in Q.G.T.C.D.

# Oscillators define the electromagnetic phase field of spacetime and their interactions define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime.

Space around atoms expands spatially relative to the atoms mass. All particles oscillate in their random walk, they shift in their position randomly, greater oscillations (random walk travel distances) result for particles around a mass (compared to travel distances for particles at the center of a mass, where the frequency or density of mass is higher, but the frequency of space is lower).

The way this is represented in a per-interval moment of spacetime is with the relative appearance of expanded space, but expanded space is spacetime that has a greater oscillatory interval for particles. In other words spacetime, in the void of space, is stretched out in volumetric surface area on the axis of space, but it is thinned out in the volumetric area of time.

Conversely spacetime at the center of a star is a compacted volumetric surface area on the axis of space, but it is expanded out in the volumetric area of time. A particle traveling in the void of space will travel long distances with high speed, or high frequency, whereas a particle traveling through the center of a star will travel short distances with slow speed, or low frequency.

It's like if each particle in space was the pendulum of a metronome, the expanded spacetime around the atom or any mass is like the bottom of the pendulum that swings out the widest (during the random oscillation walk)

The center of mass is like the top of the pendulum, it has the highest frequency which is also the highest mass density, and because its frequency interval is higher it is like extra spatial surface area that is hidden in time dimensions, it is essentially a time crystal.

With the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation conjecture: Space ought seem to be moving more slowly at the center of a large mass like the sun, as it has more time area to move through, conversely space ought to seem to be increasingly faster in the spacetime field with distance from the center of that solar mass, this is because it has relatively fewer time frames or time area to move through.

# Space appears to consist of a harmonic oscillating field of particles that can be classified as either energy or mass depending on their frequency or speed.

The fast movement of an electron mass in space ought to accelerate time around the electron which is what I think the magnetic field is, accelerated time, that has an attractive interaction because of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, while what is outside a particle mass is attractive, what is inside a particle mass might be repulsive. (Does that imply that the inside of the earth might be repulsive?) but I guess the density of earth's crust is technically repulsive in effect isn't it? We think of that as pressure, so could the center of mass in an electron be considered to have the effect of pressure (keeping out other particles). Does the pressure effect inside an electron's area increase when the electron is accelerated?

The energy state is mass times the speed of light squared, in other words particles classified as energy have a faster apparent velocity. Imagine the higher speed of energy, relative to mass, indicates particles moving through space that have higher frequency but lower time area, conversely imagine that the lower speed of mass indicates particles moving through space that have lower frequency because that space has higher time area, or more time frames to travel through, so the apparent speed, or relative speed of mass is lower to the speed of energy.

 frequency and ~~amplitude~~ magnitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude increases frequency decreases and vice versa.

If energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space.

# Another separate QGTCD conjecture is that QGTCD creates broad vertical particle traffic lanes emitted from the center of mass. As they get further out into space they are broken up by increasing horizontal particle travel, eventually the horizontal and vertical travel balances out into directionless, or random direction, waves in space. Horizontal particle travel orbits mass but it's a reaction to vertical particle lanes that result from QGTCD.

Dense volumes of space, such as the center of mass, are warming the electromagnetic field & simultaneously increasing the relative intervals of time.

One hypothesis I have comes from imagining a visual symmetry to these vertical particle traffic lanes, that emerge from the excited, heated, time accelerated space at the center of mass is that there are increasing horizontal particle lanes that move in between the vertical particle lanes that balance out the symmetry of particle travel in space, so that there is an equal number of particles moving in each direction, but mass initially defines the pattern of particle travel. The further you get from the center of mass the larger and longer the horizontal particle lanes get. These vertical and horizontal particle lanes create the effects of time dilation by shortening or lengthening the amount of time that it takes for a particle to travel in one direction or another.

At some distance from the center of mass, for example, there is a threshold where the increasing volume of horizontal particle travel, caused by decreasing area in time, corresponds to an aggregate decrease in the observable gravitational effect over a random particle such that we can measure the effect known as time dilation, on clocks located on Satellites in the upper atmosphere for example.

# Challenging the expansion of Spacetime, but returning to a new take Einstein's original conjecture

Space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to atomic oscillations in densified areas of space,

The expansion of space, relative to mass, is simultaneous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales.

Space is not really expanding in the absolute sense (in absolute total area), it's just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking space and spacetime outside the oscillators is staying the same.

This idea could make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are in a sense shrinking space, as if space was a napkin, and a mass represented an area where the napkin was crunched up.

We could think of mass representing an area of the space napkin that is becoming more dense, or more compact. As that area of the napkin shrinks, the spaces around it seem more distant, space seems to be expanding around mass, instead of shrinking at the point of mass.

We can imagine planets gaining mass as they move through spaces with particles & atoms, attracting new particles & atoms via the warping of spacetime, resulting in particle collision lanes attracted to mass. (on a large scale these particle collision lanes result in galactic filaments between galaxies). Mass is space clumping, like oscillations of similar frequencies clumping together. As planets gain mass they further shrink the space napkin so the areas between masses seem to increase expansively.

Critically in this take, not only is spacetime not really expanding, but all of the expansion of space that we can possibly observe is directly relative and proportional to the properties of the mass, if a planet is growing then space expands at the rate of it's growth, if a planet was dissipating then space (around the planet) would appear to contract at the rate of it's dissipation.

# Spacetime as a wave

Suppose that Spacetime as whole is a wave with a frequency pattern.

I'm considering the idea that spacetime is the length of an interval between two oscillations that the cosmos is making when particles shift in and out of existence between having a location or having a velocity.

I imagine that the apparent void of spacetime (imagine the spacetime napkin again) becomes stretched (like a particle wave) that has a high velocity that is warped around an oscillator (like an atom or a planet or a galaxy), because the oscillator is pulling it, attracting it.

While the oscillator has a location, the velocity around the oscillator can't be found anywhere, and instead of seeing a particle with a velocity, instead we get what appeared as the void of spacetime, with an area magnitude, relative to the density of the oscillating volume of mass.

I imagine that if the atomic oscillation (or star) runs out of energy, the velocity that appears as the spacetime void around it, might collapse into a particle with a location.

I argue that spacetime, including mass & energy, is a fractal of oscillators. It does not seem to be a stretch to consider that spacetime is a 3D time interval between oscillations, with the magnitude of the 3D space at each interval of time being flattened time.

# Time is slower the closer you are to the center of mass for you, your watch gets fewer updates, because you are traveling through more time area, or more time frames. Your frequency of travel through time is slower or decreased.

In space, time is updating more often for an object the further away it is from the center of mass (unless it is accelerating or traveling faster), because this object is traveling through space with less time area, with fewer time frames to travel through a watch gets more updates. The frequency of travel through time for the object is increased.

# The Atmospheric Time Dilation rule:
The higher the altitude (distance from earth's mass): the faster the clock runs.
The faster the orbit (acceleration), the slower the clock runs.
The first is gravitational time dilation and the second is relativistic time dilation due to motion, as described by Special Relativity.
The two effects counteract one another.

However if an object accelerates in speed, to escape velocity for example, its relative clock speed again slows down, as it is once again traveling through more frames of time with its increased speed, so it's clock updates more slowly.

# Visualizing a functionally fractal cosmos

In a functionally fractal cosmos (meaning the same patterns repeat with scale invariance) it would make intuitive or visual sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices i.e. atoms & galaxies, and a frequency interval that is 'an expansive spacetime void' relative to the combined density of the oscillator.

As harmonic oscillating space relatively expands, so does corresponding time from the center of a mass vortex.

Perhaps slowly over time the earth gains mass from space? Well at least we can argue that a planetary body gains mass by absorbing gas and comets that collide with it.

The total amount of time increases as space expands, what we experience as a forward interval in time is simultaneous with the expansion of space and in theory the increase in the relative density of earth (because earth as an oscillator is attracting objects, atoms, objects, and anything around it, earth is eating space, but that causes the void of space (and the duration of time) to grow in area paradoxically.)

# Scale Dependent Time means Time moves forward from our perspective

The expansion of the spacetime voice adds a new interval of scale dependent time (time has fewer intervals (fewer time frames) in space further from mass while there are more intervals of time (frames) closer to mass (such as on earth)), but for a object (not accelerating but just floating in orbit) the clock seems to iterate faster the further it is from a dense mass, because it has less distance in time area to travel through, so it's apparent clock speed or frequency is higher.

The higher density of mass affects a particle by changing it's path in time, through the alteration in time a straight distance becomes a curved distance, the object oriented to mass faces a greater window in time, while space around an object opposite from mass features a high frequency of space with a smaller window of time. Mass in effect emits an invisible volumetric surface area, an increase in time in the direction of mass, that changes the odds of particle travel, and changes the odds of object travel. It's not exerting a force so much as changing the path so that forces away from mass may seem to have reduced effect on an object, and forces in alignment with the direction of mass may seem to have increased effect on an object.

There are more directions for that clock that iterates faster in space to travel in the direction of a dense mass than there are in any other direction. Resulting in the gravitational effect, which is a statistical effect, calculating the odds of particle movement per interval of time given all the possible directions a particle can travel at each interval of time with the area in the direction of dense mass having extra surface area from the clock's perspective. So the clock falls toward the earth.

Each new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating distortions or collisions in particle traffic lanes (reacting to gravity aka an increased delta of time frames aka quantized time area around mass).

The effect of time would seem to change with scale: Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to what is happening at the scale of quantum particles.

If we were particles moving at light speed time would not move forward from our perspective.

Could this add light as to why observing what is happening at the Quantum scale is counter intuitive? It's counterintuitive because spacetime at quantum scale is moving faster relative to time as we experience it.

# Time Dilation at particle scale or reverse time dilation.

The center of mass is where the intervals of time are slowed down, but at great distances from the center of mass, particle time, or the clock for the particle is sped up, so what that particle emits is going to create the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation effect of increasing the odds of particle movement in the direction of any other nearby particle. If particles have a compatible oscillatory frequency they will clump together, the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation effect increases the chances of particle-atom clustering or atom formation, and it increases the chances of molecular formation.

Spacetime at the Quantum Scale ought to be iterating more slowly for Quantum Particles the closer they get to mass right? Suppose that Observation or the Measurement affect slows down a wave/particle from it's higher speed time frame, collapsing the wave function, initating it's particle function, because observation or measurement has changed the particles path (in time), the same way gravity warps spacetime, and the particles new path is more dense, because it is moving through more time frames, emitted by the mass of the observer or measurement.

Imagine as a thought experiment that human experience extends across many cells at a greater scale (composed of chemical, electric, magnetic, and mechanical waves) moving through (the atmosphere analogy of) the brain around (a fixed mass like the brain stem). In this thought experiment the human experience on the outer most regions of the brain could iterate faster in time relative to the intervals of time at the molecular scale at the center of the brain (distance from mass argument), but at the same time the faster human experience moves through the brain (acceleration) the slower the clock rate of human experience.

What confuses the issue of observation & the measurement effect is the question of the relative speed of the particles being observed, if the particles we are observing are moving much faster, from having lower mass & higher velocity, compared to human cognition, then we have the reverse viewpoint on the same time dilation effect, where I can again make the argument that perhaps what is happening at the Quantum Scale is counter intuitive because the speed of particle movement updating in frames of time faster than we can intuitively grasp.

To rephrase: Just like the clock in space is iterating faster in space the further it is from mass, so the human experience ought to be iterating faster than what happens at the particle scale unless the particles are moving at a much faster velocity and then special relativity would help us understand that the time dilation effect is reversed to what it might intuitively be with gravity alone.

In other words the speed of particle movement, causes a quantum time dilation affect in relativity that runs contrary to the expected quantum time dilation effect from gravity. Whereas if we slow down a particle, cool it down, the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation effect should be greater and more apparent in contrast.

The frequency of mass in a volume, or the density of atoms in a space, produce the 3D volumetric spacetime field as we know & experience it. What I suppose is that the spacetime field & mass alternate in existence, taking turns with one being spacetime energy while the other is a mass, or a vortex in spacetime, like a never ending pendulum, when one vortex (atom) breaks a part, the energy that is released causes another to exist somewhere else, in a never ending cycle.

# Late night notes:

Reconsidering: Tonight I think what I came up with is a novel idea for how spacetime exists and why time seems to move forward from our perspective. Adding this to the book because it's related to the perception of time in a counter intuitive way.

I was thinking that since spacetime is expanding everywhere. Since atoms are spacetime. That means spacetime is also expanding inside our brains. Our brains are experiencing the expansion of time.

Another thought is that while spacetime is constantly expanding, it is constantly contracting in equal measure, somewhere that it's not expanding. It makes more sense to me, that as oscillators our brains are actually growing, expanding in mass, which is the contraction of space actually, absorbing particles, food, energy, oxygen etc...

If my memories are attractor states, in synaptic connections, it means that I am, through my memories, literally creating myself, growing my mind, and building via new protein synthesis my simulation of reality.

# "Attractor and integrator networks in the brain"
"Thus, it is now possible to conclusively state that the brain constructs and uses such systems for computation. Finally, we highlight recent theoretical advances in understanding how the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and capacity and between structure and flexibility can be overcome by reusing and recombining the same set of modular attractors for multiple functions, so they together produce representations that are structurally constrained and robust but exhibit high capacity and are flexible."

# "Memories from patterns: a review"
""The theory of how complex patterns emerge from simple interactions and constituents is one of the big ideas in biology, explaining animal coats and morphogenesis.

"The same principles can produce dynamical states for computation in the brain, in the form of attractor networks. We review how attractor networks generate states for robust representation, integration, and memory.

"Our review covers the conceptual ideas, the theory, and the potential utility of continuous and discrete attractor networks, then focuses on the empirical evidence that the brain computes using these structures. "

As an oscillator I am in a literal sense ~~creating~~ modifying the spacetime environment around the mass that is myself.

Each oscillator is ~~creating~~ modifying its own relative space phase field, relative to itself, so it being smaller than its space, and shrinking as dissipative systems do over time as they run out of energy well.

# A radical prediction for the future of humanity

My prediction is that humanity is about to have a huge global awakening. Society is about to be transformed by radical new technologies, based on radical advances forward in science that are going to blow many people's minds and change the world as we know it.

The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe?

Perhaps it's about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states: 1 existing somewhere like mass or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel.

So if space is like an oscillation it goes from being all quiet to being all noisy and back again. (or perhaps just alternately in both states but in alternating areas)

Does this mean the entire universe will over time have a sort of heat death? Or the loss of energy from all oscillations? Following that will time restart? Will the heat death oscillate? Will it divide again into a new oscillation? Or is it the case that neither a heat death nor a big crunch ever occurs or will ever occur, because spacetime as a harmonic oscillating field is perpetually spinning up oscillating vortices (particles, atoms, planets, stars, life, galaxies, super clusters, black holes etc....) and all that stuff just happens eternally in endless cycles. I think the latter situation is more plausible.

The uncertainty of whether the universe exists is the key point to contemplate I think.

Imagine that the first oscillation is the one that makes space time possible, and perhaps each new oscillation can be considered to be like a division of the first oscillation, which reverberates for a seeming infinity, and perhaps for an infinity, creating a relative spacetime seemingly for an infinite time with seemingly infinite space. This expansion creates a cascade of new space & time expanding vortices, until the heat death of all vortices/oscillators, which leads back to the initial state of no time or space.

Either spacetime exists in perpetuity or someday it is going to collapse when somehow the last oscillation runs out of energy. Unless there is no such thing as space time running out of energy.

So inbetween no time and no space there is a seemingly infinite expansion of spacetime, and perhaps then the cosmos cycles through different forms infinitely?

Perhaps the singularity moment is only an expansion of space from a point of view, and from another point of view mass is shrinking instead of space expanding.

Because the relative appearance of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which iterates slower time with greater density, and that which iterates faster in time with less density but more spatial magnitude.

# A Random Thought inserted?
On Orch Or: My current hypothesis is that a microtubule would unlikely to contribute to an action potential event in a significant way.

The interesting idea with Orch Or is the idea that a microtubule might store acoustic waveform memories that alter wave forms as waves travel into its tunnel, encounter previous patterns, and come out again like a reflector bouncing a signal back as a new pattern, but I still do not see how that could affect the flow of ions in a significant way, unless a signal from a microtubule can inhibit or excite a receptor.

The alignment of the neuron's magnetic dipole changes with each action potential event, and so there are multiple clues that point to the neuron changing its configuration in multiple ways.

If the microtubule can store memories of mechanical or acoustic vibrations, that alter the wave shape of the AP with their reactions that affect the acoustic wave shape which might change the duration that calcium channels are open, or send a message that tells the neuron which types of vesicles to release, which neurotransmitters to send out.

"How Does A Neuron Stay Polarized"
"One of the major issues is tracking the specific vesicles that are needed to transport each specific component to its exact polar destination. Protein regulation is needed to produce these vesicles—budding from a membrane, transport and then fusion at the destination."
https://jonlieffmd.com/blog/neuronal-plasticity-blog/how-does-a-neuron-stay-polarized

It is interesting to contemplate whether or not the magnetic dipole, of a single neurons, might also encode a kind of memory, at least temporary memory, by making permanent changes in the magnetic side of the electromagnetic phase field, the possible interactions between parts of the magnetic field may going to allow them to influence one another in interesting ways. Resulting in consequences like stimulated mitochondria, inhibited or excited receptors or ion channels, and contribute to unexplained cellular behaviors.

However the meaning of the phase changes is like different internal modalities happening simultaneously in each place with each neuron at each scale. (thalamic neocortex or macro scale, cortical column, neural circuit meso scale, dentride, neuron, synapse or micro scale, and possibly quantum scale as well.)

So a fractal of the magnetic modality co-occuring with the electric signals, mechanical wave signals (the force of neurotransmitters + soliton wave vibrations affecting mechano sensitive potassium receptors with ankyrin repeats).

Those three potential paths for signal transmission in particular (there are others, some neurons can sense heat, light, pain) might represent different temporal or spatial scales for sensed, stored, and transmitted information.

At all scales from micro-meso to the macro brain network the different scales of transmitted waves of information may cooperate simultaneously to develop the brain's tonic brainwave phase field, which creates the reflection of you with its temporally oscillating expectations that define the canvas of human awareness.

It is as if the reflection of you, in the canvas of tonic brainwave oscillations, is your oscillating memories, your expectations, and those memories are driving your choices at all scales, as you get new information, from your senses.

# Phasic Tonic Relationship - The Tonic Mind
Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequencies can spike much higher.
