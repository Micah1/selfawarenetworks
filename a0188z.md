Peter Tse "Neuron can't create it's own choice" read a book called "The neural basis of free will: Criterial Causation, by Peter Tse" He remarks interestingly that a neuron cannot change it's own choice, but it's activity can alter the synaptic connections of other neurons, allowing the brain to react to incoming information, so that information criteria, what we think about, is causing the brain to make different choices.
