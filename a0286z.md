3 Types of Simultaneous Soliton Wave Transmission + Hodkin Huxley. The oscillatory dynamics of a neuron from dendritic computation to multi-vesicle release.

at a higher level the neuron firing could be seen as creating a magnetic arrow inside a four dimensional electromagnetic phase space created by the rest of the brain, essentially a vector written into negative space, because the action potential as an electrical event is probably creating an electromagnetic wave in the brain, at the same time the simultaneous creation of a mechanical wave & a magnetic wave, from the electrical wave would perhaps be of value for motor signals, moving the human body requires a lot more signalling power than what a single neuron transmits, for electricity to create soliton waves via the action potentials would potentially create motor power, and the dissipation of those electromagnetic waves would probably increase the chances of oscillator behavior emerging as a consequence of a larger group of neurons receiving the same signal at the same time, or close to the same time. 

The Synapse potentially transmits three types of soliton waves simultaneously, each exit terminal might be sending a smaller soliton wave fractal of the action potentialâ€™s mechanical vibration wave, a smaller soliton wave fractal of its electrical wave via chemical transmission, and a smaller soliton wave fractal of its magnetic wave. This would allow each neuron to correlate the 3 types of waves with the dendrite serving as a detector, or a pooler that creates the 4 dimensional (3 dimensions of space and 1 of time) soliton wave form that neurons on the receiving end will use to compile their own picture or potentially a 4 dimensional pattern representation of what signals were transmitted that maps, correlates,  crafts, produces and transmits more such combinations of soliton wave transmissions. If this is true then a neural firing sequence in the auditory cortex could represent a musical note at each interval, or at the firing of each neuron, that is then detected or observed by

Note that a soliton wave transmission is a phase with specific topological characteristics in 4 dimensions, so its four dimensional surface morphs over time. The next neuron is perhaps with its dendritic collection shrinking 4 dimensional wave patterns from other neurons into simply micro-voltage events over time, these would likely co-occur with micro vibration events, and micro-magnetic events that shake and pressurizes the mechanical wall of the cell that is held together by electromagnetism, allowing it to expand so transmitters can flood in, like a balloon sucking in neurotransmitters slowly, until it needs to blow them out with the action potential event.

Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.

If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  and electromechanical wave electromechanical wave through the air that could represent a sound or a light pattern or a touch sensation that is heard or felt or seen by the post-synaptic dendrite, and these mechanical waves are symbolic of the quantity of ions being let into the neuron by the neurotransmitters

So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

# The magnitude of the wave, determined by Potassium (see Synaptic Unreliability article a0221z.md) is passed via duration (calcium channels open longer)

Which translates to a great number of vesicle (lipid or fat sacs containing thousands of neurotransmitters to be release) 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicles transmitted in each interval (action potential firing), representing oscillation phases for four neuronal phase states: inhibition, tonic firing, excited firing, and really excited firing. This allows the neuron to store the meaning of a phase event as a charge resulting from ion build up. Each event sets an interval for the neurons clock, which is essentially counting until it fires, making it an oscillator that essentially learns patterns by changing the configuration of its synapses or having those synapses reconfigured by other neurons.
