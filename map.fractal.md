As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of ne

   4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's

In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23

The universe doesn't have to store any data beyond the fundamental mathematical formulas that give rise to the position of every calcium ion in your brain. The reasoning is that these mathematical formula's can regenerate whatever your learning would have been, in the moment they are needed, regardless of whether you vanished from existence for some period of time prior to whatever is happening right now.

Here is what I can say. Take a causal set (S, w). It has a corresponding permutation groupoid, which induces a group-theoretical block system on S. In addition, and here comes the interesting part, partial order w induces a partial order on the blocks, and the block system itself becomes a (smaller) causal set. This property of recurrence should explain hierarchies, fractals, power laws, scaling, semantics, emergence, AGI.

  132: *See my notes on "telescope" /c0002x.md I compare the brain to the eyeball, in that the lense of the eye, with the retina, is a fractal of the brain with the neo cortex as the retina of the brain, and patterns in the synapses scale up at micro, meso, and macro scales, when memories become the focus of our minds eye, when we are thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.

  173: So, he is, he's very much a fractal of cancer. He doesn't, of course, realize it because being a fractal of cancer means that the biology doesn't realize 
  178: His behavior is the fact that he's not connecting the dots, he's not conscious fully conscious that he's a fractal of cancer. And if he accepted that, he understood it, he would transcend that concept despite name, sort of like naming his behavior and understanding the analogy to cancer, but he's not transcending the concept.
  182: So we're dealing with essentially a cancer, a biological cancer, a fractal of a biological cancer playing out in terms of human personality. And this is possible because essentially, the human biology is a computer program. And and it's like your brain is, this is the server for the matrix. Your brain is like the server for the major.
  302: In any case, where some independent cells that are really tiny, could be like little, you know, little little men that self-assemble into a larger man because that is kind of like the human being is a fractal. Right? Where like a T cell. This is like, it's like a little man moving through your body.

b0015y.md:
  119: So we are reality spiraling, essentially, on some level. That is a valid way to see it as a valid viewpoint. It's not the only valid viewpoint. This is also real, but that's another valid perspective on it, right? And yes. So it's like, yeah, we are in essence like this fractal.
  123: Functional funnel. Isomorphic, I mean that's you know, when I say fractal and I say, isomorphic, those are (almost saying the same thing) Those are like a self-repeating pattern, right. But it's like you have a, you have an isomorphic function and you have like an isomorphism of functions. What I mean is like if you have, you say, okay, you're gonna describe how something changed over time, like, this is gonna go from here to here.

b0044y.md:
  43: We have this sense of space. And so going to like the fractal, hierarchical the fact of hierarchy practical functional isomorphism. It is this thing that we see with you know with EG and MEG and MRI that there's seems like you know the signals that one scale are repeating at another scale.

b0062y.md:
   5: So let's go back to the eyeball. And I want to say that. Imagine. Okay, so you have the light comes into the lens, it's a little area. And then the the round sphere of the eyeball is where the red nose is. And that's a fractal. The brain. And the question is that, if that's a factor of the grade, then whereas like, coming in from, and it just so happens that there's something special happening in the enterino and table loop.
  11: That's how the brain is a fractal of the eyeball.

b0098y ctpr.txt:
  89: But like, I think so, I think, eventually it's gonna be easier, but, but I'm feeling like the so I feel like I had this idea that, you know, the, you know, going back to the brain having fractal patterns at multiple scale that have been identified with EEG medical imaging with the EG and in, and energy and FMRI.

b0100y.md:
  186: And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.

b0103y ctpr.txt:
  17: Yeah. What if it's like a fractal space? Like we're like, what if like what if the particle of a face field has its own face feel, right? And so the reason it's behavior is some mysterious is because it's micro face field. Inside the pace field is basically repeating the same patterns as a larger phase field, kind of smaller.
  35: Those are the four case screens that are being presented to your thalamus, that in collectively. They're pretty in the being presented to the, to the default network, right? Which is connects the default that, you know, just the major connections. The major connector areas between the different parts of the neocortex are acting like a fractal screen for your for your downness, right?

b0104y.md:
   84: Just say that the global rain pattern is alternately magnifying. The pattern coming from the left hemisphere and the innandous, magnifying, the pattern coming from the right hemisphere. And so when when one of those patterns is active it, transmits, it's pattern to the global pattern as a sort of like as a fractal.
  110: But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.

b0105y ctpr.txt:
   10: It goes each time like a pattern scales up so that it was represented at the neuron level, but now at the synaptic level, you know, but, but now it's represented at the global level of brain. And you can see that these fractals, these fractal patterns, do exist to the brain, whereas where you will you have at the global level can predict what you might find at the or which you take like, you can have correlations between correlated activity patterns at different scales of the brain that have been measured with EEG given measures with MRI.
   28: Yeah, so I yeah. But anyways, the shrieking Sam. So, I mean, I guess if a mechanical wave really is a fractal of basically a largest scale factor over an electric wave, right? Mechanical wave, but they're just withers away. Fractal in, in the mechanical space is also electromagnetic space, so it's like a large scale.
  134: And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.

b0106y ctpr.txt:
  61: So a mechanical field wave is still an electromagnetic wave in a sense. It's just a larger scale wave. That happens at the mechanical level, but it's very essentially, both kinds of waves are. Are the saying it's to say it's the same fractal. It's like there's a friend. It's like the universe is a fractal of wave patterns.
  75: All being interact. They're all being interacted with by the gravitational force. Right. There is an intro. There is interactivity between gravity and the electromagnetic fields because because, you know, we like gravity is sort of described at the at the classical scale or the the the molecule scale, right? But mechanical waves are really just fractals.
  77: And of EMWA. So just larger scale fractals of the amines, right? And yeah. So so but yeah, so it's interesting that like, you know, so the neurotransmitters that get expelled from one neuron, they don't. Like I said, there's they don't go into the body of the next cell. They stay in this, an app to cleft and they're either like, swept away, like the brain like sweeps away, that space and the stuff in it or, or which is in and then.

b0107.md:
  234: So there so their temporal scene has been shifted from being connected to some neurons now being connected to other neurons. But in any case, I'm like I'm suggesting if there's a magnifying effect this similar to an empty to the, or the similar, to the enlarging effect of a photocopier, I mean, I think that the other the other foot to drop is that we do see fractal patterns at small scales becoming factor patterns at large scales.

b0110y ctpr.txt:
  69: So like if you imagine if you imagine you know, if you go from this order of you have a big oscillator, followed by a smaller oscillator followed by a smaller oscillator and then you look at human beings. This is also can also fractals oscillating, you know, fractals because it goes down human beings.
  75: It's sort of thing like because the universe can't decide it it oscillates between existing and not existing, in a sense and that oscillation creates an oscillation cascade which creates space time because the each of the, because from the first oscillate, the for the first oscillation to the multiplication of oscillations, the fractalization of space time is growing and so space time, appears to expand, but it's expanding relative to the oscillators, but since human beings are oscillators hemolytes trees.
  85: But what we're seeing is that we're that we're all part of the branches of a great, oscillatory tree and at and at the same time that. So basically that wouldn't mean what that means. So is that as a human being you are like the branch of a tree your branch of the tree of the the oscillating fractal universe, right?

b0112y.md:
  27: If the brain a synaptic memory structure, and a fractal sense, like chapters are like, and I guess that could represent the court, the cortical column, you know, quite sort of cortical columns could be fractal of the, the synapses on the, on the, on the on, again, unidentight, like the blue times on the dead rate, right?

b0114y.md:
  164: That's an interesting. It's an interesting thought. I don't know. But like imagine that. So like your brain at your skull has, it's kind of like a dumb, you know, like your eyeball, like imagine your your brain and your eye are our fractals of one. Another like you're I mean you're your school like your skull is it is kind of like a it's on it's almost it's it's almost a dome you know it's round it encompasses your goes around your brain and protects it from every direction.

b0116y.md:
   51: And then that becomes so that it then gets divided by the branches of the exit terminal. And so that potentially becomes like fractalize. So what I'm saying is, imagine that you have this convergence so you have, you have the electric signals can converging into you have disparate you that you have basically.
   54: ⟪ 270 characters skipped ⟫. And then what might happen is that the external it when it divides that way it's basically making a lot of copies of that waste pattern that temple space away pattern and each copy is like a little fractal, mini copy.
  102: Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU. 
  110: I've been thinking of spaceTime as a fractal of verdicts and I you know we're dissipative systems like a Vortex like a galaxy.
  119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.

b0122y  ctpr.txt:
   9: But I expect that the the actual effect of signals from the microtubules will be too small to to meaning meaningfully contribute to a change in the voltage membrane that would cause an action potential. I mean, it could be that there's some, you know, if you basically consider the the brain as a fractal, then then the argument would be that what's happening at the thalamic level, at the cortical, column level in the neocortex, what's happening?
  13: And then in theory, there could be another, there could be a quantum scale fractal in the microtubule.
  17: Activity in the brain, we have the the thalamic thalamic scale, column scale. Actually, you know, we've got four different scales. So we've got the neural neural circuit court. We have horizontal scale, horizontal narrow circuit scale, and then we have the sort of like atomic and dendritic scale. Fractal. Isolation memory system.
  21: Prediction system action prediction system. A fractal, pretty more back factor. So in that practical possibility yeah she's like pretty much. All right. Now. Fractal. Oscillatory fractal. Oscillatory, action prediction memory system fractal. Also towards action prediction memory system and necessary introduction of the system track. Now, it tracks tracks oscillations between actions and sensory inputs.

b0125y ctpr.txt:
  11: And this is sort of like a fractal of what happens at the at the it with your with your neurons on the micro level. It's a fact that because yes so the the neurons are connected by synapses and sometimes the connections grow and sometimes they disappear. And the kind the sort of like analog the the big picture analogy is that the human social network and the social network of neurons.
  13: They have some frat interesting fractal parallels that that can be considered for potential insights. One of those insights. Might be that people that we are not talking to. Now that we were talking to in the past, they still exist and a shared network, but it's not, it's not like this network has to it, it's not that this network has to become diseased or cancerous.
  15: Maybe there was some sort of event or lesion that drove people apart, drove the neurons apart and maybe it was traumatic for both. I don't know. But the point is that that if you think of it as a human being is kind of like kind of like a neuron as a functional fractal.
  17: Functional. Fractal, isomorphism of a neuron in terms of
  19: Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.
  21: It's the fractal of a person in the context of their social relationships.

   3: Fractal Water Canvas Dipoles Neurons Brain
   5: So with the soccer's book, read the most of the brain and 2006. He talks about the fractal nature of EeG readings and multiple scales. Whether you're measuring whether you're measuring electrical fields that are they represent a few hundred neurons in depth in the cortex or your measuring millions of neurons.
   7: Recorded by scalp electrodes with the EG. The the power spectra is essentially identical and there's a sort of scale invariance or self-similarity self-similarity at different scales. That is, then that is the decisive characteristic of fractals such as river bed is, and this is, this is again from stockies or rhythms of the brain.
   9: So you can talk about trees. You talk about different kinds of fractals. And so there's a fractal pattern there in the EEG. And in electrons, efficient from measured outside of scalp and from electrodes inside the scalp. But also from, for measuring the mat, the magnetic and dipoles, or with energy.
  11: So the ET measures the electric dipole. The energy is, is a machine that measures the magnetic dipoles of the brain, which are different from the electric dipoles. So, you get a different sort of image with energy, and which interesting is that, you know, recently, there was an FMRI study, I believe it was at a Princeton where they discovered, fractal patterns in regional, brain activity at multiple scales Again.
  13: So, now we have blood flow, we have the magnetic dipoles, we have the electric dipoles also impractical patterns and there's also, you can also make an argument there that there are fractal. Functional isomorphic patterns in the, in the India and anatomical function from from the way. If you consider, how is a neuron like a hand, how is a dendrite like your fingers?
  17: The LGN cluster of your thalamus that that it's like here arm is plugging into the socket of your shoulder. So so what I'm arguing that that, although your arm doesn't, it doesn't look exactly like a dendrite that it has a fact that the anatomy has a fractal, functional isomorphism to your eye and to a neuron, and to your brain is the whole.
  21: So, for peanut patterns, and the magnetic readings and multiple scales, and in the readings of your of your blood flow, tracking activity in your brain regions, fractal, functional isomorphins morphisms exist in multiple domains, or multiple modalities simultaneously. And,
  77: So you have this like flexible sort of like substrate, that's almost that that is fractal and multiple scales. Which again is like that is it's something that if you think about like, you know, Galileo and the, the I think about the first lenses, right? How do you make a lens?

b0151y.md:
    7: (this note then links to the map on fractals with medical imagining, to illustrate that the telescopic effect is being found with patterns that repeat in the brain at multiple scales)
   23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.
  152: When you are not when your attention is not needed. And so attention is basically. I think of the analogous multi-scale pattern. Replication pattern linking between microscale and macroscale, representations, or basically the fractal, the factory representations on multiple scales across the acrostic wrath, the multi-level graph networks of the brain. And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book rethinking consciousness, he says that there's, he says that the central idea of consciousness is of this right of attention.

b0153y.md:
   9: Regional activity in the takes the shape of multiple cell clusters that fired in a sequence of soliton waves, so if you draw a line between the neurons that fired at each stage of the sequency you have the soliton wave vector pattern that represents the scaled up & activated representation or fractal of the patterns stored via learned synaptic connections over time.
  25: # There is a whole discussion on fractals that I want to link right here.

b0160y ctpr.txt:
   9: Cameras have like, what is what's waking consciousness? But we need to talk about fractal ice with the different scales, or fractal, play that and crackle patterns. And functional functional.
  11: Fractal. Functional and isomorphic, fractal patterns at multiple scales, nice and more functional practical isomorphism, right? Or fractal functionalized basically their fractals. But so we can talk about. Yes. So talk about the highball in the brain and but also we can talk about poor calm development and everything. All the above being like nested embedded crackles.

b0161y ctpr.txt:
  48: So yeah, the ideas people could change overnight the the way that let's say that the Maltese scale fractalization of brain activity and look like in terms of like how small patterns become repeated on the larger scales or different scales. I believe that helps to create that those fractal patterns the same patterns that appear different scales are helping to create multi-scale temple, spatial, cohesion, so that

b0174y ctpr.txt:
  26: So that was my major. I was my major point, my major argument of contention with Morgan and also I argued that the brain was a fractal functional was was the functional.
  35: Fractals multi-level, fractal. Functional isomorphism, meaning that the functions and different scales with the brain were functionally isomorphic and recursive. Fractal pattern is it's it's a, it's a, it's only a fact or and in terms of having a functionalized, a functional a fractal, functional isomorphism, a fractal, functionalizing, Marshall, fractal functionalism,
  44: That's also a fractal. It's fractal. Functional, isomorphic and multi-scales of the brain, but them, the macro. And as a in the micro each one of them is tractor. Functional. More effective. Functional. By some morphism, I said the right word so I promotions iPhone and

b0179y ctpr.txt:
  7: So, you have to think about fractal of what's happening in the micro level. So when we're talking about macro dipole, oscillation is being the, you see. That's the thing that you don't think about is actually. So the brain is a has a quad quadruple, has a dipole on the other side, right?

b0197y ctpr.txt:
  159: Your hand is, I think of your hand is like, the as like the fractal of a neuron and your fingers would be like the dendrite, like the branches and the core of your hand, the center of your hand is like the soma. Okay. So your hand, you hand. It is collecting a lot of sensory data now, touch your hand and in the center in the palm.
  161: Because that's like this so much. So just definitely like signal collection happening there and it then, right, there's signal collection happening it's it's a fractal. And in that, whatever you touch is creating signals on this under the surface of your skin, your touch is creating signals and where your hand is being touched, okay?
  167: You might jerk your hand back. That's the at the autonomic nervous system that sort of like out of your conscious awareness. It's doing all these things. It's listening, sort of all the time to a new incoming sensory data. When your hand is a good analogy for dendrite. In fact, it's the it's a fractal of dentry.
  171: Okay, then your hand, your hand is a fractal, like a tree, also, right? Think about the, the roots of a tree, right? And so, each, each part of each of your fingers is, when, when you touch each part of each of your fingers and go ahead and do that.

b0213y ctpr.txt:
  146: It's just that humor, but I think that's a interesting metaphor. Like are you your hand is basically at the fractal of a dendrite basically.

b0234y ctpr.txt:
  21: But what what gives us sort of like would gives each person each individual. Their own separate agency is that is the is first of all, the the structure, the modularity of like, you know, every every brain is its own module, right? And a brain has modules inside it. It's like a fractal of modules.

  637: It's a green tree. Like, fractal thing that's crunchy and tasty. And and it has nutrients in it and has all these properties that I can identify and you can identify your emotional spectrum might be dramatically different from mine and probably is because I probably have a lot more testosterone, just guessing.

b0267y ctpr.txt:
  231: And but they will connect to a summer which is where so it's like so imagine imagine a fractal right so fractals like you have imagined my hand is my hand as a fractal okay and the look which do you see my hand right now? Okay so the dendrite is like the tree so imagine each of my fingers are like the branches of the tree, so the dendrite is where each of my fingers is one is part of the dendrite now we're all the fingers meat in the body of the hand.

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  153: Throw. Out patterns that are not what it's looking for. So it's gonna do like a micro computation recognition that is seeing sort of like a single cell fractal of what the multi-cell pattern recognition is doing perhaps. And and like I said, you you talk to different people in different researchers and different areas and you're gonna get different answers in terms of the granularity of pattern recognition, whether it's single cell or multi-cell and so I'm just sort of like yeah open-minded about exploring what the answers could be here.

b0276y.md:
  908: So yeah, so it's like every it's a crowd it's fractal so it's like saying your whole factor room isn't is also matter of like fractal rooms.

  259: It's happening really low down and that's new that was not that is that's a new idea. So and the rapper, It's not it sounds like we might have a thousand visual concepts of coffee cup and a visual cortex and a thousand audio concepts it'll coffee cup and an audio cortex and those are just linked together but right but I wonder for you this is sound similar to like, you know, like a hologram when you have many copies of the same thing or like a fractal.

b0308y.md:
  219: This scale in variance or cell similarity. Is a decisive characteristic of fractals. I almost like fell out of my chair when he said that I was like, whatever you heard me, I made some sort of sound at the time was like the fractal structures such as river beds snowflakes furn leaves tree arbors and arteries and fractal dynamic processes such as pink noise cloud formation earthquakes snow and sand avalanches heart rhythms and stock market flux price fluctuations are so similar in that any piece of the fractal design contains a miniature of the entire thing.
  249: So the generalization of the relationship between physical stimuli and cognitive events has come to be known as psychophysics. Right that was that was another note and psychophysics was the term. So let's look at the another note. So several recent experiments provide evidence for scale free and spatial fractal nature of scalp.
  252: EG recorded over. Extant durations. That was the reference I believe to the fractal scale-free and spat in space for free. So here was this idea that basically like every mammal like every. Every brain that's similar to our brain is basically a fret like a fractal the same program. That that was like that was mind stretching and alarming sort of way.
  264: I mean this it this goes yeah, this is why I say I'm studying quantum, you know applied quantum field woo and you know, but that's why I always phrase it that way because yeah if you look at if you if you look at the fractal nature, you can't you can't really divorce one discipline from another just each discipline focuses on specific aspects.
  267: But if you you know, if you take this to heart then yeah, it is all just. Copies of or not copies, but you know, it is all just a fractal array right? Yeah continental copies. Yeah, it's a self repeating pattern. It's all copies of the same sort of cognitive structure.

b0310y.md:
  1065: You can. And yeah yeah comments a little bit so like my team does measurements election next signals of genetic molecules like viruses and TNA RNA we found that they behave very much like fractal antennas so antennas can tune into fields for the distance and so this kind of idea of telepathy.

  1960: Anyway, if I keep on rolling a die and I put it halfway in between the point of the triangle that I initially made and where my last point was. It actually creates an incredibly accurate fractal. So the point of this being is that math and nature it's just literally it's emergent it's baked into what just simple numbers like you can't create a parallel universe like it all is.

   536: So um, so either packaging came up with the with I think could be the original idea of that human beings are dissipative systems or vortices and so you you can see that you know, basically the entire universe is a fractal vortexes or vortices, you know from like from a galaxy to an atom to to a cell to the human brain to basically everything is a vortex in some sense or a dissipative system and it has to maintain its own equilibrium and export.
  1106: I don't know this way actually. This was my initial question. If the bounds we we see now in this in this mathematics is just bound to this world or to the simulation. So I I wonder it's basically the question would be do you find a set of causal principles that keeps rise to some kind of dynamic fractals in which you can find computers and intelligent beings and so on.

  214: ⟪ 291 characters skipped ⟫we are vortexed the there are oscillations in the brain there's there are cycles and feedback loops and self-maintaining physics and the physics of every cell and the button the body itself and, In a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium like these are all concepts that are sort of like tied into the what what the concept of a whirlpool meaning to you know, maintain it's it's on order with the I guess the the topology of recursion what was the was what makes those said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that because when mixols did recursion I thought of ways as you talking about like a recursive neural network, what is what is this was?
  315: I just got inside when you're told that like oh my crap maybe the the whole microtubules are yet another dissipated system that exists below the embodiment of the the currents understanding of DNA and stuff it's all right in my mind, so thanks a lot. I mean, I think honestly that the entire universe is fractal dissipative systems, so I just that's my feeling but,
  321: This. Clone as well a human being is as dissipative system is a is a human being as a life form that is a cyclone in an on paper if you look at the physics that the human being has to maintain equilibrium or maintain life as to export increasing entropy to the surrounding environment to survive to maintain that equilibrium a cell does the same thing that's another cyclone does a human cell so like the entire universe is is is a fractal of cyclones, that's so funny.
  327: Is happening at the the quantum level and that aligns exactly with this whole idea of everything is like fractal structural fractal yeah, the problem is fractals are very often just considered the the recursive structure well if you actually look at the essence of a fractal is about fracture it's about being rough edges and and how you can actually start measuring with that so that I know there's always quite some confusion of the the recursive name.
  330: Nature and the fractal nature but I follow you. I mean it's it's always all the time this this dissipative system popping up at at the next emerging level and that's kind of lines which with the stuff that philosophers are doing with the emerging vector theory the emerging mind. Emerging vector theory, so that's that's that's something philosophers are pretty heavy on at the moment and to to stop trying to to yeah.

  1329: in terms of like his description and then we've got all these loops and we've got small loops and loops inside other loops and it's like this and this, um, this fractal of loops and and and maybe a fractal dipoles and it's just so so interesting and I don't know if we should leave it there for for tonight, but then,

People will say oh of course it makes sense. Universe is a fractal and they'll be like, okay, no big deal. Then the interesting thing to consider is the the basis of the kind of consciousness that we have versus the kind of consciousness that a machine intelligence would have because we've entirely evolved even from the time of being single cellular organisms to feel the world around us in the form of receptors bunnies different molecules.
