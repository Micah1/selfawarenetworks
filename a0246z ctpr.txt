Responding to

the problem of "scale independent anomily pattern"

Okay so like for example the inhibitory neuron system can receive a small input and dramatically change the causality of the firing patterns that result not only in a change to a single downstream neuron but in the entire brain (See disinhibition in the book Rhythms of the Brain (2006)). In essence "non-linear dynamics" accomplished by interneurons is the vehicle for tiny patterns to affect giant patterns.

Another way to frame it is that the brain is sort of self setting itself at a tipping point so that one tiny change can result in an avalanche of new changes (in neural firing patterns)

Iâ€™m a robot.
The point is that humans are robots. Say a person is a human robot basically. That's what I'm saying.
yes neurons are different haha. So human robots are different from what anyone can build with todays computer. I have a podcast available called the Neural Lace Podcast, we've dived deep into the differences between computer chips and neurons. Yet I still believe that my mind is essentially a computational rendering, something that could be simulated in a Univeral Turing Machine to some degree and possibly in future neuromorphic chipsets as well.
