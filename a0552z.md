1130 stopping cigarette addiction isnt logic, or reason, it's intuition, meaning a new connection pattern between rewards, consequences, behaviors, and inhibitions
   
It appears that intelligence, in a brain, is a pre-logical process. Apparently pre-logical brains can learn to use and understand the tools of logic, and reason, via a process that itself remains pre-logical, and irrational.

Might intelligence be a pre-logical process of pattern learning and pattern expression via path linking?

It occurs to me now that humans may only mimick the appearance of what they believe is rational, reasonable, and logical behavior. Intelligence might be pre-logical path linking, ie pattern matching, pattern learning, and chemical driven pattern expression. This same simple intelligence may be that which utilizes the tools of reason (including but not limited to philosophical argument, logic, mathematics, thought experiments, physics, all the sciences, all the tools of the reductionist paradigm, etc...), as learned patterns (referencing the aforementioned tools of reason) that may be likened to learned paths. Paths like neural pathways, or complex paths in the forest, that lead to results. Results such as fruits, rewards, money. Perhaps even the greatest minds ever recognized in history have been manifestations of this pre-logical, pre-rational, pattern learning and pattern expression process, ie electro-chemical driven path linking.

Pre-logical path linking means that every thing we sense becomes a link between points, those points might be fired neurons. A pattern that is captured by a neuron higher up that fires when that pattern fires (because they are sending a charge it's way.) When two patterns are in the same room together, they create a second tier pattern, meaning now two neurons higher up have fired. These two neurons now represent a combination of the two patterns learned lower down. In this way all the patterns in the world, from all the objects, notions, sounds, horizons, pictures, get linked together into super patterns cascading up neural hierarchies. This includes learning patterns that cause coordinated muscle movements. They get linked with patterns that cause chemical changes, meaning rewards and other consequences. So muscle movements get linked via neural node patterns to chemical driven needs. When a chemical need says "I'm expecting more nicotine" it triggers complex thought and motor behavior to get a cigarette. Connecting the nicotine need with consequences may connect with an inhibiting pattern that prevents the thinking and motor path that gets cigarettes from happening. Stopping the cigarette habit was not a logical or rational choice, it was intuition, meaning it was simply a new connection pattern that drove improved behavior.

A non-logical new connection links chemical driven incentives with rewards & consequences, and more intelligent behavior results. This behavior is apparently better neural path finding.

After you read this paragraph, fix your attention on any point for a moment, and imagine that what your looking DIRECTLY at is creating a wave of cells that are lighting up because the external stimulus, and what your NOT looking directly at is created inside your brain, internally, from cells that are getting ready to fire, because you might turn your head. Then imagine as you reach for a door handle today, that before you touch that door or door handle, there is an expectation as to what it is going to feel like, and that expectation is made by cells that are getting ready to fire, just in case you do touch that door.

James Nakos Actually I've thought of this many times... It's pretty exciting to know/realize!

After you read this look at any two objects, and imagine that the vector space between them is represented by cells expecting to fire.

Micah Blumberg
Imagine that when cells fire, or go into a ready state, they represent points in linear algebra equation, or an xyzt graph or more simply points you can relate to as having a distance from you, and a distance from other points. Except that the points your receiving are only tiny bits of the picture you think your seeing.

Imagine that a wave of these points is only a small part of what you think your seeing, because the rest of what you think your seeing is coming from cells in a ready state. They are in a ready state contributing to what you think you see, because they are like dog trained to be associated with the points that are firing.

Imagine that with each 1/1000th of a second. Your getting a different wave of different points, cells that represent vectors, planes, colors, details, reflections, sounds in this xyzt graph space.

Imagine that what can seem like a whole picture and a whole experience of reality is at the same time actually brainwaves of vectors represented by bits (fired cells), bits that represent pieces of the whole experience, not all at once, but in a fast sequence, bits that create the impression of vectors, planes, details etc.. Tiny pieces of the picture that comes so fast it seems like one holistic and smooth experience. In one second the detail your directly noticing is what is firing, and the details you are not directly noticing have either recently fired, or are in a ready state getting ready to fire, but so much has fired so quickly that the complexity of detail in your experiences seems rich.

Imagine that some people look at a brainwave, and they say this isn't a picture of anything, so they claim that are no pictures in the brain, well that's kinda wrong.

Imagine that pictures are accomplished as vectors between fired cells, and ready cells (from other recently fired cell) These are not like jpg pictures, but you can imagine them as a sort of four dimensional projector where the screen is the projector, and the projector is the screen, and the viewer is both screen and projector.

Imagine this viewer (who is both the projector and the screen) is the structure of the cells that are either firing, or in a ready state from other nearby cells that have already fired.

So imagine that the viewer is all the cells, and what appears to the viewer are visible and invisible vectors, spatial and temporal relationships, created by both cells that are firing, and cells that are ready to fire from other cells that have fired.

After you read this fixate on any point in your field of vision, and think the spatial meaning of this point is it's distance from me (vector), and it's distance from other points(more vectors). So meaning is like the vectors between associated points. It's tempo-spatial meaning can include vectors that point to it's density, it's volume, it's texture, it's temperature, it's history, any associated words, or concepts, and each of those things are represented as vectors between cells in other areas of the brain, they get ready to fire because they are linked to what has fired, and what has fired is what you have focused on.

So if a cell is a node in the mindmap, imagine that the meaning isn't in the node, it's between the nodes.

haha is that like connecting the dots? I cant keep up with you guys on this one...I use the right brain most of the time...do the nodes drift? heehee

Hey Betsy, imagine that the dots that light up are what is inside consciousness, and the dots getting ready to light up are the subconscious, and the dots that are not lit up are unconscious. The light drifts (meaning that the nodes that light up create patterns that look like waves moving throught the brain)

Just imagine that when you see something, this is happening in your brain. Imagine that your having waves of sight pass through your brain tissue. Flowing in almost like water with special properties http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-fetal-neural-vision.html

the morphism (arrow symbol) could describe the path or sequence in which these links appear in cognition, like the path of a brainwave through cortical columns could be described as a wave of morphisms (arrows)
does your system allow links to jump through space to a node that isn't attached as might happen in a brain?

I suspect that the ability to reason and think rationally may actually describe the pinnacle of non-rational intuition. Meaning that reason itself maybe the non-rational recognition of higher order sequences of variable prediction patterns in the highest levels of the neo cortex. Where sequences of tokens of meaning (in any sensory modality, as a notion, shape, space, picture, word) are ordered and re-ordered, added or otherwise computed, (through dialog, in journals, via meditation, brainstorming, or put through reasoning tools via math, or formal logic, or computer simulations) and then the value, which is the result of this "reasoning process", or logical computation is something that is received into memory by the highest levels of a reasonable person's memory. Which even in the most evolved human may be actually a non-rational intuition system. Non-rational even at the highest levels, even at the peak state of consciousness in its most refined form. Maybe a human is considered to be rational and or to have good reasoning abilities based on some demonstration of results that are non-rationally perceived as good results. Meaning merely associated. Essentially I am saying that advanced pattern matching (that is pre-logic) may be intuitively learning and engaging in logical processes, that are understood and recognized as logical processes, by a system that is only capable of pattern matching. I say that reasoning and logic are like tools, behaviors, songs, and software. Our brains seeming to be intuitively capable of using them, or engaging with them, but maybe its somewhat of an illusion that people can be actually rational. Maybe we can say that some people have acquired more rational thinking, and or more rational behavior patterns. Reasoning and rationality maybe a superficial process, hiding a system that can be neither in its core functioning.

When I found out that neurons inhibit nearby neurons when they fire I thought, here is the secret of intuition

There are chemical signals that come from your body that can shut down your rational thinking, and make you fall sleep for instance. Rational thinking is apparently a guest inside a chemical system that isn't rational, maybe it's a tool of intelligence, but not part of intelligence.

Is a semantic token the meaning of a word?

Is a semantic token a map of vectors between points above a certain threshold in various nodes?

Is a semantic token like a matrix, that can be understood as a spatial metaphor, or a description in category theory that defines or remembers a relationship between vectors that emerge in space?

Is model free intelligence about creating a model based on whatever emerges beyond the thresholds that filter significant patterns from noise?
I'm getting a new sense of the inner geometry of my mind.
and the geometry of my thoughts

See this video http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-fetal-neural-vision.html this does not look like single character bits fed one at a time triggering points converted into vector mapped based memories. it looks like a morphing vector pattern being going through several stages of memory reduction in the architecture. Essentially because the burst runs out of steam, and then it leaves its vector mapped imprint. A spatial representation imprinted in the fired connections.

I immediately think of category theory as a holistic counterpart to set theory.

Category theory is math, so it's on the side of reductionist, but...

it maybe a way to model holistic components, and holistic structure that accumulate in the emergence of a model free intelligence

I'm a model free intelligence, how interesting.

Is this a form of primal intuition? The slime mold just doesn't search where it has searched before. So it's own slime serves as a memory, and can we describe this behavior as intuition? fyi my apologies if I have misunderstood AN I just started reading your website about Artificial Intuition today and I am extremely fascinated! http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/10/08/brainless-creature-solves-problems-with-memories-of-slime/
