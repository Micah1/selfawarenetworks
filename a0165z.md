Volition. Who or what is really in charge of the ship? How could that be verified in direct experience?

Its as if the brain builds a map of everything it senses, including its own body, so your name is associated with an internal map, that is associated with a voice that is associated with motor controls, that why when someone calls your name your body responds, so there is a map which is kind of like an avatar of self, the thoughts you have are effecting the actual hardware of your body all the time, and they are effected by everything else as well, but they are yours just because those a variables in your map and your brain is writing maps all the time.

Your neurons which fire thoughts are regulating every cell in the body, its a complex system, but the brain can change itself, meaning you can change you.

What's interesting is that this that the ability to regulate, control, grow, change and choose yourself, your actions, your development, and your relationships towards others does not actually eliminate the possibility that this is a deterministic universe, just because it's a probabilistic universe does not mean that it's not also a deterministic one, being that the universe on some scales appears to be probabilitic might mean that we will never be able to predict what is going to happen with certainty.

Apparently the thought of your existence is unified with the physiology of your brain. So you might be responsible for your actions towards others in a dualistic context, because the rules of determinism may include unpredictable probabilities, and self organizing beings that have to regulate their own behavior, something they call choice, in order to survive on this tough planet. It's very paradoxical.

Someone said there is a bell curve of probabilities, in the middle where the curve is thickest are the things you are most likely to do, and on the ends of the bell curve where it's thinnest are the things you are least likely to do, and what you do is called your choice, but it's someone of a dice roll, there is a probability your going to pick something in the middle, but there is the chance your going to choose something on the ends.

"If you are the sum of your experiences and those past experiences shape your present view of what is happening and your immediate actions are in response to the story line you have created around those past experiences, then is anything in your present mind based on volition or is your action more reaction to associative stimulation? In other words, everything you have ever done has brought you to this post; and reading it, your reaction to it is based on the sum of those experiences. I would think your first action is the only independent action you have ever taken or maybe not."

No in your scenario there are no independent actions, not even the first action.

That's the kind of determinism where every action we take is preceded by something that came prior, as if we are only part of the chain of cause and effect

so the other idea, is to consider a world that is a probability, and the mind is a betting machine, and a choice in that context is a dice roll, and you don't know what your choice is going to be (it's a dice roll) but you can predict it sometimes, because your more likely to choose somethings over other things

I am not saying that you control your choice, it might be an automatic reaction, but you, and choices, are part of the map of reality that your brain uses to coordinate, to increase the chances of a successful result, because it has evolved to increase the chances of a successful result, by doing all sorts of amazing things, like considering it's own choices, sure it might be deterministic probability on another level, but that doesn't mean it's not useful.

If someone stopped making effort because they believed their thoughts did nothing, well that would be a quiet way out of existence for some. Maybe they had no choice because of fate. I've got the brain plasticity info encoded in my brain tissue that says, hey wait a second, we are not fixed in terms of our present expectations, maybe you can't predict your future path, and when you can't predict your future path, maybe you will start to go wild with trying to predict all the fun things you could do that you never before thought you would do, then the odds of rolling the dice of choice on one of those new things increases a lot!

Rob, please check out this book by Norman Doidge, MD | The Brain That Changes Itself http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z1nLJNqpLk
This answers your question

Chelsea Reede 
For me it is an unanswerable question with the language skills I have. No words are adequate.

Micah Blumberg
It is answerable, it has been answered before, articulately, by hundreds of people.

Rob Unknowing
Well on the whole it seems pretty obvious that Rob isn't the one in control. I usually say something Iike Life is what determins outcomes. Maybe life operates through Rob. Lately I've realized there is still a subtle assumption that these are my thoughts. How could they be mine?
Micah I am not reading another damn book :) Sounds like torture.

your neurons which fire thoughts are regulating every cell in the body, its a complex system, but the brain can change itself, meaning you can change you.
this book I mentioned is not torture, its paradise, its heaven, your brain will love you for reading it
but there are videos you could watch if your against reading

Rob Unknowing
Haha jeeze maybe I will look up a video some time.
So no one is going to say that they are individually responsible for how they treat others? this is my poor attempt at baiting.

Maybe we all have no real choice, and at the same time, choice as in the probability that must be decided, regarding what we do next, is part of the map of reality. The organism must choose, the program is shaped by evolution in some sense is it not? So when we talk about choice, maybe it means something different then we think, maybe it means something neurological. Some people may feel like they have less choice, or less self control, or less ability to do things they want to do because of a situation regarding other people, or a situation regarding an diagnosis learning disability, or because of an illness.



You can change your life, because brains can change themselves, because neurons are the kind of cells that can regulate other cells, in addition to fire together to produce thought, expectation, beliefs, predictions, the illusion of a unified awareness, that is really a coordinated symphony of many separate players playing together. (Neurons are the instruments)

So what does it mean when we talk about choice, if determinism is reality? Perhaps these thoughts describe something that is not psychological in nature, but neurological. Maybe it's an upset brain chemistry, or a brain tumor, or a minor series of strokes, or just bad training.

Neurons that fire together wire together
Neurons that fire apart wire apart
Neurons that are out of sync do not link

so with different kinds of training, or new sensory apparatus, or new brain stimulation, or new diet for healthy brain chemistry it's possible that someone's dialog may shift from feeling like determinism is high on their mind, they might be stressed, fatalistic, with a worsening personal situation, about to be homeless.

then with that new training, new artifical sense machine, new brain stimulation, improved brain chemistry, it's possible that they will start sounding very happy about the word choice

it might indicate that their brain is functioning very well, I mean how a person views choice might indicate their assessment of their own personal ability to coordinate their body and mind.

Choice is a measure of our satisfaction with our ability to coordinate ourselves in alignment with our expectations, but in a sense we can talk about choice this way, in the context of a probability based cosmos, or a indeterministic probability cosmos.
