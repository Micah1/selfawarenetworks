People thought that memories had a specific location, aka engrams

Penfield operated on Epileptics
stimulating the temporal lobes caused patients to relive memories

the same spot evoked the same memory

because a synaptic configuration represents a memory trigger point

but with A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins we have the idea that different regions of the brain store variations of the same pattern

not the same pattern, but variations of the same pattern, alterted by their intersections or connections with other brain signals

Yale: Karl Pribram & Carl Ashley
the fruits of lashley's 

his aim was to cut out the area of the brain that created the rats ability to run

this led to the idea of distributed memories, which was a predecessor to sparse distributed memories

removing a part of the brain caused memory to become hazy, because the fidelity of the memory is made by combining multiple varied representations of the same memory

Holograms: Interference: the criss crossing pattern when two or more waves interfere with each other, if you drop two waves: interference pattern

a pebble in a bond produces concentric waves, earth's oscillation creates a similar spherical concentric waves in space, absorbing electrons and spitting protons, the protons become fermionic condensation creating lanes

the invention of the laser
the second beam 

because laser light is an extremely

the hologram is produced when laser light is extremely pure, perfect pepple, perfect pond

fermionic condensation from electrons 

the invention of the laser as holograms

a single laser light is split into two separate beams, the first beam bounces off the object to be photographed, refraction

the second beam is allowed to collide with the reflected light of the first, they create an interfence pattern which is recorded on a piece of film.

a bright light source is shined through the film a 3D representation of the object appears

it wasn't until the invention of the laser that holograms became possible

holographic principles / it means that every pixel of the brain stores a viewpoint reduction in 4dimensions, every other neuron stores a viewpoint variation, or another perspective on the same view

neurons are combining their viewpoints together to create the brains viewpoint, and the micro viewpoints of neurons scale up to the meso scale viewpoints of cortical columns and the macro scale viewpoints of the whole brain.

its holographic distribution with pixel like variations for each point, sort of like how every pixel in light field labs displays shows us a 3D pixel with a 360 rendered perspective, representing just part of an image, so the data going to each 360 pixel varies just a little bit, but all the pixels are overlapping in terms of the perspective that each shares

so the multi-modal perspectives stored in each neuron represent something similar to the 

the phasic pattern represents the beam of light going through the holographic paper, the routing of the phasic signals through the tonic oscillations activates certain rendered perspectives, which are magnified by the oscillation array to other oscillation arrays, oscillating arrays play back perspectives on data in temporal-sequence patterns

a focusing mirror?

phasic signals are activating microperspectives, which result in holographic attention-schema-theory
