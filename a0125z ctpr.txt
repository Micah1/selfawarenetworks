Neuro inflammation 
priming a rhythmic circuit 
how does it change the drug sensitivity
with drug sensitivity
more neuro inflammatory molecules, and cytokines that you can measure
we have compensatory mechanisms
but when you give drugs, opiods or anesthesia
its like a chem lab experiment
inflammation that up regulates a voltage channel experiment
LPS lipo poly saccarchi
control
you can read the single cell of neural activity
a broad-scale of how the network changes function
we now can measure more than we did before

there is a software called Max Trac
instead of manually digitizing

Carl mentioned the brain singing? how sense are coordinated?

Our brain is a different size on the level of circuitry loops. 
Different scales of neural circuits.

why is SSRI are slowing down the intake of serotonin
the psychoactive 
the chemicals have to be
the electrical gradient
the only way for the neurons to talk to each other is
the cellular chemistry
the sodium ion, it splits a salt molecule a positive or negative ion 
neurons are like salty bananas, the sodium from the outside is going to flow to the inside ,
the neuro transmitters trigger 
transcranial magnetic stimulation
Some types of 
increasing brain activity with SSRI,
with tDCS

inflammation
metabolic disorder, inability to produce ATP
interference with new protein synthesis

Schemic stroke

Infrared and near infrared light to stimulate Gamma band information, because
Gamma stimulation
because its treating a symptom instead of the cause
there is not enough stimulation here,
neurons will synchronize with the light that is being stimulated
the gunk that has cleaned out
the light stimulation was clearing out the the tau protein and amyloid beta
increases the production the ATP, 
red light might be stimulating the neurons to increase ATP
photo modulation to increase ATP

there are so many different wave lengths from the sun
lots of bad light from the sun

the targeted wave lenths 808 850 860

substantia nigra breaks down motor control going to those areas

new protein synthesis new neuro transmitters, 
fixing cells

after age 30 cognitive plateou

those decline
knowledge increases, skills increase
60-70 after decline accelerates

no 80 year old has the cognitive speed of a 20
covid-19 may have aged blood vessels, aged the lymphatic system

by degrading the endothelial lining, destroying ace2 receptors,
causing vasoconstrictoin

and long covid

1 of 3 are still suffering from long covid
after the vaccine
the whole sweet of steroids

the steroids are going to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress and 
will the steroids improve bloodflow and vasodilation and the plastic

the steroids
what the glucose steroids will do
the genetic structure, dna rna 
hit them with an em wave, they absorb, they allow permeate, they reflect
from those processes you can characterize each nucleotide
similar to radar, using something like beam forming
the dish exploits phase shift, temporal shift, spatial
if you have wide enough grid
the molecules resonate in the 450 resonate image range and up
they can do it for $50
computational photo levera machine to leveral resolution of a low cost sensor

cells that have a particular virus
dopplar radar pathogens perdue university

sending 450 and 451 increments of 
sending phases, 
bacteria, phase shift on the membrane
virus, phase shift?
dna, phase shift?
rna, phase shift?
water memory, about a french, aids caused by HIV, HIV had a unique spectral signature.

mouth swab, switch, cells collected
similar to rt pcr? no need to expanded it
you can put your finger on the sensor
biolloc
4 nucleotides they have a certain frequency range
450Ghz range and above 
get them in the specific order
geometric configuration / array of sensors
ACTG
what happens when I ping the A's, the sensor 111, what happens to sensor 113
you have to put the finger on the sensor 
continuous monitoring on a smart watch
shrinking the ramen the spectroscopy down to a cellphone a coin sized chip

perdue university pathogen detection by dopplar radar, 
darpa

the phase shift does not change
if its alive it reacts
if its dead it does not react

if its within a cell, rna dances, then it reacts
if its on its own then its different, its something

its a time dependent signal that is more important

everyday just scan yourself, or have passive scanning in a smart watch, if you have it stay at home,

automated viral detection with smart watches

pathogen sample through the process of variability people could find viruses,

surveillance
first applications would be b2B

its a detector, 

department of defense can id you by heart rate variability, use a wifi rader
wivi detect you through a wall and detect your cardiac rhythm
