the problem is that synchronization or coherence is non-informative, its a solution for binding, for convergence, coupling of patterns, but not for distinction making, decoherence, deconvergence, decoupling of of ideas & concepts

sync theories are like 'lets merge all information together in a big pile (integrated information theory?) but not provide any method for disambiguiation, distinct, reflection or refraction.'

Peter Tse points out the fallacy of this kind of logic

The primary storage place of short term and long term memories at the microscale, LTP appears to be the spines on dendrite some of which are ionotropic receptors.

the oligodendrocytes therefore would also be able to store and transmit memories both short term and long term

larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

Fractal, Recursion, Scale invariance
The brain is going to learn scale invariant patterns, like vectors, that are distance & location invariant, temporally invariant, and phase invariant.

So patterns are tempo-spatial phasic coincident differential potentials with four dimensional (or higher) vector formation.

Isomorphism, from Hofstadter pushed a lot of people including myself into studying category theory and topics related to studying natural or topological transformations with numbers

category theory is interesting because you might want to think of comparing two topological transformations as like comparing apples and oranges, or comparing unstructured datatypes

but perhaps within the stacks of unstructure data there are isomorphic (or functionally similar patterns) that can be isolated and compared.

Category theory points out that if two transformations can each be further transformed into the same transformation (the same result from two different paths) then the two paths are functionally isomorphic (producing the same result at the end of their journey) even if they have radically different pattern transformations to get there (bob took a car, sherrie took a boat, both got from their common home to the same store, so the journey was functionally isomorphic in that the functions along the way served the same result despite different structures.

and this idea gives rise to the idea that consciousness could be a substrate invariant information process

I like to think of the oscillator as an Expert Data Structure (Instead of an advanced data structure) because its creating its own paper for which it can measure incoming signals against as deviations, allowing the system to collaborate as knowledge gaining system, mapping a dimension or a movie frame of consciousness.

problem with pan-psychism resonator theory is that resonators which are decaying oscillators, like vortexes while being ubiquitous at all scales of the cosmos, do not encode memories over time, they dissipate into nothing, so resonation by itself is non-informing, it does not store information in a way that allows for transaction of information patterns
