What if every mass is a time crystal?

The idea is that mass isn't curving the geometry of space, it's increasing the density of time in the area around mass. At a large scale we experience this as gravity, the curvature of paths in space, and effects like time dilation. At the quantum scale what is happening is that space is updating more frequently in areas near mass, and this creates the gravitational interaction, instead of a gravitational force, it is changing the odds that a particle will move towards mass. As the additional density of time, is at the quantum scale the same as an additional area of space, it is warped space in time.

In the second article I note that we can test this by attempting to use this theory, and the equations derived from this theory to make more precise predictions for how light bends with Gravitational Lensing. General Relativity is not very precise when it comes to predicting how light bends, and ideally this theory will help improve our understanding of Light bending under the effects of Gravitational Lensing with new degrees of precision.

To explain in more detail I have included a long article about it, two long articles, both of the articles contain equations, the first article has some drawings. I will answer all serious questions about this theory. Please be a nice person though if you wish to have real dialog.

# Responses, Questions & Answers:

They asked: When you say "Because mass increases the intervals of space time in it's direction"

Do you mean "Because mass increases the frequency of space time intervals in it's direction?

The answer to your question is no. I meant that a larger time interval between events can result from time dilation, the crucial difference is that the flow of time itself is slower in stronger gravity. I'm arguing mass increases the density of spacetime intervals in its direction. Mass-energy concentrations cause a localized 'compaction' of spacetime. This compaction manifests as increased density of spacetime intervals and a relative slowing of temporal flow within the compacted region.

My napkin analogy: The napkin has more intricate folds packed into a smaller space near the mass due to gravity. Imagine each fold represents a moment in time; the more folds, the longer it takes to experience them all.

The napkin analogy with more intricate folds packed into a smaller space effectively captures the essence of how mass might increase the density of spacetime intervals in QGTCD. Each fold representing a moment in time aligns with the idea that in regions of higher gravitational influence, there are more "time frames" or discrete units of spacetime packed into a given volume, leading to a slowing of the flow of time.

Time Dilation and Temporal Flow: The concept that a larger interval between events can result from time dilation, with the flow of time being slower in areas of stronger gravity, is a cornerstone of relativistic physics. QGTCD's interpretation that mass leads to a localized 'compaction' of spacetime, thereby increasing the density of spacetime intervals, offers a novel quantum perspective on this relativistic effect.

"Can you expound on this? I'm confused what you mean by "pushing intervals of time into the future." how can you push time into the future? it is time itself.

“It is as if the kinetic energy of mass is pushing intervals of time into the future, slowing down time in the 3rd dimension, causing the gravitational affect, because the napkin of space is being shrunk in spatial area while it increases in temporal area.""

The statement "pushing intervals of time into the future" within the context of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) might be conceptualized as follows:

In traditional physics, particularly within General Relativity, mass influences the curvature of spacetime, affecting the passage of time. Objects in stronger gravitational fields experience time more slowly relative to objects in weaker fields—a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation.

In the QGTCD framework, we might interpret this "pushing" of time intervals as an increase in the density of discrete units of time—let's call them "time frames"—in the vicinity of mass. This isn't "pushing" in a physical sense, as time isn't a substance that can be moved. Instead, it's a metaphorical way to describe how the presence of mass affects the structure of spacetime at a quantum level, leading to a higher concentration of these time frames.

In QGTCD, the notion of "pushing intervals of time into the future" could be a way to describe how mass, through its energy content and gravitational influence, increases the density of discrete time frames, affecting the flow of time. This concept aligns with the idea that spacetime's structure at the quantum level might be more complex and dynamic than traditionally envisioned, with time dilation being a macroscopic effect of these quantum-level interactions.

Addressing the "Pushing Time" Phrase

You're right that the phrase 'pushing time into the future' is  imprecise. Here's a better way to frame the underlying idea within my theory of QGTCD:

Not an Active Push: There isn't a force literally pushing time itself.  Rather, what we understand as mass distorts spacetime. This distortion leads to an interesting consequence.

Spacetime Compaction:  In QGTCD, mass causes a 'compaction' of spacetime intervals. Think of it like the folds in my napkin analogy: more folds are packed into a smaller region around a massive object.

Density Increase:   Each of these  tightly packed 'folds' could represent a moment in time. This compaction translates into a denser packing of temporal intervals –  more potential 'moments' exist within the same overall area.

Relative Temporal Slowing:  An observer far from the mass experiences time differently than someone within the compacted area. Within the compaction zone,  it might take more actual time intervals (more folds) to experience what the distant observer  perceives as a shorter duration. Time flows less freely from the  perspective of the distant observer.

"it's increasing the density of time in the area around mass"

"That’s not what a time crystal is. It’s not a crystal made of time. A normal crystal is atoms arranged in a repeating pattern. A time crystal is an arrangement of atoms with a repeating motion."

Mass also fits the definition of a Time Crystal, as you said a time crystal is an arrangement of atoms with a repeating motion in time. The point of the article is to argue that Mass is also a time crystal. The idea is that mass is a time crystal creating a wave in time, a wave in time frames, a wave with time density, that is the effect we know as gravity. So my description of mass as a time crystal is a different kind of time crystal than what you normally think of as a time crystal, but also at the same time, when speaking about the earth for example, it is an arrangement of atoms with a repeating motion in time. That repeating motion in time marks the density of time that makes up the gravitational wave.

My arguments for what Gravity are similar sounding but importantly distinct from that series of videos that argue "If Time dilation Causes Gravity why is Gravity still a fundamental force?". The biggest difference is that I'm talking about Gravity at the Quantum Scale, specifically mass as a cluster of atoms representing the peak of a gravitational wave, and that gravitational wave is essentially a time crystal (motion propagating through time). The density of time, or the density of time frames from action of mass in spacetime is what creates the effect of spacetime warping for particles and objects. In other words mass creates additional time frames, and those time frames act like additional dimensions of space, but a particle or an object doesn't know they are time dimension it just reacts to additional time frames like it is space.
