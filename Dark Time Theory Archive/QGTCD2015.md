I asked hyper write AI to create a report from Google on Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation and it found this gem from 2015

"Some researchers have proposed that the tick rate of a crystal can be influenced by time dilation effects similar to those observed in special relativity, suggesting a connection between gradient time crystals and gravitational fields." (Nature Photonics) "Gravitational and relativistic deflection of X-ray superradiance"

Abstract:
"Einstein predicted that clocks at different altitudes tick at various rates under the influence of gravity. This effect has been observed using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy over an elevation of 22.5 m (ref. 1) or by comparing accurate optical clocks at different heights on a submetre scale2. However, challenges remain in finding novel methods for the detection of gravitational and relativistic effects on more compact scales. Here, we investigate a scheme that potentially allows for millimetre- to submillimetre-scale studies of the gravitational redshift by probing a nuclear crystal with X-rays. Also, a rotating crystal can force interacting X-rays to experience inhomogeneous clock tick rates within it. We find that an association of gravitational redshift and special-relativistic time dilation with quantum interference is manifested by a time-dependent deflection of X-rays. The scheme suggests a table-top solution for probing gravitational and special-relativistic effects, which should be within the reach of current experimental technology3,4,5."
