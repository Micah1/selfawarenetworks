Max Hodak Neuralink, and the new Neuralink representative both repeated what appears to be the same error.

They both think that the only way to hear an APsyn in real time is to insert an electrode within 2 microns UI

Neuralink is operating under a false premise because a single Neuron firing could actually be monitored from outside the brain
with a combination of laser infrared imaging, ultrasound, holography, and a camera sensor that was large enough & fast enough,
this is because Neurons are little pumps that are constantly expanding & contracting as they take on and expel neurotransmitters.
