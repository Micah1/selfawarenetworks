I argue that there is no will power that is separate from your memories. Your memories-evoked as rendered predictions when activated serve as attractors for driving behaviors and new memories

Going back to the question of where the locus of focus is in the human brain, what is the primary seat of conscious activity, while I think it is virtual, meaning activated by different cells at different times, and not always in the same place, I suspect that the locus of focus for the observer is a loop of core brainwave oscillatory activity in the Hippocampus-Enthorinal-Parietal-Thalamic circuit/or junction.

Today I have put into writing where I think the primary seat of conscious activity in the brain is eminating from.

I think that cells guided their own evolution through the development of receptor based nodes, that informed the learned development of successful protein structures into dna https://phys.org/news/2022-05-insights-link-genetic-mutations-biological.amp 

interactions between the cell, its receptors, and the environment encode changes in the dna pattern and develop new dna over time
