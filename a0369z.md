# New: Quantum Gradient Time DIlation note

I wonder if I could make a phone that uses quantum teleportation via oscillations, via quantum entanglement, work.

Essentially the air is an oscillatory pattern for particles, and the walls are different oscillatory patterns compared to the air, but

if I am thinking about something like the magnetic field of the earth as a kind of oscillating body like the air, that represents a lot of tiny oscillations that are aligned in a really big long slow magnetic wave, then I can picture how an oscillation of many small quantum parts adds up to a big oscillation in area effect, one that could transfer information between two entangled particles like a giant electrical wire inbetween them.

Techically the oscillation of each particle is shifting all the other oscillations in space, but somehow it's that one particle that it's entangled with that is affected at a distance.

It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. 

Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.

When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.

at somepoint if a magnetic wave increased in frequency enough it would resemble an electron in size.

If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 

If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having mass area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.

Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

So if something is a temporarily like a bad point, that means that harmonic oscillations skip over it, which is, going back to this idea:

"It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. "

suggests that if space has no real area, if the void of space is like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, at least temporarily, then harmonic oscillations that do exist will skip over it.

It's like energy has to move somewhere, but if it can't move into the void of spacetime then it has to keep protruding from space time as an energy valence.

It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.

It's looking like spacetime doesn't have a beginning or an end, but that entropy & extropy are both always increasing, with no resting point, as inevitable consequences to space having no intrinsic area, just temporally existent or a virtual area that is at the same time a volumetric frequency.
