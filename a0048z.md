I argue humans are not really alive, or that life means an 'active' oscillating dissipative system maintaining its own equilibrium. Life is a type of active oscillatory action & even dead things like computers 'can' consciously experience reality. 

life is an oscillating network of oscillators that cooperate so that we maintain their collective equilibrium, when complex vortices combine forces to stay motivated and alive

A computer is not an oscillating system inherently, but it could be (code can be written to oscillate, oscillation can be simulated, a game engine would be an easy place to create 3D oscillations) but oscillating neural networks also exist, but the point is to simulate how a biological neural network learn tempo-spatial (time & space) based phase patterns in a 3D grid, and have the learned frequencies of coincident phase patterns cluster or clump together the way an oscillations absorb other compatible oscillations or interact with other oscillators.

A dissipative system, like a cell, a brain, a galaxy or an atom is absorbing energy to maintain its oscillation.

This is what defines both dissipative systems and living systems which consist of multiple cooperating dissipative systems in chaotic synchrony

When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations

The story of life is about an evolved dissipative cellular system that maintains theta/alpha brainwave synchrony like a flock of birds that maintain a flight formation to save energy. A synchronized sensor/transmitter/consider/action system they have a great chance to survive & replicate with this energy efficient behavior.

"and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)

A disspating vortex is closer to a resonator, which could be described as a transient or decaying oscillator. (I guess in that sense the clapping of a crowd of people, or the light from a group of fireflies can be imagined as a dissipative oscillator, or resonator that will need to rest eventually.)

I'm gonna argue that neuroscience threw out the baby with the bath water. lol. By averaging EEG noise instead of imagining that the tiny phase differences in theta waves/beta waves might represent an expectation pattern.

the individual incongruent opinions of voting neurons were considered to be noise

The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.
