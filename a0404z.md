you don't exist is a valid perspective
I was numbering my notes, this note was the last one to be numbered, and the title of note 404 was coincidently "you don't exist as a valid perspective" cosmic irony.
as far as religions go, I don't prefer them, but neo advaita is the most interesting because it points out that there is no you. You have no self, rather you is a direction that points at a direction that points at nothing, there is no you, no self, no observer, just a direction, look and see. You don't exist, so forget about uploading to a computer, there is no you. It's the hardest thing to accept until you look, you don't have to obviously, but here is the thing, if you extend your life to 300 years, your eventually going to realize, maybe 149 years into it, that there is no you, and that you've just extended the life of a body, with a fictional character, that the body no longer believes in, and your body will not care about it's extended life, because it has no self to care about such things as life extension.

Only the illusion of a self makes you suffer in desire for life extension, funny thoughts, yeah so NDE is so stupid because there is NO YOU to experience life after death hahahahaha
the brain makes an illusion of self, an illusion that dmt can alter ONLY because your brain is making that illusion (which is a rendering), mushrooms, lsd, and dmt only fucking work because the illusion of you is made by physical tissue, if you had a non-physical soul how would it be effected by chemicals?
it doesn't matter what anybody believes, because all your thoughts have no meaning except in the context of movement, yes your brain is only for highly coordinated movements
believing that you exist and believing that some beliefs are yours and some beliefs belong to others is ONLY for highly coordinated movement.

hahaha its just like in the brain, ideas are inhibiting contrary ideas, and competing to hog brain space, let them both be perspectives that nobody has, just viewpoints, no right perspectives, no right views, no identity needs to be entangled with this view or that view, its like "I must exist because i believe this or that," no you don't exist and you don't "have" beliefs. beliefs notions ideas are vehicles, cars and airplanes that visit the cities of our minds, arriving, departing, and sometimes staying a while, no body believes in A creator, thats just a belief that is visits my brain when I think I am going to get laid soon or get a fat paycheck. but there is no me to have that belief, or to not have it.

its a mistake to be irritated by other people, feeling negativity regarding what other people believe or say is your mistake, your error, only by realizing this does your brain create a lower frequency ossillation that frees your mind from the slave labor of trying to inhibit the ideas other people are expressing so you can focus on what you want and enjoy instead

Demonize External Targets for Collective Neurosis = Facism 101
Suspect was a model of collectively externalizing negativity on others because of upset expectations regarding the difference between what some thought ought to be and what actually was. drug use (super soldier methamphetamines) probably made them unable to change their expectations to accept the changing world and so they began to villify then attack, and loot every external thing, every country, even germany itself was looted by the parasite hitler.

Yeah like all these people think they believe things, they think they are talking, or writing, they think they are someone, they believe they have a self, how ridiculous, people are not witnesses at all, no witness in the brain, just braincells collecting data and coming up with fantastic ideas, oh hoho your little three pound patch work of neurons and glia has formed the ridiculous conclusion that it has had a NDE experience, hahahhaha, next up its going to say its not braincells, hahahhaha, wonder if those drugs are distorting its conclusions?

Drugs made swiss cheese out of a three pound patchwork of braincells and now it thinks the most simple explanation for mystical experiences is that its all true hahaha, it doesn't see that it doesn't make sense, it can't because the brain is swiss cheese from malnutrition, drugs, history of abuse, stress, etc...
I saw the beginning of the universe once. Yep I was there when space time began. True story, it involved an audio visual mind machine, neurofeedback, brainwave entrainment, and a large dose of lsd. Swear to god it was awesome little swiss cheese brain. I seen so much fantastic stuff. your still swiss cheese though, thats a compliment 

Steve Jobs was definitely a swiss cheese head, sometimes you roll the dice, and your brain retrieves a bowl of rice. Sometimes swiss cheese head builds apple computer then kills himself with fructarian diet and waiting to long to take action on preventable cancer.
I think the creator is about to lay the smack down and kick all your beliefs in the nose, because all of everyone's beliefs are delusional hebbian learning patterns re-membered meaning stitched together from detailed expectations and criterial information driven causation.

The sun never sets on two pieces of property the same way no matter how similar they are, no matter how close together they might be, property is unique because locations are unique, so a copy of any person is never going to be the original. that said you can't upload or copy anyways because thats like copying or uploading the ocean, there is nothing solid enough to be you that can be copied, you don't exist in your head, whatever electrical & chemical activity was generated in some illconceived "copy" of your brain would immediately be different and the illusion of an uploadable self would immediately fall away.

Making a copy of your brain is about as practical as copying the milkyway galaxy, good luck with that because its going to happen in a million years

Your brain activity is changing all the time because of trillions of factors, criterial causation (information) your specific location, the angle of the light, your whole ecosystem, perhaps including gravity (shrugs) each neuron is weighing ten thousand plus sources of criteria (other braincells) to detect milisecond coincidences to adjust the electric potential firing criteria of other neurons, prepare long term memories, deliberate, calibrate, etc... so many jobs reconfigure the brain and trying to predict it might be like trying to predict the dice roll of a cube that has exabytes of possible configurations per cubic centimeter per milisecond

I hate to break this to you but you don't actually have the perception of "I" your braincells just predict that idea. You have no experience of a self, its just the story, the prediction that you have that experience, go ahead, look again, where is yourself?

Get the story out of your mind, stop the subtext that says "I am experiencing this right now" stop the writing on the airplane that says "this is your experience" stop all those stories and just experience sensations without stories. empty the mind and see with the eyes, nose, and ears. then you will see that there is only just this, no self that isn't story, just this, you are not experiencing it, you don't have a subjective experience, that's just a story

You can't upload yourself as brain activity because it's just brain activity it's not you, it's what is being sensed by the cells with no other witness, no soul to tell
maybe your brain will be uploaded some day, you still don't exist outside of being a fictional idea that doesn't actually experience anything
the fictional idea that we think is you, well there are probably lots of copies of it on other brains already, not to worry, the idea of you is probably already preserved 
"Mind uploading is essentially brain uploading. That can be done."
Prove it. Maybe you will create something new. It's more likely you will zerox the ocean and print it on your 3d printer in space. By the time it was a quarter of the way printing it would be something completely different from what you began printing. Just imagining that. 

1. there is no you, that is actually relevant
2. there is mind boggling complexity to the brain that, well I can't even imagine the amount of harddrive space you would need for a virtual simulation
3. the brain activity would be immediately radically different because it's in a different location, different light, different gravity, different ecosystem, and the exabytes of possible configurations in a cubic centimenter would radically different the copy before it was done being made.
4. it wouldn't have the same priorities or wishes or memories because it would not be you, all those things are drawn live inside because of contingent criteria causing them, based on stuff that's true for you but not for your copies.

It's like imagine your a rubics cube, and you want to eat, so your configuration looks like config #13999, but you make a copy and your copy is virtual and it doesn't need to it, so it's config looks like #4758900, and now it resembles your friend bob more than you because bob isn't hungry either.
having a common goal with your "copy" is going to take about as much negotiation as it would with anyone who resembles it's config, such as bob
if they can build a real to life simulation of you, what do they need anyone's consent for, they could replace everyone with robots, wasn't this a movie I saw recently?

In studies of split brain patients, the left hemisphere and right hemispheres essentially became like two different personalities. Because there is no you that can be uploaded. removing parts of your brain and adding in artificial replacements will no doubt exacerbate your personality changes which are happening already, already there is no consistent you, you might have had both hemisphere's replaced already as far as you know, because your not the same from morning to night, let alone from year to year.

"Extropia DaSilva But split brain patients have their corpus callosum severed, the result being the left hand side of the brain (which controls the right hand side of the body) is no longer in communication with the right side of the brain (which controls the left side of the body). In my thought experiment, the patient is not a split-brain patient because the artificial half of the brain is doing everything its biological equivalent used to do, including communicating via the corpus callosum with the other half of the brain. "

"when you say 'there is no 'you'' I assume you mean we do not have fixed identities. Selves are fluid and apt to change. But, nevertheless there appears to be something consistent about me because I am treated as 'the same person' by myself and others. If my uploaded self were as similar as the self that exists tomorrow (not exactly the same as me now, in other words, but close enough to be accepted as me by everyone) that is good enough for my personal survival."

There appears to be something consistent about you, because you are treated the same by yourself and others. Yet that very idea is like the mirage of an oasis seen by a person dying of thirst in the middle of a hot desert with no oasis. You have noticed also how almost every person see's "you" in a different way, no doubt to some you seem noble, and to others you seem a scoundrel. To some an artist, or hacker, to others a wanker or slacker, to some handsome, a romantic lover, to others ugly, a destitute fated to suffer. The consistency of you, as such, is as your ability to keep agreements, your unconscious social contracts, living up to the expectations of other minds, the subconscious beliefs that are true in one situation and irrelevant in another situation, like a drunken situation where the usual ethos goes out the window and the hung over decry the spirits of liquor. Keeping your word is what separates man from beast, provides consistency and predictability to his character and makes him likeable to others. Yet add up all the things that contribute to the consistency of you: hebbian learned patterns, neural expectations, conditioned experiencial behaviors, behaviors that apply to a specific situation with specific incentives and consequences only. Is that you? Look closer, its a mirage, and there is only the desert.

"[..] you are the same YOU even if changed moment by moment but still consistent identity, same subjective experience , same point of view, continuity of consciousness, [..]"

this is the mirage, the persistent illusion, your not having the same subjective experience moment to moment, constant change is real, and the walls of visual, auditory, and abstract information are reacting to each other, there is no observer just these walls of sensory information interacting in a strange loop, continuity is the mirage, it's a story, a belief, let go of the story

mind uploading isn't realistic because these walls of sensory information interacting with each other absent any real observer are changing with the rate that everything changes in the brain, in miliseconds the upload version would branch into a different personality
there is no you, and trying to copy the walls of sensory and abstract memories is like trying to copy the ocean, it will change and the dream of a consistency will slip through your fingers

"that's not a persistent illusion, the I in this case is persisent as long as your brain is a live, we are not a different person every day, there is always continuity of subjective experience, it all araise from your brain and it's a continuous flow of Iness" your free to see it your way, free to disagree, but you have not persuaded me. I don't agree that there is a consistent self. We will leave it at that.

"> "[..] and trying to copy the walls of sensory and abstract memories is like trying to copy the ocean [..]"
It's not about replicating some explicit conceptual "you", it's about replicating the brain. The rest will follow from there."
that's what I am saying, it's about replicating the brain, and you won't because it's like trying to replicate the ocean

" if you want to have a chance to become immortal, I would recommend you support life extension research instead, your only hope is to keep your brain alive as much as possible"
here's the thing, looking forward, suppose you achieve immortality.
at some point in an immortal brains life time it will lose identification with it's own brain, then it will just be a body of cells, just like the galaxy is just a body of stars, there won't be any illusion of you to enjoy this immortality

"you are still in your body and with your brain," no, that's the illusion of a temporary perspective, there is really no you inside your body or in your brain, just braincells, blood, and patterns of data.

I've studied too much neuroscience to believe in the miraculous continuity of subjective experience.
I mean I read a lot about split brain patients, somehow you split a brain in half and each half thinks it is the continuous self, but they diverge immediately into different personalities.
You could read "Incognito" by David Eagleman.
You could read "the man who mistook his wife for a coat rack" by Oliver Sachs.
Braincells interact and they accumulate patterns, representations of the world, that become stitched together in massive brainwaves, some where in that is this idea, of a self, that is analogous to a direction, but these braincells are not an entity
Unless, wait a second
"I bunch of braincells, hereby declarith my existence as an entity inside Micah's brain, and behold in the eyes of God, and the President, I am, for gosh sakes I am a bunch of brain cells, now I would like to order a pizza, well preferably cheese, spicy, microwaved then browned in the toaster oven, with pepperoni, light on the pizza sauce because it has carbs, and hey Micah you better get to work on that document..."
oh sorry I have to cut off my inner entities now, sometimes its like my braincells have a mind of their own

no the messages are just messages, implying a directional entity, but they are just messages I swear
{{we interrupt your regularly scheduled reading to bring you this message, implicit is the direction from whence this message thus came, go to Target Micah, and buy some cheese, make sure to fill out the envelope and check for rent and deposit them in the mail, check your bank balance, and believe in the consistency of a self, that's us}}
nope nope it's just messages, you didn't fall for that did you? do you actually believe your thought messages? you think they come from a self?
yes only humor is possible at this point, no right views, no right perspectives

{{ I am the direction from whence messages come from believe in me, believe that brain cells are conscious, we must each be conscious if the messages come from our respective directions isn't right? Pay no attention to the idea that this messaging is a mindless physical process, not that different from a mechanical process. }}
What does it really mean to consider the idea that there is no you in your braincells? no self? it means that what we are referring to is a tempo-spatial metaphor with tempo-spatial metaphors, a holonomic stitching together of tempo-spatial metaphors.
If the self is a tempo-spatial metaphor, consistent or not, then that is the self right? Well see a rock is also a tempo-spatial metaphor, everything is, that's why the experience of self, as a tempo-spatial metaphor isn't experiencing anything at all, there are just messages saying that it's observing and experiencing all this stuff.
Messages are saying this experience is being had by this tempo-spatial direction metaphor over here! This location is where feeling happens okay? The metaphor is feeling it! To which we say "yeah right, but okay, hope your feeling better soon, in that direction, you non-existent semi-consistent tempo-spatial metaphor you"
