00:00

Okay, let me just invite people.

01:04

Okay, let me invite. All right. Welcome dammit good how you doing it's mean you only yeah at the moment. I just started it. I didn't give people a lot of advance notice so this is pretty good so far certainly on instead. I didn't have a scene yet so let me actually got maybe I look right now huh maybe I look oh yeah I listen to you and it just yesterday.

01:45

I guess one. One thing that came to mind the listening conversation was better this whole duralink was potentially just a project within Tesla. I just basically to to find a way to find highly signals for some cognitive sort of patterns of decision-making for super gnarly edge cases and L5.

02:22

Traffic. I mean, I listened to that whole conversation and thought maybe the test a group wanted to monitor really deep into that. Oh yeah yeah so I mean so that the discussion of neuralink and I think I would refer to it as the what I was saying was about how the process of decoding with narrowing is just is a new we're talking about a new like we're talking about big data like extracting like big data from the human brain from from neurons, it's it goes way beyond like the Utah array or DPS or EEG or eCog or you know, any of, Other.

03:09

Medical imaging device. In terms of it's in terms of how much data it's capturing at the resolution that it's capturing and and and for that purpose I'm just going to invite everybody who comes up to come up and talk. And so for that purpose the the potential applications go way beyond like so right now.

03:31

I guess you know, it's it's it's neuralink is trying to just show that they can do the same things that other devices can do that they can. Because because by itself if you can prove if they if they can prove that they're their device can do what it would an eCog machine can do but it's it's cheaper and it's mass produced well that's good enough it's a good enough value proposition right and and it has other other benefits over over eCog for that specific application of just you know, having having a person or a monkey just control a cursor on a computer or you know, remote or just a remote limb.

04:12

So for that purpose alone, it's going to. Be worth the money for for these companies to invest in but the potential like is far greater the potential applications are mind expanding and then in they start to enter into the realm of sci-fi in terms of in terms of you know, maybe we were talking about decoding thoughts at the or short term really.

04:38

I mean really what I meant to say is really decoding short term memories at the level of individual neurosurgeon neural circuits. That's that is more it's more precise and same decoding thoughts. It's it's where like yeah decoding like local minerals circuit patterns. So we can have basically and what that means is that just means that it's a high resolution of decoding.

05:01

So if you have if you can with eCog, you know figure out where the monkey intends to use to move the the cursor. And you can view that you can do it with high resolution with new devices. Well that means that you can figure out where the monkey intends to move the cursor with much more precision and also figure out you know, what the monkeys intentions are whether the monkey intends, you know are great or banana and specifically a great or a banana like which like what is that's a word that's like it's higher resolution decoding right?

05:37

So those are my thoughts yesterday.

05:44

Welcome Abby. Yeah, welcome Thanks. I was very exciting actually seeing that how this new releasing work and I came across the article as well. I have to read a lot about. This brain neuron north hirings and how it controls the motor neurons. I'm not so sure about not inside no very basic about this.

06:19

Maybe I cannot share much about the. How it neurons function about and how the gonna control it with neural link and that is how it really helped to to understand more about the CNAs and coordination with ANS. So, but but this I can think if I see in my prospective what we are working is like, Between plant some kind of.

06:57

Those cardiac cell we wanted to transmit some specific protein tags upon their expression, but what in contrast what I understood from neural link, you may correct me that they are they are collecting the the electric pulses. Which I I I slightly differ because how because it's very close circuit and so much now finds hiring happens as one time and how they're gonna do it but reading the last article which came out yesterday and that they could able to they successfully implanted in the monkey and that that performs well, so I'm very curious and I will be reading a lot about it but my research to my mostly holds to cardiac cells, so I am may not.

07:54

And give more insight on this topic. Thanks. Um, yeah, so so you use what EKG to measure cardiac cells. Yes, we heard those are like very kind of now becoming a smaller. I don't know whether you come across with the small nano chips, which is nanomaterial like varied ultra thin and they have been tagged with the small kind of antibody and which is up on expression of a specific.

08:29

Protein the one who want protection and they will emit emit a signal outside and it is happening in in a cell in a cellular level. So we are trying to establish that hypothesis that we can use it and we can read it even if what is the the the complex network is going on, but we are I have neither I have it but is in reading out the electrical pulse.

08:58

So here more into biochemicals. So, what is it what is the type of cell usually? That we're reading when we when we do EKG.

09:10

It's a human stem cells derived cardiomyocytes, they are functioning their beating and we wanted to build a small network and two three proteins together. I we wanted to see which protein triggering another protein or which pathways. Helping or it is simultaneous or it is it follow a hierarchy we want to see that so we are developing that technology, yes.

09:40

Okay and then so would you would you is it correct to say that that we can consider the EKG is really like the the the frequency range of the cardiomyosite pulsation.

09:58

You can look say that you look at your grammy's totally correlated with the cardiomyocytes function, however, it depends on the maturation and like how the cells are becoming but when we make the cardiomyopathy cells, they're actually neon they do actually the signals and ads. I think one or two months after the the conceived like the baby still in the womb, so you will see that kind of pattern in inside a, Inside the room it's not even a baby when you get a baby like in the back to the butt the beginning or the case you pattern completely change and which still we are struggling to get many of the this big challenge is still in front of us is like how we can mature the cell and inject into the the right place of of a person what you call is self therapy, that's why it's telling again and again in a lot of I think 2019 I guess and British heart foundation, they tried to implant a heart patch.

11:07

Same person they derived the cardiomyocyte and they wanted to catch it they are not success. Which I completely understand but at least they are dried and and and we are also trying out and mature we still see some signature of cancerous genomes that still they grow in as they grow in the stem cells so they are not so much safe as well or for now but eventually I think this barrier will be overcome yeah thanks.

11:41

Sounds good, um. So I bet um, okay, uh, yeah so this uh, so uh, this is popcorn to style discussion so any any questions anyone wants to to have or any to any topics anyone wants to have this is meant to be like very casual happy hour styles so welcome both of you and I'll pause for a dinner but I'll come back later, okay?

12:12

And. Okay well and by the way, so if you're if you're down below, just come on up and talk about talk about anything yeah. I'm just a. I don't know you do commercials this article today about the climatic development IPS in monkey embryo, oh no, no, I mean, let me look it up, can you tell me what to look up yeah, you can you can see it.

12:41

Human like primary they put a human induced pluripotent stem cells in monkey embryo and they could able to grow it up to 20 days and they were growing and they had to terminate it which means it could be growing to something and this is a great topic. I think many people have interest to know how they are growing stem cells human stem cells inside a monkey monkey blastocyst, so that's a interesting and this is actually been a very I think I will say, The real success that if this will be possible that this could open a new dimension of of of organ development, you know, it's it's really exciting all right so I'm looking at I think it's the right paper let me just see if there's a date on this paper it's so called generation of induced player potent stem cells from adult resist monkey fiberglass, okay?

14:05

did you see the new so there's a new there's news on the topic from open BCI they have a new basically like an armband that is EMG yeah.

15:35

I saw that they reset yesterday or two days ago few days good. I just saw this morning so. Oh yeah, yeah. I'm not sure when it came out but I just saw this morning, so I don't know the whole story yet. Yeah, I think I forgot what company not Dexcom but some other company has a EMG IMU node that they sell like in packages of like 10 or 12.

16:02

So having this open source. Module I think is going to be great for this kind of research. Yeah. Great.

16:14

Okay. So there's that I'm actually some I'm sort of like looking at that obviously if I can if I can find the news. I don't know why it's not appearing but so we've got this so we've got that we've got stem cells scientists generating monkey human, monkey, turmeric embryos.

16:35

It's like I think white why I said this is because. It is still very challenged how to develop we are subtitles of organ transplantation, they're not really developed a good tissue even we cannot develop a tissue in lab can cut with current advancement of science we can only gather some cells and they will be clump each other.

17:04

Yeah, people are trying to do it a 3D print where they can build a good network of neurons of blood supply and the whole lot of thing as they are as it human and we cannot do if this primary construct if this kind of medic approach is successful then what what what is in front of us is the in the same way by guiding the stem cells to differentiate into a specific organ for specific kind of cells may get a safe inside.

17:39

The inside the inside the room at least imagine we put some some we put some human induced pluripotent stem cells in the blastosage and we inject that egg to monkey to the monkey again. And to the month, we give some medication where the MTO has at the side by side, there will be a treatment for the everyone then then in a very specific manner the development will occur to.

18:14

To a specific organ the way we do differentiate them or the the the way we do from stem cells to bones themselves to any any specific kind of cells in the lab. So what we're expecting is probably probably by doing that we can able to make a mixture urban development.

18:36

That's very long term, what what this kind of study gives us some good hope on that that ground. So I'm very curious and I think a lot of labs are also trying here to do that with mice as well, but mice is defined the cells after putting the IPS cells inside the plastic they are dying.

18:59

However, this yesterday paper says the cells were survived up to 20 days, which is really good. Things okay. I'll reset the remote real quick welcome Frank Nick NCCL, I want to give you each of you a chance to speak very shortly this is a popcorn style discussion so you can pick your own topic and or ask any question you want and and it's pretty open so what I mean, so so far we I just wanted to say we've talked about we've talked about stem cells we've talked about implanting stem cells into monkeys and we've also talked about the briefly but a control labs.

19:43

So was mentioned and then opened BCI has a new armband, so I'll go ahead and pause and let everyone who's new speak.

20:02

Hey and it goes that's funny yeah thanks. Mike for starting the room. I don't know if there's any sort of like topic that you guys are covering like you said or just kind of random anything neuro or neurophysics.

20:22

Yeah journal, how about this about something that? I'm starting to put a grant together right now for which is the interaction between neuro inflammation local neuro inflammation within a brain circuit and drug sensitivity when you got mica, um, all right, why don't you I'm really interested so now inflammation which is it again no information with drugs sensitivity.

20:49

Yes, so basically neuro inflammation let's say priming a rhythmic circuit to change sensitivity to a subsequent drug application.

21:06

I'm so I'm still trying to put the whole sentence together so narrow inflammation priming arithmetic circuit. And. For drug sensitivity yeah so basically like how does it change the drugs sensitivity and so it's kind of a pie in the sky as of right now, which is why I'm putting the grant together on it but you know, the sort of the idea that let's say you have a patient with I don't know, maybe sleep apnea or you have a patient with.

21:39

COPD here some sort of like product or exposure to let's say hypoxia or hypercapnia or maybe they have an infection or maybe you have a cancerous patient for something like that that leads to some sort of known inducible amount of neuro inflammation so meaning that you have like an increase in the amount of measurable neuroinflammatory molecules being that either like TNFL violent beta any of the any of your typical.

22:10

Cytokines that you can measure and perhaps on you know on just the side of function it's not necessarily on a day to day function though necessarily change anything because we certainly have compensatory mechanisms that will take over in order to keep the you know, the rhythmic circuits normal but when you give a secondary insult say you give drugs or anesthesia or opioids or anything like this suddenly the network may become more susceptible to it and I guess we don't necessarily, Know that as a just that be curious because I know you do a lot of everything on on rhythmic circuits what your thoughts on it are so um, so I will my first my first thought is that I am surprised this hasn't been studied in more detail at you you propose something that at once seems novel and obvious that it's something that should be cited for I mean because you know, what with um, you know, when when you have a part of the body that's undergoing a serious inflammation, the environment is different right and and, So so you've got a whole bunch of inflammatory molecules floating around and maybe you have a cytokine storm and then if you so then if you then try to like add drugs like the drug interaction the results of the drug interaction, I think in many cases if not most cases I'm ought to be different not exactly sure but I mean this is like a it's like a chem lab experiment, oh yeah no, absolutely that's the whole idea is that we know that they're different but we don't know why and so the the the grant would be more focused on the mechanisms of The why you would sensitize some circuits or decentralized others that makes sense so let's say you have inclination that suddenly upregulates like a voltage gained sodium channel expression or pre-synaptic membrane, so then you can see that you know for a given action potential coming down a neuron you get a greater amount of transmitter release something like that, so so we definitely know that there is that synergistic relationship where you would change the sensitivities but we don't necessarily know why for a lot of those things.

24:26

You know, the topic is is hugely important. I mean isn't like I mean, I think I oversimplified by saying it's a chemical experiment the chemolog lab experiment inside a live inside of live biology, it's crazy but important.

24:42

Yes, I'm just at this moment just sort of stringing together possible pilot experiments to put together some some data in order to put the grant together, but yeah. So there's a topic. Yeah, I mean I as long as you can I think this has to be successful as long as you can just present it in a way that is is super easy for for those, you know, past passing approving the grant to to get the the concept and the importance of it but it's also huge like sort of a huge undertaking.

25:22

I think anyone else have thoughts on that.

25:27

Nick, sorry, I missed the I don't know how much of that good trunk probably how I mean are you gonna induce inflammation like systemically with LPS or something or you just gonna have your slice and throw I know some inflammatory cytokines or something on there's more curious about the the pro yeah.

25:47

I think well, okay, so I think that I'm gonna use environmental exposure to either like intermittent hypoxia or something the model because I usually focus on the respiratory system so a model of. Mapping out basically but in order to get the mechanisms. I'm think I'm gonna have to LPS which is just a lipo polysaccharide which is for anyone that doesn't know it's a reproducible way to induce a known amount of inflammation into the system so basically you you inject that and then because it's big inflammatory response so I'll probably have to use LPS to get at the mechanisms and then do some sort of either on targeted mass back or proteomics or RNA seek to see which transmitters I should say inflammatory molecules are.

26:37

Related with locally within the circuit and then take a healthy slice and then back by that on top so because there's so much going on with biology it's like it's like you have to like for any study you're gonna have to like control for a huge amount of very possible like there could be like really different gene expressions and different proteins being created in two different bodies, you know, I guess if you're doing my you have a lot of clones so maybe that's easier but but still there's a lot to control in it in an environment, how are you going to isolate the the essential?

27:12

Data that is is is going to allow you to to prove. One one one concept or another. I mean, it's certainly going to be for you know, usually the translate four years long and with a decent amount of funding so so that necessarily isn't going to be a limited.

27:30

I mean it is but. In the short term, I guess not really but yeah, it's going to have to be I guess to the point where you have to start out and have some sort of known stressor that's going to lead to the inflammation so first we got a see if that's even true which I think a lot of the the different studies like that and the literature can already be showing that because neuro inflammation is certainly been there a key topic or at least a buzzword, you know within the neuroscience field but, From there that's what it's going to be the trick was to try to figure out the mechanism because like I said, everything is is going to be sort of subject dependent, you know, because you could have the exact same oscillatory output from some network despite the fact that you have completely different transmitter profiles than I do before, you know, from most amounts of inbred strength.

28:28

But I guess what I was curious from from I guess the your perspective or anybody else's perspective in the audience is that you know, when when you take it out to the innovation side of it, so what's what you think would be some sort of outputs that you would be able to use or measurable tools that you would be able to use from a non-invasive standpoint as sort of an endpoint to the grant to say that hey, you know, what these are some of the mechanisms that we find.

29:00

Now how are we going to be able to translate that into a more broadly applicable tool in order to get night understanding of whether or not this network is changed. Like either like surface electro type of analyses because that much is definitely out of my wheelhouse.

29:23

Well for so um, I like I said, I'm not I'm not the. I guess what I want to say is um while I'm not the the the third year the person who at a UCSF who's been doing hard neuroscience and in medical research for 30 years I am I I am an enthusiast of the topic and what I'm what I'm thinking is that if I was going to try to sell an experiment with like this I would I would want to say okay, well, you know because so the basic the basics of the experiment is that you want to compare you know, how a drug is affected by inflammation just like, you know, plain simple.

30:07

But you you could you could do that by you could do that or say okay we're going to test something like injecting a mouse with over 19 and cutting triggering inflammation and instead and then studying we're going to end Jack a lot of mice with it with this and then we're going to study how the the how the inflammatory response from the virus affects the basically the you know, the drug that we're going to give them out, so we're going to see how how easy is it to put them at to to give the mouse and Anesthesia and if the n if the covet nineteen if here is with with the drug and we'll be able to like measure that by by doing you know all the different measurements of people currently do with studying, you know mice with with EEG and in watching their behavior when they go to sleep and we're just going to see we're just going to study like sleeping patterns with and it's basically sort of like the has a component of your experiment but it's like it's it sounds a little bit more exciting because we're like doing you know, we're playing carbon 19 and anesthesia to to big things that seem to attract a lot of money in the world, right?

31:17

And and then you can still do your own research underneath it, that's my thinking a positive. So naked this is a question my current boss frequently asks if everything goes according to plan what would the end result show like everything went swimmingly and the initial experiments. What would it show and then you can kind of design hopefully design your bigger outcome measure from there?

31:47

Yeah, I think you know as of right now the the pie in the sky hypothesis. I guess that would be sort of the the main of aim of the studies would be to show that let's just say a sleep apnea, you know for a reproducible model that we have in the lab conduces either short or long-term information and I don't mean like circulating information.

32:14

I mean information as in like increase in the inflammatory set of kinds locally within the circuit which can obviously work. As transmitters and that alters the expression profiles of different channels on the even the neurons with the glia which then primes the circuits either be more resistant or more sensitive to subsequent drug application and I have a track record of doing studies with opioids, so it might be you know going back to the the how it changes opioid sensitivity.

32:51

But you know the thing that would always get caught up with and branding you might know this as well is that at some point you might get hit with okay now what you're doing is an observatory study. You're giving the inflammation you're measuring the circuit you're measuring the changes and you're measuring the the drug sensitivity but you're not showing a mechanism necessarily.

33:12

And so that would be the key is that. You know, trying to sell in a grant that we don't know what the mechanism is. So we first have to find the mechanism and then be able to reproduce it in the absence of let's say the the sleep apnea or something or something like that.

33:30

It nickel heart is it? To inject. I feel preboxing or something like is it feasible to stick a? Fine like glass pulled electrode in there and injects something. Oh yeah, and we can either do that in a slice or we can do it live in an indivo system as well.

33:50

But that's not hard. We can either we can either in a and that's surprised prep we can actually directly inject right into the pre-bot and a slice we can either locally apply the drug or we can baptify the drug or LPS or whatever it is. And then in vivo we can chronically implant microbiologists probes in order to dialize the drugs locally with it there.

34:14

Yeah, I'm curious for the wondering if you did. If you took once you had like some slice stuff worked out and decided like hey this network's more susceptible or less susceptible to this perturbation. You could go and vivo then and deliver either a short interfering RNA probably be a vile vector or up regulate something that was knocked down that you think might restore function of the circuit.

34:48

I don't know the functional make behavioral outcome you would look out would be but. I think that would tie nicely with yeah if you had some slice some slice work and then just modulating it somehow. Yeah and vivo I'm knocking down some target or a regulating it, oh that's a good idea yeah we can always inject the viral vectors in order to insert something let's say is down regulated or knock out something that lives up regulated that's a good idea so because you know, I was just gonna say because a lot of times a lot of the studies that we've been doing have been sort of with done the phenomena are we measured the phenomenon and then we've gone and measured the neural activity from a single cell from a network activity.

35:40

And then we've been using I think I told mica about these those neural pixel probe which is basically like a multi unit electrode array that can measure like 300 or so neurons at a time so you kind of get neck a broad scale understanding of how the network changes function as far as like the phenotype of firing patterns of the neurons, but again, it's still come back to that same thing like the innovative in the fact that we now can measure more than we did before but you're still just observing a phenomenon, you know.

36:15

That's always the tough part about getting the the studies funded.

36:26

So so I so I so what I thought was that since you can measure single cells with with the electrodes that you that you're injecting on the tip of a needle or basically right that's what you're using or you can measure basically the broader activity like like maybe of many cells and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.

37:01

Of the brain once it's once you know from from a baseline to when a baseline without inflammation to a baseline to the brain's oscillations being modified by inflammation and then and then compare that to the oscillatory changes when you apply medication versus when you're applying the oscillatory changes to the brain at baseline without the inflammation.

37:32

Oh yeah yeah definitely and I think we're certainly do our best to to do that and that hits a sort of defining the phenomenon as to what's occurring but the the trick always was selling it is then being able to. Somehow modify the system either to restore function or to if you know type match what you're seeing without actually having the perturbation.

37:58

Yes, I'm imagining that so on top of that they're also has to be a comparison to to changes in the animal's behavior and and yeah in like like you said like if you could take away the the functionality and or return the functionality to to the animals behavior, that's another comparison.

38:20

Nick is there any like clinical? Patient data, that would show that sleep apnea or something has any link to neuro inflammation. Yeah, I think that data is pretty rich and you know, I'm not married to the idea of Irwin formation, but you know how it is right now is that I'm a fellow in the lab or postdoc and you know, I'm at that stage where I'm at.

38:50

I need to apply for K99 or the transition to faculty award so you kind of apply for your grants to get your own projects up and running your own lab up and running and, You know up into this point we've been doing a lot of sort of I guess you would call it circuit breaking type of experiments figuring out how the respiratory network is affected by opioids and stuff like that and you know, it's they're very rich studies, but if you go to apply and let's say I want to study some other mechanism of opioid induced respiratory depression.

39:23

It's certainly a great study but you're you're then in direct competition with the the person who's lab that you're in already which is pretty much a kiss of death because You're never going to win there because they're already established so you need to somehow branch out and spread your wings and do something completely different and so that was the first thing that came to mind and and like I said, I just started thinking about this like this week.

39:49

So, you know, I was just filling the void for for topics in the room, you know, but yeah that was a the first thing that came to mind was the inflammation but certainly any other mechanisms are around the table as well. So, I wonder Nick have you. As have you so I'm actually just looked up no inflammation and some is brought up a possible link between cannabis can't avoids or basically maybe like smoking marijuana smoking and inflammation the brain and okay, so what I was thinking was it a wealth do you think it's like a well study topic already that the idea that inflammation markers in the blood can can how it basically how they can affect the brain?

40:36

Because you know, we have you know, like if like we were talking yesterday in an in a group and You may have been there for a part of it or maybe not but there we're talking about this the stent road which is these device you can insert into the arm and you know, you can put it into the the jugular and then you can push it up into a person's through the vein into a person's brain above the motor cortex and so there is like a there's a there's like a direct vein that goes from from your arm into your brain and, And and and so, I mean, it's like that is a right it's like a you know, there's there's this there's a blood brain barrier, maybe we can talk about that a little bit but it's not it's not leak proof and there's definitely like.

41:26

Pathways for stuff that's in your blood to get into your brain and there are there's also the lymphatic system which is also something that I but so if you like what I'm saying is like if a person gets the person breathes in you know, like like the covered virus that could that could I guess somehow get into their lymphatic system and get into the brain that way and get into their their blood and get into the brain that way and, So and then of course both the lymphatic system and the blood vessel system have you know endothelial lining and the endothelial lining has h2 receptors which the virus would connect to and and then the question is okay, so if we have this inflammation going on, how is it affecting the the rest of the brain tissue outside the the lymphatic system and the blood vessels and I is this some is this something that's like barely understood is this a new frontier research.

42:29

It's a new. Which I guess sort of there's some of the studies that are going on sort of defining how let's say a acute or a chronic state of neuro inflammation or I guess just systemic inflammation or any sort of systemic perturbation, whether it's be occlusion or even in the brain like a stroke and how it affects sort of blood brain barrier permeability.

42:56

And I think there's there's some of the studies are starting to find that like a local occlusion or stroke within the brain sort of leads to a leaky excuse me a leaky vessels around surrounding the brain which then sort of give rise to a leaky blood brain barrier, but I think a lot of those the mechanisms as to how it occurs is still being sorted out.

43:28

So yeah, it's it's it's still somewhat of a newer field.

43:35

Yeah, there's some one of the other students in our lab right our lab like I own it the lab that I work in he studies alcoholism and it's effects on got microbiome and then it's tied in systemic inflammation from that to. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response and very specific neurons and and the cerebellum and some are the cortex so they don't remember but yeah, I don't think they they know exactly why this systemic inflammation targets those specific neurons or anything but isn't it alluded to it's kind of a new emerging?

44:18

Thing of how the systemic inflammation may cause a quote-unquote leaky blood brain barrier over time.

44:28

Um,

44:35

I was just gonna say yeah, it's a you know, the blood brain barrier itself is still pretty it'll define this to you know, what it is, so that's always a tough one to tackle.

44:49

Yeah, there's some astrocytes and parasites and. Uh neurons near them and that's basically it. It's a little bit confusing because um, the brain is full of micro micro blood vessels and how is that separate from the rest of our vascular system?

45:16

So they have wrapped around those capillaries are the endpeats of the astrocytes right so kind of these glial cells that clean things up take care of some neurotransmitter. Recycling and things of an act is. Hmm cells to keep neurons happy essentially they have a lot more function than that but they're in feet wrap around and couple with another set of cells called parasites and form these tight junctions that limit on what can cross in those areas that a little more than they let's say a capillary in a muscle.

46:05

Okay, so so this is a blood vessels are wrapped so neatly that there's very little. There's some there's sealed containers it just branched through. Of course. Like questions like how much of it is an effective, you know, a crossing the blood brain barrier because we do have ministrations in the brain that actually are that's how like, you know, the the some parts of the brain like can can release a gonadotropins and can also have essentially have reception areas from from the stomach to to signify like some kind of satiation or not using.

46:56

Left and so is it possible to kind of like you have some proportion is to how much of it is crossing the blood green barrier and how much of it is going through the fence regions?

47:12

Sorry this how much of what is getting across. So I was I was under the impression that some some you know side of tying to actually kind of cross over or into the brain from other systems in the body. I could be wrong because I joined in late and I'm trying to catch up so.

47:36

But yeah, I guess saved my questions kind of related to how much of those it feel like if those cytokines are capable of crossing for is there like a proportion that we can play to say that you know, this percentage has the ability to cross the bridge blood-brain barrier and the other it can be simply passed through the penetrations which are blood capillary systems that are exposed to the brain matter or at least like that the the brain itself if that makes sense, oh that's a, It's a good angle that never really thought about is that you know, most of the things that we'd be inducing is sort of a systemically based perturbation.

48:18

You know that the angle of let's say, you know, where do the cytokines come in order to get into the different neural circuits that's good idea sort of looking at let's say you have some board sort of perturbation that leads to a systemic amount of inflammation which then could increase the permeability of the capillary surrounding the different neural element neural networks.

48:43

I guess are the the neural regions and so that you don't necessarily. Have let's say an increase in local release of cytokines, but rather you sort of have a flooding of the the different synaptics bases. I guess with systemically derived inflammatory cytokines which can then change the function of them, that's a good idea.

49:06

So I looked up the Wikipedia article for the blood-brain barrier just to because I think it's maybe 10 years since I looked at it and it says the blood brain barrier or BBB is a highly selective semi-permeable border of endothelial cells that prevents the prevent salutes in circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system, and so like when I read that I was like it it's basically endothelial cells so like what what copied 19?

49:41

Does is it's it's it's viruses when they cause these cells to burst are destroying those endothelial cells and they're just like spilling straight into the brain's extracellular fluid.

50:07

Interesting and that was good the good little think tank for putting ideas together and I apologize I gotta jump off. I got a call at seven o'clock. I gotta go over some sleepy and EEG data but yeah, thanks guys, if you're still here around when I'm done. I'll go back in yeah.

50:24

I think we'll be here till 12:00, thanks for stopping.

50:31

Thanks lady. Yeah, so it's popcorn style we've talked about a lot so far but any questions any topics you want to bring up go ahead.

50:46

Yeah, so I was just listening very carefully in the not as I just also just lay person and the very need to into elastic about this related pick up some for you. Saturday, especially with Nick I think Nick has a very good. Sons of what the grant what angle to to to to attack so that too.

51:16

I mean, it's like navigating through the minds right so the where the established the don't don't touch the family but in general, I'm I was about to ask him a question on a angle that I think I can somehow related to so where can you know machine learning you can can be connected to what he wants to do right so like is heal up and let's just, You know, I was like, he's thinking their general maybe somewhere he mentioned the priming of drugs taking take in a that the drug some some some sort of a database of candidate of molecules or something is that one.

52:03

Used, you know meaningful angle or maybe some some other like, I mean the the so I guess this is Michael come from that this was just such discussion is logical or related to our earlier room with sound data, the Kobe 19 actually affects the brain is that the cell common inflammation material type of you know affects these.

52:36

Cigars under the oscillatory rhythm in the effects of sleep, for example is that the the question aware is irrelevant so I I was tracking most of what you said until the last sentence and then I sort of fell apart for me could you maybe you like rephrase that a little louder and like yeah, yeah, so okay.

53:02

I'll repeat the last part so I was asking you to confirm that no is the is the current. Discussion related to an earlier discussion we had with some doctors tell more that he briefly mentioned the Kobe 19 effects of brain of the brain yeah, so I just hope so just asking you for that confirmation.

53:32

I I don't think Nick was here for that and I I don't know that yeah. I don't see a direct connection to the previous conversation. I don't know if Brandon wants to talk about how he's seeing people use machine learning to in the context of neuroscience. I can give you the little bit that I know of it at least that we've used so there's a software called not max track.

54:12

I'll have to look it up but anyways it's essentially instead of us manually digitizing these rodent limbs, whether they are swimming or running or walking we can train the neural network to recognize the limbs automatically for us which for me saves me. I mean weeks and, Know weeks if not months of worth of work of analyzing rodent behavior manually that it once we talked to the the program to to recognize these limbs and.

54:52

The program after so many passes that we've told the computer and the program what it's looking at it just we can throw all of our behavioral videos provided the cameras are set up similarly and get. Automated connotation of that road and behavior as long as you've trained the the program for it, which is extremely helpful because it saves months of time.

55:18

So it's it's a common mileless move. No sorry. I will try and look it up here as we're on here.

55:30

Yeah, that's a nice thing thanks. Sorry suit other application of machine learning in fact like I think it's pervasively used in a signal analysis so if you say that you have implants so it's not just something related to neural link but this is done regularly to kind of diagnose the the effect of like or at least like that the mutual affecting of different functional groups in the brain like whether you have a knockout bottle like this infuse with with a retrovirus or something that but there is always.

56:09

Like a study to to like there's always a mechanism to study the electrophysiology and vivo and one application of machine learning that I've seen that's pervasively used is that and and spikes written so suppose that you have, you know, multiple trips or tetris as they call them because they're very fine structures like are embedded within within the mouse brain and will be incredibly difficult to trying to determine like, you know, which neuron aspiring or what location so.

56:44

You can apply different clustering mechanisms like k means or or a mixture of calcium systems and to essentially cluster your neuron like the signals that you're getting so that you can identify how many neurons are firing and you can also apply. A PCA principal deployment analysis to to reduce the dimensions because you'll be listening to like the chatter of like lots of neurons.

57:14

So there's a possibility of picking up a single neuron firing from the treacherode or you can have like what they call local field potential which is like doing the constellation neurons for firing and have having or like oscillating the the potential is where at the position where the electrode or the tetrahed is implanted.

57:37

So it has, Wide application when it comes to decoding or I guess like decoding is kindly debated contested idea based on our discussion from yesterday, but if you want to understand like which neurons are firing it or like how many neurons are there that you're picking up based on your electrode positioning, she learning has a lot of input in that regard.

58:00

If that answers your question, Yeah that's where things Information AI I think the arm between mentioned all sounds from there. I mean PCA that's a basic and so there may be also you know all the energy spectral type of analysis reduction of dimensionality and unsupervised learning and yeah, so that definitely can I can see that it's applicable to FMRI of you know, the neuron or, The signal structure, but for me, I mean those black box type of approach is will be definitely.

58:51

I'll be how great greatly helped with some of physiology and physics of type of reduction as like understanding available, right? So which is already connected to which which already understood and yeah, so it's interesting if there's a paper that I mean, I don't know this direction how this direction related to the next.

59:18

Interest in those inflammatory type of work. Okay, I don't know if Nick was just asking out it looks like vitamins can say something. Oh, I just Frank I found the the software mentioned. It's called deep lab cut and it's actually free to download and everything. I forget who developed it.

59:42

Yeah, you just Googled deep lab cut and we'll come right up.

59:56

I was just gonna say I think that Nick randomly threw out a new topic that was related to a project that he's. He's considering to propose to get funding for. So it might have been a little bit a little bit random but it's also something that is is in alignment with is it with his interests.

01:00:15

Does that answer your question?

01:00:23

Yeah, I think you know heck. Well, I'm just trying to connect something. I'm familiar with the current discussion. Yeah, thank you. Thank you all. I mean so fascinating. So for me the so I mean in terms of general very general questions the again, it's a. It's a Let me let me think of all of that.

01:00:53

I'll come back. So yeah. Okay, no problem. So, um, let me go ahead and why don't I just um, you know what I would so so Brandon I I noticed that you're the the profile you've shared is it's very interesting which would you care to share a little bit about the work that you do and and what you're interests are.

01:01:23

Sure. Yes, I'm a PhD student at the I work in a spinal cord injury research center one of the things I really like about where I'm at now is we have a basic science building on one side of the street where we have all our animal models and petrol models and then literally across the street we have our rehab hospital where physical therapists the MDs and neurosurgeons clinical researchers all work.

01:01:55

With spinal grid patients. Rather have your run of the mill approved rehab stuff or for clinical trials or new experimental studies, that's really helpful. On my interests really lie within. Proprio spinal neurons, so those are neurons that are completely contained within the spinal cord. They don't protect to the brain.

01:02:18

They don't project out to the periphery to a muscle or anything. And the reason I think these are interesting is most spinal cord injuries. Are incomplete injuries so some of these axons or the projections of these appropriate spinal neurons remain intact, which leaves you some. I'll say quote-unquote intact tissue to relay signals past the injury either to the brain or descending from the brain or the brain stem down to let's say the control centers in the spinal cord will eggs.

01:02:52

And what we don't really understand which is what I'm working on is how after these injuries even though we have these intact projections, how do how does the morphology of these neurons change how does their connectivity change? Change very quickly, does it change over time it does it settle down if we do have some neuroplasticity.

01:03:17

Does that circuit look similar to? Pathological state that we might be familiar with or does that circuit look more pre-injury like an uninjured if we provide a pharmacologic intervention or some sort of rehab rehabilitation therapy, so yeah really just trying to unravel what spinal cord injury induce plasticity looks like in these proprio spinal neurons.

01:03:44

So what are what are the real what what's the real chemical bias or bio what's the real biological process happening with with neuroplasticity?

01:03:56

I mean, you can take that question. I think a number of directions so at least related to spinal cord injury right right where the injury is you have a capitation that forms so you have neurons that die the other die and you have blood vessels that are disrupted then that really gets balled off by always trying to glial scar and you got to think anything that was connected to or connected with those neurons that died in that area now.

01:04:28

I have to try and reform new connections. Plus as we talked about a bit ago, there's this widespread systemic inflammation that also occurs with that, so we're not talking just about. Neuroplasticity in the area with neurons trying to connect to new things or find new pathways to relay him from it information but also centers very far away from the injury site so for talking an injury at the bottom of this final chord, we'll see changes cortically, which is this far away you can get in the central nervous system.

01:05:05

And trying to understand that I think will help guide therapeutic strategies going forward.

01:05:15

Okay, um, I apologize I apologize for missing part of that. I got it a message from someone that I might be dating. I don't know and I I missed part of it but I don't know if you covered this I want to ask how important is um, so not so nervous so if we talk about neuroplasticity again, there's something I read about a long time ago an idea is that your brain can can learn new things right and end and that you're not you're not necessarily stuck with with what you learned when you were young as.

01:05:50

A sort of vague idea and in but we're but you brought it to a very specific the specific area of study that is not it's not high level, you know book stuff for for you know, someone looking for self-improvement you're talking about something very, you know, it's very specific and very medical and and and so, you know, I'm, I'm just thinking like okay well it is is a big part of this just having to do with how the brain is able to make new memories.

01:06:22

Is it about like the neurodegenerative nerve tissues the environment and and and whether you know new protein synthesis is happening or I mean, I guess one topic has been brought up as to whether new neurons are able to replace dead neurons or something like it's some I'm a little bit vague on the topic and I'm gonna try paying attention.

01:06:43

I'm gonna try to pay attention this time if you want to respond. Yeah all good man. Yes, so again, I'm a and neurobiologist so I think very medically about these things. I know and if you're running around clubhouse you'll find some neuroplasticity rooms quote-unquote that go aren't talking about the medical definition or how a medical scientist may think of them as a broadly the way I think about it right as I can have.

01:07:15

There's some areas the brain that. We're pretty certain cannot form new neurons those say you've had a stroke or brain injury or spinal cord injury. They don't seem to be noon neuron to just form and fill in that area to fill in the dead to replace those dead neurons.

01:07:33

So again, really broadly it is the brain or the spinal cord being able to change itself over time based on a new input that's provided. So that may be that, you know, if I'm I have neuron A and it connected to neuron B before and I learn a new skill neuron.

01:07:53

A may now connect neuron B antenna on C or maybe neuron age just really solidifies its connection with neuron B when I learned that new skill or, New information to form a memory or it could be that neuron. A connected to neuron B and C and now when I form that new memory neuron.

01:08:15

A doesn't need to be connected to neuron B anymore because that may be introduces some noise into that memory or that new skill that I've learned. So and I can think of it very broadly like that of the nervous systems ability to change itself over time based on an input or an insult or something.

01:08:33

I think the flip side of that doesn't get caught a lot is it this plasticity could also be a really bad thing, right? So if you think of somebody that has chronic pain, we would call neuropathic pain, so it's induced by the nervous system. There's not really structural tissue damage anymore.

01:08:52

That that's neuroplasticity that's occurred because those narratives are either overactive or they've connected to new neurons. So there's more no susceptive or pain signals being sent and recognized for some reason and all that's neuroplasticity, it's not a good thing at that point. So, Question half of you Brandon is that do spinal for neurons like those interconnecting neurons, they just mentioned do they exhibit some kind of plasticity the same same way as the ones and the cortex which is like my producing more amp a receptor send vis-a-vis having like like the c-phox expression into that will go to like into some kind of genetic expression, but do they have like the same kind of mechanism to to kind of find out undergo.

01:09:49

Like a synaptic plasticity much like the critical neurons. So this is kind of a crux of spinal cord research. I suppose is for whatever reason it is not as far along as let's say cortical circuitry or like sensory systems in neuroscience, so if you're studying vision or taste or smell or something like that, you would assume because they are still neurons in the central nervous system, they have some similar properties.

01:10:22

Like we know the neurotransmitter phenotypes are very similar depending on where you're looking and they have they come from similar embryonic tissue which would again imply that they have some similar characteristics one another they are still definitely able to change we do know that I just don't know that.

01:10:40

For various populations, anybody has nailed down the exact mechanism. I imagine it's still ampa and MBA dependent calcium influx at those synapses, but again for whatever reason the spinal cord field just hasn't moved as quickly as cortical circuits are or sensory systems so um, so so I am so I guess the theampa and in the MDMA receptors would be changing the the fastest whether they're whether they're going to be.

01:11:15

Accepting signals from from from one neuron or another or not like I guess they could be blocked with with the calcium or something and or they could be open maybe you can expand it and then so that's like there's that's like, you know a lot of change happening at the receptor level like really fast and short-term and then that the the longer-term memory might have more to do with whether they're actually as a like an actual synaptic connection but between the dendrite and and another cell is that right?

01:11:51

Like a think you got the gist of it yeah so this an MBA ampere receptor is calcium dependent right so anytime a neuron starts spike or send an action potential. There's to be calcium influx and that it's which is a good thing it helps neuron get to its potential and fire and the more that it fires and the postsynaptic cell responds you get long-term potentiation, which is those neurons starting to solidify their connection together more and more.

01:12:22

I think that was most of it okay and so I'm just feeling like the whole like, you know back when this whole movement this positive psychology move me movement around a neuroplasticity started there was this huge emphasis on oh your brain can make new neurons and and like an in retrospect.

01:12:40

I'm like, why is that important? I don't know. So if I remember correctly from oh my gosh, I class this four or five years ago, now they. Like you are an adolescence or maybe even at birth you have the most number of neurons that you will ever have and then it is.

01:13:01

Essentially a topogene. Other cellular death mechanisms that. Will start to get rid of neurons that you don't need anymore and hopefully that doesn't happen too fast then you have an Alzheimer's or some other neurodegenerative disease. And also yeah, so steep. So on the on the YouTube there's this the pruning of the video.

01:13:27

I think the ages four is reaches which is the highest point and the turning point in it the proning happens until 18 or something and it's stabilized into adults like brain yeah just a side data. Yeah to synaptic pruning is more important like in in like kids that are like less than each four because like they're they're brains.

01:13:57

I mean, the neurons are like really highly connected and they don't actually gone through the process much much later like and in fact I can find out mistaken the brain actually goes through some some changes until like the age of 25 but it's not like from synaptic pointing perspective, but just keeps on changing I guess.

01:14:20

And I guess like to have to some point to what you just made mention my goods that there are some studies that seem to suggest that there are people's stem cells and and have a campus if not the cortical area, but in the interior part of the the brain there seem to be like stem cells that can replenish dying cells, especially in the hippocampus but I don't know if that's really correlates to like generalizing that for the brain because we already know that cortical neurons are irreplaceable.

01:14:55

And the fact that it's throat patients can revive is because of their actually using their cognitive reserves so which means that other neurons are kind of being repurposing to fulfilling the tasks that you know, this the earlier or the the neurons that actually died out were able to do so just wanted to put an important put it out there.

01:15:21

Right on so I so I guess I'll share it since yeah. I'm gonna record and publish this so I'll share some of my ideas. So, I think that. So I so I I'm going with the hypothesis that a bit of information in the brain is is a coincidence pattern, you know because a so there's there's a the book the note basis of free will by Peter TSC.

01:15:49

He says basically neurons attacked information as coincidence patterns and he doesn't spell it out exactly but I think that yeah like a bit of information so like a quintessence patterns like if you can if if we're thinking about an artificial neural network at the first layer of the artificial neural network that first layer is going to detect the lines and edges.

01:16:08

Alright just basic stuff and then another layer is going to take higher level features. It's a hierarchical model of learning. And then so the idea is that so information for the brain at the lowest possible bit bit rate is just like a coincidence pattern. It's it's to have two things on to two neurons in a at least two neurons within a certain frequency range and a certain spatial parameter firing at a lower at a lower level or maybe at the input level.

01:16:38

And that coincidence pattern is is a bit of information in the brain and and our our brains are basically.

01:16:47

Processing bits of information, but so that's that's the first is the first first idea. I'll go ahead and pause there and it is if anyone wants to reflect.

01:16:59

Like I don't have much to add I've just never thought of it in that way, so I have to sit with that but I like this idea. And then the next idea I wanted to share was that. So there was a paper that that came out where they were saying that.

01:17:17

The that there's the new hypothesis for it's sort of like they demonstrated a new hypothesis that's kind of an old hypothesis for short-term memory. So the old hypothesis for short-term memory, it's like it. So if you need if you need a certain memory, it's like if you need to remember a phone number that lasts for 10 seconds, but if you stimulate a neuron, you know, it's gonna it's gonna you know, maybe it fires and and it's it's a the fire it's you know, It's it's to I guess between two and five seconds is is it's a.

01:17:55

Is the when it's gonna fire and by the time it's ready, you know half then it has to go to. Through and maybe maybe I can ask Brandon to maybe add some clarity to this but but after it goes through this firing process, it has to go through like an inhibitory and inhibited state for a little while and then it resets and I guess it's like after 10 milliseconds it's ready to go again something like that.

01:18:19

But that's not that's not long enough for for a long-term as far as it's not long enough for a short-term memory of 10 milliseconds is not it's not 10 seconds. It's not close. So so for our human so forth our brands to remember some, Thing for. 10 seconds or longer like a phone number The idea is that you'd have to is is that the neuron would have is that neurons would have to talk to other neurons to keep that pattern going like one neuron would say, okay.

01:18:50

I'm gonna I'm gonna say what the pattern is for ten milliseconds another in them. I must say to you and the other neuron has to kind of say back to you and the other in the neuron and maybe have a neural circuit they basically repeats the same pattern may over and over.

01:19:01

So that that pattern can persist for it for 10 seconds and that's the sort of hypothesis the old hypothesis is and and the Seems to be I would I need to find that paper so I can share it with you folks, but um, what short-term memory is, so I'll pause right there and give a chance for people to reflect.

01:19:24

If. Amino wise is seems to be tangible, right? So there should be circuitry that identified just have a you know, significant signature tends to 10 seconds time. I mean temporal. Characteristics. I guess. I'm asking questions if they're experimental proof, hurry.

01:20:01

Through the question again. Sorry. I was just suggesting that the what the the theory might mention that seemed to be quite the you know, it's good. I mean experimentally can be easily verified right so just yeah, I don't have patterns that are identified. So without a times difficult time, like 10 seconds at to look for is I was asking that.

01:20:41

As people look into that already has already data available.

01:20:49

This is something that I study here that I've really looked for. So one of the the harder things at least right now technologically is is to record from. Ensembles of neurons and very different areas of nervous system right like so the way that Nick who was on here does it is if you take our brain slice or brain stem slice you can record from neurons that are within that slice that's I don't know probably 10 millimeters thick or something right but that doesn't mean that you can record from.

01:21:25

Or stimulate in the cortex or chord from these very specific cells that you're interested in the brain stem. So it's. I think what you're talking about is is feasible but for these bigger longer circuits, especially when you're talking about memory right where you have to go. You know, research memory but I hope it's helmets of some sort cortex and probably a number of different areas and there has to be integration of all that across both sides of the brain.

01:21:55

It's. It's hard to do that study perfectly at least right now. But you could have again a slice or if some number of neurons and needs. Microfluidic chambers and connect them together and and work it that way but for these big large behavioral memory circuits, it's a little harder we just kind of have to extrapolate at this point from those those smaller preparations.

01:22:25

So I thought it was really interesting in the book by Jeff Hocking's called I don't know if anyone here has read it his new book is called does anyone know the name of his book new book? I'm blanking on the name. I just happened let me type in the computer real quick to hocking's.

01:22:44

Brain on a thousand brain a thousand brands yeah so so we would Jeff Hawkins is suggesting is that if you your neuro columns are organizing here your brain activity in a multimodal way. So if you if you're looking at your phone, you would have one or more neural columns would be.

01:23:11

Would be managing the the concept of the phone at a high level and integrating all the different modalities of the phone including its distance from from your head, it's distance from your hand if your hand is on the phone where your fingers are and the and it kind of has to be that way because if you like if you're sliding your finger along the phone on different sides of it, your brain is predicting what you might touch what it might feel like and if there was like a bump you would notice it immediately because your brain is is predicting that and I guess, you know a prediction for a neuron could be like, You know, like it might be like something like the dendritic the the the dendrite firing in a forward direction towards the torque towards the the axon body towards the soma sort of prepare the to prepare the neuron for for action for the action potential to fire and so that that is sort of what I've heard is like a neuron predicting that it's going to fire.

01:24:17

Or getting ready to fire and then so that so that prediction the fact that you're your finger your brain is predicting what your fingers might feel it's like saying okay, well your neuron you're you're the neurons in your in your somatosensory cortex, perhaps are getting ready to fire and the neurons in your visual cortex or are getting ready to fire and and in all the at all in all the modalities, you know, like the your audio cortex and and and your thoughts about the phone and and and they're all being sort of integrated and managed.

01:24:52

Maybe by one one or more neural columns that are sort of maybe maybe many neural columns at the same time, but maybe all these neural columns at the same time are sort of creating similar models about what's happening about what you're focusing on and and then the there's sort of like process of of neuronal deduction where then we're the neurons are voting on what is is the most likely.

01:25:25

What is the most likely situation that's at this happening what was the most likely to be the correct model or prediction of the of the reality of what's happening with with all your senses and? And but this is like this is something like so neuro column is is many layers of.

01:25:47

Micro of of like a microcluster of neurosurgeons in a way. I mean, just pause.

01:25:58

Like I haven't heard the a few of those terms before but there's a similar. Thought process in motor control and motor learning where let's say the cortex but there's a lot of things that control look emotion and motor output, but we'll see that the the cortex decides hey. I don't know let's say throw this baseball and it sends a copy of that command down to the spinal cord to get out to the muscles and the arm and the trunk to coordinate everything but at the same time a copy of that command is sent I believe to the cerebellum and then once you have feedback from how that baseball circle felt.

01:26:41

Know what the outcome was of your baseball pitch your that was the outcome is compared to that efferent copy so that you can make adjustments hopefully over time to that motor outcome so it seems like a similar paradigm at least for whether it's memory formation or. The which are repaired.

01:27:05

I'm you just mentioned in the book.

01:27:10

Um, so I hit so that the the Hocking's paradigm for a dozen brands is the he causes the,

01:27:20

Right he calls it reference frames and so so reference frames is an idea that similar to understanding the relationship between play cells and grew cells in the into renal cortex the unit do you know about that one? I do not. Okay well I'm so I guess I will try to describe it not being an expert on the topic but I think that so so the the basic the base so just to start with the basic idea of place.

01:27:56

I'll just for the whole group is and I hope I don't mess this up but I might be I might mess it up so so a mouse can move. I might I'm asking move into different rooms. And in the case of an experiment some of the rooms might might shock the mouse there might be an electric zap and some of the rooms might be very pleasant to mice make might find food in some of the rooms and the mice can tell which room that it's in and but not only that the mask can tell where it is in the room and so if you're if you if you're sticking electrodes into the mouse's brain the mask can tell if it's if it's on the the, you know, like for example, I think you're gonna have place cells.

01:28:42

Because we refer to the mouse what the neurons are lighting up that's how the mouse where it is in the room relative to the the different walls of the room it's what what it's what it's place is within the room and then the grid cells are this hexagonal pattern of cells at a large on a larger scale across the interim cortex and I hope I'm not messing this up really badly but but the the, But but they basically help the mouse to know which room it's in and so the combination of grid cells and play cells is like one is you have like with grid cells you like a reference for what room you're in and with place cells you have a reference for where you are in the room and what what your orientation is, and and I guess it's thought that there's a similar.

01:29:33

Concept happening where so the the reference frame is what which which grid you're in and the that's the frame and then from that reference you you can figure out also which which which room and which part of that room you're in with the with the play cells and so there's there's like a there's a we're a relationship dynamic and it's it's a sort of like, The the grid cells are going to be very slowly changing and very stable and the place cells are like more like shorter term information, they're going to change very fast and they're going to because the mouse is constantly moving within one room and and so on what they're looking with they're hoping to prove right now is that they're actually are either grid cells in place cells throughout the neocortex or or the functional equivalence, they're of place cells and group cells and it is it it kind of look.

01:30:38

S like there might actually be grit cells in place cells everywhere in the near cortex but but I guess it's it's still an area of research a new area of research and but the idea there is that you are that all the thoughts then are basically like all of our thoughts are basically, you know, like I think it's it's a common story we've heard that the brands are for movement highly coordinated movements specifically, you know, like like planned movement where I and it's not just like I need to face where the sun is that's what a tree does.

01:31:10

I need to face a sun it's like I need to. Walk across an environment and away from the other animals and towards the food, it's a really complicated highly coordinated movement right and so that's what brains are for but the idea is that like now maybe every single part of the brain is literally for a movement and maybe every single thought we have is a movement involving the motor involving involving motor neurons, so like I mean at some point we you know, we had the the brain like there was a the motor cortex everyone knows there's a strip it's a motor cortex right but But and then and then at some point if you people like you know okay well actually we have a layer we have a layer that's the motor layer and that goes everywhere in the brain it's the the fifth with the fifth layer of the brain so so we had the motor cortex that was supposed to be one strip and then we have the motor layer which is the entire fifth layer of the brain and and now it's like well we'll shoot well like every like everything is like every every thought is basically a movement in one sense that's that's like where it's going like it's it's I mean pause for a second.

01:32:25

Yeah that seems to be like a very interesting thing because I was under the impression like I actually reviewed one of the one of the papers that actually showed that there are play cells and the brain and it was published like 14 years ago, but they actually located those cells and hippocampus most specifically like the CA1 at the hippocampus and it will be very interesting to see that if placed cells are kind of a ramp and all over the, Text yeah, that will be something that I'll be very interested in.

01:33:07

So a lot of things have been discovered about the hippocampus that people have wondered if that is the supplied to the neocortex and and and not so we've talked about place cells we've talked about grid cells, but another thing is the best vesicles so in the hippocampus it's it's been shown a long time since a long time that that you know, an a neuron has a multiple vesicles.

01:33:37

And and there's this thing called multiple vesicle release it looks like a abyss you're gonna say something when I top it go ahead. No eyes I was applauding because so yeah the multiple vesicle releases. I think it it has something to do with like with a presynaptic strength relation because like strengthening up relationship because I essentially released vesicles to to induce postsynaptic potential.

01:34:12

Or inhibition or that matter. Would you would you say that one more time this is like this is important to me. Oh so so I was under the impression that the vesicles are so physical when you talk about vesicles like I mean probably correctly on this bet my understanding is that the vesicles are sort of like the lipid bilayer bubbles that contain neurotransmitters that will be released to the postsynaptic cells, so whether they can they can induce post synaptic potential or or inhibition that's that's up to the neurotransmitter because like if you have don't, Knowergic vesicles still probably induce postsynaptic potential, if you have gotta hurt gabergic neurotransmitters inside the physical they can also they can they can hit inhibit postsynaptics you're not but I guess like when you said something about multiple physical systems like trying to differentiate whether it's like a new thing because this this physical or release of your transmitters is a well documented case or is it like any different so okay, so here's the right it really interesting thing.

01:35:33

Is that it it's well documented in the human hippocampus but it's it hasn't been well documented and in the neocortex and it's been an it's been sort of an unknown but the recently I wrote an article that that was about research it had been done that essentially proves that that multi-multivate so the basically, you know, we have between throughout the neocortex neurons have on average like 2.5 vesicles per neuron or between zero and three vesicles.

01:36:07

Per neuron and and that's important because what the what the multivet what multi vesicle release means and and I so your description of it being like sort of like a lipid bubble of neurotransmitters is my understanding as well. I wish I knew more about. How much the how different kinds of like because so my understanding is that you know, you basically would have you'd have cells that are gonna just regularly release a certain kind of neurotransmitter and I'm sort of interested in and how often the neurotransmitter that cells release can change, can you have an acetylcholine anesthetical choline neuron change sort of spontaneously to to be like, A was it a glute a glitter magnetic neuron.

01:37:09

I brand new do you know the answer? Yes, so they're there's a little distinction here, so I haven't seen. And most my work is in the spinal cord with motor circuits, but you don't typically think of neurons changing their their transmitter feet or type right you don't think of them as changing from releasing gab or being governor Jake to being glutamatric and releasing glutamate but what can change this is again with pathologic states as you may get transporters that change which will affect the concentration gradients of various ions inside and outside of the cell.

01:37:54

And if you flip those concentration gradients then there's a chance that depending on how much it's flipped that a let's say that gap up bound and a chloride to release from the cell. I don't. Somebody can correct me on that are Google it real quick let's say that you're neurotransmitter bound and before it caused calcium to release from the cell so it made the cell more positive right because you had a negative.

01:38:21

I'm sorry chloride a negative chloride ion flowing out of the cell, yes, but in this pathologic state. The concentration gradient is flipped because the transporter the normally keeps chloride in the cell the opposite way. Now allows chloride to float into the cell that neuron is depolarized so that now rather than a negative chloride flowing out of the cell when that channel is depolarized it flows into the cell and actually makes the cell more negative so I haven't seen or heard of transmitter phenotype changing but what that transmitter does in some pathological states can can change the flow of ions which may change whether that transmitter is.

01:39:13

Inhibitory or excitatory. Wow, that's it. I'll pause okay, go ahead of this. Yeah, I have like sort of like a loading question for Brandon because I have to leave and like few minutes but I can repeat the questions if you're have like in trouble remembering them first questions that you see spice dendritic spines in the this final chord a neurons much like the protocol neurons second is that have you do like organoid kind of study to kind of?

01:39:56

See if there is a an innate ability of spinal cord neurons to repair themselves if there was like a like separate severing and like in the axonal on the axon or there's like any kind of damage that you use like organic models to study such responses like a neurons can can go through the repair system my last question is 

01:40:29

I don't know if you heard about the, Was like a recent publication that said that layered to layer three paramedical cells and the cortex can do dendritic computation, so how much of it do you think would apply to the spinal cord neurons, so these are like three of my questions?

01:40:51

Yeah those are fun questions so they definitely have dendrites fine tried if we label appropriate spinal neurons that I work on they have a label that will fill the cell well enough you can and you have the right microscope you can zoom in and quantify the number of dendritic spines and the shape of those spines and decide how mature or immature of those spines are and how many of them there are.

01:41:15

The organoids. I I don't think there's anybody actually here it does organoids. I know that's kind of a developing area we can talk more about organoids later on and then abyss what was the last question? It was about dendritic computation much like the parameter cells, but I was asking for this if that applies or a few things that applies to spinal cord.

01:41:49

Yeah, I'd have to see what they mean by dendritic computation but inevitably if they're if again, they're still neurons even though there's a little bit of difference between the brain and the spinal cord. I would it's some level there's computation occurring whether it's in the dendritic spines. I don't know but for two.

01:42:14

For now to do the computation of all the inputs that it's receiving that as a variety of inhibitory and excitatory and then decide if it. Has enough excitatory input relative to the inhibitory input to fire to send it signal wherever that may go with the correct timing there's computation that has occur in each of those neurons somewhere whether it's at the the dendritic spines are not a I don't have a direct answer.

01:42:43

Yeah, they're actually yeah, I'll be really interested if that's kind of a good is in the central nervous system but yet this has been a great discussion guys some and have to leave now but thanks for having me sure well next time you come. I do have a lot of thoughts on dendritic computation so we so we can talk more about that next time.

01:43:08

Hey thanks babies. I have a just like hit on this. I mean, I found this by Google that are there's regarding the earlier discussion the short-term memory the it's came out like March this just lost March target the title of the papers targeted photo stimulation uncovers circled motifs supporting short-term memory, so I just browse in through I sold the, Technique I use is a two-fold on image in the posters stimuli nation are mice.

01:43:50

I found just you know relevant to they are identify some kind of a circular feeder carried the characters time less than 10 seconds. I think so. I in your human when you have time and your comments will be. You know, welcome and so so for me I'm in my car mentioned that I have this like why I'm interested as a general interest, you know hobbyist because I'm losing my sleep I and the maxima I can have is like very accurately I can only sleep like flower and they're accurately no matter what time they go to bed so even right now.

01:44:30

I feel like I'm you know losing in I care that's my memories that yeah short-term or long-term is better, but it's something interesting. I think it is if you can verify that branded that they actually find maybe find the right to experimental apparatus for to address the question that a important question.

01:44:58

Yeah Frank I haven't seen a paper so I can't comment directly but I presume based on the title it probably used some type of option genetics and drove using a specific wavelength of light whichever neurons they are interested in and then had some type of calcium imaging which would tell you in another area if.

01:45:20

The neurons downstream of your neurons are firing as a result of driving your neurons to fire or maybe inhibiting your neurons, but I have to look at the the paper a little more. What was the the title of it again? Frank, sorry. Oh yeah, so the it's available on the bio, but a bio archive so that the first name of the author is d a i e d a i e the last name of the first order and the title of the papers targeted photos to stimulation.

01:46:00

Uncovers circled. Motifs supporting short-term memory came out of the jet-generia research lab service. Stanford, that is that is in fact the what I was referring to earlier today, so that's it's a. That's that's what I was talking about. Yeah, okay that's okay, so my thought you are familiar with her.

01:46:28

I've read this paper yeah that's that's what I was referring to when I said short-term short-term memory appears to be basically activity in in in neural circuits it appears to be it's it's the idea that you know, one neurons activity might last for. 10 milliseconds, but you have if you can have one neuron repeat the same assets to another neuron the other neuron repeat the same message to another neuron and that can continue for for 10 seconds and that neural circuit would be responsible for short-term memory that's super important though in terms of like if we're getting it we're able to get like really super high resolution.

01:47:14

And high not only high resolution but also like just getting a ton of data from a neurosurgeon basically by you know with them, you know, I guess you I guess you can you know, like like the idea is that a neural circuit is where where we might find our thoughts basically in the firing pattern of mineral circuit.

01:47:40

And so that's that's interesting for for the future of brain computer interface to every search.

01:47:52

So. So don't mean that this extremely interesting. I learned a ton and the really appreciation, you know experts here brand in my current and make hope. I mean, my car are you going to schedule? I mean, it's your room like has a fixed schedule or I saw this one like in hallway.

01:48:21

I mean, you know when you schedule it so I what I'm considering. I'm, I I haven't decided yet how often I want to do this but I want to do this very often and I I I'm thinking if I if I can have like a happy hour discussion just open for anyone to to talk on these topics, like I would love it if this topic was always happening on a clubhouse and I could just come in or out whenever and and just hit join this discussion, but what I what I've noticed is that there there is not literally someone hosting a neurophysics and nerve gear type discussion every single day in clubhouse it.

01:49:04

Doesn't have and I'm surprised because it's the only thing I look for and and I hope to see it every day but I haven't been sound like okay, well maybe I should just do it every day but it only as long as I can it's like in I can do my work while at the same time so if I can if I can if I can do my work and and just sort of like have this happy hour discussion happening in the background, then then it works out and then and then maybe I'll do it every day, but I haven't committed to that yet, but but I think it's gonna be often yeah.

01:49:37

Just one quick suggestion better it is also great. I wouldn't you know, oh I love to attend yeah, you're happy hour discussion and just listening I guess the one quick suggestions you can make I I see you're also in the neurosurgery and there's a multiple many even showers and your nation clubs right there, they're already subscribers followers it a I mean case you is that what you wanted you want if have a more attention people attending.

01:50:12

Just post to those rooms as well, so there will be I mean, of course it's more room has you know advantage of more guided deep diver so now it's up to you yeah what I've noticed so far if I so I'm a member of like a lot of clubs and that gives me the option to you know, there's some huge clubs and so I could start groups under those clubs and that notifies a huge number of people but it doesn't let it doesn't let people who are not in those clubs see see my event unless I unless I'm an admin.

01:50:47

Of those clubs and if I'm not an admin then then I'm I'm yeah, so it's like then the people in the hallway who are not inside a club don't see it and I don't know what to do about that yet. I'm just I'm just you know, it's like a you know, a club gives me access to a large group of people but restricts me from a general the general population, so I'm confused about why it's that way, yeah.

01:51:14

Okay, I. Am just I have to start a room yet okay can you like to start a within the club with a few experts then open as people come in and open it up to to all I think that's opportunity so what I'm so what I'm saying is that if I start a room in someone else's club and I'm not the admin of that club then the only people I can invite are the only people who I can invite are people who are already members of that club and they only get a notification at the beginning and that by that might be enough to start a conversation that has you know, 200 people in it and and maybe it.

01:51:51

I ought to do that but um, but but if I but that means also that people who are not members of that club already won't discover this conversation and so for that reason. I haven't gone that route yet. I haven't. Sort of yeah confined myself to someone else's club just yet for for that basically for that reason.

01:52:16

I see yeah. Frank thanks for making me aware this paper elected dig into it a little bit over the weekend.

01:52:37

Um, So I yeah, so the paper you can read the whole thing if you. So they publish it twice, so you can download the PDF if you go if you go into bio are XIV. But but but if you go to if you see the paper on your are they gonna want to charge you money, so it just depends I mean, so I guess some people have access to some people have like, you know, your your your company or your university will give you will pay for it but it's also available for free that was my point.

01:53:10

Yeah, if you ever have issues getting to papers for anybody, there's a website. Called CyHub that is all for open science. It's I believe SCI dash HUB and I think it's dot TW now but it gives you access to most papers that you may not have access to if you're not already university or something.

01:53:43

Right? Yeah.

01:53:51

So, how did you get interested in neuroscience and all of the like? Well, I mean like like like many kids that group in the 1980s. I watched movies I was kidding. I you know that the fan of a science picture movies robots that like number five is alive, you know that you know that reference number five is alive the sentient robot you're lost on me.

01:54:25

I'm sorry that's a movie called short some of you called short circuit and short circuit two is Disney movie about a robot that became sent in it really cool movie if you liked movies about sentient robots. That the that are really cool and. And the the kids have to protect that the the sentient robot friend from from being captured by the military.

01:54:48

That's what I remember, but it was funny so then I write so then like when I was an adult, I read this book called. On intelligence by Jeff Hawkings and that really changed my life and because then I had this idea about how the neocortex could could how we create a an artificial neocortex thanks to Jeff Hawkins book and he just really has a really great way of explaining some some concepts and not it's not that his book is is a hundred percent original.

01:55:22

I wouldn't say that but if you didn't understand neural networking before dev hockings, then you would definitely understand. That after Jeff Hawkings but but but he makes some important differences, you know, it's not like you know, like the the um, you know deep learning is is not computational neuroscience, it is the the airplane of intelligence it's it's it's not trying to you know, like so there wasn't it so before the right brothers there was this airplane that was in France that this guy claimed flew.

01:55:59

He claimed airplane because he was so secretive there's no evidence that his airplane flu but his airplane had bat wings like yeah that wing can you imagine and so he claims it flew but but but we don't really need bat wings for airplanes to fly right just the flat flat fairly flat blades, you know, and the airplane flies just fine because the principles of flight.

01:56:26

Are different from the the the specific biological implementation of a flight in birds and and that's the idea with with deep learning is it's not biologically plausible because it doesn't need to be it has the it's supposed to grab just just the principles of intelligence but but so Jeff Hockings though is I guess the closest to being a computational neuroscientist and in terms of what the the software that he writes while well, you know similar is intended to be biologically plausible.

01:57:01

And biologically consistent to really do intelligence the way that our brains do intelligence and so so for so for that reason he he makes writing basically setting the brain and I mean and you know, I would just have to say that there's nothing like the people who the architects of deep learning, you know, I guess yeah only current and Jeffrey Hampton, Joshua Benjio and and others.

01:57:35

Many other people those are the three big names but there's many others they they all read neuroscience, they're not like ignoring neuroscience right the end they all read Jeff Hawkins book and everything and computational neuroscience, it's just that it's just that they're they're really they're not trying to to produce they're trying to try and they're not they're not trying to be too biologically plausible but they are they are trying to study to look for the principles of intelligence and so to end and in both approaches.

01:58:10

I think. Are important let me just pause and give someone else a chance.

01:58:18

Well, I'm glad that there are those people that think about these things on a much larger scale than the idea, right? I'm just so used to I have this these two hundred little neurons that I study so that there are people that think about these things on a very large scale to kind of push push the thought process forward.

01:58:41

Yeah, let me see if we should probably invite some more people up so I just want to like make everybody who's listening I just feel like you know totally welcome because this is like happy hour conversation we've got some intense topics but but you can really bring up any topic that's that is semi-related and and ask any question we've got this amazing a neurobiologist here on with us Brandon Brown and he's a PhD candidate and maybe you have a question for Brandon or.

01:59:16

Frank or myself, so I'm doing my invite people up here and just come on up and talk about anything you want.

01:59:28

And okay, so welcome to Carl and Dr. Olu I'll just meet myself and give each of you a chance to take a turn to to speak. Okay, thank you because I I Imigo or Michael I usually say mica, okay bye. I am a silent supporter so whenever you think that the room is not as full as you might like just think that I'm I'm a peacock admirer of yours, so anyway, so I am I have begun to read this book called on intelligence.

02:00:11

It's so bad a guy who completes complaining about how there's lack of operating theories on mural science and then he talks about why it is probabilistically very difficult for the brain to have come up with different processes for processing sounds versus vision versus smell and the kind of stuff and then he says that maybe there's not just one approach which is sort of related to a, Time series it's time series sensors sensory input, so it's even touches time series and so on and so forth and then I was listening to is it professor King I is it I forgot his first name but.

02:01:06

He has a room and they're talking about how when the when when a person or when a mouse is presented with our sin familiar terrain inside a maze there is this type of like a true herd so ten heights rhythm but develops in the neural transmission and that sounds social like some kind of a time series of like a singing type of things so I'm wondering if, There is a formation of this type of realization that somehow the brain sings in some sense of the mural transmission space that is telltale sign of how it is processing all kinds of different sensory imports.

02:01:59

Thank you. And then. Yep I may have to if so I may have gotten a little lost maybe someone else wants to answer you said something about the brain singing. I definitely would like you to to restate that but let me pause first give maybe maybe other people heard you better in doctor or who could respond or someone else but I'll just deposit for a second.

02:02:26

I'll give time to others to to try to answer. I was kind of formulating what I wanted to talk about so. I'll step in after maybe somebody else has a chance to answer Carl's question. The Carl I don't know about these the frequencies you're speaking of oh my I'd have to look at the the paper to to have a better answer there was one part and if you can clarify that'd be great you mentioned.

02:02:56

And that senses something about figuring out how senses go together right how all these senses are coordinated or something like that.

02:03:08

Right. So Jeff Hawkins.

02:03:13

And. What it says is that evolutionarily it's probably very difficult for the brain to have come up with five different mechanisms for preceding the five different senses. So then he says, maybe just one trick that we're using to process everything and then he makes a point that the and I don't know if these people scholarly broke away.

02:03:45

I just picked it up in a bookstore and, Then he says even touch is actually time series information because he pure to just touch something and without moving the hand try to figure out what it is. It's very hard. It's only by slowly and gently the progressing the surface with your pivots that you begin to ascertain exactly what type of surface it is.

02:04:08

And so and then sound is by nature time series even the visual signal if it's moving we're much more perceptive about it rather than a stationary image. And then so yeah, so that's that's as far as I understand so far. I haven't. So I I read that book a long time ago and that was like I said that was a book that changed my life.

02:04:35

So I understand a lot about that book but um, but what I guess what I didn't understand is what you were taught what you were saying and maybe just restate what you're saying about about the brain singing.

02:04:51

So I think was the last weekend there's this neuroscience room. And I forgot the name of the moderator who's lasting his king, I believe. And. And they were talking about their monitoring the and I don't know how they were monitoring him, but they found out that when the mouse moves through a terrain that is familiar that the the mouse has seen it before.

02:05:24

The the and the more familiar it was these periodic firing of certain set of neurons. So it was not just the memory forming but it was some kind of a dynamic dynamic thing that was happening that reminded the that that was coins correlated to the the mice recognizing something that that's as far as I remember about this.

02:06:00

I think they the book that you you refer to on the intelligence that's a first it was a book by Jeff Hawkins in 2005 and the other book that the thought thousand brain it is actually a I think a newer version yeah, so I think you might want the interested to get the top one as well, so the the time series I might I'm my own.

02:06:35

Take on this but I think so quite a legitimate contracture right because when it comes to signals naturally, you know for a Siri expenses a series has to come into play right so a third the evidence is abundance right in our brain, that'll you know, our sleep rhythm like from a comma beta, you know, you know out of all these.

02:07:08

Delta so also earlier discussion that a brine in the product. I mean, very interestingly, I mean, the my thought that the short-term memory that the subtype 10 second of a time-tourister is that a I also you know just hit on upon a new research that they use to fold on the imaging and also stimulation to study data finding some experimental evidence supporting that theory of short-term damage so to me.

02:07:43

Is that a evidence to towards a similar theory of contractor that I heard earlier around clubhouse is better our brain is actually different size of on the levels of circuitry loops right so so involved given that different level of consciousness whatever they mean that the the interior way you can define it then individually so within the brain yeah, so maybe I'm just saying that a is a to me and, It seems to be legitimate and also for earlier interesting topic that Micah I mean, this is a maybe for later discussion this had a you you mentioned the light brother that the airplane right so that that's I founded the he just the mind following the the it's a it's it's some strong evidence that a argue against the the the high fidelity for biomimicry is so essentially is pointing to a way that will have to understand.

02:08:53

The solution biology offer might not be the optimal one right so if we understood the physics and we human can come up with a even better. I mean, say a CPU, right? I mean, there has its own clock and the also these anyway so memory and all these so I also.

02:09:16

That question also interest me or what the future likes, right? It's a great discussion so far is it? Thank you all for that. Let me just give the floor to Dr. Earlier, are you ready with? Yeah, thanks for bringing me up. Just by way of background. I do work in computational neuroimaging particularly with a focus on connects at the macro level using different modalities, like MRI diffusion cancer imaging FFRI particularly in the context of psychiatric disorders, like looted anxiety disorders and we've done some work using EEG to generate connectos and specifically looking at dynamic.

02:10:07

Connectivity with EEG data, especially during a particular task like the emotion regulation task and we've done some interesting work showing that if you look at these dynamic domes across different subjects across different time points, you can use that data to put into a manifold learning algorithm to kind of populate a state space that represents the different activities that subjects are doing during the task and it actually nicely separates out different conditions of the task it separates.

02:10:42

Who have anxiety disorders versus controls who don't. And I was actually interested in your background by cut because I saw that you do some work with EEG and VR and so one of the things I've been interested in is sort of taking our initial findings into the yard to see if we can use sort of real-time data from EEG to feed back into the subject through VR so basically VR enhanced neurofeedback and I was wondering if Mica you've had experience combining EEG and, VR and what sort of equipment you've used to do those types of projects.

02:11:21

Thanks awesome. Thank you for the things for the question. Doctor. Who? I am happy to talk about that. So. There's several there's several things to talk about. So one of one of the one of the things that I should share is my bio so if you go to go to this if if folks can't go to VRMA.io and there should let me know.

02:11:46

I should open a medium page. Let me know if that's working for you.

02:11:53

Vic is okay. I'm going there now. Yeah, it's it's V6 screens. Yeah, so VRMA dot. IO is. Is a victor. Robert Mary Adam dot Isaac Oscar, okay. And I'm. So so there and then you click on the the first the first see I think it's the first thing it says link to buy out this is Michael.

02:12:29

Lumber get a programmer and a journalist, okay? And yeah, okay and then you're gonna scroll down and you're gonna see at some point today there's there's you can see something that says neuro hacks or EEG.

02:12:48

Yeah, oh yeah there we go so um, this is gonna say it's gonna this is like it's gonna say a lot about what I worked on and what I did um, and so I'll sort of summarize this so um in 2008 I became the organizer of neurotech SF which is one of the branches of neurotech acts which is a global organization of of of meetups worldwide to with 22 or 23 chapters and major cities across the world

02:13:21

And so I was doing the San Francisco chapter I did for two years and in 2018 every single week not every week but but almost every single week I had people coming into noise bridge which is a noise bridge is a maker space also called a hacker space there often big cities in and in Hong Kong and and Tokyo and Texas and San Francisco makerspaces are hacked spaces and and people come there to write code or or to.

02:13:56

Do you know do all sorts of weird things as those often like a wood shop and a metal shop and you can make anything you want there's even people even make a you know fashion designer show up and they make clothes so um, so I was hosting a coding meetup though and I was using this technology called a frame which is built on top of it's a it's a it's a a framework that let's makes it easy to build VR applications and now also augmented reality applications.

02:14:29

It wraps around 3JS, which which is 3js is wraps around WebGL and WebGL was invented to to bring a canvas to a canvas for 3d for 3d objects and and and and why am I why am I stumbling it was so what you I maybe I'm nervous so no so so the it's a period it's it.

02:15:00

I'm not usually one whose stumbles but, Who so yeah so so WebGL was basically 3d technology for the wet, okay just to make long story short so the web has html which is documents and documents are supposed to be 2d and they wanted 3d so so web GL but what GL unfortunately is is so low level that if you're just gonna do one shape it's like if you just put a triangle on the screen or a pyramid that you take attach a hedon, right?

02:15:26

I, Year you might have to write 250 lines of code. It's ridiculous. So so 3GS it was one of the one of many. One of the firsts I think probably the first high level scripting language that made creating 3D on the web really easy. And what a frame added was an entity component system that allowed you to.

02:15:47

To make your code even neater basically and in and also entity component system is great for teamwork because it's sort of it it makes it like you don't have to be a ninja to get to build non-blocking high-performing code when you're using an entity component system because that it does a lot it sort of the structure of an entity component system, so it does a lot of that a lot of good code practices for you and your team basically.

02:16:18

You could have one code and the rest your team can can keep up with you if you're using. A system And so what we did was we used the brain. So so what what I did in the beginning was I was I brought a bunch of people together and I said, okay let's bring let's bring EEG into VR.

02:16:33

And the reason is because I I wanted to do that since I opened a business in San Francisco in 2012, and I I wanted to create an alternative bio feedback and neurofeedbacks salon where I was using the motive headset and at the time in 2012 and I was using a program called Neuroprogrammer and another program called Mind Workstation and creating custom.

02:16:56

Basically custom tracks that had ISO chronic beats and I was using the line I was so there's this guy named Lennox in the 1980s and he Lenox Delano. Oaks protocol was basically a biofeedback frequency program where he was capturing EG patterns and then using them to to change light basically light he didn't really have sound at that point.

02:17:26

So he was just changing light effects like the light would flash with the frequencies of your of your brain activity and, But he would also encode it with with with frequency with certain frequency ranges certain frequency patterns as well. And he he reported that that his patients had some significant success with their own in many cases with their with their issues.

02:17:52

You can of course read more about Lenox and his protocol. He's eventually the man who invented transcranial magnetic stimulation. A long time later. So but in the 1980s being able to do, you know, EEG and, The kind of thing that he was doing was was I guess that his kind of I guess his setup was like half a million dollars back then but but what I was doing was bringing using the EG to drive light and sound effects to a light and sound machine and that lightens it they're like the total cost of the equipment that I was using was like about a thousand dollars.

02:18:28

And but I wanted to do it in VR so basically I would have your brainwaves driving light and sound effects and they would change what you see in here and they're encoded to isochronicbeats and and they would they would really cause us like intense sort of like self-awareness. I made like them some meditative state and if I change the the frequency patterns that I was encoding of course, you know, then that would that would affect that your the changes in your mental state, but it was just it was very particular it was very interesting because I began to feel as if I was listening to I began to feel so of getting.

02:19:03

Some awareness over how my my brain was for changing the light and sound patterns and and therefore gaining some awareness over what my when my brain waves were in an adaptive stacked way and not in the very clear way but but but getting a sense of how my thoughts and feelings were were sort of changing light and sound patterns and like I said, it's very very weird starting it all up love, but did you start feeling some conscious control but, Over your brainwaves and terms of not that you had this feedback yeah.

02:19:33

I yeah and one of the weird things was I so I put a blindfold on one time and just turned off all the lights so I just try to get it as close to zero light and in the room as possible and I had this visualization there's no drugs involved where I turned into you know, something like something like an ancient Cambodian statue, but it was but made out of fire and the fire was like there's like basically the fire was different colors based upon how far based upon like like seven different.

02:20:04

Colors like representing the seven different chakras or something and and I could change the color of the fire consciously and and basically that would change the light and sound effects but I was sort of seeing in my mind's eye because my visual cortex was was freed because I was wearing a blindfold and it was completely dark.

02:20:22

I was seeing my body as visualizing my body as this is being a flyer and I could change the light and sound effects by thinking and change what I change my my form as this sort of status sort of like Cambodian style statue that was made out of fire.

02:20:39

It was it's we sounds weird but it's very very interesting and I had a number of other like really profound that amazing experiences including one that I was described as sort of witnessing to beginning of time and I loved that story but it's um, it was I don't know if I should tell it right now but but um, It was a so how many sorry how many channels were using so I so the emotive had said is it's like a it's a 16 or 14.

02:21:10

I think it's like 14 channels and it's in 14 channels inside a 16 channel syntax that's had a 16 electorate device 14 good channels, and of course, you know with EEG you're the the the you know, so I guess it's it's it's well it's really removed right it's really far removed we're talking about like, Dipole activity at a large scale, right?

02:21:36

It's not very specific to your. To your neurons firing at the point that we're measuring it with EG it's like large-scale dipole activity, right? It's very abstracted from maybe from from what your neurosurgeons are doing what your thoughts are doing, but but but maybe somehow because well what I'm saying is like in some sense you're.

02:21:57

You can use it's been proven that you can use EG localization technology right where you're trying to plot where signals coming from before it triggers a dipole. You can that that can be very accurate. It's been shown by it with like with a DBS there's a study that maybe Frank wants to look this up and share it with us but there's a study where they where they compared the the the data with DPS and with with EG to see if EG localization was correct and it correlated correctly with where the signal was coming from in the thalamus as detected by.

02:22:32

The deep brain stimulation device. So even though we are only getting sort of like large-scale dipole activity it is with EG localization we can make predictions about where the information is coming from and it may be my maybe my brain could also sort of decode more information than from from you know from listening to.

02:22:59

The the changes in light and sound as my thoughts and feelings changed and and that is it's it's a really farad idea but and I don't know that you know, and then the other problems are like this all the noise right with the EG and sort of like yeah that's one of the reasons why I was interested in your setup because that's one of the problems that I've heard of when combining, you know, like a like at the art headset with with an AEG cap that there's quite a bit of noise interfering with the signal.

02:23:31

Well innocent in this situation back. Like in 2012 we were I had everyone be very very still so nobody was moving around because movement obviously is one of the things that causes lots of noise and that was just an LED glasses, but I did want to do an interview.

02:23:47

I wanted to recreate into VR and 2018 I did and so I what we did in the beginning was we I was hosting meetings where I just said, okay, this is what I want to do, let's talk about how we can do it and so I let these group meet ups and at first we talked about using the Open BC I had sent which is which is still a good idea.

02:24:05

We had one and but we needed to create 3D printed parts if we were gonna attach it to a vibe headset and and like I said, I kept running into people who were a neuroscientist who were laughing at the project because with VR you didn't like as soon as you're moving around the VR headset, you're making noise and it just doesn't make a lot of sense.

02:24:24

But we we kept on like from the very beginning people were telling us as it's gonna be too much noise. It's not but but we did it anyway, and and so we kept on so eventually, um, we realized that it was too hard to for us to do 3D printing because we didn't have the Enough.

02:24:40

Knowledge I didn't have the knowledge of 3d printing of how to do it and our 3d printers we every time we tried the the print would fail so around the middle of the year we eventually the another another group of folks bought a at the address space they bought oh it's called a brain doino EEG device brain do we know and folks can look that up if they want BRA and DUI NO.

02:25:06

It is you've most people have probably never heard of the brain do we know but it is um, there's a lot of this there's it's been documented on the noise bridge website so noisebridge dotnet has has a lot of information about the brains we know it's it's a very obscured device it's very cheap it's like the size of an Arduino board.

02:25:25

And it's I think it was 300 bucks or something. And it has. Like it. I think I think out of the box you can do like between two and four it can support either two or four electrodes we were doing two electrodes we had actually three electors but the middle electrode was just it was our.

02:25:53

It wasn't it wasn't to bring it was it had another job. I am. I'm for some reason. I'm blanking on on the the right name for it, oh gosh, it's some. But anyways, it wasn't bringing us signals it was just sort of like helping to to ground there's our grounding electrode and so anyway so we had so we had two electrodes we put them on the forehead the signals were measuring of course voltage detected at the at this surface of the skin and then the that would create that would the the the brain we know processing machine would turn that those that voltage into an array of.

02:26:39

That had hex values to represented that voltage and then we converted the hex values into. Numbers and we there was a. We brought a basically we created a server the original server was created in Python and the server would take those numbers and we we we were it was very easy to basically.

02:27:07

I think we ran one line of code and suddenly we had the the four year transform it's called the fast-forward transform just with it was like ready to go. I thanks to mint thanks to the work of of other people and and so we had the Fourier transform going and and we created a local host and and then we we broadcast the signals of really cases a website so we decided on a website to send the data to our webpage and we sent it to the webpage because web stars is.

02:27:43

Is usually it is is a. Usually run websites you don't actually have to run web certain webpage but but that's used that's the this is like the first place you would find webexars or webpage and I mean, ultimately it's a strawberry script and you can run it in a in a you could you could you could create a webex or application with like was like react native for example react native with it's called react to three fiber and so you don't have to use a you know, the web.

02:28:20

So to make it so to make long scripture we there's lots of discussions like well well because normally you know, if you fetch if you use a web a website to fetch information and you just like fetching one thing at a time right you're not fetching you we need to stream so we need to stream the the numbers that we're coming from the easy device into the website in real time and so we did that with the website and we brought those numbers into the into the web page and we we applied the four year transform a second time so I I'm always empty as to whether applying the four year transform the first time actually actually does anything because we really needed the Fourier transform on the on the client so in the inside the website itself so so we did it the second time yeah.

02:29:09

I'm that's just I'm a little vague on and whether or not applying the Fourier transform the first time meant anything in the end, but but yeah, so I'd like to I guess maybe I need to go back and I'd have to say that so so so. This was a team effort my contribution was mostly on the web XR side of things but also in terms of organizing the group every single week and and an organizing the discussions that allowed us to figure out all the different components of it, there are certain things that I what I what I don't know in terms of like are specifics related to you know, the the actual construction of the servers that we went through multiple incarnations with the servers and I did not write those and as far as why we needed a four-year transform in the server.

02:30:05

And also in the webpage. I'm that I don't understand but but I can answer a lot of questions in terms of the the web sourcode and and so the web is like the A-frames the client side code basically so is once we've brought once we were bringing the the stream of numbers into the webpage through a web socket from the brain we know because of our our server.

02:30:29

Then the question was okay, so what are we going to do with these numbers right we can see them in the console it's just a streaming numbers, okay, so here so here was one idea so as a we can we can put some shapes on the screen we'll generate a bunch of spheres and and we'll have the shapes move up and down.

02:30:49

And and this is what we did. I think if you look I I think it might be the video you see the one of the spheres but no I see the one with like the frames and I think you have different frequency bands represented for a stream of frames right yeah, so that was that was the later version of the project so in the in the beginning.

02:31:15

I guess I didn't like the video with the spheres here. But oh actually I did maybe I did so if you so if you search for so if you look right above the one of the frames I think there's a video a right above that so this video is one of the first results let me see if that works.

02:31:33

Hey and that takes you to it's like a Twitter link. I think. So well I saw a Twitter link where you have it like visualized underwater yeah yeah so so that visualization underwater is a bunch of spheres and that was our that was actually what our proof of that was our initial proof of concept so that was like the very first version of it that that underwater is actually just a really simple 360 sphere to static image it's like a 3d wrap around image super simple, but it may does make it look like it's under water which was fun and what you can notice in that video is that there's like you see this like the the just like, Massive slow down in the frame right because that is one thousand spheres it's it's it's two basically is I don't I don't think it's labeled at that point so it basically we had the two electrodes and each electrode was divided into five different frequency ranges that left and right alpha beta theta gamma delta and and then we had not only did they move up and down in sort of a times here, what is the time series it's a 3d time series and so they moved up and down basically so each incoming signal we assumed.

02:32:49

Numbers coming into the through the web socket and every time we got a new number we would use the number that we were getting to set the height of the sphere and the height would also determine the color of the sphere so there's always red on top there's always blue in the bottom you see that?

02:33:04

And but but it kept the program kept token because this machine that was running on was the Linux workstation that was extremely underpowered and and if you tried to run that in VR it was extremely slow and nauseous and so eventually I tried cubes and then I replaced the cubes with spheres and I got labels on it and in the video that has the planes on it that that video with people if people just arrived at this room, it's at VRMA dot IO.

02:33:36

And you can look look for a link to my bio but that video basically shows that you know at that point what I was showing off was that I had this like you could you could press on that's inside of this recorder from inside the Oculus, you know, that was inside the Lenovo Mirage solo and if you press the left or right on the controller.

02:33:53

You could you could turn left or right and that's what I'm showing off to the beginning and then you could click you could you have laser pointer so you could click on the bottom of the square on the bottom underneath and that would rotate the entire grid sort of like so you could see it like from another perspective and, And and then you could you could teleport you could help it around the environment by pressing on the the top actually I think it yeah, we pressing on the top of the the thumb pad and that would teleport you around and then you could.

02:34:30

You could walk over to the the side of it and see it from different angles and you could so so at this point people were walking inside a representation of their of their brain activity noise bridge and host like this was like the coolest thing and like nobody hardly any people ever noticed that we ever did this and it's no I think it's never been difficult duplicated but but the code is all is off is all on the web for free and so I have plans to basically so because functional nervous spectroscopy data, it can also sort of.

02:35:05

Can be read out as a time series you can bet you could basically unplug the EV data and plug in FMRI data, it's right not FM news data f and IRS data and individualize that as a time series another thing about this is that this was like pre. M so there's something that came to web XR basically like we were maxed with this is 200 the ones that plans is 200 different planes but what but and at that time that we're maxing out are like our frame rate because we you're trying to hit with a mobile head, so you're trying to hit like 60 frames per second or or maybe 72 frames per second so that the person use using the headset it has comfortable experience but there's a new way called it's called mesh instancing and with matching interesting instead of being limited to 200.

02:36:06

Frames I was instead of the instead of being limited to 200 objects. I could have like a million 1.2 million of these squares and make a really long time series and basically and and and still run it at you know, 90 frames per second maybe even you know, maybe even you know, think about making like a super amazing 3d.

02:36:32

Representation of your brain activity at 120 frames per second, but we were but here's the other thing is that um, you know, when you are saying we had to cut down the the sampling rate because the fact is that the amount of data that you can pull from. From the human brain with EEG is is like like that like it's just like this the sampling.

02:37:05

I guess the sampling rate we had with the brain doing a device with something like 250 samples per second or something like that. I'm not sure if I'm if I'm actually saying the right number but it was. Something it was it was it was some sort of situation where we had to like say okay, we're only gonna take like one out of every four of those samples like one like one like one-fourth the rate because our just our computer can't handle input that that much input that fast our webpage can't handle it and and our our or actually it's it's really I mean, it's I think it's less about the webpage and more about the the the renderer in the the the GPU that has to do the rendering on the on the, Either rendering by the VR headset itself if you're using an Oculus class, which is what people what we'd be using now.

02:37:59

Or if using a desktop here ahead of your headset, which is your desktop GPU, so so if you're using a desktop you can do a lot more rendering and maybe you could do a million. Planes with a desktop GPU with mesh into seeing with 250, you know, samples of your EEG signals with 128 electrodes or 256 electrodes simultaneously, but but I I would really like to do that and to see that but at it yes, so I don't but I have no idea if that is going to really.

02:38:44

An in terms of like how much would be pushing unlimited there, but anyway so much so you can get my code. You can see all the old code. Thank you very much. I'm following you now and so I'll definitely be in touch because this is something that we're definitely working on and we're working towards an actual intervention so you're you're knowledge is the greatly appreciated and I'll definitely be in touch okay, do you want to give it a coding for you head out it's it's just gethab.com / myco number one.

02:39:18

Great thank you. I'll check that out, okay. And hey Michael if the information overload here but let me click to quick questions that so I you mentioned 3d printing somewhere so well what you need to I didn't get the the contacts what what did you need the three to printing for?

02:39:45

I had something experience with those three printing so that's why I'm curious and also okay, you can can you like just quickly so. In a like summer, so you you say you said so there's a emotive like EET has that and you use it to do like VR I just wanted a short summary what was the what's the technology that you're you you're you're delivering or in the future.

02:40:20

All right so I as I mentioned that I use the email of headset with in 2012 with LED glasses in 2018. I used the brain do we know device which is a different EEG headset a different EG device it's not it's not the emotive and we and we will I also have a number of other devices like I do have an email and a an open BCI device and originally we try to use a 3d printer.

02:40:53

To attach the emotive sensors to the vive headset and and when we fail to do that, so one of my really smart friends is why don't you just use tape can I just?

02:41:15

As usually the case good. Yeah, but right around the same time we we the we the brain doino fell into our hands and we were able to to borrow that every week, so we just use that.

02:41:33

Okay, so since I have just a. One of the expo that I had aware of these has a better you can for example, there's they they they're value adding is proposal is that a some attention kind of correction so whatever so you are using EEG and in addition to your hands and others right so to do the brain as you see on human need computer interface.

02:42:08

I don't know why I wasn't able to sort of like grab your whole sentence, could you say it again? So. Better picture for what what what is the nature of the your your technology is a is is is what is the value what what is he what you're trying to to do right so so for me I had experiences of wearing one of the headset might say there's a company called and they are similar compensators there are many rights so Mario so they wear this, you know a band on the muscle so you can you know a few degrees freedom you see using EMT you can control a mouse or something right so without you place it or give a Your hands will be free to do other things right just that's for me.

02:42:57

I'm yeah, I think adding. What you could use freedom for a human to control the computer. It's a human computer interface type of thing. So for me, I mean from coming from that angle I'm trying to understand what you're proposing so apparently you're using the EEG and as well a digital set of controls in addition to hand, for example a mouse physical house.

02:43:23

And say, An integrated into VR and a R and detector drench and now it's not not not on so that was so I was not trying to use EEG to enable a control interface because the so there's a story like to I like to say when people say were you trying to use the EG to make a new kind of way to control something and there was a whole bunch of devices that came out before we did this project where they were.

02:44:01

Saying well you can use the EG to to control them a mouse on a computer or to float to float something, you know, you know, you can have mine to control with with with EG and in and these devices were cheap and they all sort of they were exciting for a little while and they all sort of faded from from public memory, but but is like Mio's.

02:44:24

That's right and welcome. Did you want to um, no I'm actually I was curious because I've been decided for physical medicine rehab which recently we use a lot of augmented assistive devices. And I've always been curious about the EMG site, but EEG as well. So, I remember I think Frank right was speaking before.

02:44:47

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I I know about the Mayo band that was made by a lab called The Lamic Labs Waterloo and I was hoping they would work on it, but I think they sold off the patterns to someone else and they worked on the north glasses. Now, I think Amazon a Google bought them over.

02:45:04

So because I was a great way to connect onto with VR right when you're on a VR space, it was a great way to like navigate using EMG but I was just curious to know what the EEG you you had. Sorry, go ahead. Okay so so so that so the way I saw it the problem with the EG was this.

02:45:28

If you are driving a car you you're you might have a lot of brain activity when you're learning to drive a car. But then as you get as you get because maybe because your brain is is is trying a whole bunch of different things. It doesn't yet know what which which micro and macro circuit patterns are going to be the right patterns that will enable you to to to drive so it's over your brains overthinking and there's two there's a lot of brain activity, but then when you get Really good at driving a car you requires a lot less visible brain activity, apparently if you're just some if you're just talking about medical imaging that the people who are really good at doing something have less way less brain activity than someone who's brand new at trying to learn how to do something and I don't know if there are exceptions to that but I think that's a like I don't know if Brandon or any or anyone else wants to say talk on that.

02:46:27

I think any time you're talking. Motor output is the end goal after you've learned that skill or that set of. Motor outputs and know how to string them together it kind of definitely less cortisol input likely just gets offloaded to motor control brain stem centers, if not the spinal cord on its own.

02:46:52

Okay yeah so um right so the so the story of that is like if you get really good at controlling the the means headset and this is so funny then um, then you're your brains is okay, well I'm gonna you don't need this much brain activity anymore. I'm just gonna have your I'm just gonna create a pattern and and and your spine is gonna remember that this pattern and now the pattern will come from your spine when it needs to come or something like that, but anyway in in the idea here is that as soon as you get good at controlling the muse it.

02:47:27

The eye you're the brand activity decreases and so the reason you were able to control it the muse is because you're creating a certain amount of activity that the muse was able to recognize a certain amplitude of of dipole activity perhaps and but now that that activity is no longer happening there's no longer happening at that scale or no longer happening in that place it's it's not really it's not if that there's the ability for the news to continue to detect it is is diminished so like the better you get at using the muse the harder it gets to use the muse you can see the same and so that paradigm.

02:48:02

Is why I was like using EEG to control stuff no that's just like that's bad thinking that's um, it's just not going to anyway so so that was my hypothesis and decided what I want to do instead is is I want to allow people to just passively view a reflection of their brain activity that was our goal I wanted to create like a meditative state so people could just meditate on on what their right activity was not on trying to do anything and and just to maybe under maybe to sort of.

02:48:37

Have this introspective expansiveness of their awareness about you know, making making their own connections between their own thoughts and feelings and and the the the changes in in brain activity that they were seeing in our program those visualizing the that brain activity, that's what I was thinking and so that was a what that is up meant to be a passive experience now what we did notice was that people would often have these the more they paid attention in this program.

02:49:12

The more that to what was happening the more that they're they're they're beta waves would rise up high and the beta waves are a certain frequency range it's usually often associated with with you know, if you have a cup of coffee, if you're really paying attention if you're really concentrating sometimes you're beta waves might might be more active and guess in some studies, it can be other brain waves but and in our in our particular case, it was beta waves and, So we would tell people yeah, that's because we really pay attention.

02:49:42

But it is a. It's a. Yeah it's a the I mean there's a lot there's a lot of stuff that is unclear in terms of like I really don't understand how much noise was playing a factor into our signals, we had noise cancellation programs hardware noise cancellation programs and software noise cancellation programs, and and but it's it's just as I I don't have an a fine-grained enough knowledge of the system to really understand how much noise was affecting our results or not in every in a really detailed way.

02:50:20

So I instead of trying. To solve that there and then with with our primitive equipment we just said well we've got a perfect concept and it's cool and that's where we're gonna leave the project and that's where we left it. See so. The most recent has it. So in that case, we were using two electrodes at the brain doing a device and went in 2012.

02:50:48

I was using the 14 electrodes of the end of the of the mode of device. So the your gradually reducing it's not increasing that's surprising. I saw you you need more. So it it's it's really it was it was really just a perfect concept. I the next the next thing that I've been planning is to to do basically the same thing but with a different kind of sensor what is called a near sensor functional.

02:51:22

Near for a spectroscopy or light or basically. Instead of voltage we're talking about imaging the brain with light within forward light. Sorry imaging the brain with infrared light, but what does it penetrate to though? Is it through this gull? Yeah, it goes it goes through the score. So you're shot you're sharing red light through the skull and and you have you put two basically two sensor transmitters on on this person's head and one of them transmit the light and the other receives the light and you calculate the the the basically you you calculate the like a sort of like banana.

02:52:08

Shape for the path of light based upon the the intensity of the transmission you're might be misting this but it's it's some like you can you can send the light deeper you can send it. You can it's but but what I'm saying is like there's a there's you can estimate the curve that light is traveling between one sensor between the center of the space station IRS.

02:52:37

Yes, that's right. Okay. And so there's many different categories of light imaging but but F n is the most it's like the most.

02:52:48

Maybe the most common and maybe like the bottom here but but the potential of f nurse is you know, like you know like you is is great there's also HD dot HD dash doT, it's another cool thing there's this company called open water that is is so again, they're they're using f mirrors and they're using ultrasound and they're they're using they're doing holography, so when you try and when you try and light through the brain so our brains are.

02:53:23

Our brains and our bodies are basically two infrared light, they're basically transparent they're basically as transparent as jellyfish to infrared light so light just passes red light passes through the human body, and but it will fly it refracts a lot so it's so it it scatters right and but if you can if you could accurately reverse the refraction of the light, then then you're doing the the exact thing that that is holography that it holography is the reversion that reversing the reflection of Light and producing an image from from that reversal of light scattering and so with that technology you could recreate extremely detailed images of the human body, especially if you have a very fast and very big camera sensor or CMOS chip and so and and if you like you could use you can use ultrasound to also extend the depth of the of the lights and, I I wrote about this no no I'm saying that I wrote a you wouldn't recommend it.

02:54:43

You have to be very careful with the ultrasound. Brain. But as long as you're okay with whether you're just to make sure the frequencies that's all I'm not familiar with the frequency numbers, but I'm sure. Of you. Yeah, I mean to to your point you can use ultrasound to do surgery it's as it can be a scalpel it can be extremely dangerous, so right?

02:55:06

But if you but if you're if you are if you're doing things exactly right like using the exact frequency of ultra ultrasound you can instead of cutting in there on you can just stimulate it you could just make it fire.

02:55:23

At least that's whatever this is what I've heard. I haven't I've never done that but um but I mean, I guess a similar concept to to to to making a neuron fire with optogenetics or or making a neuron fire with them neural dust or or or with a lot of electrical stimulants so and so so the idea and so that but the question is like, okay, well how can we see a neuron firing if we're not measuring electrical activity?

02:55:51

And so but it turns out that neurons what I learned and I interviewed this guy on in a podcast that I did and he was he's a I I've entered interview multiple people who do imaging with with light and he was saying that I what I learned is that neurons do you change shape when they fire they expand and contract and, And and you know and when they fire of course the the they they use up oxygen and and ATP and I guess oxygen and glucose and ATP but anyway they need but then blood flows right blend blood has to go and bring new oxygen and and so these different these changes are are the kinds of things that you would be able to to detect if you had if you had some.

02:56:47

If we're talking about imaging with with light and basically, you know, reversing the reflection of the light or decoding the the spectrum of light that is as changing as light moves from one cent as moves from the transmitter to the center and so the potential basically was merul's absence technology is to go extremely deep into the brain maybe maybe all the way to the thalamus and to actually see you know, if it's fast enough if it's like laser.

02:57:22

Fast maybe it we could see neurons firing and real time but whether it's fast enough is a big question, you know MRI is a way too slow to see neurons firing in real time right but but um, but but yeah, so that would be that would be profound because because you know right now if you want us if you want to know if a neuron fired you have to be like really close to that neuron.

02:57:43

Because because the the electrical signal has a very short range right the actual action potential of it so I mean you could figure out if you I mean, if you're gonna know in real time like you could figure out with EG localization where I say don't came from but but but not in real time right so so that that that's really interesting is it so it's because we have with neural length as this technology that there's no there's nothing else that comes close to the resolution.

02:58:18

Or this the speed and the resolution and the amount of information combined. I mean, you can you can like I said, you can stick lectures in the brain but you don't have you're not getting as much data as you're getting within something like nearly link which is which is which is sticking electrodes in the brain but it's just it's sticking a lot more and it's in there a lot smaller and it's it's a it's just it's it's better and it's generations better than then then something like Utah array or DBS, it's just it's just a massive leap forward, but what it's just really.

02:58:53

Interesting. Taking that potentially someday we may also do this wirelessly. This basically collects the same amount of data that we're collecting with our link. I'm not invasively with with holography and and functional narrative spectroscopy and an ultrasound. And that includes doing closed loop therapies. And in right in like, you know, when you know, I believe that that I think was max type mark that the guy who is leading the neural ink project that he.

02:59:29

I believe he said something like there is no other possible way to to detect a neuron firing in real time, unless you're gonna stick an electro like right up next to it. Like you just can't do it from outside the brain but but but I think you can. If you if you can do holography, you can reverse the reflection of light and you can do that process it laser speed, you know, if you can do it as fast as I you know, 200 times faster than MRI or something like that, but but so maybe so 20 to maybe 20 years from now you have a you have a device that can do exactly what nearly does.

03:00:04

But but you just but it's outside your brain. It's outside your school. I'll pause. So, for example, there are so many connections. Negotiable. You try to to inverse transform on that because there's so much detail they need to worry about. Z is that you can help them. We say again, sorry.

03:00:43

Oh my god, let you take that but I gotta head out it is a touchpad midnight here and I need to be in the lab far too early tomorrow. All right, thanks for thinking. I definitely for coming great. It's really good. I appreciate it. Thanks everybody for hanging out, listen and contributing.

03:00:58

Hopefully, you'll talk to you guys again soon. Thanks great like a, Yeah, great. So the room continues for folks who are staying. Sorry about that. So are you staying Hammond if you want to I've got I've got pink to another area with a buyer friend, so I've got a quickly drop by I'll drop by once in and out.

03:01:20

Sounds good. Okay, all right. So let me see if we want to invite.

03:01:32

See you so it's not the question that you you presented is a fascinating intriguing matter. I'm a little bit obvious that you're asking of 20 years. I think for this I mean the you know, just see the number of mobile prices came out just you know, it's it's all medicine Noble Prize now be a physics or it's all related to imaging and you know ways of providing tools to study biology if I mean that's hers.

03:02:07

We're praying and neuroscience falling rain is still field so you you mentioned various techniques like ultrasound and infrared and also laser maybe so. Apparently the the time scale we wanted to do it. Without a 90 day set price were also as high as faster and better resolution apparently that's the challenges in school so your estimate is that a right now what's what's your take on what if you take one what would be so you there's also another clarification you mentioned something HTT dot.

03:03:00

I didn't catch up so. I mean, so if you look up if you do if your researcher topic of imaging with light, there's many different methods and so if you look up HD dash dot there's there's a imaging technique about imaging technique that is called hd-dot which is a which some people claim as advantages over over affiners, but you'd have to research that for yourself.

03:03:34

Okay so shorthand for high density is used optical thermography for image income thank you and also what's your picnic what was your so you you mentioned so for me. I mean, hmm my gut feeling instead of for ultrasound this a mechanic mechanical signal would be slower than a light electromagnetic signals right, so they don't still depends on the the subject.

03:04:09

We're studying the potentiation of neurons they go both ways right so this is what's your take on I'm not sure here but the future what if what is them, what's the one of the if you pick one what will be me using will be pet the best. I mean ways to.

03:04:31

What's my favorite like tech like neuroimaging technology is that that's the question. Yes, yes you mentioned a few yeah. Um, well, I mean, it's a bit like but I think it's it's like it's a little bit a.

03:04:50

Um,

03:04:55

I mean, I guess I guess your question is a little bit like betting on horses like bidding on companies right and do I like you know, the the approach that the neuralink folks are taking more or the person open waters taking more um, but I but I think that.

03:05:09

I. That it's not of it's it's really like the way I see it is it's a we've got different tools we've got different tools and it's like it's like it's for the service for me. I don't I'm not sort of thinking of in terms of like bidding on horses.

03:05:24

I'm thinking in terms of of we've got you know, you could do surgery with with with the scalpel or you could do surgery with. That that involves deep learning you can do surgery with a microsurgery robot and does the surgery for you you just have to approve the surgery ahead of time if you're a neurosurgeon.

03:05:44

I there's yes, so I'm just looking to think about as different tools in the toolbox and and that sense there's not I don't really see a competition here but go ahead to Kyle if you want.

03:06:00

So for up to so obviously optical imaging is a possibility, but what about for stimulation? Other than. Maybe introducing chemicals that are photoreceptive to allow for stimulation are there optical techniques that can direct the stimulate with high precision so that's probably a big barrier it's been solved but you know, it's been solved so they approached that that talks about often in her talks that you can find on YouTube is that she's going to use ultrasound to stimulate the brain ultrasound can can do all the stimulation as necessary.

03:06:45

Like what kind of precision like can you get down to the neutral transmitter level specific synapses? Um, I don't know if it gets down to the neurotransmitter level but but I think it gets down to the neuron level. I some yeah you've reached every scenario of my knowledge and a little bit grey on but but but I believe but what I do think I know is that it's it goes down to the neuron level as far as whether it goes down below the neuron level.

03:07:18

I have to have to find out. How to do some more research. This is just using ultrasound and being forming to kind of stimulate the action potentials right so um, so actually why don't we just look this up while let's look up they precision. The precision of ultrasound.

03:07:45

So um this the investigative three ultrasound system achieves an intramodal accuracy of one millimeter braidedly. And a controlled laboratory setting. So this identified systematic and random errors required and an optical cleaner tumor volume. To planning the target volume margin of about three millimeters.

03:08:09

So okay, so let's consider that. Okay, so what so let's actually look at the lookup what is the size of the?

03:08:27

Vesicle. Because so. Hmm exercises, what is this so I guess we're talking about. 30 to 100 no okay, so actually what is a so let's okay, let's look over the size of a neuron first of all. Just for memory, so we're talking about a neuron can range from four microns to one hundred microns.

03:09:03

So it's at like the multineral resolution. And yeah, okay, so see let's see if okay, this is looking can't I'm gonna say can can it a neuron. Be stimulated. With ultrasound.

03:09:25

So focus ultrasound excites action potential firing in mammalian, peripheral neurons and intact tissue ultrasound neuromodulation. Huh, so I guess let's look at the doctors believe that their system can serve the powerful tool and study effects of ultrasound on neurons and brain surgeons somebody okay, so we got new listener but um yeah, so if just and they took off so let's look at this real quick, um, A review of results mechanisms of safety.

03:09:56

So ultrasonic neuromodulation is rapidly growing field this paper is stated 2019, so the review summarizes findings. The which US mechanically interacts with which the mechanisms by which US mechanically interacts with neurons and and could affect firing or presented so okay, so this paper if you want to look it up.

03:10:19

I just actually I just Googled cannon neuron be simulated with ultrasound and yielded like, A lot of cool papers and so if you wanted to do that but I found a paper called ultrasound neuromodulation a review of results mechanisms and safety and I think that that's something that you would want to look at Kyle but um, But that might not answer 
the question you had.

03:10:53

Thanks for googling that for me fair. I was just curious, though. Now but I've been interested in optical imaging techniques and I'm trying to kind of. You know, tend to actually a little bit but. It's a stimulation side, which is still the most difficult part. She should comparing neuralink to optical imaging techniques, that's that's one advantage that it has.

03:11:20

It's still not down at the resolution of individual neurons with synapse of this but well. Okay, but so the thing is like there's a big limitation now for for for neural length though, is that you you can only stimulate something that that these. Through the electrode right based on where the electrode is whereas let's say that you're let's say that you are analyzing large-scale brain activity with 10,000 different electrodes, but your computer modeling suggests that the ideal place to stimulate the brain in order to create the response that you want is far away from where your lectures are implanted.

03:12:04

Well in that case you that you might want to use ultrasound tissue to do to stimulate the, The neurons that you want to stimulate instead of using your electrodes to do the simulation. So and and and going back to what Frank's point in terms of like which which which which tools gonna win.

03:12:24

I I think people will use both tools actually.

03:12:33

I I expect future neuroscientists to combine both tools, basically.

03:12:41

So for a long time I was saying I'm thinking more kind of the nanotech side will probably win. Once we can figure out how to grow kind of a neural mesh within the brain. I think that will be the killer solution. Grow under a mesh. Yeah, so you can think of a engineered.

03:13:07

Cell basically that can just inject it and it will grow whatever structure we need. This is this is definitely like 50 years out, but. I think that is the kind of holy grail because then you can basically have a secondary neural network. Alongside. Our own neurons and do whatever we need with that known network.

03:13:35

It can keep you in corporate processing before it leaves the brain through whatever interface we have. And then it can be targeted throughout the brain. So, have you ever read the the novels by science fiction author? He created the Nexus series.

03:14:02

His name is a Ramez. Nom. And so in the next series novels, it's a trilogy Nexus trilogy. He there's a neural device that he that people inject called Nexus and it's a bunch of nanopets a bunch of nano machines. And an animite machines will float through your blood and and then they'll get into your brain that's how how they do that is is that well I okay so well, I'm not gonna try to answer that science fiction right but but so they'll though they'll get into your brain and they'll attach themselves to neurons and and then they'll begin to create a wireless the begin to create a wireless connection that between reading your neurons and stimulating your neurons and in sending that information wirelessly to other people.

03:14:58

Who have an access and it creates a telepathic communication between yourself and and and everyone else around you in a local area like a mesh network who's connected to Nexus and so you so as you walk through crowds of people who are also injected with Nexus everybody's sharing each other's feelings and thoughts and this is a yeah, I mean the cop house is so.

03:15:28

Making another correction process. Mine yeah so if you want if you really want to geek out and cool next generation ideas, he's he's I think his books are up there with like, um, you know with like William Gibson's novels with them like the matrix and we're just like we're just waiting for someone to create like the equivalent of the matrix films but based on the the Rama's nom novels and X's novels.

03:16:01

And it hasn't happened yet, but it's it's bound to happen eventually. Yeah, thanks for that. I'll attitude another thought I've had kind of as a precursor to that would be.

03:16:20

Kind of implanting. Maybe a combination of electrical and magnetic stimulators like a high resolution kind of fabric.

03:16:33

It's kind of wrap your brain. And use kind of low power.

03:16:41

Basically microwaves magnetic fields electrical fields to to do that kind of stimulation and it could also be useful for sensing as well.

03:16:57

But again suggest a crazy idea. I don't know if anybody's trying that. I'm waiting would you say that again microwaves what? So you can imagine.

03:17:13

Remember what the the membrane is, but get within the membrane in casing the brain and so you have like a fabric. Fully encompassing the brain or encompassing enough of the brain that you can use.

03:17:28

Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.

03:17:52

I love you said that you're describing project that exists so if you go to if you're rocksa.com that is called a few rocks. To f u r a x a and that is furoxetine microwave imaging. And yeah so super cool idea um, but it is it's like one of the best is one of the coolest ideas.

03:18:18

I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?

03:18:40

I've actually five you can cleared HD dot and and there's more so there's one that you can and there's you can so a long time ago people were trying to prevent people from from having their arteries collapse and so they they invented this stent that you you insert this thing into your drug dealer and you put it you know somewhere in your heart and then then when you pull it out expands and keeps your blood vessel open.

03:19:09

Well somebody had the bright idea to put electrodes in that stent and they invented stent road which is like so now you can stick a you stick extent road basically into your jugular into your arm and push it up into your brain above your motor cortex above your motor strip.

03:19:28

I mean and and and when it gets to the the vein above your motor strip, you you pull it out and it expands and to allow maximum blood flow so you won't ever have to worry about a stroke in that particular area, but but I mean, I guess well, I guess it could be blocked but it's like Mac.

03:19:44

It's like the maximum it's pushy it's pulling up in your your vein but the point is it's not to pull up pull up in your vein to the maximum extent because really it's about putting electrodes up there and so without brain surgery you can put you can basically have the the same kind of like electrode array that you might have with with the eCog or with with brain gate if you look a brain gate you can you can do that without brain surgery with dense road which is so cool, it's like like people at home could make 
their own stem throat and without brain surgery as cool.

03:20:19

But it's really like I mean, I wouldn't do that if I were you it's like let the doctors do it.

03:20:27

Are you the one talking about brain games yesterday or the day before? It came up because we had we had one of the people who worked on BrainGate with us yesterday. So there was I was involved with the win a conversation where somebody else was talking about their work on brain gate.

03:20:48

Yeah that electrode idea that's that's really cool. It's close to to what I was thinking for.

03:20:57

More than nanotech side. But still you're gonna be stuck within the blood vessels. I mean, you can get pretty close.

03:21:12

I just I just really think we need to get down to like neuron synapse levels stimulation to really get some of the. Crazier ideas working like being able to do like ARVR. For a brain interface. I don't think we can get there with this kind of multi-neuron stimulation. Um, so I mean without with that disagreeing with you, um, so okay, so there's a study that came out where they showed that.

03:21:43

So, you know with what you can get with EG is pretty limited, right? But you can do you can see something if you have if you have a lot of electrodes you can do something called EEG source localization. That is the exact phrase. Look up EEG source localization. And and so they had someone had a someone had a like I think it was like a DBS and plant which can not only stimulate your brain.

03:22:07

It can also read and so it was able to basically collect data near a person's personal stylist and that person and they were using they're using EG and AP cap at the same time and they and they they did EG source localization to figure out where the signals were coming from and some of the signals were coming from the thalamus and they were able to prove.

03:22:34

That the EEG source localization was actually correct by comparing it to to the data that they were detecting with the deep brains with DBS device the deeper into simulation device. And so, so what that means though is that. Is that even from outside the brain you can figure out where signals are coming from.

03:22:59

And if you have if you have stem trode in your brain, if you have you know, you're then the quality of signals is much better. That night you're talking like eCog level quality of signals. And even though that's not next to your to your neurons to measure their firing in real time, which is the holy grail of this is what neuron cares about.

03:23:20

Even then you can sort of like use that technology if you if you had you know, maybe maybe. You can bond. I am extendroid if you had multiple stentroads in multiple locations in multiple blood vessels and you also had like EG you could get really precise about where your brain activity was was coming from like really precise depending on how many sensors you could put in there then.

03:23:52

Then so let's leave aside, you know, stimulating the brain electronically right and and just think about stimulating the brain by stimulating your your from outside so so you know for one, you know your eyes, you know every with a VR headset you just a whole lot of brand simulation coming in from your eyes right that's taken up like two thirds of your brain activity.

03:24:18

I guess so that's that's that's number one so VR is like the probably like it might be more it might be easier to stimulate your brain with. With through your eyes and then through direct brain stimulation right yeah and this is this is a weird idea but like for for what what we could find out is that even is that you you put all you put ten thousand electrodes in a human being with neural link and and you could stimulate the brain directly through ten thousand different electrode simultaneously, but you 
might but we might find out that the the highest bandwidth way to stimulate the brain is still through the eyes through through like VR that's a weird idea, but maybe because maybe like because the evolution.

03:25:02

Just adapted the brain to to to have this like high bandwidth port and it's high bandwidth path and that just works best it's a weird hypothesis, but but I think it hasn't been I don't know what the argument against it yet that disproves that so I don't know. But it is true and also at the cortical level you really can't get down you can't reuse the brain's own visual system to decode the signals.

03:25:37

So you know at the cortical level that kind of stimulates you might be able to say there's like some kind of objects in this part of your field of vision. But you can't stimulate it down kind of at the pixel level to get really high resolution. Images through through brain stimulation.

03:25:57

I've always thought that's. We really need to get into kind of spinal column. If we can stimulate at the spinal column level before our brain actually starts interpreting the signals, it's probably a much better option for high precision control over the signals that are going in. The agree. I'm the so that I at my my hypothesis is consistent with that and then in terms of you know, in terms of what I've in terms of what I've.

03:26:34

Studied there's this there's an example of of two girls who their brains are connected, they're they're twins they're born with their brains, like physically connected their schools are are connected right and they're they're specific connected by the the thalamus and there were news reports that these girls could see through each other's eyes, you could show a card to one girl and the other one would know what the other girl was seeing if she she closed her eyes and thought about.

03:27:09

It and so the idea there was that that they were because their brains were connected via the thalamus and the thalamus is where your where your your your senses travel through the thalamus including, you know, your your your visual cortex your audio cortex. I mean your eyes and your ears and your your and and your somatosensory cortex your sense of touch and your taste, they all tried those senses travel through the through that.

03:27:44

Elements through the brain stem and and then they go into the cortex and in the end and I've also heard that the, That that there's five pathways that the the olfactory bulb travels into the brain and one of those pathways goes through part of the one of the five pathways that the the olfactory bulb travels that it does actually go through the thalamus but the other four the other forty not so you often hear that oh the olfactory the smell doesn't go through town as well part of it does and little known 
fact part of it does and so so the idea here is that if you're going to.

03:28:26

Implant information into someone else's brain like something like an image, maybe the brain stem is calcane is a as a potential target to try. But we need a lot more research to to validate that. And I so I mean, I'm not like in just like I'm not for sure why Kyle saying we we could not stimulate Michael columns directly to to to create images.

03:29:02

I what I would think is that we haven't figured is that is that we have we we don't have a study yet there's been published showing that that has been figured out but but I don't want to use the word we can't it can't be done because maybe maybe it can and in the right way to do that, it hasn't been figured out yet.

03:29:23

It's just I'm based on my understanding and this is I'm not a neuroscientist at all. I'm coming more from the artificial neural networks side. It's that at that level it's already so abstracted from the raw signals. That. You know, maybe there's particular neurons or particular clusters of neurons that you can trigger for particular objects.

03:29:54

Or particular, you know patterns or something like that, but. It's it's so far removed from the raw signal coming in from the from the optical nerve and again there's even more processing going from the retina all the way through.

03:30:13

That I think you'd end up needing so many electrodes. To kind of. You know, it's like each electrode will control one particular object that you can sense in your visual field not necessary controlling particular pixels to kind of have like an overlay. That that's my hypothesis at least. So the other thing about that is um, so I mean, yeah, I mean, I think I was I think I was a hundred percent an agreement with you about five years ago, but um, but since then it's kind of like, I think that so I mean the the deal 
with actually really was a really four years ago.

03:30:56

So really since so 2017 was when Jeff Hawkings was released his his first paper on how how micro how his theory of micro columns how they basically how sorry just columns columns in the neural network how they can organize functionality of the brain. And so it's 2017 when I read that and that's when I sort of, This sort of like really messed up the picture quite a bit because yeah, I mean, like I said, the girls were connected by the thalamus and maybe that was the clue to how you could transmit 
images from one part of the brain to another but then but then um, but but the thing is like well, so maybe a neuro a single neural column is organizing the the information of you know, combining basically the many different modalities and what you might have is many neural columns doing a similar operation at the same time so many many.

03:31:55

Columns that are sort of basically trying to to do this sort of duplicate multimodal process where they're combining visual information with audio information with somatic sensory information to touch feeling inside and all of your senses when you're touching a phone when you're holding a phone how far is from you it was the phone orientation.

03:32:14

And so you have one or many probably many more neural columns that are tracking this phones activity, but you've got at least one and one neural columnist doing it at least one. And and then and so they, Can in summary the you know, so there's maybe lots of different representations happening but they can but what's similar between these representations allows the sort of the brain to to vote and what's different allows the brain to and eliminate the the incorrect analysis and so then it can be like reduced and and so to make a long story short, it's like, The ability to change someone's perception of reality it might might come down to figuring out which microcomms are relevant at that particular moment in time and manipulating them and that operation might be might be a lot less work if we can figure out exactly how that works and exactly how to how to locate.

03:33:26

The activity and identify the activity correctly in and what and what it's going to take to to manipulate this system so I have to say that and but here's here's the reason is because in general the the thalamus is a lot harder to reach then the neocortex and so if we can modify part of the neocortex that effectively does what we want to achieve by modifying the thalamus then maybe that's a an easier way to to.

03:34:01

Accomplish the same goal. And and and more to the point that the the activity between the thalamus and the in the neocortex is especially I mean, it's between the thalamus and this and the in the the primary sensory and neocortex so the that I'm talking about the the visual.

03:34:25

The the visual cortex audio cortex on the somatosensory cortex the primary sensor cortex and the thalamus is like it's like this it's like it's like feedback loops it's like, um, you know, lots of like multi-layers of feedback loops feed up feedback loops between every layer of of the of the visual cortex we want to be to be three virt and each one of those communicating to thalamus and each one communicating with each other and and so there's so much like it's so much like traffic going in every 
different direction that that.

03:35:00

It's it's so so here's what here's I think it's like imagine that the feedback looked really is like one big circle right and the big circle is passing the data around in a circle all the times oscillation of this of this information traveling on a big circle and do we need to intercept that circle at the timeless or can we just really intercept that circle anywhere maybe closer to the surface of the brain, that's what I'm saying, do you know, you're not saying?

03:35:34

Yeah, that makes sense, oh. But again that all sounds like a recurrent donor networks to me and so you might be getting time lag you might be getting. You know at the higher level in living in your cortex. So much feature processing has already occurred as this bill has a signals have gone through that loop.

03:35:58

I just being difficult. To target like I just want to have a blue pixel at this point individual field. Like to get that kind of resolution. I think we need to go deeper we need to go at least to the thalamus and possibly like you said going all the way back up to the eyes, maybe not.

03:36:22

Like I'm just thinking like how do we do it without having to have goggles on or any kind of external stimulus? Um, so if there's anything I can tap into the optic art of directly. Stimulated that but that point that's probably the most effective. But then I want to live in the matrix so.

03:36:46

Having something deeper in the brain that can stimulate everything would be great, so have you read about bi-directional recurrent networks recurrent neural networks?

03:36:59

I have not. All right. So it's it's an interesting topic so so so how it's so maybe you can talk a little bit about well, how is a recurrent neural network similar to the brain and all that. I'm going to bidirectional no networks. So typical darkest, you know, our networks our feed forward the kind of stuff that they're doing with deep learning and most recurrent owner it works these days well typical neural networks are feed forward you have an input layer and everything just kind of.

03:37:38

Pushes all the way through to the output layer with deep learning you just have a whole bunch of layers recurrent no networks have backlinks, so you're taking signals. That have already gone through processing through various layers and feeding them backwards and that's it's commonly used for. It gives a sense of memory because essentially signals can be repeated and loop around in the brain and.

03:38:10

Typically in recurrent neural networks, you've got to repeatedly stimulates repeatedly activate the input layers to get a. Before you get a stable output so that you get the signal to kind of loop around a few times before all the neurons on the output layer kind of stabilized.

03:38:34

That's typically how it's done on the artificial internet work side.

03:38:41

Okay, um, hang on I am just. So so yeah so that so there's this idea of you know, I brought this up in a discussion with some some really great neuroscientists and I said well is it the case that you have like information flying from the thalamus to the bottom layer of the?

03:39:03

Of the neocortex and you know and then up to the top layer the neocortex and then back to the thalamus sort of like in a big and a big loop right from the bottom to the top and. And and so there's like the cycle right there's like because it's people are still trying to understand exactly how well understand what what exactly a biologically possible version of back propagation would be there's a lot of ideas but it's still I think it's still an area of a research interest and I don't know do you want to comment 
on that specifically before I continue or?

03:39:44

Date all right so um, so then we have but then we have so a bidirectional recurrent neural network or a you can also do a bidirectional LSTM. Basically it's like it's like okay so like you um when you really people should like you know search look on local look on the web and look us up, but just just imagine there's just imagine like if you take if you took the input right and you just and use and you sent it into two different directions at the same time into two different neural networks right and and I think 
that may have been like the beginning like the like the the the genesis of the idea was like, okay, well what if we played with the structure of where stuff is going a little bit for it, well, what if we sent it in two different directions like, Four four states and backward states and process the input in in multiple different directions and and so yeah, it's um, I'm looking at a Wikipedia article right now called bidirectional actually it's not a Wikipedia art but it's an article called bidirectional recurrent neural network be iron and training system and it implements forward past algorithm and a backward pass algorithm at the same time.

03:41:06

And so but so here so so I was sharing this idea with with these neuroscientists and and is really great neuroscientists and and they. And they I guess they didn't knock it down, but they but they they took it up a notch because it's kind of like it's kind of like you have.

03:41:31

Like and so like a neuros so like a neuro like imagine like a neuro column is just like any radical like it like like everywhere in the brain in the neocortex the top two thirds of your brain isn't but neocortex specifically it's like the same repeating algorithm it's the same thing same pattern just repeat over and over again individual cortex and an audio cortex and the and the postpartal cortex everywhere same repeating pattern, but so you pick one particular neural column anywhere in the brain.

03:42:00

And um, it is receiving. Inputs from every direction from below from above from the left from the right from the front from the back from every direction right now so that so that so just like imagine you have to create a neural network now okay where where it's not receiving inputs from one direction and and pushing outputs to another direction it's receiving inputs from every direction and pushing outputs in every direction the system.

03:42:34

I'm saying like this is weird, this is weird, this is weird weird but it's, It's like yeah, so that's what you just kind of what you have to think about in terms of like it's not just like recurrent known that work it's it is it's it's like next something next level and but yeah, so I just wanted to hear that.

03:42:57

That's cool. So it looks like BRNNs are more like evolution of the typical single hidden layer perceptron.

03:43:11

And what I've been thinking when I think of recurring our work is like the modern ones, it's like you said like LSTM's deep deep neural networks where you have those kind of backlinks going across layers, but I agree with you that's biological neural networks are way way way more complicated than anything wears push simulating with artificial doughnuts, but they're also super cool.

03:43:37

I mean, it is like the brain is truly a 3d neural network because it because it's processing information and in in, At least six degrees of this is better to think of that as a neural graph. Like yeah from my research like maybe some of the the, Well you have dendrites like basically go across the entire brain like extremely long connections between disparate parts of the brain, so it's not just that they're communicating with it's not like a column is just communicating with columns next to it, they can be 
communicating with a column on the other side of the brain and it's incredibly difficult to.

03:44:22

To simulate that I mean, I it's definitely no algorithms that the training that works like that right now. No. I mean look, we don't have we don't have the my understanding is that even even creating of of a model of the brain that's completely functional it's just beyond the computational capacity of appears today and we may not approach that you know before 2050 or 260 or maybe even later if we're really depending on the level of detail we really need.

03:45:00

A great which is unfortunate.

03:45:07

Have you studied it all on your like the the quantum theories? For neural activity. I have I have sure let's let's talk about them what it is, what's your what's your interest there? I mean just getting into like are we even simulating the right things or trying to simulate a brain looking at the structure?

03:45:29

Because I. This is what I've seen and. I mean individual neurons are basically entire chemical computers and ended up in and of themselves. And by whatever mechanisms they're using they're possibly using quantum techniques or that they operate at the level of individual molecules and could be subject to some quantum processes.

03:45:56

And so even if we were able to simulate. You know, this trillion node neural graph. We would be missing the quantum element. With an individual notes individual neurons. Okay so so it it gets even worse than that because it seems like you know with with a short-term memory we need to model the we need to model things like whether receptors are in the NMDA receptors or open or closed between different neurons because it because that is something that changes very fast in real time.

03:46:42

As you're in at the short-term memory range and then the long-term memory is whether they're actually are you know connections at all so that synapses can form between different neurons. I mean, that's part of it this is I'm maybe if that's not the whole thing, but um. I may have okay, go ahead and would you I lost my train of thought let me pause.

03:47:09

I'll pause. There's a paper or article. I read one of the last couple years that's found that there was a differential activation at different synapses within a single neuron. And like that's a level of simulation that I don't think it's really been considered. I still very recently was so the you were artificial in order for models.

03:47:41

So what? Neuron is an individual. Kind of analog computer. That can selectively stimulate particular axon or? Particular synapses. Like we are very far away from simulating actual biological neural activity. So without. So there's too many things that I would need to say about that, but to sort of like what I mean by just focus on one part of that is that is that is absolutely the case that single that.

03:48:20

That synaptic connections or receptors are being modified at the single neuron level at this at the speed of thought. That is that is the actual truth. And the NMDA receptors are being created in being destroyed and being blocked or inhibited in real time at the speed of thought. This is this is this is a witness is actually part of the, A thing that happens and happens at the single neuron level.

03:48:54

Now the there's there are arguments and evidence that the single neurons are self-regulating and that's not that it's not controversial at all and there's also arguments and evidence that that single neurons are actually being regulated by other neurons. And that's also not controversial both things are happening and this is you know in the in yeah,

03:49:29

I think we're in agreement that it's very complex. So, welcome David you've been listening for a while, but what do you think? I love this stuff. I am just learning because you guys are the experts that of course he gets me thinking. It gets me thinking so I think Kyle said something about Quantum so that possibly and if you could elaborate more on what you guys know or what the science says or it doesn't say about how the brain works and how that gets down into the I guess through the 
biochemistry potentially to the quantum.

03:50:12

Physics thing you guys will everyone. There's been a lot that's been there's been speculated about quantum effects into brain. You know from like I guess the the most well-known. Research is sort of you it's a so there's the I want to say that that the, There's this weird sort of thing going on culturally between the sky who wrote this thing called Orgore and and everyone else in their neuroscience who doesn't want to listen to him which I and I also kind of like have some disagreements with his with his ideas, but but that he's probably the most well-known guy to talk about quantum effects from the brand so you can look up or.

03:51:05

Who are CH space o r so it's a theory of quantum effects in the brain but but it's I think it's actually not really a controversial idea and and so the the cultural the course world thing is kind of funny but that like, you know, people get mad when you bring when you bring that up it's not and it doesn't really change anything I because because here's the thing is like the ideas of short-term memory and long-term memory are not going to change if there's some additional.

03:51:37

All quantum things happening with the microtubules or whatever. It's not gonna change. It's still basically, you know, a information the brain is still a is still basically, you know neurons detect information because they detect coincidence patterns and and so like if there's a quantum effect that the change that that is changing the brain the weight would happen is the, The quantum effect would change the the gradient of the neuro So the gradient to the neuron is basically the distribution of positive 
and negative charges.

03:52:17

And that's going to affect when the neuron is going to fire because if you separate the positive and negative charges that the neuron has to reach equilibrium in order to balance itself in order to maintain its equilibrium and so it fought and so the action potential event fires and that's when this funded neuron fires.

03:52:37

It's sort of like it's the same sort of reason why lightning happens the positive and negative. Charges separate enough that the the the atmosphere needs to reach equilibrium and that in that moment and there's a lightning strike. And then the positive and negative charges are distributed more evenly after the after the lightning strike.

03:52:58

And so if there's anything coming from the microtubules that's going to affect how a neuron fires it's going to change it's going to be reflected in change in the ions. I undistribution which is changed which changes the gradient of the neurons positivity or negativity which determines when it's going to fire which is good which would affect the brain but it wouldn't it wouldn't be a revolution.

03:53:27

In in that the brain is like what we know about the brain we not so far we don't throw that out. We just it's the same they're not the knowledge is not as is going to be good where the no matter whether the microtubule theory ends up being real or or kind of a mistake and so so the funny thing about microtubules is it is a when microtubules are destroyed people have memory memory issues, okay?

03:54:01

And so, There is a correlation between memory and microtubules and the microtubules are where the orc or proposes that memory is stored in microtubules with quantum quantum effects, okay? But here's the thing. Microtubules are responsible for the structure before they're like a structural support. It's like the bridge it's like the supports of the bridge that holds the bridge up.

03:54:30

Okay, they they microtubules help to sell to have to have a space for the sale to be a room for sale to be a structure or bubble. And without without microtubules the cell is going to collapse. Okay now in order for memory to happen for a long-term potentiation to happen there has to be there's scientists have discovered over you know, 200 years of research called neuroscience that that new protein synthesis has to happen but in order for new protein synthesis to happen, there has to have has to be a space for it to happen, you know, your your ribosome has to has to have have a space to check your your.

03:55:17

To to check your your DNA and your and and do its process and do the new proteins this is process and make a new protein from from your DNA right from your it's it's I'm not an expert on genetics, but it's something like that and so new post so when you whenever you created new memory long-term memory or when you recall a long-term memory a new protein synthesis has to happen and and and that that's shown as illustrated and that's the sent me sound weird, but that there was this recent 
study where I so in the case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's it's fact and you can research this that a new protein synthesis is is inhibited and in this is something they found out in last year in 2020, there was a study in in Parkinson's and another study in Alzheimer's and they found out the new they basically not only is new proteins synthesis inhibited in Parkinson's and also an Alzheimer's but if you treat the patient with the chemical to to improve.

03:56:22

To increase their to their ability to synthesize new proteins, then then that patient is going to see improvements in their condition but but the thing is like if you if your microtubules have collapsed there's no space for you to for yourself to to do new proteins so you so of course, you're gonna have memory issues.

03:56:46

But but it's like it's like that'd be like saying okay, well the way the way it's like imagine you like the the football team is holding the football stadium up. The support of that stadium collapse well okay so so so that so that's the same okay so football always stops when the stadium collapses right but then you think what the stadium itself is causing the football to happen no it's not it's just the container so that's so I think it's just I think Oracle is just like a massive mistake and they're confused they're 
he's he's essentially confusing correlation with causation but, I'll go ahead.

03:57:25

I'll let you respond. No agent just I love this kinds of conversations when I just can hear the next expert just just through all this stuff might go that's so freaking cool. I'm intrigued with it for. For reasons. My father's funeral was his last Friday and he had a wonderful long life of 88 years and married for 63 and thank God we've got a lot of really great things to kind of carry us as we work through you know, just everything but you know, it's kind I've been a caregiver because he's wrestling with cancer for six two cancers.

03:58:14

Okay he worked at the Nevada test site for decades and sadly a lot of people that work there on the nuclear bombs, you know during the cold war along got cancer hundreds and even thousands of people as cancers because we didn't know what the hell we were doing but any case I just I've got these just odd it's probably just me.

03:58:36

I don't know, you know, just these weird desire to know that there's something on the other side and I am a nerd head so like just listening to you guys it's like such orchestrated music. Get my ears to try to understand what the science say about all this stuff, you know.

03:58:55

So I just thought this stuff. I'll look into the orchest stuff worker, okay. I was at a I didn't have a really cool experience with Neil deGrasse Tyson about seven years ago at a VIP event he was a keynote and I chatted with him of a bunch of us work had with him but like he he had he introduced me to this these ideas on some of the I guess he's one of one of the other guys there had asked them, you know, what dark matter and he and nailed the grass ties to said well, you know, this is someone else's theory, but it's pretty.

03:59:31

Popular it's it's like gravity leak from a different dimension. It's so I thought holy crap how cool is that? I call it a Kennedy moment because my head got just. It's really ridiculous let's say that but it's just rippling my mind and so you know, I'm just really curious if dark energy dark dark energy if there's just something that explains these these things that happen, right?

03:59:58

I don't know and then alcohol close my get jabbering all these things yet after one more point, which is I'm not a string theory expert but I I've heard and I know that like on the surface according to string theory, which is basically math that there's basically math proof that there's eleven.

04:00:18

Mentions and then if you hear Neil deGrasse Tyson talk about just if you're a higher dimension beam you can look down into smaller into the smaller dimensions, but if you're smaller dimension being you can look up into higher dimensions, so then I think like I as you can tell I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, but this space time continuum is if please correct these you guys know this is not the right way to think about this, but our universe is this comprised of four dimensions right isn't that right other than the black hole knows what the hell happens in there, we've got.

04:00:53

Space. We've got type and we have the upper debate Oh everything's up for debate, you know right move it but my point is is it there like more more dimensions beyond the four that we live in at the universe and again, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

04:01:11

I'm just a nerd I try to listen and that's it. I'm David thank you Mike for letting me speak, but please continue sure well people can respond but I but I eventually like make the physics responses short so we can get back to the the main topic but would there's a nervous physics is like brain waves and stuff and Nerve gears bring computer interfaces and and yeah we can take a temporary diversion into physics just a short one okay, but we'll come back to the road to the main topic but I just just real quick so I think rent had an answering office pause myself and.

04:01:47

You're just I think that's. The biggest points I would make is one thing a lot of people say that time is a dimension that I don't agree with that and two I think if you're trying to think about you know, what's happening in terms of dimensions I start with trying to just at the very least visualize what a hypercube is since that's something real.

04:02:10

I even that's super hard to do so that would be my recommendation. Okay. I also want to welcome Jeremy to the room. Jeremy did you want to but? No. I just I've just, you know coming for a visit. I don't know. I was just in a pretty hectic room it was something like what just hanging out for 10 minutes with Cammy you can meet Russo and then there was a whole bunch of physicists in there and they got into a fight and we closed the room so I'm drifting from physics now back to neuro physics here due to a fight due to.

04:02:51

Big fight yeah I mean you know I feel like physics people are sometimes no offense any physics people in the room here, but there's some kind sometimes a little bit disconnected from from reality and in with a fight over, you know, like stuff like somebody asked recently like what what is the the upper bound on how much the brain can stim it can be stimulated and and when one one guy who's a neurologist was like well, I don't I don't think there's any limits and no but as I know 80 second you don't understand what he's asking he's He means like if you're calculating infinities into the end of the existence like this like physics is like what is the old like there has to be like a theoretical upper band to the the the absolute maximum amount of information at the brain can be fed at one point in time.

04:03:42

I mean, you're just gonna get tired after too much information right but but but to his but to to the realist the the neurologist he's thinking really along the lines of like well what is what is what's real now in terms of our equipment now in terms of our technology now and he's not thinking like a physicist.

04:04:01

So and neither neither would an AI person either, you know, I mean, it's when people to try to say that they're going to solve AI using physics it's well, I don't know. I mean, it's a ways away, you know it likely it might be it's not going to require that much physics in my opinion actually to to make a machine that can actually think a little bit like a person why is that Germany.

04:04:28

Well that's so that was maybe a loaded statement on my part maybe I shouldn't have opened the can of worms. I don't want to I don't want to hijack. I think it's actually the most important distinction with AI because it's either something you can just code, you know in a turning complete, you know interface or it's like, oh, I don't know I mean Michael it's up to you guys if you want me to respond I don't you know, so I don't want to divert you no no no so Jimmy you're you're on topic for this group so talking about AI and everything you love to talk about is is part of this group it's in the description so keep going, all right, all right well, I mean it's tricky.

04:05:09

I mean, you know a handsome below is in the group maybe Hansen might have heard me respond, you know, there's it's very tricky with AI now, I mean, we have obviously people like mica and and many others who are. Trying to come at it trying to understand the neurology the the biophysics they're the you know, the nature of how the whole the whole brain works every aspect of it and hope to be able to map that and then there we have the neural link folks who are trying to tap into the brain and capture certain segments of it and we also have different AI scientists and mathematicians trying to map parts of the brain in a simulated fashion.

04:05:52

And then you have AI folks more traditional AI folks using machine learning and neural networks to take information from basically the databases as many David databases as they can get their hands on and to be able to sift through it and to be able to use pattern pattern recognition and all all different types of patterns to be able to slice and dice every little element in these databases up in such a way that might you know might get at the way in which a person would think.

04:06:27

But it you know and then then you have folks like myself and then now some other folks I think deep mind just came on board with this idea of trying to ground trying to simulate basically the the the simulate into reverse engineer how a mind might actually develop without actually looking under the hood as Michael would actually trying to figure out the the the learning process right from the from the ground from the grounding from a grounding or patterns and I think that base is pattern.

04:07:02

Kind. Physically looks like. Well, I mean there seems to be some agreement. I mean, I I I started I mean someone by the name of Terry Winograd actually started the Pat this this idea back in the early 70s, he was a kind of a pioneering AI guy. He's just started with the notion of a sensor and sensor sensing colors and being able to just name them and to be able to you know, as a way to to get it the symbol grounding problem where the colors were just basically.

04:07:31

The colors represented sort of wildcards of nouns right and it could be but any any kind of the most basic object, you know in this could work by the way, if you are blind you aren't seeing you could actually do this with auditory signals or you could if you were if you're a depth you could also do it probably with touches, you know, very particular patterns of touch and or or possibly even well, I don't know.

04:07:59

I haven't I haven't thought about smell but there's you know, or possibly taste. So the goal is to be able to ground. It to just the most basic possible objects or or at least senses and then to be able to mimic the sensory spatial temporal ability of a of a person of a child a young child which they're doing so they are doing experiments basically based on Piaget's they get to object permanence a lot faster than PHA ever thought.

04:08:33

And so, So then so basically I had sort of maybe about 20 years ago, you know, I've been doing this for a while I began to sort of merge this idea of you know sensing color but to do it in such a way of sensing colors and patterns in such a way that these patterns would have to associate themselves of colors such that a sensing simulated human would need to basically sense them and in a simulated fashion without even you know, having a real child there.

04:09:09

And then I began to notice that you could you could obviously have a there's a bare minimum of you know, I sort of came to a different conclusion than Terry Winograd. You know, when it grad was talking about just naming colors and then sort of associating colors maybe adding a few operators in but but I sort of I was like, wait a second, you know, I think what we need to do is we need to be able to make it so that's mimicking a child and so that the the child is going to actually first they're going to 
point or they're going to signal they're going to make a statement like that or it or.

04:09:44

Or or red or or it you know, that is right they're going to they're going to apply language to it and so then I began to figure out that there would be a way to build an ontology a very granular ontology where you're literally layering every meaning that a potential child would would learn.

04:10:08

But in a very specific order because it's not simple and it's it's a very you can't just it's not going to it's not it's not so random there's a there's a lot of problem. Ability going on because humans have needs and they have instincts and they have they have requirements that they that they possess in order to to develop that are really pretty much no option.

04:10:32

So they have to be able to use the simplest words, you know, we're in the beginning they can use, you know, just obviously baby, you know, maybe babbling but but eventually the babbling has to transfer of transform into words and they and those are very most basic words like like that or or this or is or, You know it or you know, you know and then to be able to to combine these words and in such a way that you're getting basically this and that this with that this and that are both that this and that, you know red is red and blue are colors being able to again levels of abstraction and then I began to realize that you could get.

04:11:21

Much more language out of that you could begin to begin to trace that the what it would require like this this idea this theory of requirement this to trace the child getting a you know. Beyond words that are beyond, you know with or you know, like words like start where you're literally catching a word, you know a color or an object that is.

04:11:51

You see it actually going and so you're initiating a word like go and then you're you're you're watching it move and so you're saying that is here you're starting before go you're starting with maybe here that is here and and then that is there and then your establishing and grounding that because something is here and then something is now there and then there's some sort of time this potentially involved that it's actually moved and then then you begin to say that you've been able to instantiate the 
meaning of movement and then you're able to when you.

04:12:26

When you're actually going from movement you're able to then get into to this idea of let's see. I'm just trying to I'm just trying to remember this is going they're going back a while something like, you know, it's it's it's moving faster and it's and it's moving and it's and it's it gets to it's getting to another thing and then it's beginning to arrive or it's beginning to start where it's beginning to finish and you can really I found that you can begin to develop many hundreds of thousands of words this way and it I And you can these words aren't just words they're they actually turn out to be statements they turn out to be sentences and they turn out to be sentence structures they certainly turn out to have syntax and when it be fair to say it's um, I think of the day it's at a recognition, you know, like you're looking at patterns you're looking when they start stop it's inherit to it, you know, so like you're understanding, oh it starts to stop.

04:13:24

I think when you immediately born you understand it's starting and stopping it's inherent to just pattern recognition in general. I would say that in the beginning. I would say in the beginning there are patterns, there's no question about. It but but but I think I'm saying because I strlaying you know thinking these are just patterns that you're picking up on you know, you're not making any debate for me about that there these these these things some of these things are patterns, but but but what I would 
say is that they they eventually move what are you and waiting for matter well, no.

04:13:59

I mean, otherwise I could just write a patent and then just say that, you know, maybe turn pattern got patented no no. I just had the word patent. I just used the word patent because I'm saying I could use the word I could I could use the word pattern in a patent and then just to be able to patent the bunch of patterns but I'm not saying that lately that's a legal framework.

04:14:21

I'm just talking about I have in general, like you know us as a as a entity that's collecting data. You know, and it's also abstract level you can just say it's patterned recognition. I I don't know if it's as simple as that I think that it's it's it's involving you're feeding the system.

04:14:41

The words that fit that fit the pattern The more memory needs the more patterns or digesting to understand the rest of the patterns you have. Yeah, but but I'm saying that these are you're you're basically collapsing the evolution and you're collapsing the development of people, you know, known development of children and and young adults.

04:15:00

So you're kind of collapsing it and then you're you're basically trying to figure out what the what the required not just though you required words are but the required experiences the required emotions potential emotions and feelings from the most elemental. On up And so also isn't the ultimate verify isn't a word just like a way to convey an idea to another person you know like it's just like you also have the concept of what that is doesn't mean it means the same thing like words mean different things technically but it's try trying to have a shared understanding but that's exactly why we're doing you know, it's not just me that's doing this now.

04:15:39

I mean deep mind is doing it to deep mind us not choosing to do this for the fun of it. It's is because you're trying to ground it. You're trying to ground it so that you can share meaning so that that that that there's a reason why. Children learn the way they learn and that they're learned they're able to sit together and all learn and not necessarily they all don't successfully learn but but most of them do I think and I think there's a reason for that and that's it's because loud language is grounded and it's it is grounded in very basic the most fundamental structures and then it escalates and so that that allows for this ability to have a shared language in a shared sensory temporal experience feeling the shared experience of some feelings of sensations of sight of hearing of taste the touch of All manner of you know of words and so I think it's it's a it's more than just getting back to this idea you had suggested a patterns.

04:16:35

It's it's really I mean when you say like like if you look at the word regret, I mean, you know, you regret something I would say it's a it's a it's a humanly developed word. I mean these work any words are humanly different dog, you know attacks another dog.

04:16:53

If I could just so it's evolved because because people need to interact with each other and they need to live with each other, right? So if you're going, To live with each other and understand each other you're going to need to be able to cooperate and you're going to need to be able to you know, basically share right where basically sharing and social beings.

04:17:11

So I you know, I think that you know, it becomes very abstract when you begin to call everything a pattern it I would call it more of a requirement. I would call it more of a requirement and a question to expand on that idea you said it's human unique, which I think is not the case in terms of at least regret because I mean think about what graph means right?

04:17:35

No, I don't mean please. I don't. Mean I don't mean to say this just humans. I'm sure that many animals from the animal kingdom are able to feel regret. I'm sorry I didn't mean to to say that okay, sorry. I think what Jeremy is touching on is that embodiment is a key component or not just brains in the boxes or brains and bodies and that has a significant effect on how we model the world and how we.

04:18:03

How we recognize those patterns because those patterns are all coming in through our bodies and so as yeah, we all have the same bodies for the most part and so we all tend to recognize similar patterns and over time as cognition develops and becomes more abstract those patterns become much more abstract, but they're also common because we all have similar body form yeah, we were all mere counts right now the type of patterns we've be talking about would be you know ones that we 
were all experiencing and they'd probably tip of the ones we're experiencing that.

04:18:38

So I I just had a funny thought and and I was like I was imagining that if an animal has many of like a cat or something feeling regret and then like if we like listen to the brain like okay, well what do you mean you feel regret and and like we we might discover like two great comedy that the regret is like extremely egocentric and just you know, like extremely self-centered like regret like like if like maybe the cat is accidentally causes this accident and and and and someone else gets hurt but really the 
regret is about missing and Everything.

04:19:13

I don't know is super title right cats don't feel regret. It's like okay yeah, it's true but it's like a pain, you know regret is just um, I think it doesn't the day you can really boil the shit down just super simple things like. Like bad and good you know like regret it's definitely enough yeah yeah that's right you can no begin we talked we talk about these things in the field as primitives and and you can be able to you need to be able to start with the most basic primitives and indeed good and bad are definitely no but the language but the language are construct helps create a context for what that good or bad signal means to to the organism and without without language that language is also purely meant to just communicate with others.

04:20:05

If you had lived in this in a world by yourself for eternity and never talk to it someone else you wouldn't use language you would just understand what's happening to you in terms of patterns in terms of what has happened to you. But that doesn't address the nonferable communication my wife says she's a preschool teacher she's got like a master's degree in early childhood and in that in that field, they it's pretty much commonly accepted that empathy is taught so we immediately day one of looking at someone else if you're a baby you're immediately just.

04:20:42

Trying. To communicate with them and trying to you know but you don't know how and obviously now we're on clubhouse that's how much it's involved we know but I'm because my point is simply if you're you should language it was kind of it's all I'm trying to understand you but but you know if empathy is taught think about all the other things that the I think is so excited parent yeah.

04:21:05

I was I would I would agree with Gary I think that there's empathy would be a mixture of being taught at and hearing and it is one of the first things I think if you just pop into the world you understand is I am myself and this is someone else.

04:21:18

Like an immediately there's that everything out you don't understand the beginning that they feel pain when you punch them you do over time because you know, oh and I get punched I feel pain but you do inherently understand that empathy in terms of this is someone else and I'm building up my emphasis sympathy awareness of so yeah, no, I I don't know I don't know I mean other than just it it's it's it's you would think okay, you would think all that but remember not all of us have the same left and right cortex, you know firing off of.

04:21:53

Whatever performance level so unusual blessing children see well they're not going to talk about animals with that the evidence that's anecdotally it just protecting you who knows right oh I'm telling you is it in the in the child development field that we're and all the children from world different right and we're not all born the same and we can talk about you know, all the nature genetic stuff that just some of it's gonna activate and some of it's not and so for for lots of humans if they need some some help along.

04:22:28

That and so the teaching of it is is kind of a if you wouldn't get much argument in that whole space is all I'm saying that whole field is no question that there's some people who's cultivated it's cultivated there's no question that some people are born with poor poor ability to emphasize empathize.

04:22:46

I mean, it's just no question about that and that that that some people need a lot of training to even begin to even the fathom the concept. I totally or the idea. I guess. I'm my point is just that. Kind of going back to my pattern recognition it's something that you is emergently learned is empathy because you're like wait a second.

04:23:10

I'm myself. I'm feeling the same things that these other people are feeling. I would say you know, what though it's tricky it's very it gets tricky when you know David's example is pretty good. I think you know, I don't know if anybody knows but you know that famous actor Sasha Baron Cohen anybody know him, oh yeah he's yeah, yeah, so his brother apparently is one of the foremost he's like an Oxford he's a PhD and he's one of the foremost.

04:23:37

Experts in autism and and he actually talks a lot about these issues and it's it's very controversial not very but someone controversial and he's talking about the fact that you know for some for some folks that they you know, they are they don't really have he compares people with autism and people who are on the sociopathic, you know spectrum who like he says that people with people who are sociopaths are not born with.

04:24:09

Empathy that they don't actually have the feeling but they actually understand it intellectually and that he says that that where people on the spectrum were on the autism spectrum, they actually can feel they do have the feeling but the intellectual aspect of the intellectualization of it for them is complicated and murky and so they actually have the sort of figure out what's going on whereas the the sociopath understands what's going on but actually can't feel it so it's tricky to say that it's always.

04:24:44

Emerging because if you are as dead as David I think correctly put if you are missing a certain feeling state or a certain emotion state if you're or if you're missing a certain, you know a sense of sensory perception or emotional perception, you might not ever really get it it might not actually ever isn't that it's not more reason to say it's emergent because it's like some have emerged more than others.

04:25:11

Well, I don't know. I don't know if something doesn't emerge. I don't know if it's emerged that's too simplified. I mean, I really attracted to the point but yeah, no, I think you're out. I mean, the pattern is a very useful metaphor right that the pattern and just our ability our brains are really to quickly interpret patterns and we start to map it out to bigger and you know, I totally get it.

04:25:38

I think that's great. I just, I don't know is there you got a lot that's a really strong base, you know foundational base. I like that I I read but because you own a simplified things as much as you can and sorry Anton I love what you say so so that's okay, thanks I read the the reduments in the in it praying and some people have abundance of them and then some others have a dearth of them so and then they so some people just don't.

04:26:15

And not I mean, let me just don't have the material base to appetite. I think just one observation. I have in terms of. People understanding what's going on is if you look at you know, like a, Newton or someone that understands a lot it's like they almost go off the charts in terms of understanding so it almost seems as if a base understanding is the most important because once if you have a good base you can pay basically take more fruit off the tree because it's actually yielding fruit versus something that never really grows much so it's like you can't just be quotes smart and able to pattern recognize right now you have to have a big understanding of what is happening and build off on top of that.

04:27:11

So it kind of makes more sense if you look at it that way that someone would be able to understand a lot more going forward about a lot of different things because they have a very solid structure of what the patterns are how they're fitting on top of each other in a so to speak well that's what education is about right the pedagogy education totally as long as education good but yes completely well said aside from that that's that's kind of the point of education but then if you want to go become a researcher or something you've got a all of us have.

04:27:46

A shared understanding of the language and then we went through a similar educational system, you know to some degree but then you could it's up to us the kind of take that and and continue to explore building new it's almost like Legos right it's like building new patterns and and fabricated that the creative brain kind of gets involved right so I don't know I think really out of some thanks Brad for really getting me to to really respect the pattern recognition piece.

04:28:15

I'm more intrigued with the other side are not necessarily correct but you could see. Them be like, oh this means that and then after a while be like wait a second it means this but if you're not willing to readjust then you're just going to be stuck in your old way.

04:28:33

Michael you had a question before about the good and bad you were going to speak a statement. I I forget but I mean, I feel like I feel like a lot of things that are being said or not are more on the psychological speculative side of things not really grounded in a neuroscience, for example, like um, the whole thing about.

04:28:55

About some people having more neurons or other neurons I'm sorry so I mean the the idea of that is some some some of the folks have more mirror neurons than other other mirror neurons well well that is a I'm like, how can you even prove that like but that is just like that's actually that they did it they did they just actually see you see Davis and I think several other UC schools were doing studies on that and they they actually covered in scientists they covered that in scientific American about a decade ago, it was called the the broken mirrors theory, but they now again, I think that, All I think it was very politically incorrect that the work that they were doing so I think they shut it all down so I I think they were looking into it but I think they decided to stop maybe maybe it's because it was politically correct or maybe because as Micah says maybe it's a it was a trip toward, you know, no man's land no I'm just saying like it's it's it's it's um, there's no there's like it might be a hypothesis but here but okay, so like the one of the reasons why mirror neuron stops being a topic one of the reasons is that there's just like the way the weight so marinas was observed in in monkeys, it's basically.

04:30:05

You know, there's a very it was very specific neuron that is gonna fire with with consistency that. That I. You know like them like if another monkeys hand is firing and and and the monk it's it's the same neuron that fires when the monkeys hand is firing or something like that, you know, it's just like but that's sort of like, you know, so that hasn't been observed in humans what's been observed is that maybe we have like a functional version of a mirror neuron maybe a neurosurgeon is doing the same job as a mirror neuron and and and like in like identifying like actual like being able to identify to look at a human being with enough detail that you can identify where they're neurons are which of those neurons are mirroring.

04:30:50

Herons and which of them are firing correctly and how many mirror neurons they have this is like this beyond any medical imaging technology that an existence like that so the idea that you could you could casually say well, you know, some people just don't have as many you're neurons as other people is just not connected to neuroscience that is more like this it's like a story it's like this that's what I'm so that's all I'm saying it's like not.

04:31:19

It's not it's an idea this is not a grounded in science. I mean, it's a hypothesis right theory some kind of there you go yeah. I agree let me die. I don't know how they yeah. I think you have the the it's a very reasonable the I don't know how they they got it out.

04:31:46

I'm yeah, the other thing that I noticed is that like if you're. You know, whether like so so they're examples of like animals being sort of like born with a certain tendency to have certain certain kinds of knowledge like like rat like rats are born with certain behaviors that are a tendency they're the born with a certain tendency to develop behaviors that are relevant to their survival and so you have to say well then that that the brain isn't a blank slate where you just like, you know, where you just like, It learns everything from scratch where you could like you know like if you took a rat's brain out and you just you know fed it like data it would just become like a general purpose computer it's not it's not that simple the bad the rat screen is gonna have some some some genetic likelihood towards certain kinds of behaviors but so so yeah, so there might be some genetic likelihood for someone to develop empathy they're definitely they're definitely is there's no question about that it is a weird no I'm weird so yeah, I'm what I'm saying is there is there's there.

04:32:58

I think there is some question about that like like in terms of like the, Degree of it and why it's not consistent with every person there's some question about it but there's like there's definitely like a genetic basis to to why humans are likely to more likely to to have certain behaviors I bet but but but I think it's something it's like some it's the topic you want a question that's that's what I'm saying and in terms of like, you know, how much of it could be you know, How much it could could be how much of our brain despite its genetic predispositions is open to training and open to to change and that's just an interesting thing to think about.

04:33:42

Yeah, it's like you know, you're hereditary impulses, they're there and it's it's so hard to say how that affects your your tablet roses so to speak you're part of the brain that does start blank or however you want to try to you know, talk about that. See the thing is also with what I was talking about too is that you know, a lot of the the language, you know, after doing this for many years and I think others have found this too and in the field not that many are working on it yet but.

04:34:17

There's so there's a there you need to build you need to have some words before other words and you know, there's there tends to be this this prominence of words being required before other words can go and so the words the words have to be grafted on to ground and experiences and grounded situations and and grounded nouns and so that becomes rather invariant in variant and one can say there's a massive amount of variability, but the groundedness and that then the types and the features of things and the conditions.

04:34:52

Need to be grounded and they're they're often very easy to identify and the options become easy to easy to identify as well the the goal is is to be able to make it so that you're nouns are your nouns are like wild cards so that you actually get like every time that anybody in this room speaks they're going to be using basically the same words over and over again what's going to change are going to be the topics, but the words and the combinations of words that you're using and when you write up or if you're writing, They're going to be the same over and over and over again and the same combinations and sometimes a little different combinations but so the the theory is that the the words and the meanings eventually when you begin to figure them out developmentally that they're these developmental causal causal definitions ideological definitions of various different developmental definitions when you begin to get at these new types of semantics and these new types of sentence structures then you can overlay them basically over and over again.

04:36:01

Like people do every time they see or do something new.

04:36:08

Is your point that language is kind of. You get more sophisticated or what's your point well no my point is multifaceted. I mean the point is that language does get more sophisticated it does build on itself it's not optional like you can't you can't learn a harder word without having learned some simpler words first but I I one nearly understanding that you could actually convey incredibly complex theoretically.

04:36:36

The maximum complex ideas simply with minimal metal words to yeah I tend to agree I agree with that too and that that mirrors a lot of the work that I do there's no question about that but in addition so we're talking about the the language and then what was your other just lost my train of thought you were you we were talking about oh yeah you're saying is that is what I'm trying to explain just the idea of language no it's it's not just language it's it's the it's the templated it's it's that we use language as templates all the time language, we call delete communication.

04:37:11

And yes, I think that using cannabis it helps our own communication to in some ways but I also don't think it's essential to just us, um, thinking ourselves about and making connections about what is reality. I'm sorry. I don't know how what you're saying corresponds with what I'm saying.

04:37:32

I'm you you're if I'm not mistaken, you're saying they basically, you know language is a tool to understand. Oh I mean again, I don't just mean language to by the way. I'm talking about I'm talking about the this the the human apparatus right so I'm talking about words that we use to describe our own functioning right that's language well that is language but it's it's for its stems from words that again that that we use to that we that we have in our sensory motor words now okay hand okay, can I really I don't think.

04:38:09

Can I wanna weigh in here because there's there's a if we so I have okay so like alright this is like, um, like what so what is so it's interesting because because when we like like when we communicate with language we use all these different modalities, we are words refer to things we can see and hear and touch and feel concepts that are there too abstract to assign to one one sensory modality or another we talk about things we can smell and and, In this means that language is in the brain is not just triggered not just triggering one area but not just one language area, but but when we talk about things we can see that there's there's neural activity that's happening in our visual court decks and and when we talk about things we can taste and and and feel there's there's activity happening in our somatosensory cortex and when we talk about things we sounds we heard or expect to hear that we expect to see activity in our audio cortex, we're in our brain.

04:39:15

I'm gonna the brainstem and and and when we when we Talk about you know, abstract concepts we expect to see you know, maybe more activity and and and and in the frontal and pridal lobes and different different areas of the brain, it's a so it and and and it's so like I meant so like what I want to say, okay, so like I saw this video the dog one time right and the dog was this is like bear with me for a second it's a short story but it'll be worth it, okay, so the so dog is it is in the kitchen?

04:39:49

And it's a video of a dog in the kitchen and the dog is looking at at a at something on the countertop. I think it's a pie all right and dog it looks over you know at the door to see if anyone else is around and it looks at us stool and it looks at the pie and then it looks around the kitchen again and it looks at the door and it looks at the at the store and it looks at the pile like it does a cycle it's like and I'm like, I had this idea and it was like this.

04:40:18

Um okay I'm gonna skip this part of the story because but for some reason I but so the dog so like imagine this is cycle of activity happening in the dog's brain, right this is visual activity the dog is seeing one concept and then another concept it is a sequence of concepts and that the dog is saying that are playing out and like a movie like it's like okay, so imagine a movie imagine that 10 seconds of dogs mental space in that movie.

04:40:44

I what you see on your TV screen is a picture of a door and then and then where the where it doesn't like the kitchen is clear. And then there's a like this is the concept oh yeah the owner's not home is that's part of the movie and and then there's the part of the movie where okay there's a stool so there's a way to read the countertop and then there's another part of the movie where there's like a pie that I could get this pie and then we see this dog leap up on the the stool and then it leaps up on the countertop and then it gets to buy right so here's the thing so what I'm thinking is that is that the brain the brain is just in order to do normal functions has to calculate a sequence of patterns a sequence of patterns just like I described and that when we are committed.

04:41:27

When we're talking about language we're just we're just outputting what our brain is doing is is doing to another person. I'm just like communicating a sequence of patterns and and but but but but but the what I'm saying is the essential components of language are really just the essential components of cognition and there's no and even without language we're performing mental language in a solo way because it is just performing a sequence of patterns that's what that's what I'm saying and and so it doesn't matter if there's one person or more than one person language isn't.

04:42:02

A component of cognition. So I think one thing that might be helpful here is just to separate or just state the language is a component of computation because you know, it's it's all it is it's a building block but communication that think of all the sensory contacts you get you can say almost the same words, but if you say them differently, they'll the nuance is is going to be real that's just.

04:42:32

When you guys go back and forth on just language language and it's like yes yes, but then communicationally grants their communication also and it's it's it's a component of it so I mean because we see I mean, I mean just to riff on what you're saying David you you're seeing you know in your mind's eye color you're you're you're you're you're getting auditory representations of the external world you're you know, you're getting the smell sensations taste sensations, you're you're getting you know, you're you.

04:43:03

Of your company So there's just a there's a mixture you know you're getting spatial dimensions Spatial and and temporal dimensions. And so, I mean some of these things are coming in before you have the time to capitulate what they are, right. And so then you have to be able to associate them and then convert them in the mind and then after the mind is begin to make some kind of relationships with them, then you're applying language on top of it to represent that.

04:43:31

So and often of course, the language is not going to be precise enough to be able to always do that. Hey, this is really interesting. I wish I could stay lower but I have to go to sleep. Thank you so much. Thanks for paying attention. See you again, guys.

04:43:48

Great, thank you. Bye. Not to be that horse but I just I think that it's a I don't know if I'm right but I think I am which is just that language is just a tool we build up and if we didn't have anyone else to communicate we wouldn't have words to use even internally and we wouldn't need to and I don't think that would enter us.

04:44:10

I think we just use them because it is a tool that we built up. So I mean my main point is that language is not not just words that the words are representing our internal modalities or what we're in what we're really we're doing with with our words is creating a reduced concentrated representation of of our of our internal thoughts our what we see here and etcetera not only there's a really cool game this is completely like sidetracked but I figured it's called like a hundred.

04:44:40

It's a card game and basically the way you play it is there's a hundred cards and you give you spread about equally among everybody and you try to. Count up from who has one to two to three to four and it's actually crazy to over a couple rounds. You get really good at just communicating with everyone nonverbally about who has the next card.

04:45:00

But really what I'm trying to say is that language is not our words, it is our thoughts and that our thought we're gonna have our thoughts and we're gonna have our our mentor representations regardless of whether or not we're gonna talk to someone else. Well, let's just be semantics because to immediately semantically language just means words and sorry language means communication like language inherently means communicating with someone else it's a tool to communicate with someone else language you can use all sorts of different things to communicate you can say that the language.

04:45:36

Well, it's not a cement it's not a semantic difference because we're not just using different words to to interact. I could look at you with my eyes and potentially communicate urgency stress happiness, you know, that's a language.

04:45:52

Okay, well that's a kind. I mean you just contradicted yourself because and then because then because you just didn't just say that language was just words or you didn't say that. I'm saying language is communicating. It's a communication. That's that's to me encapsulate that it's to communicating but you can communicate like I said, you know in so many different ways.

04:46:14

Okay so I mean like I mean, I don't know like so so I mean just if we're being very abstract here, like what what is isn't it in a sense like a human being with if a human being is alone in the forest and there's no animals it's like just like a weird situation there's no other life forms, but but the human being has this relationship with their environment at least right and it.

04:46:40

Your microphone was on like no I'm saying if you can be being has their relationship with with them with their environment at the very late there is a there's always right, right? So yes I'm saying that you would it's okay so that's that was my my my thought experiment earlier on which is you're just born and just an environment and a forest and you don't you never speak with just someone or have something else that you eat and even hope to communicate with then you could figure out that you build a whole and get water and drink the water and you just have all these ideas in your head of what you're trying to do and you're thinking, you know, you're thinking but you're not thinking and a language, you know, because sometimes, You'll say to yourself gosh do this do that okay let me do that but if you think about it you don't really need those words and they and your head those same concepts okay eyes so that so this I think this is like I don't know it's like I wear a major disagreement is what I'm saying, it's like the thing the things that are happening in your head are gonna happen regardless of whether or not you're communicating them to someone else you you you're gonna have activity going from your visual cortex your somatosensory cortex to your audio cortex and this is this is the stuff that is happening in your head when when you when languages happening in your head and this stuff happens when you're not talking, So the same stuff that's happening in your head before or after so gonna be happening now let's say that you lived in a forest which you lives in a forest from infinite infinitely long amount of time, but you you lived you lived in the forest for eternity, but you in the forest was infinitely big and and you could go any direction and and there's you know rivers and all sorts of crazy stuff in the forest like super crazy stuff, but you really need to to remember stuff and you remember it's not that good so you have to begin to write things down and communicate with 
yourself so in that sense like you're writing.

04:48:36

Down a representation of your thoughts of what's something means, you know, like if you're creating maps creating signs you could you would begin to create a language despite yourself to remind yourself just just a reduced representation and and you know at some point, you know, like the great philosophers in in history.

04:48:56

I think I think that you can say you can create a language with yourself. I think that is a good point. And I think that the you know, basically a lot of the a lot of the great philosophers spent time just asking asking questions and thinking about their own questions and just sort of developing their minds by themselves.

04:49:14

But exactly you you build a mental model and you can you know build upon that mental model with yourself. I mean, that's all you're ever gonna do anyway. No. I mean, you're gonna be actually developing metal models with yourself without with other people and what other people have learned saying over these days, you're getting the mental you're getting information to add to model through someone else than you yourself added to the mental model sorry to be nuanced.

04:49:45

All right so um, I think we've beaten a dead horse what if I just if I could just to finish to real quick though. I mean again, I mean, I think that people I think of some of the stuff that I was talking about maybe sailed over people's head, it heads or they didn't they didn't quite understand it but it it could very well be that there's a way of being able to recreate the experiences and the the developmental all of this developmental metal modeling and metal mental.

04:50:19

Learning mental learning of around our the space of our experience and our and language and and domains there there may be a way of doing that in such a way that you're actually able to get a decent reflection about what's going on in the mind and in the you know, the research that I'm doing in a you know have done is that you're beginning to find new ways of defining things whether they're domains whether they're words, whether they're you know, psychological aspects, Of people that so and then to be able to actually experiment to question using views a question and answering methodology upon data to be able to find out if you're actually finding stuff that obviously other techniques have not been able to show that you can find and so the goal is to be able to improve on the the the question and answering capability to be able to make a machine that can begin to go back and forth with a person in some sort of way like a person can go back and forth with another person.

04:51:28

When I look at old home movies with my siblings, it would be like a computer joining us and kind of create this phone mental mapping from a conversation with us. I'm trying to think of a practical application of something like that, but I mean, yeah, I mean, I it's sort of like that but it's also like if anybody saw that movie dust was a map does Mac in us.

04:51:53

I don't know how to pronounce it, but but you know, we're sort of like what Google's doing that, they're they're basically getting. All of the their laying out all the information about the world on the internet, obviously right and then the goal is that if you get these templates of information right of modeled definitions and you're able to reuse them over and over again as questions and then you're able to use the internet as the answers then you begin to develop this virtuous circle where you're you're developing a memory a system of memories where you're able to capture images and and and words and meanings and all manner of Domain specific knowledge from the internet and to be able to layer it in such a way as you would learn it.

04:52:43

And then to be able to create this again, another virtual virtuous circle of being able to iterate upon it layer by layer. And so it's very abstracted. I'm not expecting anybody to fully understand that but it's a it's a it's a it's a new way of doing AI that people are just sort of beginning to begin bidding beginning to start to do.

04:53:09

It's very cool but like I got to tell you I apologize for I feel like I kind of hijacked the room a little bit and the room was awesome, but you guys were talking about initially if I do apologize and I promise to be more aware of that in the future not to it because the topic is really cool.

04:53:25

But I've followed you know, everybody here. I thinks a lot for to have the conversation and and for teaching me lots of things guys. I'm appreciated but I've got a I've got to head off now. Okay have a good night. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Later David. So I guess I could I guess I could reset the room.

04:53:48

So so it's a nerve neurophysics we're talking about things like brain waves, you know brainwaves have oscillations and and the brain has rhythms nerve nerve gear we the this is a topic of brain computer interfaces, it can be you know, you can talk about there's an airlink device there's an open water device.

04:54:09

There's EEGs is you know, something that measures brain rhythms are actually brain sorry brainwait. S brain it it's it's it represents represents pains. I guess ultimately but it's measuring voltages coming from your family brain. And and then you know to you know related to this topic is a topic of deep learning and you know in the brain itself how the brain works how you know cognition works and and, And there's lots of lots of related topics that are you know in the description and and are also allowed and so I just like is this popcorn's popcorn style?

04:54:51

Meet up so if you want to bring up any topic that is tangentially related or ask any question go right ahead and so welcome everybody.

04:55:09

By the way, just to just to finish I think people could look this up by the way, you know, just so you don't you know, you could look up a deep mind grounded language development or grounded language learning and I think there's they've got quite a few publications on it.

04:55:22

You could also read my patent as well. So there's you could read about it. I mean, obviously, I don't think this was a terrible terrible much interest to people when this room but it is I think a fascinating topic for some.

04:55:39

Yeah. Do you want to share the alcoholic? I was just gonna say is very interesting. And kind of touching on pointer brought up a while ago about embodiment. I think a key component that's missing from a lot of that research. Is embodiments is. Because the way the agent is gonna understand all that content that it's consuming on the internet, that's going on finding.

04:56:11

It has to have some kind of a. In the case of something like, you know, abstract knowledge some kind of multi-dimensional body, which it uses a template. For mapping and synthesizing that information and giving it a kind of spatial multi-dimensional spatial understanding of what it knows what it doesn't know and what kind of information is out there.

04:56:42

Let's target that language too. It's just that language that you're gonna experience firsthand it's almost like, you know, like matrix status, how do you how does this machine communicate to your brain? You know directly input that into it.

04:57:04

I I I turned out for a second but I tuned it. I tune back in right when somebody said something about how does it how do we can input stuff back into your brain? What can you reprise that?

04:57:20

Kyle, I think was talking about how.

04:57:27

Activated how you want it. You honestly. Yes, so with the stuff that deep minds doing with a lot of this kind of abstracts, language-based textual understanding and discovering information and conversing with humans. Having a machine without some kind of embodiment. It's missing a key component because the way we understand the world is through our bodies through our body maps how we relate to space and without that.

04:58:04

I don't think we're going to get to AGI. I don't think we're going to be able to create machines that really understand the world as we do. It doesn't really have to be mimicking a human body. But. It that that's a fundamental component of our cognition and how we understand the world and how we communicate about the world.

04:58:29

Like agree with you totally Kyle.

04:58:35

Don't you know if I'm talking to you Kyle though, I need to basically in my mind think about who you are and how I interface with you know, how I'm going to talk to you based on what you know, like I'm automatically just going to create a mental model if I see bump into randomly on the street like I'm just going to have a mental model of who you are and how to communicate with you.

04:58:54

I think computer wouldn't be any different but they hopefully would be able to have a understanding of what our mental model is. More accurately feed into that based off of you know, whatever they can gather. So put our mental model is grounded in our in our physical form and our relation to our environment.

04:59:14

Same with the computer. Well, I don't think they're different that's my point as a computer needs to have that kind of model in addition to all this. I agree textual understanding. And that's something that I see missing from deep like deep mind research and all this deep learning research.

04:59:36

We just have these neural networks but they they don't have bodies. Okay, well, I mean, I I don't agree but but but what I'm saying is like, But I don't know that I'm that far away and in my thinking in terms of like so I think Kyle said that yeah, it doesn't have to be like a human like body it could be you know, maybe it could be a spider's body or a robot's body or something else, but but I would go step further and say and saying that.

05:00:18

That I don't think it has to be a body in in terms of like what? What I'm not talking about a physical. Yeah, well, however, we're whatever environment this. Being or whatever exists in. It has to have some semblance of some kind of form that it controls and that it's experiencing whatever environment it's in through that's right that's right now the medium through which it experiences it's it's all existence and the existence.

05:00:55

Almost by definition being accessed it's controlling something because it's it's giving it's returning, you know and programming it's returning something whether that gets used or not by definition of most it's it's a controlling something alright, so I mean, okay, so but I mean, like, so, for example, if you look at the the science experiments when We're you put on a VR headset and they you're looking through a camera that is behind your own body and you begin to believe that you're actually behind your own body right and it's like your brain is is is in the moments spontaneously creating its representation of space from the information you're giving it and and and so like when but like what I'm saying is like the what I'm thinking is like the the the brain's core functions are not dependent.

05:01:48

On on an identification with the physical body and a physical space or we're with ache with or with a like a location. I you know a specific location like you don't have to have a specific location to have thoughts but Mike I don't think you understand what he's saying he's talking about going beyond that and he could going beyond the basic understanding of of spatial temporal relationships and getting into real life human experiences as we as we have had all throughout our lives.

05:02:21

And also those experiments they didn't have a control which never had a body.

05:02:29

Because the brain is very plastic and you feed it different inputs and it will be able to very quickly know that okay that. I'm used to being in this body from this perspective but now I'm behind my own body. Okay, when I move my arm, it's still the same I'm still getting the same feedback.

05:02:47

Okay, okay, but look here's the you know, the problem the problem is you're defining a situation where it's not possible to have artificial general intelligence without a body but then but but then when you're talking about like what the body is for you're saying well, it's it's the the it's for you're saying the artificial generator intelligence that's only artificial intelligence that qualifies as artificial.

05:03:13

In general intelligence for you is artificial intelligence, why am I stumbling artificial AGI just called AGI it it is the the only kind of AGI that qualifies as AGI for you is the kind that understands the human condition in a spatial way in a body way. And I'm not talking about the human condition.

05:03:33

I'm just saying that.

05:03:37

Of self of something that is the brain controls and. Medium through which experiences the environment is fundamental to cognition on a very general level. Now I so I don't agree with that. I'm sorry. I mean, like okay, it's how we form memories. I mean our spatial temporal like our body map it and how we our body relates the world.

05:04:01

It's it's fundamentally linked to how we form memories and how we understand things. Well, I think I mean, I think that's I think that's an interesting idea that but I don't think that's that's consistent with actually how memory is formed. I agree with you Kyle, I mean, I think and become still curious to hear.

05:04:18

Why you don't agree with it. Well okay I mean so you so the there is a there's a there's a part in the part of the brain that has been called the homunculus It's associated with with representations of your body your hands and it's interesting because in the homunculus your hands are huge because there's a whole whole lot of stuff to know about your hands but but other parts of your of the homunculus are really tiny so like your legs are really tiny in the monkeys because there's not a lot of stuff you 
need to know about your legs.

05:04:48

And it's just really interesting that the representation of your body is like this warped thing. You look up the homunculus on. How on the web which is really warped version or shape of your body It's really cool But but the thing is like if like there's nothing like it's not it's like it's kind of like saying that you need the homunculus and we're to have memory with the monkey list is in the neocortex.

05:05:09

It's not essential for memory formation. Remember formation is is is a happens everywhere in the neocortex and maybe everywhere in the brain but it's like, you know, it's been mapped out. It's been like you memory forms, you know, you know with with this process there's short term as long-term memory.

05:05:25

Any new data you get just automatically formed forming new memory technically. It might it might it might be disregarded I think there's a semantic difference between mica what you're trying to say what Kyle's trying to say Michael you're talking about how memories get created in the brain and and you know, what with the actual neuronal, you know chemistry is and and that's fine and there's that that's right, but what Kyle's discussing is after this this process has occurred when you're actually you have formed a alive, you know, or at least a simulated human then the human actually has to go about its life then it uses what it has in its.

05:06:06

Mind to be able to interact with the world and then it forms representations about everything that it is excited it experiences and learns, so I mean it and the the just one component our body map, it's our body map and our environment. So how we relate to things in our environment how we determine spatial relationships, it's linked with differentials.

05:06:36

So I agree with you. Kyle is. I get I'm not a neuroscientist. I'm not too deep into the literature but I know I've come across several articles we can talk about how we form spatial temple memories and how we form those maps of environments and it goes beyond just the homunculus.

05:06:54

I mean, it's we had like we walk in a different rooms it activates different memory centers relating to those rooms and so it's like our mental model and how we think about things it's it's tied to our bodies and the environment. My point is that for an AGI yeah, it's not gonna have a human body, it's like I have a 3d body necessarily but how it understands the information it knows.

05:07:26

On I think on a fundamental level needs to be have some kind of spatial construct. And how it's knows where to go to find new information. Like that's what I call like the body like it because they give it like a like a amiibo like with tentacles like it knows like this arm is for you know, sci-fi this other arm is for.

05:07:53

Um, okay, but but, Um, okay, so so, um. I still don't agree, but I think I would describe what you're saying is more like a philosophy or a viewpoint. I don't want to I don't want to like, you know sat right that you're wrong or anything but I just like I don't I don't know the neural basis of what you're of why you of your argument but but I would say, Sorry could you say that your argument and again I probably tend to try to oversimplify here but you say your argument is basically thought needs to be physical on some level, you know in that physicality can be linked to what it's perceived in the real world but at the end of the day that thought is physical and that's almost like.

05:08:39

Of most important terms of how you see it how it's also manifest itself in gathering it from physical reality. I mean, it's a reflection of the physical reality not necessarily physical right but also I would argue that it is as well if you take it to the next step.

05:08:55

I mean, it links to you know, when we think about, You know performing an action, you know, we're firing up the same kind of centers in our brains as if we were experiencing that action. When we're sizing up another person right when we're sizing somebody up or when we're trying to estimate you know, any any number of the estimations that we make on a moment by moment basis, we're constantly comparing ourselves to the world, we need to be able to model the world in all those at the 
different unique aspects.

05:09:25

Exactly and for AGI needs to be limited to 3d or 40 world but it needs to have that kind of representation of the environment that it's in and for an AGI again, this will be like a multidimensional environment. Yeah okay I don't know why I'd like to speak with that being interrupted but I'm just so going back to Kyle's question there there are there's I mean the hypothesis that college is sharing there is it there are there are place cells in grid cells in the internal cortex of of the human being just like in a mouse that do track your look your location within a room and at the minimum, you know you and and you're in which room you're in you're grid cells might be room in a place cells where you are in your orientation in the room.

05:10:19

And so on that level you can say that that you know, at least the human ego is a directional concept and it's in a spatial coordination system that's what the identity is, the the identity is a is it as a directional concept within within a room right or and that's within other rooms and at the minimum but what I'm saying is that like, you know there there are there that there's there's you know, the at least, you know, you've heard legends of of rain.

05:10:54

People reached selflessness like where they reached they realized there's no self that it's just like a fiction like it's just like even you can you can completely have your ego dissolved with psychedelic medication, for example, or you can you can sit on you can sit underneath the tree and meditate until you realize your oneness like the Buddha and and in in let go of your of your the philosophy that everything is essential to ego and I'm only sure I'm only sharing those concepts just for to say well, so.

05:11:29

I mean, what what if there's another way of cognition that is not that it's actually selfless that is not really about you know, the even life the directional concept of where you are and in all of things like. Beyond the internal cortex be on the brain stem and then you'll cortex you have also it's hypothesized by some that there are play cells and grid cells in an although throughout the new cortex and these these functions are in a spatial way doing calculations that organize like things like the like the the orientation of your phone.

05:12:08

If the shapes and the sites in the feeling of your phone and and and how the phone is changing and you might have another neural column that's you know, I have it a neuro column that's tracking every single object in the environment around you might be tracking the room you're in or the or the features of landscape that you're in and that you're ending in and and so but fundamentally, it's like your brain is like creating like a, It's like you have a whole bunch of it's like so imaginable your whole thought space everything you see like every item in in the world around you including the environment including the representation of yourself consists of patterns patterns have spatial characteristics and patterns that have temporal characteristics and every thought that you have has temporal and spatial characteristics every feeling that you have has tempo and spatial characteristics like like patterns like, you know, frequencies vibrations and in every kind of thought that every kind of feeling has temple spatial characteristic.

05:13:12

And if you take away one part of this picture the rest of them remain in there and what it means is like your your brain is merging the temporal kit and spatial characteristics of sounds with sites with you know, what you see with what you hear with what you feel and so this whole like the whole landscape of human the human conscious experiences the thought workspace, the the experience of you you are somewhere even without yourself there is this sort of like, There's this sort of like pattern that is that is being that that that is being generated like generate like like a kind of like like you're if like that the the crudest possible comparison would be like a volumetric video right like a volumetric video inside of the inside of your headset like that that environment is sort of like kind of like what your brain is doing it's like creating that and and it's but it's creating that but it's bringing together it's connecting all the different.

05:14:20

Modalities that you have your your everything you hear is connected everything you see and and if you if you took out part of it then like like right now you you are missing part of it like there's everything behind you is is missing right you only seeing what's in front of you right right and then and then and then there's also a hole in in each of your eyes and you're not even noticing there's a whole missing it's a, At some point if you just if you didn't have any self the rest of it remains there's just all this stuff happening which is no self and that's like that is like this sort of like yeah, if you realize it's yeah all this stuff is happening but it's not happening to anybody right it's just it's not having to anybody there's no self is just another rendering another idea it's a directional concept there's no self and so that's what I'm saying, it's like there's another way of saying it there's no there's no actual stuff it's just a directional concept and it's just stuff happening.

05:15:15

You can remove the location of your ideas and thoughts from it and it's still you know retains itself.

05:15:25

Well, I mean there's I mean that so there in a sense there's like that there's a location of where the stuff is right but this stuff doesn't have to be connected to a self right is it could just be yeah, this is the you could there's just a location.

05:15:43

Think about like the last. Grand idea or whatever it was something that you were thinking about that really had nothing to do where you were you still remember where you were when you were thinking about that. I'm not I'm just saying I can sort of think about it no because I think that it is intrinsically tired so out okay, so look I'm saying that you may have there there might be there might be spatial memories happening, but that doesn't mean they're connected to yourself that they might be connected to a location and so you could just you could just interpret it a machine could interpret it as there are memories that are happening in this location and there were there are memories that happened in another location and in in human could also interpret this.

05:16:30

Way it doesn't have to have anything to do with with all the things that you might associate with yourself today these things could just be. Things that are happening in different locations that you're bringing that the brain is tracking and I completely agree with you and that's why I say for a machine it will be multi-dimensional and I think our brain does is as well is that when we form representations of the objects in our environment?

05:16:58

We're forming multidimensional representations one set of dimensions is for ourself other sets of dimensions are for other things. And our brain is able to synthesize that into a self because it needs to because it's controlling a single body. And a machine with a multidimensional space that exists in it could have multiple bodies.

05:17:22

And it could be experiencing multiple environments simultaneously a multiple objects and they would all be represented represented in a similar way. The body and an object there's no distinction really it's just when the you need to communicate or you need to perform actions there's only one or some number of things that you can actually control everything else is external.

05:17:45

Was a clear delineation between what is controllable and what is not controlable. Does that make sense? All right. I hear what you're saying, but but then but the main point is. I'm just differing on the on the on the idea that you need a self in order to have AGI.

05:18:03

I don't think you do. That was my point. I think probably abstract my point a little bit to say you need a delineation between self whether that's a multi-part self or a single part self and that can be controlled and what is not controlable what exists outside the self.

05:18:25

So I so and am I I think that you don't need that because because it is possible to be because the brain is a general learning algorithm and and because the the way the brain forms conscious thought. We're workspace is a general thing What I'm saying is like if you if you had a brain but you know basically the same thing as a brain but it was in a machine and you only fed the brain basically like you fret if you're the brain many different kinds of data, but some of the data was like stock data some of the data was weather data how having a cloud forming the the atmospheric changes, you know, it's in and what I'm saying is like yeah, if all the different, you know, instead of having the the kinds of senses that we have all the senses are just, Like different kinds of data streams.

05:19:19

I mean, all the senses are just different kinds of data streams, but like instead of like touch data stream it has you know, maybe it's just like sampling of the soil moisture across the planet or something and but the the essential that essentially the structure of the brain is going to become conscious of this information and it's going to be able to visit it's going to be able to understand the the three dimensional relationships between these different.

05:19:49

Patterns if it if that information is is correlated and the consistent way over time like if there is actually an actual relationship between whether and soil moisture which I think we can say yeah there is and in a relationship between weather soil and white moisture and changes in the stock market this machine and yeah.

05:20:10

I think there is also right. You know during a snowstorm what was going to happen to the company as the employees are not going to be at work, right? And I mean, unless it's MS for a post-pandemic world and everybody works at home anyways in which case company might be more productive, but The point is that like yeah so like the like you could have a machine and artificial general intelligence has no sense of embodiment.

05:20:31

That is conscious of patterns and able to communicate those patterns that relate many high dimensional structures to one another and does not have a sense of embodiment and does not have any sense of self. That's my the same. The thing is that Mike it needs to fill itself with experiences it it yes, it can it can it can think you know what you're describing definitely could do certain things but it.

05:20:59

Wouldn't have the expanse of human experience and stories and narratives and I mean just, you know different the deep well of memories that all of us have the the all of the opinions all of the you know, you need to be able to imbue it with with it doesn't have to have one personality but it needs to be able to it needs to be able to understand the views of many humans and it needs to be able to exemplify each view as if it.

05:21:34

Is what at least one of them and compare one to the other so that can begin to compare and contrast multiple experiences that people can have so again this is like what I was saying earlier that the summit that you're that there's a conflation of it in order to be AGI it has to understand human experiences and that's that's what I'm saying is not I had to un agree with you can have an AGI that doesn't understand human experiences, but it is sentient and self-aware and possibly able to experience the 
weather and able to experience the soil and able to experience the stock market and waves that are fundamentally they're in a fundamentally deeper than.

05:22:09

Any experience that human being has ever had with with be because because because the amount of sensory information you could feed that computer might be vastly greater than human senses but you're but you in a way that you're just arguing you're saying that these sensory experiences that you're that you're suggesting are more they're more vivid and they're more they're deeper and and you're it's almost like you're saying well that's better than human experience and it's done it's just different it's just a different thing even experiences subjective like you're just saying you're basically relatable to other things and like you can qualify them in a genre as humans, but like, I just want to point out that that is subjective and I would argue that the correlations that are formed even without any defined self.

05:22:57

Are they form a sense of self that's even if you're not controlling the weather you're not controlling the stark stock market, oh I the bottles that the models that are formed are kind of mini cells just being able to execute / think inherently means there's a self because. Your computing somewhere you are computing whether you think you're whether you're a human or a hard drive somewhere, that's a that that is an entity that's a self it belongs to a partner belongs to a greater apart or a better hole, sorry.

05:23:36

Or at least I would I would add to a grant to saying it could be a self-worthy at least be some sort of machine that is is that basically takes on the character the character of another self and be able to and can be able to say that it is represent is seeking to embody and represent that self for a time something like that.

05:24:00

I think that thought is an emergent property of a type of calculation and just thought is tied to many different things inherently. I think that location is certainly one of those things because it's it's literally inherent to the process like you literally and if if we were to you know, XYZ coordinate this thought it exists in certain atoms in this like, you know, parameter and XYZ coordinates.

05:24:29

You know I was just simply saying Grant I don't know if you understood what I was saying I was just simply saying that a the such a such a machine would it doesn't necessarily have to have its own experiences it could it could live its life on the internet and to be able to embody the experiences of other other cells that have lived but that's basically just like saying that it's just gonna get its information, you know somewhere else like yeah you can use the internet as a source of information that's cool, but it's just source information it's something that unique in a way no.

05:25:01

I mean, no and that's why I spend all this all this time talking about. You know, the sort of theory that I have which is to be able to create all the the mechanism all the mechanisms and all of the the developments that a person would need to go through in order to begin to understand you know, what what it would mean to have the embodiments as Kyle talk but you don't think about it to be an opportunity to do that for a dog or a cat, you just it you just threw an understanding of the world.

05:25:31

Can easily relate to them now because you're like, oh I know cats they're the this her dogs is to the computer would probably do the same thing with even no not disagree. I mean, you're saying that that that an AGI can just basically just sort of just pick up and teach itself without but actually going through the process but you know, no no think about think about um intelligence as it relates to the lowest as it is above us abolishing computer below us a dog.

05:25:59

I think that the the way that animal get learning is done in a brain is is fairly universal and so it's I therefore it's therefore easy to empathize intelligence-wise with what's going on. Right? I'm just saying that it's extremely difficult to do this is not this is none of this oh yeah this is extraordinary definition would definitely be not where we are today.

05:26:30

Right and not only that not just the empathize but to be able to to create all of the language and then all of these experiences that we have that's kind of what I mean is to engage and interact emphasizes how I can catch all.

05:26:50

But yeah apologies I come off as like aggressive that's kind of how I I am yeah, I did notice out of it, but but I see that you're calming down a little bit though after after the first hour and a half will make you come. I I Yeah, it's just how I am.

05:27:08

It's that some people think that way some people think that way, you know, I can't you know, when I was when I was seeing you being kind of aggressive, I was just thinking of myself maybe this guy is just that's the way he needs to be able to be so intense in order to get his thought out and that you know, I don't want to you know that you know just could be just the natural way that that's something else.

05:27:26

You know, it's it's not that I understand it all completely but when I understand something I I'm passionate about it because it's like look. I'm not just you know. Talking on my ass like I think you want to ground it you want to ground yourself in some and say you want to be able to get that some meaning and be able to establish that you got that meaning.

05:27:47

Yeah, I mean AI and and and consciousness is something that I'm like, you know, super passionate about. And it's also something that I completely you know, don't understand. I think I just have the basics of it but I do think that the basics of it are one thing. I want to part on everyone here that I think is super interesting and anyone interested in AI in general should check it out is this thing called a chaos game.

05:28:14

Anyone know what that is or have heard of it. Sounds like I sounds like okay, so basically I just want to ask questions anyone heard a cellular automata. Yes, Stephen Wilfrin. Yeah, yeah. I am a huge fan. Okay, so anyway what chaos game is is okay imagine that you draw three dots you get a piece of paper, okay?

05:28:43

I'm gonna draw three dots on it right it makes a circle or sorry triangle. Now, I'm gonna take a die. And I'm say, hey if it rolls one or two. Sorry first. I'm gonna have this triangle. I'm gonna put a random dot anywhere on it, okay. Ten I'm gonna take a dice or die.

05:29:01

I'm gonna roll it and if it gets a one to two a three to four or five to six. I'm gonna then. Take my marker and put it halfway in between one of those three dots the triangle makes and the initial dot that I made okay. Does that make sense?

05:29:22

Anyway, if I keep on rolling a die and I put it halfway in between the point of the triangle that I initially made and where my last point was. It actually creates an incredibly accurate fractal. So the point of this being is that math and nature it's just literally it's emergent it's baked into what just simple numbers like you can't create a parallel universe like it all is.

05:29:55

Faked into what like the inherent nature of everything and. This is probably what intelligence and thought comes out of too like we're not gonna create an incredibly elegant for loop what we're gonna do is we're gonna understand how nature itself calculates and build on top of that using a physical kind of hardware but it's probably not gonna be some binary one and zeros or you know, how we do logic gates right now.

05:30:24

That's I like I you reduce that you reduce the the pursuit of AGI is a very complex for. Is with any.

05:30:40

I. So, I like that your product seller automatic, 'cause I don't think Asia is gonna come out of artificial neural networks. I think it's gonna be something. Completely different than the way that our brains are structured. Something that works in silicon or whatever medium we end up creating that allows an AGI to emerge from.

05:31:06

And I think it's gonna be something like a cellular model. Now, I wanna also welcome George to the stage and so so welcome George. Mike I sorry I've been listening in the trying to.

05:31:26

Nothing but I at the same time what you guys heard talking about was so interesting that I I couldn't dare to interrupt what you're saying and I hope you're not getting sick of me because in the last few days we're being coming to the same rooms and and but just for the guys who haven't listened or listened to my voice or heard my voice before I'm on urologist and I'm fascinated by computer and brain interfaces.

05:31:52

I even though I have many more understanding about AIs and and how technology is going to work but I keep on thinking how this can be. Translated into into a brain like structure and yeah and I think it's a it's every day it becomes more clearer in my mind but also more difficult to to think about it but I'm the first thing I would just like to mention to Grant when you mention about the universe and mathematics, I'm pretty sure you read or you're familiar with Mark's Mark Techmark's books and not our 
mathematical universe is a is a masterpiece, have you ever read it?

05:32:33

No, I haven't I only know Stephen Rolfe from one. That someone said earlier Christ for Christ's sake going by the book now or get the audio book or yeah right now. Oh our mathematical universe by Mark Tegmark. Next Egmont Amazing Read and he has another follow-up called Life 3.0 will talk to one of my friends.

05:33:01

I have I have that book. One of my buddies like really wanted me to get it. I'll get the book you just show it right now. So read mathematical universe first because I think it's a better sequence of doing this but he but but yeah, he's so he talks all about how everything we know every single concept can be translated into mathematics from the most biological concept of the most abstract concept.

05:33:28

Everything is explained by mathematics. It's amazing. And then life 3.0 he talks about how it talks about life point 1.0 would be the primitive man caveman life. 2.0 is. Industrial revolution and then life 3.0 will be AI and whatever comes after what we're living now, so it's of it's very very interesting.

05:33:51

One of the things you know, right? Sorry, I better cut you off and I'm really bad at that but it's I think one of the interesting things that regarding AI is just that. When it comes about the singularity or whatever and obviously no one knows what that's gonna look like but.

05:34:15

I forget which um, You know scientific author was talking about this but basically I part of me really thinks what will happen is that humans will almost have like a father figure so to speak of. It's like, you know, you're living we're not we're not like slaves to this computer but knowing purpose so they well what's what's this book said talks so this guy talks about that there are three possibilities possibility number one, which is the one that everyone scared of is that they will take over and will be slaves possibility number two.

05:34:53

Will be that we will be co-workers and one will complement the other so they will be much better than us in some aspect. I don't think it is a mayo. I don't think it's idea in it yeah yeah. I'm sorry. I it's just for the lack of a better expression or a word for it and the third possibilities that's AI would be working for us and we will be on a any eternal holiday.

05:35:18

I don't think you're doing but I thought oh, oh it's kind of fun as we just took a turn about a future here what about a forest because what I think it is is it's gonna be. It's gonna be on not they because it's singular because yes and no but yeah since it's singular because they're gonna come up work.

05:35:40

You know it because. So I can't agree with that well it'll grow on top of it. I'm gonna phrasing someone I'm not I'm not saying that this is what I've been because I don't know what you believe in well actually years ago yeah, okay hundred years from now we wake up we go to start our day and we ask Alexa.

05:36:04

Basically whatever the hell we want and you don't have to worry about a job because it's all taken care of but you could ask it imagine asking like God imagine asking almost like an all knowing me whatever the hell you want you just ask it a question you could ask it what you wanted to do that day you could ask it how you could get a date whatever the hell you want like it's literally your premium sidekick but the thing is everyone has that everyone has it you're living in almost a utopia sorts because it's true knowledge and you this knowledge itself wants to get better and us is people we want the knowledge to get better.

05:36:39

Because it helps us and it's a symbiotic relationship and it also like. So is more it it's like gravity it'll suck things into it to help it compute so it's not like there's gonna be a bunch of them because that's it that's that's that's not how it's supposed to that's not how it's gonna go so I I don't agree with that that you know, like so the end there's a bunch of novels like that that the deal with like the future with multiple AIs and and and the thing is like right now the key the situation is like there's like an arms race to be the first to build sentient AI because if you're if someone else, Built the the self-aware network 17 AI first then potentially they could use that to take over the world so you need to build your own so you can defend against the other persons so for a every country needs to build their own self-aware 17 AI to defend against the another country doing the same thing because imagine if um, you know, like we hear a lot of scarce we really hear a lot of scary stories about some of the some of the countries that are very far away and and they you know, they have practices that you know, labor camps and And and lack of freedoms and all these you know, horror stories that we don't we don't like and and what if that what if that country got whole AI first they could they could enslave the world what we and and I'd I do without this has to do.

05:38:14

So I just I'm tired of interruptions, thank you grants, but let's just move on.

05:38:27

Any of you because again as I mentioned before my knowledge is not that great in the technological field, but I've been reading a lot about AI and and things like that so the way the brain works for consciousness is quite interesting because obviously it's not a computer it's it's a group of computing systems right so you have obviously your cortex which is probably what what gives you the action that makes you behave the way you are.

05:39:00

But there are several other structures that are involved but there's a key structure that's called the thalamus which is the relay so most of the information that come from your body to your brain and most of the information that go from your brain to your body and most of the information there that goes.

05:39:19

Go goes through this relay called felons and that's probably why when you were talking previously when you're trying to retrieve a memory you remember the way you were the smells you scented the if you was cold or or hot and this stretcher also retrieves information from your memory centers from your from the hypo campus in your temporal lobes.

05:39:52

And and gives you clues as to how you're going to get where you want to get with the sort of information you're dealing with. So this structure the thalamus is very unique and very interesting and and I and I'll what I wonder whether the computer systems that are involved in generating or creating them and at the form of AI have a similar structure that's working on try to integrate all the centers and try to modulate what kind of sensations are important or not or the equivalent of sensations that what kind of memories are important what kind.

05:40:27

Of memories are not important. So, do you guys have any ideas to whether there is any? That's a very big question you asked their George. The networks aren't that complex yet.

05:40:43

Maybe Google has something maybe Luke maybe has something on their servers, but. But I think it's something that if if we're thinking that we we want to have a machine that's a brain like structure maybe a way of trying to get there is by having such a structure that can get all the information that you want from all different areas that you're creating like, for example, if you want to have a computer that's not only good in playing chess, but putting playing chess and having a conversation with you and and also planning your supermarket listed on all these things.

05:41:19

You probably have to have a a central or a Hub where you can modulate all this information and that you have available and try to make it go in through a pipeline that's a common pipeline that's makes you have the particular action that you're.

05:41:41

And I completely agree with you and there has been something recently a came across a modular neural networks. I think it came out of deep mind research, which is kind of going in that direction. When you have. Multiple neural networks specialized in very specific tasks. But then you link them together.

05:42:08

And basically something like that at the thalamus that'll allows the various features and ways that they represent things to contrafer between the networks. But it's still we're very we're very far away from anything mimicking whether brain does I think? So do you think that the solution is maybe to abolish this idea of building something that looks like a brain and try to find something an alternative way of having an artificial consciousness or intelligence?

05:42:41

Yes. Yeah, that's what we've been talking about here for for quite a while. I'm sorry. I was very late. I'm so sorry. So, um, you know, I was gonna say to Jeremy's point. I think Alan Turin Alan. Turing had this idea that that that we we would solve. On I.

05:43:04

Without the computers would be able to solve consciousness without being able to without weight and we wouldn't need to know how like if you just have enough calculations like it would it would just like, you know, the black box would would you know, you'd run run algorithms and tell the computer is able to just do what we do and and and we wouldn't necessarily it is that right determine do you know about that.

05:43:29

Well, I don't know a lot about it no but I mean all about the concept. I mean, it depends I mean running algorithms but I mean, it just depends, you know, this gets very tricky. I mean in his day, he's talking about running algorithms on what you know and running what mathematical algorithms or you know, what?

05:43:46

You know is unclear as to what what what type of algorithms he had and what what they were supposed to do, right?

05:43:54
I think that gets to the deeper question is even if you had a machine that basically did everything a human does is it actually conscious? No but I think I think Mike I think I understand what your question was is it was a sort of a sideways question what you were sort of saying isn't that what you're trying to do Jeremy and and so how do you how are you going to be able to do what well how you can be able to do that is that what you're waiting no well what I'm saying is like he is like so so he believed that any machine could emulate any other machine and that.

05:44:26

And and and so then but but the idea is a like he he was like he was the guy who was like yeah, we don't need to understand how neurology actually works.

05:44:39

To to I think we do. I mean again, I don't don't get me wrong.

05:44:46

But what I'm saying is that there there is a way before we fully understand all of the neurology there is there's there appears to be at least, you know away to be able to mimic the way that people learn and in the conditions and contexts and experiences and in which in the and and and in the developmental order in which the humans learn and so that if that can be done and if that can be applied in a universal algorithm such that it is it has, A template ability and with with with wildcards so that it can be able to be used and reused over and over again to be able to allow for human questioners to be with the aid of smart humans to be able to use these algorithms to ask questions of the world, it would be an interpreter for smart people to be able to ask questions of the internet or of other databases or you know of of any any data that you can accumulate and then the answers could be could be drawn and then it would begin to be begin to have all of the answers and then All of the the language and all of the the knowledge and then all of the the questions and answers all of it together and then from that you would begin to actually have the information required to be able to make something to be able to not necessarily to make a person but to be able to make sense the way a person can at least make sense of information the way I'm talking to you.

05:46:17

I'm generating a language to begin to get it that what it is to be able to take information and be able to create a smart question out of knowledge and then to be able to take all that information and make a And make that question force that question so that it can go out and actually find answers and then to be able to sift through those answers and differentiate those answers and pick which answers you you find useful and to be able to incorporate that into your knowledge base and so I'm talking about a the the most basic type of AGI would be first, you know, that would be the the first thing that you would get to and so that's that's a general conception of where I'm getting it, okay, that's a very abstract statement that's a bunch of that's very abstract that I what I've said here would require a lot more.

05:47:06

I explanation. I just wanted to say hello and welcome to CEO did you want to say anything? Hi.

05:47:22

ABC6 from 6 hours ago. Yeah, so I would just like to listen in for now. All right so yeah so going back to so so in terms of like, you know what I'm doing in terms of studying neurology, I would say, you know, I would say that people that the the architects of deep learning and there's many but but it may be some of the leading names would be like like yeah Coon and and Jeffrey Hinton and and Yahshua Benjio and this but there's a lot there's a lot of people who are architecting deep learning and, But they but they but these folks are you know the approach is like they they're not trying to do computational neuroscience, they're not trying to make it super accurate, they're they're they're building they're they're building like, you know and not not not not the airplane that has the bat wings like the one that came before the right brothers, but but just the airplane that achieves lift off just the minimum amount of of intelligence to for that machine needs to do that's not it doesn't have to bring the rest of biology with it like what what is not essential about biology and and and just in Just into just focusing on that but it's not like they're ignoring neuroscience they are these folks are do study neuroscience and they study neuroscience because they're in computational biology because they're looking for new new ways to build new kinds of airplanes that are capable of basically, you know neural networks that have new capabilities right how can we how can we make our neural networks more capable and that's sort of like so when I so I mean that that is so then you have guys like jackings which have hockings wants to build a machine that is there's really, Like getting all like being very precise about doing things the way the brain does to the but still but still in a way that's like he's trying to eliminate the nonessential stuff like just isolate the stuff that's essential to intelligence and that's sort of like my like my so my take is a little bit different in that.

05:49:27

I'm really just like I am I guess I guess it's I guess it's a bridge between both right between hot between Jeff Hawkings and Jeffrey Hampton like it's it's like I am really trying to to understand neurology in a deep way and I have been. In. For since 2005 and so that I have this like really deep understanding of neurology and so that I can so that I can construct artificial neural architectures that are you know, basically basically really, you know, deep learning networks that are truly 3d deep learning neural networks and and that's what I think that you have what that is what we have in the brain is.

05:50:16

Is is that a neural circuit really represents a deep a 3d a truly 3d with six degrees of interaction neural network in that it is the inputs to this neural network are are coming in every direction they're coming from above and from below they're coming from the left to the right they're coming from in front and in in back and they're also going out and every in every direction so they truly 3d neural network and and you know right now, We have in in if you look up you can see I mentioned this earlier.

05:50:56

I don't know who was here when I mentioned it but um, but yeah, if you look up recurrent neural networks and look up but look up not recruiting networks. I'm sorry I look up I think it's the term is let's see the term by directional buy directional marinasco, so yes, so this is this camper there and or buy directional LSTM and and so here we are we have people playing with it the the the neural architecture and the and we're taking were saying, okay, we've got, These inputs and we now we can we can send them forward and backward at the same time and we can we can send that we can you know take the input so we can send that we can have tuner on that works basically so we take the inputs instead of taking instead of taking inputs running them in one direction to an output we gonna take the inputs and we're gonna send them two directions to two to two neural networks to two different outputs and then back and and so and then and then well, okay, well what we did that with what if we did like it what if we had took the input and at the same time ran it through three different neural networks sent it in three different directions.

05:52:01

And then sent it back right and and then so like button and now like like and then and also looped it what if we looped it as well and now what if we would if we have what if we're sending it in six different directions right and that in and and then I think yeah so in it and they all loop right they'll look back so they go on six different directions and both ways in different in each direction and then they loop back and then and then and so now you're like just barely like, um, creating a metaphor of what the brain bring us to and Just barely this is because this is like a whole bunch more but like yeah, but like, um, this is um, there's there's so much more to to that and and but but we can't even get close to what the with the brand is doing unless we like expand unless we keep looking at the brain really deeply and expand the the the if we look at the neurophysics of brain oscillations and the the the the transmission of patterns and in the rhythms of the patterns and the directions.

05:53:09

Patterns and the flows of information then that information will help us to construct an X level artificial neural networks that that we can then you know, they we can simplify to just the essential functions and then give those a shot so going back to what Jeremy's model was we take our more advanced cognitive neural networks and and then run them through Jeremy's program of training them the way you would you you would train train a child for example to to train a child but, It's not just training a child.

05:53:44

All the all of the known experiences all of the known psychological and linguistic and experience, you know interactions that it would have you know, all of these sort of life-nitsian universals that that that you would really need to be able to establish what it is that language actually language in an environment actually means in in terms of the the actual like how I'm able to understand you talk to me and how you understand me when I'm talking to you right now, yeah so from from childhood to adulthood and Into the present moment and beyond and but yeah, so like my like I'm saying my point was just that yes so Jeremy you have a process of training which is but it's just really which is realistic and in your and you're it's like I call it extremely extremely highly super fast okay, okay, um, and but that's your focus and my focus is like on on new experimental new architectures.

I think by contrast by contrast. I know that sounds about right okay and it's not I think it's not that you're not also considering experimental architectures. I just that's just our focus today on in a conversation so I think we're about done for the night it was from six to 12.

05:55:12

I want to thank everybody for coming and maybe maybe we'll give every speaker a chance to say something else in closing but algorithm.

05:55:24

Yeah, thanks Mike I enjoyed the conversation and I am heading to bed. I enjoyed the you know I enjoyed the comment I enjoyed the comment your thoughts today Kyle and I I enjoyed the other guys thoughts a little less it was a little bit difficult to deal with but still still a smart fellow and and Micah I think we every time that we meet, you know, we and to Kyle too every time we meet we sort of learn a little bit more about what the others doing and it's a it's a sort of a long winding road but I really appreciate you know, we're some of the few people on here that that actually stick it out with each other and sort of have the patience to sort of, you know iterate with the other and sort of imag.

05:56:06

Ine just what the heck the other one might be up to and. Know whereas most of these conversations deteriorate so quickly into chaos. So, I really appreciate the stick tuitiveness that we all seem to possess. Sure. And in Cecilia, you can go next and I'll even hang out do you want to come up and say something before we go?

05:56:29

They should make it so that the people on the on the bottom should be able to at least talk to the people on the top sometimes.

05:56:41

Here I be cutting out this yellow. You just maybe try again if you want.

05:56:49

You want to try one more time? Cecilia you want to try to take your microphone off so that you could speak.

05:57:09

Here it's okay. So sometimes sometimes her she says, she's had been having signal problems this week because of a glitch and clubhouse so um, yeah.

05:57:30

You see how we know what's the seal as we know that she's she finished talking when she didn't finish but we still can fill in some of the planks. We can't hear you but I think we all filled in some of the blanks as to what it is that you're applying.

05:57:42

Yeah, that's okay. So in Ciel it's very glad to be here but she's late to the party is with us all we heard and then her she cut out but that's um, that's okay, that's okay and give Ali a chance to talk and and then we'll go ahead and end it.

05:58:01

Yeah, thanks, um, this was very interesting discussion. I didn't have a chance to listen to all of it, but I had to make dinner and now I have to go to sleep but the parts that I did listen to I did learn a lot so. Thank you for holding this room and I will drop in again later when you are back on again, thank you great thank you it's all it's all been recorded and so I'll share a copy online and people can listen to it again if they want oh that's cool that's cool but by the way Mike ask a quick question, yeah.

05:58:43

Do you know because I used to work with this guy Ben Gertzel do you do you know, what what's going on with him these days is he yeah he moved back to America, you know, I it's the sale it's the same might know more and maybe she maybe but why don't you why don't you message me and and I'll connect you with the seal or if you can message her directly that's fine also but but I think she might be a little bit more secures.

05:59:07

I was just curious that's all you I think she's more on top of what's going on with Ben than I am so but but we could probably get you the answer. Later on. Oh, that's that's cool, although although well anyway, well yeah. I'll talk to you later, okay. Where would they recording be by the way, um, so if you follow me on Twitter, um, I'm gonna post it there and um, Yeah and if you if you if you if you want to make sure that that you catch it you could also just send send send send me a message in about a week, okay, so set your calendar send me message about a week in about a week and I'll send it to you for sure by then.

05:59:48

Okay cool this can be a cool conversation. I think yeah, yeah. I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna do these very often so yeah very often because you know why because I think that you know, we we have a lot happening with Pete and with neuroscientists and and deep learning folks and BCI folks, you know on Clubhouse but but you know and I expected that we'd be seeing an a group like this every single day, but unfortunately there isn't a group like this every single day and I think that, Beneath to be in that's why it's basically my thinking here is that like you know, but but but I like before I commit to doing it every day.

06:00:31

I want to make sure that I can I can do two things at the same time like I can actually work on I can actually do my work while hosting this this this meetup, so if I can do both at the same time, then I can just have this like open sort of open chat every day, but but I have to see if I can do that before.

06:00:51

I before I commit to it. That's what I'm thinking.

06:00:59

Sounds good. All right, so I'm taking a night and I'm gonna be good night yeah good night everyone good night see you again next time. Good night.
