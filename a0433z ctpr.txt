Ok if the Mind is not a Mystery then lets have a detailed explanation. Whilst your at it it Micah maybe you could tell me how when a person is afflicted by a serious brain injury their personality and skill change. Where is the prediction there?

Read the book I recommended first then we can talk.

I have explained it to dozens of people, and my own book is nearing completition.

We have a prediction based consciousness. Every moment is a sequence of expectations. What you see is a spacial metaphor built by expectations. In other words its a narrative (of beliefs) that defines the difference between red and the moon and your foot. Without this inner narrative you would not know the difference between your foot and the moon, and the color red. Bertrand Russell's philosophy failed when Godel proved it wrong. Didn't you read "Godel Escher Bach" and "I am a strange loop" by Douglas Hofstadter I have much more to share about the mind and consciousness, but first you must read 'On Intelligence' as a prerequisite.

Russel's philosophy was built on the foundation of his math, his math was proven wrong. There is a wrong when your philosophy is purported to be built on a view of mathematics that is proven false. What freewill? Scientific determinism is reality. There is no mechanism of choice in the brain. Everything you think, or do is a reaction to the deep interconnected layers of meaning that are shaped by the life experience. I have answers for every question, answers that go very deep. However if you really want to know, show me, by reading 'on intelligence' first.

physics is the creator, physics results in every form, every thought, every belief, every tree, every action, ever skyscraper, every result, physics is all powerful, omnipresent, and contains the information that builds everything.
