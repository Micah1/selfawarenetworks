(if you see a date under the note identification number that means I recognized that the note was old and I looked up the date of when the original note was saved (in another system) most of the undated notes are newer, and some of the older dated notes have had new things added to them. I can lookup dates upon request to add them to notes if you want to know when the note was added to my other note library (that is not on github)
(hippocampus, emotion, category theory) 
Felix Lanzalaco the system is too self optimizing thats the problem. It clogs itself up with itself basically at the same time hippocampal neurogenesis, slows down.

Micah Blumberg "the system is too self optimizing thats the problem. It clogs itself up with itself basically" can you expand on this particular part of that notion? what is your understanding of how "too much self optimizing" leads to "the brain clogging itself up with itself"? are you talking about getting tripped up by organizational complexity of all the information inputs into your life and mind?

Felix Lanzalaco its more about models of addiction. we become increasingly re-enforced with who we are in the striatum. The hippocampus ability to refresh our perspectives by neurogenesis wears out. This is just idea of the season though, dont take it seriously. Basing it on the the concept we aren't evolved to learn a lot past age 25. 

I worked on aging studies where we looked at changes in brain structure. Ability to encode decreases. One of the findings though is perspective plays a major role. If you find out you have a terminal illness tommorow your brain will alter its structure as if you were 70 and realized time was running out. If you had a faulty diagnosis the brain function returns, but this is not depression, you actually become more positive in outlook when time is running out. The theory is called Socioemotional Selectivity theory. Now i need a tenous link to return this divergence to the theme of this group.

Felix Lanzalaco Ok, yes category theory predicts that there is a category group SST, which maps on to the domain of normal subjects. A subset of SST has a Forgetful functor which co-limits a Pre-Abelian category ...

Micah Blumberg So by Socioemotional Selectivity Theory would AGI exhibit more moral behavior if it's self awareness had a finite time limit?

Felix Lanzalaco they didnt study moral decision making that I know off, but it might do as when time limit kicks in you adhere to old values as they are familiar and comforting. That would apply if your AGi was a direct copy of mammalian brain.

Micah Blumberg That's powerful stuff to consider thanks
