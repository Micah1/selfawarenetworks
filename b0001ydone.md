Think of the evolution of neural networks inside our bodies as similar to the evolution of the relationship between mitochondria and cells, and the relationship between metal ions and cells.

(audio notes transcription needs fixing)

All life contains metals. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and these things are metals on the periodic table of contents. The exchange of these metal ions in neurons allows organisms to conduct electricity. Organisms use metal to conduct electricity to attain higher levels of function (Neural Network Function). Organisms evolved neural networking functions, the ability to predict, remember, detect, perceive, render, see, consider, and react.

Mitochondria are bacteria, not part of human dna. Our mitochondria are a human symbiote, they live in our cells, they are efficient at producing ATP that we need to function, but the DNA of Mitochondria is bacteria, it's not human.

There is mitochondria in every cell of the human body, it helps us to produce more energy than we could otherwise.

I've described a beneficial relationship between mitochondria and the cells of the human body. Based on energy. There's also a beneficial relationship between metals and neurons, between metals & neural networks, electricity enables faster & higher level functions, like cognition.

It's like the organism said 'okay I'll carry this metal and and move this metal around, this computation that results improves my survival and reproductive statistics. So the program of evolving brains is carried by evolution. Evolution powers the development of real neural networks.

There is a beneficial relationship between these neural networks and cells or between the neuron, the neural networks, and organisms.

Evolution has gone down the path of saying yes we want more metals, more neural networks made out of neurons and glial cells, more brains, more hearts, more organs, more bodies, more skin, more eyes, and more ears.

This is the path evolution walked. It brought us here. The idea is that we as organisms evolved neural networks that compute our representation or our internal computational rendering of reality, including our rendered concept of self.

Our relationship with metals and neurons and computations evolved the same way as our relationship with mitochondria. This perhaps accidental start of organisms integrating metals and then those metals conducting signals or being part of the process of the functioning of the human brain.

Think of it as a neural network having a symbiotic relationship with the organism (the human body). The neural network and the animal body have a symbiotic relationship in a valid sense. Humans have really fancy cells, cell networks, neuron & glial cell networks, compared to say mice.

See it as, over the eons of evolution, there was a progression that led to human neural networks rendering reality as you experience it today.
