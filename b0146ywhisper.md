Note this version of b0146ywhisper is perfect for reading along while listening to the audio here: https://recorder.google.com/b05673ce-0f9d-4d54-918e-1d054b8be409

Note the other version of this document, b0146yhand, has a lot of hand written fixes to the original transcription, including some interesting links. So it is similar but a little bit different to this note.

Disclaimer: After rereading Graziano months after this note I take back my earlier assessment or criticism of Graziano's TPJ Consciousness Module Conjecture, in that I do not think he was limiting the function of the TPJ to a consciousness module by virtue of it's activation during phenomenological consciousness perception of an item in front of a subject under study such as an Apple infront of a patient. His view is far broader & more complex in hindsight, but not so self limiting & specific.

Title: Graziano Neurons Consciousness Animals

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

artificial consciousness shit, data and C-3PO so I see neurons as something

different like there's there's you know the neuron is a multimodal neural

network but it also but it's also the case that it's it's you know when I

describe neurons like it's not news to anybody that neurons oscillate

tonically it's not news to a neuroscientist but you don't hear that in

the average description when a neuron is described the function of a neuron is

described they say the neuron is something that you know receive signals

from other neurons and then when it reaches certain threshold it fires but

they don't talk about the neurons discriminating against with with

difference the neuron basically doing pattern recognition right like like

where it in order to do pattern recognition that means that you don't

just fire when you fill up with data you fire when you receive a certain

pattern and you don't fire if you don't receive a certain pattern right so I

really liked you know Peter TSE his book criteria causation or the neural

basis of free will criteria causation he talked about how you know a neuron

criteria could be set in terms of you know thresholds at the synaptic at the

synapse the NNM DA synapse and the AMPA synapse can they can have a threshold

where if they receive incoming signals within three milliseconds that you know

for example or two milliseconds maybe it's three and a half milliseconds but

there's a specific window that they're looking for if signals arrive outside

that window that's not going to cause a synaptic firing event it's not going to

you know cause a

good neuron to fire but but we also want to say there's definitely opportunities

for neurons to reject signals like you could get a lot of a lot of a lot of a

lot of you know like the example of the neuron that only fires when it receives

horizontal data it is imagine that this neuron could be sent a whole bunch of

vertical data in the form of like having you know neurotransmitters being sent

from other neurons to it but in order to but because it's the wrong pattern it

has to have some way to use those that flood of electrical activity so that it

doesn't fire when it gets the wrong pattern and you see there's a lot of

like you know it could be that the you know sodium channels could be blocked or

inhibited or it could be that the that potassium channels could be upregulated

or or opened early so that potassium floods out earlier to inhibit the the potential

of the action potential before it it's it happens there's some there is you know

so events on the synaptic level that can be can modify the you know operation of

the of what the synapse response to and therefore what the dendrite response to

and then the dendrite itself is is you know dendrite includes is is this

Britain is yeah I don't know all the all the mechanisms how a cell might reject

or it might self-inhibit its own firing if it's not getting it's not getting the

pattern that it's looking for but that is the basically the hypothesis that is

basically a hypothesis and it cuts to like basically the granularity of pattern

detection whether there is like a microscopic pattern detection whether

each each neuron can be a pattern detector and I've heard arguments to say

okay well you know whether the whether the neuron there was a paper that came

out so the neuron is a is a two-layer neural network and then there was later

paper that said well the dendrite is a five-layer neural network and it can

report temple and spatial patterns across across its membrane it can detect

temple and spatial patterns right so I mean the spatial patterns you like you

know things are right could be it could be as simple as let's say a special

pattern is you have a lot of different receptors in a lot of different branches

of a dendrite and it's a spatial pattern because it's like it's like pixels all

over the place there's a literally space between these activations of these

different branches and a different of sodium being pumped into different

branches of the dendrite so that's a spatial pattern and then over time as the

amount of sodium increases or decreases or the answer really like the amount of

charge increases or decreases in these branches of the dendrite you are that

is perhaps something that is a physical manifestation of of a temporal pattern

right like oh like if there's this like large sequence where branch number one

fills up branch number two fills up branch number three fills up in that

order the neuron is going to remember the go the order of that sequence

that means it has to be basically the detection of phases or changes inside a

temple inside a temporal window that that is on a topological or spatial with

the topologic or spatial distribution so there's a there's a temple window of

phases being received on the topology of the dendrite with the literal and

physical embodiment of charge building up via the injection of sodium ions and

the the exfiltration of potassium ions right that is it literally like a short

term time keeping mechanism that is true that is learning the temple spatial

patterns associated with the the temple the temple spatial patterns of phases

okay so the phase the phases you know phases between phases are like you know

two or more it's like a sequence map of two or more neurons that are firing

within a certain millisecond as detected by synapse okay so with the

tension schema he's proposing that there are some mechanisms that are driving

attention that are not directly related to the neurons themselves or that they

are neurons at a higher level that are driving attention in lower levels or

maybe so I was just going to say that it could be possible for different levels

of of neurons to each be contributing to driving attention because they're

essentially selecting to playback patterns preferred patterns that they've

learned so maybe the pattern is partially triggered and that causes the

network to play back that pattern to to take it to try to complete a pattern and

it's sort of like the momentum of that pattern being partially triggered that

might cause the neural circuit to go in search of that pattern and so by going

in search of that pattern it might drive and coordinate the activity of other

neurons in in the pursuit of completing the pattern that it it it it thinks it

detects and so you have basically ensembles of neurons or neurons of

different levels large groups of neurons but also single neurons at a

tipping point that can shift the direction of behavior towards the selection

of one pattern or another based upon what they think it's going to be there

and and maybe that we could define sort of like what what neurons are attracted

to and that it might be that they're just attracting to completing certain patterns

and certain patterns that have certain rewards and I guess we could you could

argue okay those those are chemical rewards and some instances but the

chemical rewards are linked to patterns being completed essentially but it's

like the momentum the magnetic and electric and chemical momentum completion

because of the rhythm and readiness of neurons to complete patterns sometimes

induces basically where the organism is driving the completion of its own

patterns or driving its own narrative in deviation of signals that the external

environment is trying to feed the system it seems that Michael Graziano thinks

of consciousness as as you know something that one tiny piece of your brain

adds like it's something you add on to your models of reality so you know he

describes that you know you have a model of something visual in your visual

cortex and maybe you have models of words in your auditory cortex and you'll

you'll you'll have you'll be able to identify faces in your in your temporal

cortex and but but then you know somehow the activity in the temporal pride or

junction or the TPJ is going to add a consciousness module to the whole

operation so it's like in a conscious model means you have a model for what

consciousness is but it also means that you're conscious and so like there's

just like kind of I think that I think there's an unspoken conflation that he

doesn't make but there's like an unspoken conflation between what part of your

brain becomes active the TPJ when you are phenomenally conscious of the thing

that you're paying attention to that you're that your lower senses are paying

attention to so it's possible that you could put an apple in front of someone

so that their their eyes can see the apple but they're not paying attention to

the apple they're paying attention to someone else and so there is like this

separation between what attention is and the attention schema theory and what

consciousness is because you know you might have an apple in your in your

receptive field that you're not conscious of and so attention and

consciousness for two different things but your but your brain might be we

might see that your brain on the low in the lower levels may perhaps in the

visual cortex is tracking the apple even if it hasn't registered to you and so you

know what what what the researchers some researchers believe is from based on

their observations is that you know when that person it when the apple is there

in front of them and they're aware of it they see the temporal junction lighting

up so like yeah so temporal junction which I joked is the elite which could

be the LED of the conscious system is the indicates the conscious consciousness

is happening I think he interpreted interprets it as a consciousness module

which is like if you have this additional component then you can be

conscious and you can understand what consciousness is and you can describe

consciousness and it's just a module right like it's a place where the model

of consciousness and the information sort of like

traffic to in such a way that you can now you know speak of a

conscious and describe it you can say things like I am conscious because I'm

conscious which is he points out as a bit of it is is is not it's not a very

satisfactory thing to say it may be tautological to say I'm conscious because

I'm conscious and you wouldn't be like if you just had a machine that just told

you like a computer if you're trying to it's not that's not a very good turning

test right if the computer just is unconscious unconscious it doesn't

really it's not very informative it doesn't really pass along the I think

what you need I think what we're looking for when we are testing machines now

is a turncast almost it's like well does the machine transform and return

information and knowledge the way a human being would right this does the

machine can I can I say something and describe pictures describe animations

describe places and people and all the knowledge representations and properties

of the models that represent all these people and get to a place where you know

my just my discussion of all of these concepts is something that is something

that is resonating with the other person in a sense that I can that seems seems

like a human like seems like I'm interacting with the human being or

with the with the conscious entity in some way I guess you know I guess in the

case of in the case of animals people sometimes feel like their dogs are

conscious or their cats are conscious and so but any animal can't obviously like

give you a complex response and transform words into other words and in

as far as reading the mind of an animal there's there's some animal can make

sounds the animal can make movements and and so there's a combination of nonverbal

and and communication but also auditory communication but the but I think it is

it is very interesting that animals do take turns communicating that cats like

when you communicate with it with the cat you can make various sounds and the

cat will respond to some of your sounds and cats use sounds to communicate with

one another and so there's like a hissing sound which means the cat is not

happy and so you can make inferences well well it's not happy about what well

whatever is an association spatially or temporarily with that hissing sound you

know like oh there's a raccoon in the window okay cats hissing they get like

telling that other animal to get get away or something or letting the rest of

us know that there's it that there's a raccoon in the window so the cat so the

so animals are communicating but then you know you can talk to an animal but

the animal is really is really able to take turns listening to what your

expression is and its animals seem to stop and consider even even birds birds

will I've seen birds they look around and they consider the movements of

people and bicyclists and cars and they they're like listening and watching with

their eyes and ears or you know like like like a self-driving car that a bird

has to predict where it can fly and where it can't fly so has to predict the

landscape and has to predict the momentum and orientation and direction and the

the velocity of every of every object in the city that's around that bird

otherwise it might get hit by a bicycle or get hit by a car or get hit or get

eaten by by a larger bird or you know who knows what but but it is that's the

key is that is that there is a sort of I don't want to say handshake but a sort

of exchange and the exchanges between humans and animals they have there's

exchange rates temporal exchange rates like the rates in which I'm gonna listen

for about this long before I talk I'm going to observe for about this long

before I do and this sort of external communication between between animals

between persons it also happened it also happens inside your brain where you

have basically networks of cells that are chatting which means that some of

them are sending messages while others are listening and then the ones that

were that that sent messages become inhibited for a while so and while a

different set of neurons is going to fire based upon what they listen to and

in what and while that's happening there's another set of neurons that's

that's listening to those neurons and those neurons when it's their turn to fire may be

the first set of neurons is ready again and so this is yeah this is like the

three sets of neurons small like imagine you had just to oversimplify it a bit

imagine that you had the entire v1 what is going to respond at once and it's

going to respond by some of the neurons getting excited and some of them being

inhibited and some of them remaining in in a tonic oscillation most of them

remaining in a tonic oscillation okay and then so then you have the v2 and the

v2 is listening to the v1 and so now in the v2 you're going to have the neurons

that we're listening which is you know all of them you're going to have a

situation where some of them get excited and some of them get inhibited and this

this is a reflection of the patterns that they that the v2 was observing but

it's a transmission reflection so the transmission is the reflection the

reflection it now I guess I guess the series is going to keep going up the

hierarchy but some signals also travel backwards downwards they travel in three

different directions you know it's in six different directions it's signal

travel up and they travel down they travel left they travel right and they

travel forwards and backwards they spread out radially they shoot back down to the

first layer shoot up to before they shoot to the to another brain region the

bridal cortex and they shoot to the temporal cortex this is the auditory cortex
