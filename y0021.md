On gravity: imagine reality as a movie. \n Yeah so I'm imagining like um in the case of 3D semantic segmentation you have a volumetric video. 3D semantic segmentation yeah that's when you what? That's when you uh basically are trying to get the computer to look at a volumetric video which is basically volumetric. Volumetric means that the video is not just 2D, it's also 3D. Also 3D? How do you like add a 3D-ness? Usually you like, you combine the viewpoints from multiple cameras together. And you sort of plot the 3D... No wording, Pat. Yeah. Nice. So in a 2D movie, you only have to worry about plotting where the 2D pixels are for your frame, but in a 3D movie, in a volumetric movie, you have to plot, you have to, the computer, you have to save basically the locations of how the pixels change for every point in space. So it's a huge like data flood because you've got a lot, you're not just doing one frame from one perspective, you're doing every point in a in a 3d like 3d picture picture. Yeah Yeah So the theory is that if you If you want to understand like quantum basically my new unified field theory basically it's based on the frame unified unified field theory yeah because no no it's the type of theory yes there are theories of this way yeah this is mine my take on the unified field theory which has never been unified unified field theory which has never been satisfactory there's no there's no one that ever does no unified field theory that everyone accepts Okay, sure yeah Yeah, yeah the answer that satisfies everyone This could be it? This could be it. It would satisfy everyone because, why? Well because it takes two things that have been separate for a long time, gravity and quantum physics, and it brings them together in a way that makes sense. What is the overlap? So the overlap is... Very very small, very very far. So on the scale, if you're talking about what is gravity, in terms of why do I stick to the ground and not fly up into the sky? Why does mass have a gravitational attraction? Why am I attracted to the earth instead of flying into space? Why does the gases of the earth sit on the Earth instead of flying away? So it's the why that you're probing. Well, on the classical scale, classical scale versus quantum scale, on the classical scale, gravity has been solved. Gravity's solved, okay. At least the classical scale is like human level experience. On the quantum scale, gravity, well, I wanna say that gravity has been solved, but like most of the world doesn't know about my theory yet. So it's like most of the world would say no, but on the quantum scale how gravity works has not been solved. It has not been solved. What is a quantum scale theory of gravity and why is it different than classical? So I'm just saying like, so at the classical scale we have time dilation, which is where, which is basically like saying that when you are, if you're moving faster through space, you're not moving as fast through time. But if you're moving faster through time, you're not moving as fast through space. Right. So if you're... So if you're up in the, if you're moving super fast, then if you're moving super fast. This is weird, because I'm using my... And I'm moving super slow, then you... In space. Yeah, in space. So... If you're moving super fast in space and I'm moving super slow in space, then like for you, like, it's like, um, time could be moving at a different... Would time be moving faster, faster fast, is it time to move slow when you're moving fast I Could I always get it mixed up, but I think it's something to the fact that if you're if you're if you move faster Through space then you move slower through time. Okay, and it's lower through space Time is moving faster. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so if you're moving slower through space, time is moving faster than you. Yeah. Okay, so it's the opposite. If you want to slow down time, move faster. Yeah. If you want to slow down... But you're, but you're not, but you're only slowing, you're only like changing... Your perception of time and space. No, not, you're not your perception of time. You're changing, um, uh, how time is for you relative to someone who's not moving at that speed. So it's only relative to another point of reference for the same measurement of time and space? Yeah. So you have to be within a controlled environment? Not necessarily. So like for example like a clock, if you put a clock on a satellite that's moving through around the atmosphere really fast yeah that clock is going to tick faster than a clock on the earth depending on where the earth is because different parts of the earth have different gravity different different different masses. You're saying gravity changes time and space? Yeah. Okay, that's the overlap. It curves. So no, gravity curves, gravity. Joe, John John Florence surfing with 100 puppies all in the same surfboard. Wow, and they used the celebrity. They used the celebrity, but his face looks weird. I don't know. So gravity curves space time. They used the celebrity. But my argument is, my argument is that gravity curves space time. But my argument is that gravity curves space-time by increasing the frames of time. So going back to the movie, okay so imagine that... that. Oh, I feel like that's your green saver. This is my favorite surfer. So imagine that whether it's a 2D movie, like the traditional movie, like Avatar or something, or a 3D volumetric movie where everything's in 3D, in either scenario, all the pixels in that movie have to advance in the same frame rate. So if you're watching a movie at 60 frames per second, every second, there are 60 changes to every pixel. Now imagine that you mess with time. And so imagine that all the pixels did not have the same frame rate. So it's like a random assortment. Could be random or could be intentional. But imagine that. They have different rates than just 60 per minute. It's like this movie could have. It could be computation. Computation. So it's a patchwork instead of a line. Yeah, it could be like a group. It could be like a group. Like a different pace? A selection. It could be a selection of pixels that change faster than some other selection of pixels. So you'd just be training the pixels ahead of time? You'd have already done all this pixel change. You're saying some of the pixels will move faster than the others. I'm saying let's imagine that space-time itself is a grid of 3D pixels. And that the way human beings have been thinking about space time is that all the pixels are changing at the same time. But we know from dilation that if you put... What's dilation? Time dilation. What is dilation? Time dilation. It means that time is not consistent everywhere. So if you put a watch, if you put a clock on a satellite, it's going to move at a different, it's going to click at a different, it's going to. This is so cool. I wrote Michael Phelps is a dolphin and is part of a dolphin while flipping through the air. So let me show you. These are kind of cool. All right. But basically the idea is that, time dilation means that time doesn't move the same, at the same pace everywhere. So up in space, time moves differently than it does down here. Like two watches. This is a dolphin. This one's a little bit weird. Nice. That looks like a vehicle. Yeah. Yeah, so time does not move the same everywhere. Now, if you take that idea down to the quantum scale, so what would time dilation mean at the quantum scale? It says, my idea is that every mass is basically a time crystal. Every mass, even at the quantum scale, like you know, quantum scale we're talking about atoms, we're talking about atoms, we're talking about qubits, we're talking about electrons, we're talking about particles, uh, glial cells, I'm not, what did I say glial cells were, but like, you know, protons and, and and um positrons and different quantum particles right particles little small pieces smaller than smallest subatomic subatomic pieces each have a time stamp or their own rate they have they have they have flexibility to change rate so it's like okay so it's like imagine that um a particle is like um I don't know it could be expressed that there's there's ways that characterize particles as either like uh as waves you know that have a that or as as energy as energy yeah so if you have a crystal in space that means that the like this is a crystal in space the broccoli because it takes a 3d shape Now if it has a form that changes through time Right that then its expression. It's if it takes a crystal shape through through time right where it has this 3d structure It's only it only becomes apparent over time That's a time crystal it only becomes apparent over time as a time crystal. Because it's not just acting in a spatial dimension, it's not just a 3D thing, it's a 4D thing, it's a thing that makes itself apparent over time. Basically everything is a time crystal. Time crystal. Do dolphins get married in Victorian society? Nice. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Have you seen those pictures of babies in flower pots? I don't know. Those were really popular in the 90s, and I feel like that's your jam. They also dressed up a specific breed of dog in human clothes. Is that the one where it's like a dog? No, this was photographed. That was part of that, but no, it was mostly like... commercial art. Yeah. It's pretty much your alley. So, a particle, which could be a wave, or could be a particle, or could just be like some like... So a particle... It's like some potential amount of energy. Potential energy, yeah. It's like some potential amount of energy. Potential energy, OK. Let's just say that it's this nebulous thing that's difficult to describe. Sure. But it's really small, and they make up space. They make up the 3D space. These are our pixels. These are our pixels. OK, and you're saying each of them. I'm saying that they don't all move at the same rate. They just haven't been realized yet? Like so we think of time as something that is and I could be like maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way but I think of like people think of time as like this constant. Oh consistent. Like it's a constant. The word they would use is constant. It's a time constant. Yeah. And the constant says you know basically like in a manner of speaking we're all kind of moving at the speed of light, except that because we're moving forward in time, like, that we have to subtract our light speed to add to our time speed. So basically, there's a constant where, like, the total constant is, like, if you added up the amount of time we're spending in time and the amount of time we're spending in space it adds up to the speed of light or something or the constant. It's like this relative relationship between... Is it like latitude longitude kind of thing of like that's how we know where we are at any given point of like both time and space or is it what is it what is that like that equation that you're saying we use right now this is the classical understanding of time and space is that I'm oversimplifying it it's not really like yeah you can't oversimplify that part okay so maybe more complicated okay so you guys theory in detail would be that two cheetahs fall in love and get married in Victorian society. Okay so let's say so the idea is why does why does gravity work at the colonoscopy? There's also a book that has an illustration from like early 70s that has two tigers that get married. Oh yeah, two leopards get married in Victorian society. I have to do cheetahs and leopards because I don't even know the difference visually, so I just have to put both. But the cheetahs are a little more flamboyant, the leopards are a little more refined. Okay, and then, oh my god, wait, I put Noah's Ark has a masquerade ball which is really cool each image is so cool wait I'm still kind of loading I mean I just have each what was I saying? you're gonna explain in not super like as condensed terms but in like still English oh yeah so what so why does a planet move, say, in orbit around the Sun? And the planet is essentially like, let's say that this is the Sun and this is the planet, okay? And it's basically always falling, it's basically always falling, but it's falling, but the shape of space means that as it moves through space, it's always falling slightly towards the Sun but not completely. So it stays in orbit and so it never flies into the Sun or away from the Sun. It's being pulled just the right amount. I'm going to show you the Noah's Ark masquerade ball. I just have to enlarge every single picture. This is the first one. Isn't this so cool? This ark has a masquerade ball. You're just like, yo, you guys, we're stuck out here. Let's party. Masquerade ball, everyone. Okay, so that's image number one. Now, image number two. So basically, Einstein argued that space-time is curved. Image number two. Noah's Ark has a masquerade ball. Nice. I like that one better. Actually, there's an artist who's from Spain, and he wrote this one called Black Sad, and it looks like that. Because it's like noir, but it uses animals as space-time. This one's just kind of fun. Noah's Ark has a masquerade ball. That's also very cool. So I mean, so space is curved everywhere, but you don't see the curves right you just see how the forms i just thought they were all amazing yeah have you ever seen like you know when they put the like they're trying to explain how gravity works and they put everything on like a trampoline no or oh you haven't seen that image it's like they're trying to explain why they're like like you see the solar system but like they show like a bowling ball like in a fabric or something it's like it's being pulled into like a circular orbit okay because the net the actual shape of space is like sort of like cupping it and guiding it it's like accommodating yeah it's like accommodating but there's like no but there's nothing actual there there's nothing actually there's nothing providing resistance that we can see all right so it's like an end it's like, no, but there's nothing actual there. There's nothing providing resistance that we can see. All right, so it's like an invisible curvature of space, and they call that gravity. And they're trying to detect a gravity particle or something to indicate what is this gravitational force that's like curving space in a way that we can't see. And so my argument is that it's curving time. And the reason that creates an attraction, it's not curving space, it's curving time and the reason that creates an attraction it's not curving space, it's curving time and the reason that creates the force of attraction of force of gravity is because because a particle has this like this hyper sort of like particles like this hyper hyped up energy imagine it's like this fuzzy ball of like I got to do something and it has to move somewhere yeah and it can move with the probability go here or here here or here left or right up and down in any direction and in space with nothing to pull it in one direction or another direction it's randomly gonna move in any random direction yeah the direction it goes but if there's a mass near it Okay. That's the... Just statistics, or like random, or chance, or whatever you call it. The direction it goes. But if there's a mass near it, then what happens is, the mass is distorting space. It's warping space. It's creating the curvature of space. It's contracting space. Contracting space. Yeah. It's attractive to bring in, right? Yeah. Is it creating gravity? So, where you have mass, you have basically, there's a lot more density. A lot more density, a lot more per some volume. So the earth is a volume, and that volume has a lot of density, which means it's very like thick, or it's very like. What's that? Two slimy faceless worms fall in love. Or it's very like... Um... What's that? Two slimy faceless worms fall in love. So where you have something like... Oh, I've seen Princess Ponno, okay. Yeah, I've seen that. It looks like a bee. Um... But anyway, the argument is just that. Also, this one was pretty cool too. It's kind of more like the worm falls in love with the human. That's cool. There's a German more like the worm falls in love with the human. That's cool. There's a german artist who does stuff like that with the like shiny creatures. Yeah. Do you want to see a play structure that's made of green slime and it's melted? We should put this on the tv. Do you ever, you don't have a tv? I don't have a tv. Oh. Let me just wait for it to get... So there's density and there's... so having a mass... so there's random little fuzzy energy. Yeah, we're calling particles. It might be waves or they might just be... I think they're all waves. Nebulous something. Nebulous particle. And there's a fire in the background, but there's no fire in the background. One of them looks a little smoky isn't that cool yeah yeah love it okay so imagine it has imagine it has no choice it has to move in one direction randomly how do you know now well i mean well we're just like we're just like imagining this is this is what it did we're just imagining that imagining doesn't have a choice um for the of argument. So imagine a chessboard that has, and by the way River plays chess, pretty good, pretty good at it. But if you imagine that a particle on the chessboard is like a pawn, it could move in any direction, or maybe it's like a king, but only one, it's a king because it can move in any direction. Right, but only one at a time. Or maybe it's like a king. It's like a king because it can move in any direction, but only one at a time. So imagine that the odds basically you have the odds. Imagine nine squares. The center square is the ninth square. So all the squares around it are eight squares. So the odds of the particle moving, because it doesn't have a mind, it's random, the odds of it moving in odds of the particle moving, because it's not, it doesn't have a mind, it's random, the odds of it moving in any of the different eight directions are one in eight, right? It's like there's one, there's one chance in eight that the particle is going to move to this square, because there are eight possible squares that it can move to. So it has to, has to, one chance in eight. Okay. And if you imagine those squares are the pixels in our movie. So imagine that if you one of the pixels changed faster than another. Let's say that if you have a pixel that we have eight squares but one of the squares changes faster. So like's like- When you say changes, what does it mean? So like imagine that what we're really saying is you have eight squares for every one second. Eight squares for every one second. But now- Do you want to see s'mores made out of green slime? But now, yes. Yeah. S'mores made out of green slime. Wow. It looks like an ad campaign for hers. I don't know that this is appetizing, but. It honestly looks like something that could have been on Pinterest for like, do you wanna do a oobleck, you know, like the oobleck of the. By the way, if the battery starts to die, I have a charger. Oh, I think we're okay. You're okay? I think it's okay. Okay, I didn't know, but I brought it just in case. So, it's one second, and then one of the squares is moving faster than a second. Yeah, so every second you get eight squares. And so the particle has to move in one of the eight directions for every second. However. has to move in one of the eight directions for every second. However, if you have one of the squares or two of the squares that are updating faster than the rest of the squares, then those squares are updating maybe it could be two times per second instead of one time per second. So from the particles perspective, if you have one that's updating an additional time perspective, it's like there's additional space there. So you have eight that's updating an initial time perspective it's like there's additional space there so you have eight spaces eight possible places where the particle could go one of them per second if one of the squares updates twice as fast as the rest of the squares then there are eight squares where the particle could go plus one additional place where the particle could go which is one of the eight squares. You appeal it, appeal it. Appeal. Yeah. OK. But I tried appealing, wait, did I try appealing one and it said accepted, but it didn't actually make it? It said it's been accepted. OK. I don't actually know. So it can make it. It says your appeal's been accepted, but then, oh wait, let me try it again. So it can go to eight places plus the place that is now created by the uptime. By time. By time. By time. By time. By time. Time has added another square. And has that changed the probability? Yes. Because instead of like, so now the idea that it can go to any of the eight squares around it has changed. Because the probability is if there's basically there's an additional square in time, for every second, there's seven squares here and there's two basically there's an additional square of time like for every second there's seven squares here and there's two squares here usually it was eight squares per second but now seven of the eight are updating at the interval of one time per second and one of the squares is updating twice per second so because there's uh, there's basically an extra square of time. Right. So the chance that if the particle has to move somewhere every second, the chance is that it's going to move to one of the eight spaces or the space that the extra space, like so, so it could either, what I'm trying to say is like, there's two chances that the particle will move to the spot where there's extra time. Two chances? Two chances. What does that mean, two chances, versus like the one chance? So basically, every square has a one in eight chance, right? But if you have one square that's updating twice as fast, that square has a two in nine. Two in 9. So you want to change both the baseline and... Yeah so now every particle has a 1 in... Has a... actually it's actually like... Is it a 1 in 9? No, not exactly. No it's not. Well yeah, it is 1 in 9. It's favorable. It is 1 in 9. But then what happens to this extra time square? So the extra time square means there's nine possible locations that particles go to. And that means the odds of it going to one of these places that are slower in time are worse because now they have a 1 in 8 chance of coming to the square and now it has a 1 in 9 chance. But the one square that's updating faster, its pixels are updating faster in space, it has a 2 in 9 chance., because it's controlling that board. Yeah, that's where it's updating faster. What happens to the particle if it goes to the extra time square? Would it disappear? Because it's not in space. It's in time now. Well, from the perspective... Like it perspective of someone on the square that's updating in slower time, it would disappear half the time. It just drops, even this pizza that's made out of worms. Meaning that the. So imagine that you're in a section of time that's updating at half the speed as the amount of time that River is in. Say River's updating, her time is updating twice as fast as your time. That would mean that for you, River would be moving too fast and she would disappear for half of the time. So imagine she's moving so fast you only see her half the time. You still see her, but she's like strobing in and out of reality. Oh, okay. Right? Because she's moving at half the speed you're moving at. She's moving at half the speed? Or twice the speed? No, she's moving at twice the speed that you're in. So she's strobing in and out of your reality. Okay. Yeah. So you're not perceiving half of her reality because your because your frame rate is lower. It's similar to Glee. It's like, here I'm gonna use this one. Pitch Perfect? Okay, the movie Pitch Perfect, everyone is a rat. I feel like that should be just like a section. Mean Generation, whatever. Wait, do you want to see? Or AI, whatever. What is it called? Isn't it cheerleading squad of rats. Wow, that's cool. I like that. That's the best one yet. I actually like that, it looks like they're singing. That's what inspired me to make Pitch Perfect out of rats. Nah, nah. That's a pretty cool one. Cheerleading squad of rats. I have a little rat taxidermy trophy. Wait, you're right. I should do like a meme page or something. I have a little rat taxidermy trophy. Well you're right, I should do like a meme page or something but then I'll never get off my phone and that's already a problem. Okay. Yeah, RIP. It's okay. So... So... What makes the time different for that square? Or like how do you get to that point to be able to either control, coerce, or measure time is different than the allocated date when you're saying like the time crystal or particle. Yeah, so um well I mean it has to do with the with the um it's it's more of like um like if there's a lot of mass. Mass. Mass. Mass is like volume plus density. Minus what? Volume and density. Volume and density. If you have a lot of dense stuff crunched together. What it's kind of doing is it's kind of like... It's already mixing it up. It's creating that gravitational effect for space. So that mass is changing the time frames in its vicinity. So time is moving, time is expanding in scale for mass, like mass grows in size, so time is expanding in scale. Our time frames are increased, which means that the chances of things like particles and other planets moving towards us are increased because of the odds. The odds of what directions the thing is going to go in are altered. The odds of every part of space, like, you know, if you have a planet that... So I mentioned the particles sit in stationary, and the odds are equal in every direction. Well, what if the particle is moving through space, right? So already there's like a logical direction for it to go in. But there are still like chances for it to go to go off to deviate from its course. And so a particle, so like imagine that the planet is just a big particle that's going through space and it's deviating to the left because there are more time frames on its left and the chance that it could move in any possible different direction are more in the direction that it's going towards and more in the direction of some other mass because it's being pulled slightly because there's more time frames so the odds of its movement in each frame of time in each second of time are in the trajectory of where there are more time frames so the earth will orbit around the Sun because in a sense there's more time frames. So the Earth will orbit around the Sun because in a sense, there's more time frames or more updates to the rate of space. There's more updates to the rate of space closer to the Sun than there are away from the Sun. So the Earth is pulled towards the Sun. There's more updates in space. So it's like the space between Earth and Sun is hotter and it's moving faster and that's creating the gravitational effect. It's basically it's changing the odds of whether a particle or a planet or a galaxy, anything of any scale, small to to big changing the odds of where it's gonna go because it's curving space it's curving space by creating additional time frame. You get it? I think so. That's my idea. movie pitch perfect except everyone has a rap these are the first two and I even have an equation for it. I like this one. This is like before the rap battle. This is like before the rap battle. That's before the rap battle? It looks like ninja hamsters. Nice. Excellent. Look in the wall, see? You should look up ninja hamsters. Ninja hamsters. I want to push. I've published these online. But the thing is I would have no idea where to find it. Also too, even if I did find it. What do I do? Wait guys, this is so cool. A cheerleading pyramid where the cheerleaders are rats. This is so cool. Wait look, the rats are trying to make a cheerleading pyramid. You guys look. Here, look, the rats are trying to make a cheerleading pyramid. You guys, look. Here, I'll show you my equations. Oh, really? Oh, nice. Cool. Nice. Wait. I love it. What do you call it? What would you call it? My theory is called quantum gradient time crystal dilation. One more time, slower please. Quantum. Quantum. Gradient. I'm glad that you guys can, because sometimes stuff, my guess is, Quantum gradient. Quantum. Quantum. Gradient. I'm glad that you guys can, because sometimes stuff, Micah says, Quantum gradient. Time. Crystal. Dilation. Look, you guys. So this was the first formula that I got. The rats are having a seance. Nice. Look, Joe, look, the rats are having a seance. Very creepy fingers. Creepy fingers, I love it. Creepy. 1 equal rats. OK, here's another version of it. So this is basically, this equation is basically saying that it's basically saying that, um, it's basically like the, the, so E equals MC squared is Einstein's formula. And what I'm saying is like this equation suggests that the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity are all interconnected. Okay. H and N are, uh, represented by what? Um. Those are like science stuff, but that's what it's saying. Yeah. In math terms. Yeah, there's also like a version of the Schrodinger equation. So this is the Schrodinger, this is one of the Schrodinger, one version of the Schrodinger equation. Okay. It's a partial differential equation. Your equation is added or changed what? My equation adds, so we add in the n right here on the left side and that so that basically means that it shows how the time frames we multiply the wave the time derivative of the wave function is multiplied by the number of time frames. Yeah. So there's a few other versions of this equation that exist, but that's basically... Yeah, so this one combines these concepts. So this suggests that the energy of a particle is determined not only by its mass and frequency, but also by the number of time frames in its vicinity. This implies that the behavior of a quantum particle is influenced not only by its intrinsic properties such as its mass and frequency but also by the structure of space-time in its vicinity as represented by the number of time frames. So n is the figure for time frames. Okay. And f is the figure for frequency. Oh okay okay what's the top? What's the h? The H is... hang on a second. Let me look it up. Yeah, go for it. It's there and then you go straight and then you make the right, the first door. Do you want to see a North Korean rat dictator? North Korean rat dictator? Yeah. Look. Nice. And then there's actually two that are even scarier. Look. Look. Look. And then there's actually two that are even scarier. Look. Look. Look. Yikes. Do you want to see Donald Trump as a rat? I don't like Donald Trump. Well, do you want to see him as a rat? It's scary. I don't want to. You don't want to see it? I don't want him in my mind at all. Okay, don't. Don't worry. It looks more like a rat with a toothpick. Okay. What public figure would you like to see? Or no public figures? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Sorry, it looks more like a rat with a toucan. Okay. What public figure would you like to see? Or no public figures? No public figures in your consciousness. Ooh, I know, I can do religious figures. Ooh, like Buddha as a rat. Wait, that might be offensive. Oh, there's so many people. I already did God as a golden retriever. As a golden retriever. A golden retriever practicing transcendental meditation. Transcendental meditation. Hold on a second. Whoa, do you want to see Buddha as a golden retriever? Yep. There's four different versions. And they're all pretty full. Yeah There's four different versions That's press great Right, there's a whole thing yeah Two brains. Well, would you wanna see a dog meditating in Rose's position flying through outer space? Yes. I'll show you, wait, I think there's like, there's, this is the best one. So the little h is the plank constant. What? The plank constant? Plank? What is plank? Plank. A dog meditating in lotus position flying through outer space. That's really cool. the Planck constant. Planck? What is Planck? Planck... Position Planck through outer space. That's really cool. That looks like the the guru San from Kung Fu Panda, Little Fox Sensei, who is voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Imagine... What is it? The Planck constant is used to define the smallest possible discrete measure of energy that a quantum particle can have known as quantum a quantum so it appears in the Schrodinger equation but so that would be the fuzzy nebulas that's the H or it's the constant that's classical well no it's just like the smallest constant. So there's like the smallest constant. Yeah. That's the smallest we can go as far as like metronome. Yeah, right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. In terms of measuring time. Yeah. Okay. If time is thought to be constant. Yeah. That's what we're measuring against. The inconstant. Well, yeah, right. Yeah. Well, that's, that's, um, so there's, there's a constant of space time, which is the sum of space minus time, that difference, the difference between space and time all adds up to some constant value, which is like an abstract value, like a one or something like that. But it's like, there's always like that, but it's like it's like there's always like this There's always like a never-changing sum in terms of what space-time the space like the speed of space-time Yeah, it's weird because like either you like you increase in space or you increase in time So there's like this constant amount but that's different from this constant is about like what's the smallest possible unit of measurement? For time. For time, yeah. Or space. Or space. Yeah. It can be applied to both. It can be applied to both, yeah. So it's like it's like it like what is um... it's something it's something to do like the Planck's constant is something to do with how often a particle can rotate around itself. It's like it's own little rotation. Oh man, I was trying to make poop dark brown, glistic-y clay. Does the Planck's constant come from... Constant. And dirt. Fertilizer. Come from. So like all of these, so imagine that instead of talking to me, all these questions you were asking, you were asking the smartest person in the world. That's what it's like to talk to ChatGPT. So I can ask, like, what is, does the Planck's constant come from the measurement of a photon or an atom. I'm gonna ask this to chat GPT and it's gonna give me a response. Okay, but you need to know like all these terms ahead of time. Like the thing about talking to a person is that you can ask them things that like like references or points or inflections like the understanding isn't necessarily all verbiage is it or you're saying just like it's so cool so it doesn't like okay look here this is what I asked it that's what I asked the computer and this is what it's telling me it just made this up right now little h in the Schrodinger equation is known as the Planck's constant. It wrote this whole message for me just based on that one little input. And it's like a person who never gets tired of answering your questions, but who is like the smartest person you've ever met, and never gets tired of answering your questions. So if you don't like, if you like, if like math is like this vague concept for you, like you keep asking questions, OK, tell me about this, OK, tell me about that. It never gets tired of answering your questions. Pretty soon you've learned anything you want from the smartest person in the whole world. Just by constantly asking questions. This is really dumb spelling for the word plank. But I guess they had to make it different. I think it's some guy's last name. The guy who came up with it. Oh. Yeah. Like Schrodinger. Okay. Guess you get it named after you. So if you just go to chat.openai.com or whatever that thing is, or you just type in chat gdp, it's that. You just ask anybody. I pay them like 20 bucks a month or something. Okay. But like the subscription, you can see. You can get, yeah. The subscription gets you access to the smartest robot in the world. You guys, if this is your favorite, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you made a really nice, you I pay them like 20 bucks a month or something. Oh, okay. But like the subscription gives you... You can get, yeah. The subscription gives you access to the smartest robot in the world. You guys, this is your favorite. You made a really nice... The smartest, yeah, smartest robot in the world. Is the robot a single computer or is it a collection of all computers? Like where is the powerhouse on this? Like would chat GDP shut down if the internet was out or is it like a separate entity in some form? Oh, um, yeah. Or does it matter? No, it's on a server that you access remotely. Okay. You don't get to download it, but there are different chat robots that you can download. This is just the smartest one. Okay. Because it's got the most access. It's the most well built. Well built. Okay. Yeah. Yeah it's really it's really designed for to work well with an environment. Is it a desktop or app interface? Either. Web. Web interface. Yeah. So you access OpenAI via like? Safari or Chrome, yeah. And then it's otherwise a desktop? Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then is this also a subscription? Yeah. It's also web-based. Okay. Is it also worth a subscription? I mean, obviously, yes, but like, for you, like getting into this, is it, do you think, like is this just, this is just another way to interact? Like you're saying like, this is verbiage, that's art, and then you're saying audio is already way out there, like, I mean, for these mixing beats and like making the best music ever, like that's on the horizon? Yeah, there are many. We just haven't released it yet. there like I mean for these mixing beats and like making the best music ever like yeah there's been released music in it's called music so the level of development in music I feel like the scene from, have you seen the movie Mouse Hunt? No, I haven't. Or Mouse Trap. It's got Nathan Slater. So the level of development in music is not as far as the level of development in images right now. The level of development in text is way beyond images right now. But pretty soon, we're going to have not only images, but 3D images and also movies. There's a there's a group that's working on making movies so you just type in some text and the AI creates not just one image but like a whole movie based on what you wrote animation or film okay so imagine like a movie like sequence. Okay, this is how I know that based on AI. Yeah, so if you said I want Kermit the Frog to give a sparkling water to Miss Piggy, then the AI will like create frames of Kermit the Frog reaching out to grab sparkling water and handing it to Miss Piggy and it becomes like a scene in your movie. You can do a whole movie like that and at some point the AI will do the whole movie for you. You say I want to watch a movie that features these characters and like you can just and it will just make a movie for you. And you'll be able to put on a VR headset and experience that movie in 3D all around you. Like a Kermit the Frog movie right here. Literally like reaching right in front of you like right See what I'm saying? So you're saying the audio is still catching up to that point and then this movie would be the combo of all those things yeah yeah so you're so you said that they already released the audio one what's the name of that it's like music and mine music Jen is the name of like AI generated music or like rhythm or I don't know how you identify a sound music Jen musicN, is two different things. Wait, when I appeal too many times, will they kick me out? Oh, no. Will they kick me out? You mean me? Me out? It's your account. Will they kick me out? No, I have to not use your computer to access your browser anymore. OK, so this one time I appealed. Do you want to know what was rejected? Okay, I can make a poop. I can make 100 screaming poops inside of a house, but 100 screaming poops inside of a Victorian mansion is rejected and not- Appeal. How classist. Just appeal every time. But be aware that if like, it is possible to have your appeal shut down. Yeah, that's what just happened. I mean, you can appeal, and then they can still say no. So that can happen. And then it can be just got rejected twice. OK. No, no, no. I just got, oh, wait, appeal. So if they decline to, if you appeal, there's this third step where you can flag the attention of like a human moderator to come look at it. But I doubt, but like basically. You just do it like a bunch probably, yeah. I mean, at that point you might as well just like try something else. This does not even look like poop. Oh, you know what I said? It's because I said 100 realistic screaming poops. Once you add the word realistic, then it gets pretty crazy. This prop has already been appealed and denied. Imagine 100 realistic poops screaming inside of a toilet. I already did, you know. And I have to like look at this stuff. You're gonna have a whole adventure for you. Like what just happened? I and I have to like look at this stuff It might change my It might change my like what the computer thinks about me or something because River's using it. Your opinion is the outlier. Maybe it's because you have a wider base. This is what the computer thinks a poop is. I just said a poop. A poop. That was all. A poop. This is what it thinks a poop is. Alright. A poop. I don't like that they put faces on it. That's just emoji world. I don't like that they put faces on it. That's just emoji world. Do you want to see red dark sticky paint smeared inside of a... What? ...sticky paint? No. Like punk rock river, okay. And then there's like the puppies with halos. I should add that to the dark red We gotta get River her own mid-journey account so she can entertain herself. Yes. Dark red sticky pink smooth everywhere inside the journey. I feel like either you've been like listening so consciously to what we've been talking about and you're gonna have like all this whole wealth of information or... I just have the wealth of rumors, unconscious, on! More likely, it's both. I don't understand all these long words, I don't understand, I just stopped paying attention, sorry. I need to get home soon, otherwise I'm going to be too tired to drive. Do you want to ride? Sure. Do you mind going back to North Beach area? Okay. Yeah. Puppy, Angel. Wait one second. Alright, I'm setting a timer. Cool. Thank you. You get five minutes. Five minutes, yeah. And then, like, thank you. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. I'm just making money. You're just making money! I am making money. Yeah, yeah. I say that not to stand on myself, but I'm a little biased in that way. I feel like the book is going to lead to much better revenue. I'll make even a lot more money after the book comes out. I have a feeling we're going to be very much touring the world to explain and you're going to be very much touring the world to explain this. And you're going to do it in a way that people understand what you're referring to using bad language. Those are the most entertaining things. AI left me speechless. I'm impressed. I'm totally on board with this. I would love to be your marketing manager and or like cheerleader of like Versioning friendship Also, what's realistic to a computer versus not realistic, meaning animated looking or like AI looking? I need to upgrade my computer and I'll get a different version of the AI software that doesn't have any restrictions on it. Then we can request lots of poop. You can request all the poop you want to see. As realistic as you want You know what? That's a thing too, isn't it? It's a home Should I leave this wherever you want this? Or do you want me to take it? You take it, you don't have to Um You guys You guys I'll put my hat on. I've got another coat just in case it gets cold out there. My favorite one was the night where the two losers rocked. And the Coachella skeleton. I like the puzgad or what is it? let's clean because everyone we need a mouse we need a mouse we need a mouse we need a mouse we need a mouse we need a mouse you know life is just such a nice gift if you always clean I normally clean for people but you know what I'm just going to clean up. You know, Micah is just such a nice guest. He always cleans. I normally clean for people, but you know what? I posed for today, and I have to clean when I get home. I'm going to leave the microphone on, so you can use the break. It's a bit crowded. Is this what Micah's doing? You have to see it. The solution is that you're listening, and now I listen. So Micah up in it. So he can do it. That's true. He can do it. What is so much better to do? Be careful of the knife. Okay. Hang on, hang on. Wait a minute. Let me just put this in the trash can. No, no, no. I'm just gonna put this in the trash can. Oh, you have a trash set, but... I'm just gonna put this in the trash can. We have our compost. Wait, here. Now we need a new bag. A new compost bag? This one here. Yeah. Now we have to... Oh. Let's just say it just goes resting a little bit. I'm not resting. We have a timer set, so... Oh, okay. Here we go. ...we're good until it goes off. I've been hoping for sparkling water so that way it can... Wow, you were hoping for sparkling water? No, they're not. Do you want a cookie? I have one. Oh wait, you gave it to me. I'm surprised. Do I want the cookie that I gave you? Is that why I gave you it? So that I would be here when I come back? I just forgot you were the one who gave it to me. My mom did that for the gift that she gave me last year. It smells so good. It was a gift that she gave me last year. She was like... Yeah. She did. It was a gift that you got her? Uh, no, she got me, but she had forgotten she'd given it to me already because it had been stored. Oh. In her closet, so she just re-gifted it, being like, Here you go! Here's your, here's a new jacket! And I'm like, this is my jacket. Didn't know where it was. That's funny. That's a great one. It's not the version I noticed. It is not. Wait, I'll have to pull this. I wore one of those to my car. Maybe she got into the habit of doing that when you were too young to notice? Yeah, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure this was just my mom did that. Alright. Alright. That was funny, guys. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love doing that thing. But I only like doing it with you guys because I'm like, what am I going to do by myself? What am I going to show it to? Because I'm sure many people would be curious. But I really thought it was a good idea. Sure, it's very well done. Can you try to... I'm trying to think of a short to... Have you thought about teaching a class? You could teach it to your students. I feel like I'm too involved with saline right now to get too involved with these AI things. Okay. And the AI saline doesn't do anything because the whole point of doing saline is to have fun so the computer is doing it to go for it. I'm going to go for it. I'll wait. All right, I'm going for the last time. I'll wait. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to show you guys out. Unless you want me to walk to your room. No, just tell me where to go. You remember how to get back there. Yeah, I'll walk you down. Alrighty. Thanks for coming over. Yeah. That was so cool. Thanks for coming to the opening, Sam. That was so cool. Yay! Thanks, Mom. Can you see the trend of the kids' garden? No. No? No, I don't know. I'll look up there. You can turn on the downstairs. Can you just put it all over? Where's the board? Where's the board? Oh, no, no, no. That's my neighbor's. Okay. Yay, I'm coming. Yay! Yay! I'll walk you all the way outside. Bye. Alright. Thank you River. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Alright Joe. Bye. Let's get out of here. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you River Bye bye bye Bye Alright Joe Bye Mike said Bye River Mike and Joe just left River 順序 順序 I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to say, there's a music den, which is like the name of the game. The music den is like the name of the game. So if you look at the music den, you're going to find the piano, which is the name of the game. The music den is the name of the game. The music den is the name of the game. The music den is the name of the game. Yeah, I'm going to find the one hand that's not working. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to get some information in that there's a fire. You're going to be able to get some information about the fire? Yeah. Fire. And the rain is going to be complicated. So, what's that? An hour? Something like that. They are like interfering with your brain function. Oh, so you're taking your time. Yeah. So you're going fast. Yeah, it's like when you're, if you do it, like, some drugs will speed you up and some will slow you down. But if you're taking drugs, they're speeding you up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like when you're... If you do it like... Some drugs will speed you up and some will slow you down. But with these anti-drugs, you're speeding your mind up. Yeah? Yeah. Do you get node effects or is it just... Yes, there's no effect. You can see... that... what people on our psychedelics... when you do medical analysis, brain imaging, you can see lots of these people moving all over the place. So the activities that the brain is working hard to detect is the movement of the senses. So, I'm going to go over to the other side. Maybe? Maybe? Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Alright. Can I put this in the back? Okay, cool. I'm going to try to get a better angle. I'm going to try to get a better angle. Okay, type in 1011 Kearney. Okay, type in 1011 Kearney. Okay, type in 1011 Kearney. Whoa, fastest time ever. 15 minutes. I'm pretty. Can I make sure it's lined in the right place? Yep. Okay. Let's see, what's that? Yep, that's right. Okay. Okay, so we're going. Need water. Oh, hold on. Okay. Oh! Okay. Okay. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. It's a temperature. So you met Rover in South Bend? Yeah. How'd you guys meet? She was friendly, started talking. She was going for swims and I was in the day room and I go there also and I do swimming and... Do you do long swim or like regular? I go there also and I do swimming. Do you do long swim or regular swim? When I first became a member of the Southern Swimming Club, I was in really long swim. I would go after work and I would swim for several hours. Sometimes I'd even hallucinate while swimming. That's your hand? Yeah. Is your hand dangerous? Yeah, so this is like 19. Do you have a buddy? No, so this was, it was very dangerous. Oh. Ha ha ha. Well, I guess that means you're fine. Ha ha, back in, back in 2015. Oh. That's probably when that happened. Alright, so like eight years ago you were in that zone of like, let me push it. Yes, I would say I was in that zone. Okay, in all capacities, and this is one of them? This is the main path, going swimming in the bay, on LST. On LST? Lots of LST. So you just upped the ante of like, shit they tell you not to do in open water or in life because of survival worries. You're like, fuck you, I do what I want, I can take a shit ton of LSD if I can. You didn't go swimming in the bay. I was swimming in the bay for a long ass time until my body is like separate from my head. Oh shit dude, I don't know the level, okay so you're like doing that, self experiment I'm pretty sure this is not like a tolki like guidance thing this is just like a self self brought up before that I started a business in San Francisco where I was um trying to do I was trying to do like alternative itfeedback therapy type of thing, right? Where you work in an EEG machine and we're bringing visualization and audio representation of your brain activity, those signals that are running in your head. We bring that into the computer and add light and sound effects. I've heard of this! Right? Like you were supposed to like help people get happier? You like, you know, bright light? Yeah. Maybe I described this to you one time in the past. Yeah. Yes. That's what I heard about I think when we, Jared was here too, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this is who you were working with when you first came to San Francisco. Is that what brought you to San Francisco? Is it like this company that you found? I wanted my company to be an alternative biofeedback experience that actually improves people, and improved your mind and your health Essentially, you know, to find enlightenment through through meditation, but through accelerated neurofeedback So like meditation is digitally enhanced? Yes Digitally enhanced, digitally augmented, by words, by... Yeah, it was almost this idea of digital medicine or digital health. But in an alternative vibe, not actually medicine. Or using the classical computer... I'm just trying to like... Whoa, there's still fireworks! Wow. That's crazy. Oh yeah, so I was using existing technology. Right, okay, that's what I mean. Yeah. But I created my own custom tracks. So yeah, I was using existing technology. Right, okay. That's what I mean. But I created my own custom tracks. So I was using existing software that you could purchase and then customize and build. Right. And implement your own protocols. I was designing the stack, the experience that the person would use. Okay. Based on the person or based on what? Yeah, so there was a lot of work in that area in terms of what other people were doing and contributing openly and contributing for sale. So I basically there was a mini market ecosystem that I was connected with and I pulled together the elements that I wanted to be part of the experience that I wanted to create that could be related to... could be customized for individuals. That's one thing that could be done. But to do that part right requires a lot of like... you know, working with a lot of people over a long time. Oh sure, right, you have to have a big enough pool and like, it has to be worth it for the amount of hours it would take to like, customize, right? Yeah, like, when it comes to like, I don't know if this customization was actually better for one person or another. Oh. Because you don't have to have data. This is not enough. It's not like, it's sort of like, at some point you're saying, well, maybe this feels better, but you don't know what that means in terms of what other, someone else means when they say this feels better. Right, this feels better, right? Like, is it better because you just generally feel better, or is it better, basically? But yeah, there's not that requirement. There's, if this can, you have, you'll have, um, yeah, so basically you're trying to quantify, like, what self-improvement means or what optimizing your brain means. Okay. Sort of like lost meaning. The more I try to quantify what that means. Right. Because optimization means different things to different people based on how they want to feel most of the time. Yeah. Or choose to feel if you believe it's in your control. Okay. Or changeable. No. But like you're saying, the more you try to figure out what optimization means in terms your control. Okay. Or changeable. But like you're saying, like the more like the more you try to figure out what optimization means in terms of like human performance, well you have to like define some narrow construct of my optimize versus some task. Now that I like, if I do this sort of therapy, will it help me improve at this task? And so there was, I did a bunch of like, in any case, it's like a, I ran into a sort of like wall of like, there's this, there's too much information to wrap your mind around that you need to process in order to figure out if, you know, what an optimization means versus, you know, you have to invent some sort of like... I'm sorry, I'm not used to this. Like an EEG for example, you mentioned the word baseline. In EEG they take a baseline measurement of someone's brain activity and then they notice what changes to in accordance with their baseline with new readings like with the new readings are the alpha waves increasing and then they and then they and then so you have this like you know sort of subjective representation of of or you have some sort of like uh craftive representation of right until you're taking the metadata and you're you're trying to say well this means this and that and um it's just it's really difficult to really say that it actually means any of the things you're saying that it says so it's's like the whole, it's almost like it almost falls apart in terms of like you can't really prove anything. Okay, because at some point like how are you supposed to like tell somebody that their subjective experience of betterness is attributed to this area of what we think is improving it. Yeah. Right? Yeah. So, like, there's nothing that's, like, conclusive that comes out of it. It's just this big, mushy box. Okay. You try to talk about it, and there's just, like, you can't pull anything meaningful out of this jumble of words. So that was the... You were coming up against the wordage getting in the way of the math. Well... Or the expected, like, thesis or the expected thesis or hypothesis? Well, I mean, so I have this, you know, I didn't, you know, I realized that if you're going to be in the business of brain optimization, you should be able to demonstrate in some way that what you're doing is optimizing someone's brain. And when I realized I couldn't do that, I had to rethink what my product was. What I was selling, what the purpose of the business was, realized I couldn't do that, I had to rethink what my product was. What I was selling. What the purpose of the business was. Because I don't want to sell voodoo. Sure, well yeah, snake oil, but for brain optimism. Like yeah, if you're going to do a false narrative, I mean you can go big or go home, but also like if you're actually trying to be an integrity with advancing or like learning more about providing something that has actual value. Providing actual value and or like yeah optimization like your intention of optimization right? Yeah. If you're actually going to do that then yeah okay so once you hit that wall then what? Well I think you know I used it a whole bunch myself. I like to think that it optimized my brain. You like to think it deserted? Wait, who knows? Maybe it didn't. I don't know. Um, for sure. But in any case, so I had this tool for optimizing people's brains. Well you like to think that why? But I couldn't prove it. You couldn't prove it, but you think it did because, like, did you feel like you found discernible or at least just like felt results? Like even if they were subjective, you still had that. I still had results in terms of... You had results. In terms of, uh, yeah, in terms of my... My ability to, like, basically, like, um... My ability to chunk through different levels of representation became a lot smoother. Okay so you basically like lubed up the mechanics of your head. Yeah and I'm able to like um consider any piece of knowledge to in how that relates or doesn't relate to any other piece of knowledge so like I have this really like It's like what it's like it's like, you know a lot of people like, you know, I remember like the way it used to be where You know you take two really complicated Topics and try to relate them together. Like how does like how does a car relate to an orange or something? And at some point your head starts to hurt because there's too many different things associated with oranges, and too many things associated with cars. How does a car relate? But you can ask the robot in a robot walk tool to make some analogy between that. Anyway, the point is that it's like, I don't know, I felt like though that like even if there are some cognitive benefits through this technology, like I felt like it didn't like make me a happier person. So it didn't make you happier, but it did help smooth out certain areas of what you felt were like your neural transmitting, which was kind of the point, but then also it's not a quantifiable point, right? It's not a quantifiable point. It's not measurable. Okay. It's not measurable. It's not measurable, but it was felt for you in the fact that you noticed like an improvement of that kind of learning that you're able to do now more smoothly. Yeah. Partially probably because of all the like in-depth like attention that's been more time with it, more time out of it, but... Yeah, and I have like really interesting ideas as to what might have actually happened, but again there's no way to... Well yeah, but okay, so you feel it, and then... What I can do is talk about it in a book, which I'm doing. Which you're doing, right. Okay, so you're having another book or it's the same... This is part of the first book. So the first part is about brain-computer interfaces. Oh, okay, so this is your background. That's why you have like the the chops for it. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so this became SF War, this is what you did and then once you got to that point, then you were just like, okay, I'm going to start taking a bunch of LSD and swimming in cold water for long periods of time, because maybe that'll like shake it up. Or like, are you trying to put what kind of like nirvana are you trying to reach here? Or at least place in time or space? Like are you wanting to just like, ascend at every, like at every available level? Or like what? What's a like, are you just trying to like? So I gave myself three life goals. One was to create the ultimate brain computer interface, or the brain computer interface that's like nerve gear, or neural lace, which means that we can read and write to the human brain like it's a special kind of hard drive. We can download it when we see it here, just like with hard drive also. Like imagine that right now you're filming a movie with your eyes and we could download that movie into the computer so you could watch it again or change it and the computer could experience your memories. You could also download other people's memories and experience them. So like a court for example could like you know pull a pull a memory out of someone's head and figure out if a crime took place. Oh you should totally check out this uh graphic novel series about these people who smore dead people's ashes and then gain their experience. Oh goodness. And it's similar but scarier. That's the that's the yeah that's like maybe a warped like fantasy like version but like yeah anyway okay so you're saying that's one of your That's like maybe a warped, like, fantasy version. But like, yeah. Anyway, so you're saying that's one of your life goals. What's the second one? The second one was to create artificial cortex. So like, um, like artificial brain tissue. Okay. So like, so the, um, artificial cortex could lead to like an external, like you have a neocortex. Like spike it. You have a neocortex. You have a neocortex. But if you had another neocortex outside your head, you'd be even smarter. But also... You'd double up. Yeah, you're doubling up your intelligence. But that means like... It's like an external hard drive. Now plugged in. Yeah. Yeah. Literally. Yeah, and so now you're thinking twice as fast. So... Oh, you're creating more spaces for yourself. But you're also experiencing time more slowly. Oh, so you're basically experiencing time more slowly So the experience of time slows down you get twice as much time every day But you know you be having the best days ever because it's like you Because first of all your days are super long so you can like but you're having it. days ever. Because it's like you... Why would it be the best? Because, first of all, your days are super long, so you can like... I go straight? Yeah, go straight and pull over to the right. Okay. Let's see... Oh yeah, can you get over? I don't know. Here? Yeah. I'm gonna pull up here. Okay. If I can. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, cool. If you want to pull over here for a bit. Yeah you want, I can pull over here for a bit. Yeah, yeah, I can just hang out for a second. There you go. I'll get back. Yeah, wait, wait, let's just finish this. So... Um, okay. So you had the second idea of creating an artificial cortex, which would be like the cortex would be basically like a hard drive that you could like attach to your head nurally like implant like it would be a biotech thing like so be made out of like muscle tissues or like the same shit that we have yeah it connects to your biotech so you're saying like you'd figure out or work with or like help. You'd figure out how to like get that intersection. But it extends your mind into the computer. It extends your mind into the computer and the computer into your mind. Both ways. Yeah. So when I was doing the Ominous Cycle, I had the experience that my mind was pulled into the computer. Through the feedback loop. Okay. Because the feedback loop is, it measures your brain activity. Yeah. So as your thoughts and feelings change, they change your brain wave activity. That changes the light and sound patterns that you're seeing and hearing, which further changes your brain wave activity. It affects your thoughts and feelings, which further change the light and sound effects, which further change your... So there's this feedback loop between yourself and the computer. Your brain is giving off this data. Your thoughts and feelings are changing what your brainwaves are doing. And the computer is adding light and sound effects to those brainwaves, which and eventually I started to identify how my thoughts and feelings were changing the light and sound effects. Like I abstracted everything else. It was just my thoughts and feelings are changing the light and sound effects. Like I abstracted everything else, it was just my thoughts and feelings are changing the lights and the sound. And I went really deep into meditation with that, where I became aware of how my thoughts and feelings were expressed in terms of brainwaves. I had a sense of that. Oh, so you felt like you were in the seat of consciousness. I was connected to the computer. You were connected to the computer, and then you were the computer. The computer became integrated into me. Okay. Yeah. Wow. And I had this idea to connect the computer to that way in a more focused way. And eventually, I created a VR program so you could walk inside a representation of your brain when it was in VR, like in 3D. And I did that with a bunch of folks. Wow. Okay. So it was like a, I get to literally look at my mind map. Yeah. So if you have scary thoughts it'll be just like a terror forest. At this stage the only thing that was happening was I had blocks or slides going up and down. Oh, okay. Just in changing color. Oh, okay. So not at the point where we're making images but that is like the next version. Oh, okay. And then you're like I'm taking a walk through like how I'm thinking about the world or I'm So not at the point where we're making images, but that is like the next version. Oh, okay. So you're like, I'm taking a walk through like how I'm thinking about the world, or receiving from the world, and or like at rate of where I am. What is my brainwave? Um, at- How good are your thoughts? What if you're stupid? Um, well, I mean, I mean- Doesn't matter, they're the same? You, you, it's, it's, it would boost your intelligence. It would boost your intelligence. It doesn't matter, they're the same? It would boost your intelligence. It would boost your intelligence. So having, if you extended your brain into the computer, you'd have, you know... Your brain plus the computer brain. Plus the computer, yeah. So you're basically, the computer is multiplying your intelligence. But at some point, we can make the computer basically, like, the artificial brain tissue can have the same experiences. Like we can figure out how to represent, you know, basically. Basically it's like a real experiment with your brain. It's like adding more brain. Adding more brain. Adding more brain. You want to add more brain. That's the second. Yeah, so then your experience of time slows down. Yeah. Because you have more thoughts per second. And then you have... You're really extra piece on the job. Yeah. Yeah, well the brain is creating more of that. Yeah. Okay. Okay, twice as fast. What's the third? The third one is artificial brains. Wait, okay, so one step further. So the first step is the... Neural lace. Neural... Ultimate brain-computer interface. Ultimate interface. Like you get to interact with this being that has been created from... That's the third step. So the first step is just the brain-computer interface. Brain-computer. Makes your brain like a special hard drive that you can read and write to. Oh, first it's the... how do we get the translation? Yeah. How do we how do we translate what's inside, outside, outside, inside? Yeah. Yeah. So what's that digitally? That's the technologically. The communication protocol. The communication protocol. Like, how are we going to translate what I'm feeling right now, how I'm feeling it, when I'm receiving it in memory? Yeah. Like how are we going to get that into a computer so that the computer can then feed it back to us and or feed it to someone else and or just retain it for a future time. Like a soul pocket. Yeah, like a soul pocket. But also like not a soul, hopefully, but more so like your just lived experiences as patterned by brainwave activity. Yeah. Okay. And then felt otherwise. So that's one. And then the second is the actual hard drive of like the thing that will... Yeah, like being able to extend your mind with extra... I call it extend a mind was my first idea for the name. Calling it extend a mind. Okay, cool. You just wear it like a hat or something. Okay. And or you know how to wear it like a hat or something. Okay. Or you don't have to wear it like a hat. Yeah, yeah. But the idea is that it connects your mind with the computer in a way that extends your mind into the computer. So it's like imagine you have a larger brain. Mind melt like a... Oh, but it's like more than that because it would be mind extension. Yeah, it would be a... Really like when I'm talking about everyone's on their phone, it's like, well yeah, you can be your phone, like, your phone is you. But you might, you might be able to even experience it as like another person in a car with you, talking to you, as if like they're another person, but it's actually just a computer talking to you. Are we basically, are you just kind of like creating schizophrenia, but like for like digital schizophrenia, but like for like digital schizophrenia? Like how much smarter, how many personalities can you have? Or not even personalities, but information? Well yeah, that could happen, or there's like, if you can integrate it into a single feedback loop, then you can, I believe that's why we have like, you know, one person and one person's head. There are people who are conjoined to each other, their brains are connected, their heads are connected, but they still have two different personalities. My argument is that it's because they have two independent feedback loops. That binds all of your data into one entity, one person. But it also keeps you separate from other people. So that's your protection. So if you created an independent person inside someone else's head, that independent person would have its own feedback loop. So it'd be basically like Siri. Yeah, like Siri in your head. So that could happen. Okay. But you could also merge your mind with the computer. Basically extend your mind with the computer. Basically extend your mind with the computer by having the computer integrated into your feedback loop. And that's what I experienced when I was connected with Neo Mind Psycho. Was it like somebody you knew? Or was it yourself? It was like myself got larger. You got bigger. Yeah. Like my mind got bigger. So did you feel like you were connected to like universal consciousness or you were connected deeper into your own consciousness? I felt like there was more of me like my there's more thought more thought happening in time more more brain more experience more experience of reality more consciousness. more experience, more experience of reality, more consciousness. Okay, so like, psilocybin is supposedly like, or not supposedly, it does expand your awareness and you're saying this digital interface, you had the experience of it doing the same but intellectually like in how your brain is working so not just like emotionally or unconsciously which is like the shadow work this is the binary work that you're wanting to do okay so it's first how do you translate it then it's how do you expand it? And then it's... Artificial brains. Artificial brains, like totally separate. Taking those two pieces and then making it, it's a whole thing. Artificial brains is like, yeah, where you could, with artificial brain, you could upload a representation of yourself, have a digital copy of yourself. Or you could have have created an entirely new being that's like a, it could be like your, it could be like your, your, a new, a cat or a dog, a co-worker, or even... Like your idea of them? No, I mean you could create a person. What do you mean you create a person? Who is you at that point? Like are you then identifying with your hardware? No no no so I'm talking about like artificial brains. I still don't understand what that is. So our it's basically like um yeah so a human brain has a has a brain right that's a real brain yeah and what so that my idea was first I want to connect the computer Human brain. So my idea was, first I want to connect the computer to the brain, so the brain is like a hard drive. Right. And then I want to make an extra cortex, or an external cortex, so you can expand your mind into the computer. And then I want to make an artificial brain, which is the third thing, and that is like another entity. Okay. Now you could connect with this other entity, or it could just be separate. And so it could just basically be its own person. Wait, wait, you say person. Like a dog or a cat or a human. Or a bug. It's like a being. And the consciousness comes from the feedback loop that brains have. Yeah. And this part of the brain would generate. Yeah. Based on all this other things that make it possible to exist. Yeah. Okay. And then the kind of hardware, it wouldn't have to be, like, you know, but its packaging would be secondary. The main part is, as you said, like, the brain. Because, like, are you basically trying to, like, disprove, like, Nagel's theory about, like, you can't know what an experience of a bat is because we don't have the like body of a bat Or is that oh, yeah, yes, definitely so you're trying to quantify experience and And then download experience and measure it and so you're saying absolutely But that I if I want to be bad I will be I'm gonna just chip it in yeah like all this all this LHC and cold water is really like what I mean in theory but like theory okay but in practice like you know a bat has so much about its experience that you just can't like replicate. Right. Right, like being a bat. But you're looking at the replicable parts of brains. If you downloaded the bat's memories, Okay. you could have some experience of what it experiences. Okay. But even then, you'd be comparing its experiences to your own. And so that would create a different context for those experiences that would be unlike the bat's experience. Right, okay. So you're not like totally saying, okay, it's done. It's more like... You can have a window into... You can have a window into like a record. Record, yeah. And like even if it's a third level copy or like it's not it entirely, it would still be, the point is that it's its own data structure. And then you've already have done that in the first step. So then it would just be applied to other creatures with the same model. Or it would just, you know, evolve. Yeah, or it could just be like an experience that could just, like you were talking about, like an experience that just is disconnected from the body, like an experience that can play out over time in a computer. Wow. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. Damn, okay. My head is totally full. I think I need an extension. You're welcome. Okay. Alright, I'll grab my stuff. Are we connected? I don't think so. These are on the seat. I need to add my handphone. Do you want to send me an email? Sure. Oh. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I'm going to go ahead and get my stuff. I need to add your email code. You want to send me an email? Sure. Oh. I didn't know how to spell your name. I didn't know how to spell your name. I'm just adding in my email and you can text me also. Okay, cool. The same number as the number I used for what's up. So, okay. Awesome. Okay. Yep. Thank you. We are going to go to the other side of the river.
