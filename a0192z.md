feedback structure to improve the flow

he thinks that conscious is just the electrical activity, and its not the brain

and that the brain is just the container for this floating consciousness and 

neural networks can be creative they can generalize

but bots, physical robots, and chat bots,

a cybernetic

global workspace theory

issue was with integrated information theory

the brain activity patterns 

brain activity doesn't have decoders, so it can't observe information

the four forces system of creation

convection patterns
"Convection cell" they warm it up at different rates to form different patterns, to it contains information

scaffold

fashion

mens fashion men and women

a tree was observing the sun in a sense, observation was necessary to react to the sun

virtual patterns interacting
non-physical information patterns that require physical substrates to move between... !!!!

not the electricity
not the brain tissue

order out of chaos
information out of noise

consciousness in the cosmos is not in a rock

if we know what consciousness is

the spectrum from a rock to a human mind, it doesn't consider computers
 computers have vastly more complexity than a rock, but the are less general in their thinking than simple insects, despite having vast complexity

why aren't computers conscious?

Why are brains conscious and computers not consciousness?

It's because brains are doing a very special process that leads to consciousness

(integrated virtual models)

computers take information and pass it,
can it be accuracy?

render, describe, or process, to what accuracy?
what is their response-ability
the ability to ignore their surroundings, and move your frame of reference, take yourself out, and put your referential frame into another 

you need shadow to see any shape?
