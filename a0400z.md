I need to connect the notes on quantum gradient time dilation including the one that talks about mass as a time crystal with the notes on neural function, the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) with the concept that because the mass of the neuron is changing it is literally warping spacetime.
