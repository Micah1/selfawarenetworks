dreams
dreams like the self, are sequenced neural concepts that are connections between cellular memories evoking theta brainwaves ~ this is the dream where guantama buddha has given us a false premise, to be happy, you must discover your original nature, this, this is it, breath the air, look around, this is your original nature, you are spacetime, you are the sky, you are the stars, you are the expectations of your breath and mind ~ its a false premise because you were this before you discovered you were this, and because all that changed was a new connection in your brain, a new conceptual pathway to another branch of memories ~ its a false premise because like the catholics original sin, it assumes you to be unhappy, until you go through the ritual observance, commitment, binding social contract, dedication of your life, and acceptance by a master yogi ~ all this for a simple conceptual realization that you never needed to be happy, as nature, you can be happy, without ever knowing why you are happy, without ever discovering the concept of your true nature, how many happy children exist? how many happy monkey's, how many happy dolphins? how many happy athletes? how many happy people who are not catholic and not aware of Buddha and Yoga? because its a lie, the Buddha is a liar
