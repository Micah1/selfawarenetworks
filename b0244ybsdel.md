audio transcription needs fixing
this one had a ton of bs that was deleted
 
And, you know, as if, as if it's deignizing, right? It's going to take that lower, it's going to, it's going to bump up things to make things look as good as possible. And in and that includes like adding, you know, potentially it can improve the graphics significantly across the board, like the AI, can add and really amazing 3D graphs.

02:28

It can add an amazing skies, it looked like real skies. It can make the cars look just like real cars because they can take the knowledge of things look from from photographs and from videos of the real world and it can apply them to less detailed computer graphics. A sort of like a semantic segmentation just like a 3D semantic segmentation or I mean just really a semantic segmentation for frame right.

02:59

But there's a there's a continuity that's like across the frame. So it's not and so it looks as if it it's like a semantic segmentation of the of objects, it is possible. Also to do it as like you can do three, semantics, segmentation and training, neural network to convert between which to both recognize and convert between the 3ds semantics and the 2D semesters.

03:26

So it could take a 2D picture and consider that as this life of a 3D image, right? And then detect the 3D shape of the eye of the objects in the 2D image, and then ran to those three shapes. And then, and I guess that, that's sort of, there's like, I guess there's interesting because, like that, what is the question of analogy, for AI, for now networks?

03:54

Because if you're converting something from, if you're converting, basically a 2D image 2 or 3 image. You've an analogy is a conversion. I think maybe perhaps of a analogy itself is an abstract pattern. Okay, let's do it analogy the

04:22

Let's see. Why can I think of a good analogy? Let's see if you have a process. Okay, let's get that. But the point is, the point was that, you know, if you have an analogy and it's going to it's going to presume, I mean, okay, it's not what I meant.

04:53

If you, if you, if the computer is able to understand and allergies then and I said analogies, if it appears able to understand analog to use,

05:10

Then.

05:15

That means that there is a sort of, I think there's this cement. There's a 3D semantic segmentation of word concepts. Right? So that's like if I talk to a computer and it can turn my words into images, then the fact that those like just I think that the the fact that the you can have words represent concepts or words, words can represent objects like trees represent trees.

06:07

And so an analogy is like an idea. That is represented with a different set of words, a different set of notions and different concepts. But there is it, this kind of isomorphism between two different sets of ideas And it offers a a new, all a new alternative. The what is it called?

06:45

The steam.

06:53

The mobile steam device for 399. It's, it's a, it's like a mobile Linux machine, that's but it's in, it's like inside a tablet with two controllers. So it's a game console, right? And then you, but then, you can plug it in and it's like a desktop. But the key thing is, it runs like, the latest game, you are games, right?

07:17

I know it runs the latest steam games, but here's the thing. Like what if that could power the valve index, right? And what if like, if you put windows on it, it could power the oculus rift or Oculus, Rift games and air length sent to Oculus Quest.

07:46

All right, so it's like and so now, like, this is like up, this is like, the big upset because now, like, what, what might happen is that faceobok maybe pressured into creating their own sort of, so, steamed deck, right? So, it's called the steam deck, faceobok might create their own.

08:07

So it's like the Oculus Rift deck, right? They had to comply Oculus home and it's a full like PC with Linux on it. It's got oculus on it, right? But it's also an AR. It's like, it's got, it's gonna layer tablet, right? And the faceobok one might have augmented reality, right?

08:31

So you can like you has web AR. And with like air cortex is owned technology, like they have their own air tablet, right? And it has a light filled, it's light. It has like a light field screen, so it's like you are so that anyone who sees so that if anyone looks at what you're holding up like it, it's always from their perspective.

08:58

And if you move relative to the screen, so augmented reality with a light field, right? With lyrics are on Linux, tablet with Oculus technology. Like they're not using air core, they're not using air kit, they're using their own technology on a tablet that has controllers on it. CD AR stuff with two controllers As I can gamepad.

09:24

Like what? Who else would think of coming out with augmented reality. The had a game had attached. This is something that faceobok with things to do, all right?

09:38

16:10

But and it and just to begin with, I'm sorry, did I say thousands of years? I mean forever as long as he went history just to change that a little bit. What I'm saying is he's not, he's not alone. There's a lot of brilliant people on earth, but but there's not an infinite number of brilliant people on earth.

16:39

There's not an unlimited number of us and I think it's like yeah, it's like I think it's

17:24

Yeah. So sister working? Yeah. So um it's not an unlimited number of of geniuses on earth, right? We can all be counted.

17:59

So, what what my thinking is, is that

18:11

Yeah so if you consider what's the name of that, we're going to have all these different VR companies that was my post that I felt. By the way, we have all these your companies and and I put it back, I fixed it and air companies so they have it.

18:31

The air tablets. Air tablets are going to be the thing, right? It's it's going to be like a Nintendo. It's gonna be like an Nintendo switch but augment reality, right? Like that, that's what that that's right. It's the what I played was a tablet where they put the camera on the race car as a race around, right?

18:54

But but you could also like have an augmented reality race car on the ground, the controlling from above. All right, and you could switch to like like yeah. That'd be interesting if it if you like if you do like a photograph here of the ground and then you can switch to like an in person view, or it's driving through the photographic capture here of your actual space, but but it's like you are sent your servicing your actual space from the first person perspective of the car because you have a photogrammetric capture that you captured of your actual space, right?

19:45

And yeah, they just do actually. They just make it like photographs and they use the photographs to have AI generate 3D models, right? That match, that sort of like this is sort of like of scaling. It knows exterminated. Semantics limitation. But it's like up to the upscale imaging or the A has been taught has been shown, you know, like videos of the real world, right?

20:15

And at highest super high resolution and then so is saying oh well this is actually this and and essentially and and so is able to take the really low resolution

20:37

Photogrammetry and an upscale it as the as the car. As your augmented reality car races around the photographic capture of the real world, right? So you could have some people like they could see augmented reality race cars through some tablets and other people the drivers could see. The first person perspective of each car, right?

21:11

And it would have it would use the actual location of the cars. Would in virtual space, would inform being able to see the other cars and like a multiplayer view, right? Be able to see each other in multiplayer and people would seem old. And then people who are not drivers, who are looking through the, the windows that are just over the event, like just tapped over the windows over the event.

21:46

Like they're like those people.

21:51
