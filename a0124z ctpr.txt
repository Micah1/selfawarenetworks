"On neural firing, the message is in the synchronizaton, which is a subtle modulation of the random, thus randomness is the carrier, and necessary." Author Unknown, May 2016

"My argument is this: you know that there are four oranges in a barrel you can't just choose to believe they are apples instead. you can lie about it, go into denial about it, but no one can choose their beliefs. The point is that cells react, they only react they do not act, and a human is a body of cells. The brain cells predict coincidence patterns in vast neural networks that begin with sensory inputs like eyes and ears. The neural networks begin to store concepts that are distributed distortions in the gaussian noise of our brains. These information based concepts are spatial temporal patterns or programs that cause our brain cells to react in predictable ways. I can say I made this choice for this reason, but that reason is a tempo spatial program  of coincident firings in the brain to make me react in a highly coordinated way."
