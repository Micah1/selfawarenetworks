Integrate Cortex Decisions

So this means that the if if the if the delta range in this in the fifth and sixth layers, delta figures range represents the ware decisions where high level decisions are made instead of the paper onto portions. Then then, you know, we can say basically like yeah, the visual cortex has high level decisions, all the courtesy is a high level decisions, the smell that we'll call the prefrontal cortex.

00:31
The smell cortex. And so, all the cortex is a primary sensory, cortexes and visual stuff integrates down in the

The answer, you know and the landmark the sensory inputs integrate and there's an awesome there's an oscillation there that represents the a certain level of focus of the sensory input signal setter they're in a loop. So this is loop between the thalamus and the the internal cortex and hippocampus and that loop is piping in the springing, the imp that the sensor you can put areas in looping them together.

01:23
So that's where perception happens. That's where reality is. But then above in the new cortex there's what at the top of the cons those loop back into the talents. So that's where high level decision and observation is happening. That's where you're observing. And that these patterns and make them decisions about what to do that's happening into top leaders and those are also being fed back into the limit enter, you know, and Hippocampal too.
