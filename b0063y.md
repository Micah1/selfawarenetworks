Integrate Cortex Decisions

Reasoned about brain's cortical decision-making structure for 10 seconds
Below is a comprehensive summary of the key ideas and arguments presented in the recording (b0063y):

Distributed High-Level Decision-Making Across the Cortex
High-Level Processing in Cortical Layers:

Delta Frequency Oscillations:
The speaker argues that high-level decisions are not solely the domain of the prefrontal cortex. Instead, the delta frequency range found in the fifth and sixth cortical layers indicates that these layers, across all cortical regions, are actively involved in making high-level decisions.
Reconceptualizing Cortical Roles:
This perspective leads to the idea that every cortical area can be viewed as a primary sensory input cortex. For instance, the prefrontal cortex is humorously re-termed the "smell cortex," emphasizing that high-level processing is a distributed property rather than being localized to one specific region.
Integration of Sensory Inputs:

Sensory Processing in the Visual System:
In the context of the visual cortex, sensory inputs are integrated within structures like the entorhinal region (referred to as “enthrino”) and another component labeled as “lamic.” Here, sensory signals oscillate within a loop, representing a focused integration of the input data.
The Role of Oscillations:
The oscillatory activity in these loops is seen as a mechanism that refines the sensory signals, effectively determining the level of focus or attention given to the incoming information.
The Thalamus–Entorhinal–Hippocampal Loop:

Perception as a Looping Process:
A critical loop exists between the thalamus, the entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. This circuit is responsible for gathering and integrating sensory input from various areas. The speaker suggests that it is within this loop that our perception—or our constructed reality—takes shape.
Feedback Mechanism for Sensory Integration:
The loop continuously processes and refines sensory signals, linking raw input with the brain’s internal representations.
Neocortical Top Layers and High-Level Decisions:

Feedback to the Thalamus:
At the top of the neocortical column, there is a loop that sends processed information back to the thalamus. This feedback loop is where high-level decisions and observations occur, meaning that the brain is not only passively processing sensory data but actively observing patterns and making decisions about how to respond.
Integration of Observations with Sensory Input:
The high-level decisions made in these upper layers are subsequently fed back into the sensory integration circuits (the “lamic enthrino and hippocampal loop”), creating a dynamic interplay between perception and decision-making.
Overall Implications
Distributed Nature of Cognition:
The argument challenges the traditional view that isolates high-level decision-making to the prefrontal cortex. Instead, it posits that multiple cortical regions—each acting as primary sensory input areas—are involved in complex cognitive tasks.
Continuous Feedback Loops:
The brain employs continuous feedback loops between sensory integration areas and high-level processing centers. This interplay ensures that perception (the construction of reality) and decision-making are deeply intertwined processes.
Unified Processing Framework:
The described architecture implies that the brain's processing system is highly interconnected: sensory inputs are gathered and integrated in dedicated loops, and the resulting high-level interpretations and decisions are continuously fed back to refine ongoing perception.
In summary, the recording presents a model where all cortical areas participate in high-level decision-making through delta frequency oscillations in the upper layers, with a key integration loop involving the thalamus, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus. High-level observations made in the neocortex are fed back into this loop, creating a cohesive system in which perception and decision-making are fundamentally interconnected.

So this means that if the delta range in the fifth and sixth layers, delta frequency range, represents where high-level decisions are made instead of the prefrontal cortex,
then the visual cortex has high-level decisions. All the cortexes have high-level decisions. We'll call the prefrontal cortex the smell cortex.
So all the cortexes are primary sensory input cortexes, and the visual stuff integrates down in the enthrino and the lamic.
The sensory inputs integrate, and there's an oscillation there that represents a certain level of focus of the sensory input signals that are in a loop.
So there's a loop between the thalamus and the enthrino cortex and the hippocampus, and that loop is piping in the sensory input areas and looping them together.
So that's where perception happens. That's where reality is.
But then above in the neoportex, at the top of the column, those loop back into the thalamus. So that's where high-level decisions and observations happen.
That's where you're observing these patterns and making decisions about what to do. That's happening at the top layers.
And those are also being fed back into the lamic enthrino and the hippocampal loop.
