path of signals
Do signals find their own path,

or does the brain define the path of signals?

Is it like the path that the signal takes in the brain is something that contains the information of the signal as a sonic imprint, like a photograph,
or is the brain sorting signals, by their differences algorthmically, using brain space as a sort of digital hard drive space, so representations are in bits like numbers, bits in terms of coincidence patterns representing a long sparse of spatially & sequentially distributed numbers, string during playback of a neural circuit

How smart are Alpaca's? How similar are they to people? Do they have a language?

(oscillat, decoherence, synap) oscillation
Imagining that the neurons couple via the principles of oscillation, firing at the same time causes them to absorb each others timing, I think of the brain's oscillations as being clock like, even if one oscillation is permanently decoherent from another oscillation it is possible for their clocks to interact like gears, such that they will maintain their decoherence, but perhaps they will also share moments of coherence, such when firing does occassionally align (coherently) once in a long time before decoherence again. While writing this I am imagining two solar systems or two galaxies close enough to be affected by each other's gravitational pull, but not close enough to rip each other apart, and not close enough to merge. Another possibility could be that oscillatory alignment between two neurons that fired together is not just strengthened at the synaptic level, with synapses appearing and growing stronger to support connections inbetween those neurons, and synapses growing inbetween all the neurons inbetween those neurons.
