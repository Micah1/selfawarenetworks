(oscillat, fourier)
It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.
