(oscillat) Led connected to eyeball
Imagine an eyeball with an LED
imagine two eyeballs each one lighting up and LED of a different color

Imagine ten eyeballs stacked vertically and each one of them is looking at a row of LEDs that is produced by each one of them.

Now imagine that some of the LEDs are bright, brighter, brightest, some are dark, some are dull, and they exist in all colors.

but now imagine a larger set of eyeballs that is watching the rows of LEDs produced by other neurons, with each eyeball in the next set having an axon terminal from each of the previous sets wired to them

so they are able to notice phase differentials 
which is how we can have solid precise pattern recognition on what is otherwise a very fluid brain with virtualized patterns

so the larger eyes are watching patterns from previous sets of neurons

but the knowledge is played back in sequences, so knowledge appears partially in one area of the brain, then partially in another, then partially in another, and consciousness only exists in time over 4 dimensions, 1 dimension of time and 3 dimensions of space.

It's a self-aware network in 4 dimensions rendering a 4 dimensional pattern to itself that is reactive to the world and able to make prediction-based models of reality with sparse spatially & temporally distributed frequency/phase patterns that represent coicident neural firing or coincident neural inhibition deviating from the oscillatory norm of a given oscillator on some level as observed by the neurons in the oscillator, and by oscillators or circuits or cortical columns linked across the brain thanks to the activity of interneurons and major intersections of traffic such as the thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, the tempo-parietal junction, Werneck & Broca's areas and other areas of the brain that are highly connected or connecting multiple regions of the brain together.

At the level of cells in the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin there is a similar thing happening, it's like a sensory/transmitter array of nerve cells, ganglian neurons, cones, special receptors, this paragraph is not a great anatomical description, which I will fix later, but the point is that when you are detecting light, heat, vibration, pain, there is some physical interaction happening, a photon might be colliding with a protein causing it to move, flip, change position, sounds might cause hairs in your ear to vibration, that motion in all these sensor array situations is detected by neural/glial arrays, by their specialized receptors, but when they pass information the next set of neurons, up to the next layer of the neural network, the next layer doesn't know it's the 2nd layer, or the 4th layer or the 5th or 6th array of neurons, what I mean is that the signals sent to each subsequent array may as well be, from that subsequent arrays perspective, signals from the outside world. So imagine that if the first sensor array in your eyes, ears, nose, mouth or skin is capable of the perception of an image or a sound or a pattern, then so is each subsequent array of neursons, each edge community, each neural circuit, each cortical column, each layer in the hippocampus, each layer in each cortical column, and all the interesting connections between the pyramidal cells, the thalamus, the different brain regions, they are each in a sense sensors, like little eyes and ears (the receptors on every cells) that are picking up signals, connecting more synaptic branches listen better, or disconnecting to listen less, considering via thresholds that are growing or shrinking based on the growth or shrinkage of synaptic branches, and the patterns the each cell represents to the community (to the cortical colum or to the oscillating group, or from the oscillating group to other oscillating groups Is memory engram based on the synaptic connections that it has grown at that moment, in part because those synaptic connections, establish what memory the cell is tuned to receive, identify, predict, via its receptors being activated, and in the case of neurons via it’s dendrite being activated, or via it’s soma bursting.

That physical state, of the neurons literal connections creates it’s phase signal, which is distinct from all the other neurons in the brain, the memories that neuron contains are distinct, but those memories are like the keys of a piano, that becomes tuned to be receptive to certain frequencies and to transmit certain frequencies, and the oscillating group of neurons plays back many of these neural piano keys, creating an array of tempo-spatial sequences, that get blown up or magnified via the inhibition of nearby neurons in the exit terminal, which amplifies the clarify of the signal being transmitted to the next layer of cells or the next array, or the next edge community, or the next layer in the cortical column or the next cortical column, or the next oscillating group in the default mode network or the next oscillating group in the rich club network and so on.

I argued somewhere, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.
