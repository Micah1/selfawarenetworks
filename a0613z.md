a0613z

Note a0613z on my 3rd github is a quick & dirty combination of Category Theory with Petri Nets for the study of dynamic systems (biology) to study state transformations (cellular reactions) between places (inside cells & between cells) and the functors (cell signals).

I don't know if there is enough computing power in the world to model even a single biological cell at the particle scale. So effectively a cell a black box, or a category that we can only reason about abstractly.

Category Theory in particular is interesting because it allows one to study an object via its transformation without knowing everything about that object, such as what that object contains, because we can study that object's functions. Object A at time step one is A1 and that morphs into object at time step 2 represented by A2. A1 & A2 represent the object before and after its transformation, and the transformation is the arrow between the first object & the second and could be written like A1 -> A2, in another scenario A1 could transform to A3, and it might look like A1 -> A3, but if it is possible for A2 and A3 to both reach the transition state of A4 through some other function then you can say that A1 -> A2 -> A4 is composable or isomorphic to A1 -> A3 -> A4, because the starting point and the end point are the same. Two different routes, with the same overall conclusion or meaning.

In that sense if I could send a mechanical wave to a cell, that causes the same result as sending a chemical message to a cell, then we can make an argument that the two methods for communicating with the cell are isomorphic, or that one is composable to another, and I frame it in terms of “we can make an argument” to allow room for differences between the isomorphisms. So we can study an overall similarity (or isomorphism) between two different ways of triggering functions (behaviors) from biological cells but also leave room to study the differences between the chemical method of signaling & the mechanical wave method.

I'm interested in studying multidimensional natural transforms, in particular for biology, so if you have a cell that sends a signal to another cell, that other cell has some physical change and then it sends out some message that might impact the first cell, causing it to change...

In category theory an object might represent the state of a function, then the arrow is the transformation to the next state of the function which is a new object. So the objects might represent the states of a single cell changing over time, but not multiple cells interacting.

So what I am imagining is how to track two sets of objects representing the states of two cells, transforming each other's state over time.

With an object that is a biology cell you could have transformation coming from 6 different directions, for example, with six different simultaneous message functors emerging from that cell in reaction to the incoming functors.

So if you want to work on mapping really abstract multi-cellular, and intracellular transformations & functors with me that is something you could do.

So it's like cell with the identity of object A can transform into B, C, D, E, F, G states which then emit specialized functors representing some response like a protein synthesis

& transport of the same protein to another cell with the identity of A2 which can transform into B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2 states.

A Category Theory teacher asked me if I had looked at Petri nets? 

On Petri-nets, I wonder how moving unremarkable tokens between places can help model how a mechanical wave triggers a nuclear deformation leading to gene activation & protein folding. I almost need category theory inside Petri-nets to do this.

But there is something that I can take from Petri-nets and that is the concept of places for objects.

So in my Category Theory Petri-net hybrid what I am proposing is that we put objects inside places, so that there is a multi-dimensional format for interlacing the abstract spatial location of a function mapping over time.

So we have Place 1, Place 2, Place 3 etc, and Place 1 represents cell one with Object 1a.
If we have a Place inside a Place, such as the Nucleus inside a cell, or the Mitochondria inside the Nuclear, we could represent that as P1.N1.M1

With numbers representing the object in category theory that is undergoing transformation, we are representing the object's state at some abstract interval of time.

So if Cell P1.S0 the Soma fires (Soma in State 1 = S1) & it creates an electromagnetic wave that stimulates the Mitochondria in P1.N1.M1 of produce more ATP, which then results in new protein synthesis in the nucleus & the construction of new receptors on the cell body, or some other behavior to happen in the cell then we can note the transformation.

For Place Designation 1 is a Cell identity A in state identity 1, and inside that cell the soma is in state 1 which means it has burst and we want to abstract out a description of how the burst affects other parts of the same cell.

So we could write that as P1 = Cell(A). Soma fired = Soma State 1 (instead of 0), or P1.S1

If we want to describe the function mapping from the Soma to the Mitochondria then we write.


P1.N1.M1 for Cell A, the Nucleus location, and the Mitochondria location. With the 1 represented the Mitochondrial state (at some abstract time interval, we don’t know exactly when its happening but it’s a different state from some other state at some other time)

In this case the researcher needs to include a key mapping to say to readers that M0 equals the state at which the Mitochondria isn’t producing ATP, and M1 equals the state at which the Mitochondria has already been stimulated to produce additional ATP and is doing so.

So then with category theory we can describe the function between the two places with their two states as P1.S1 -> P1.N1.M1 which means activated Soma function leads to activated Mitochondrial function.

Activated Mitochondria function M1 -> leads to Activated Protein Synthesis ps1 -> which leads to Activated Receptor Growth R1 and a change in the state of the over cell P1 to state 2 or P2.

Now if I could stimulate P1.N1 with a mechanical wave and trigger the M1 to activate ps1 -> R1 -> P2 then you can draw an isomorphism between

Soma burst activated S1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)
And Mechanical wave activated MW1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)
Or Electric wave activation of EM1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)

That opens the door for notation intended to study or log all the different mechanical wave frequencies/amplitudes, or electric wave stimulation frequencies/amplitudes to contrast and compare their effects on soma activation.

That’s just an example.

The point is that it's not just about studying a dynamical transition between X number of states in N number of places, but about studying the abstract composability of natural transformations between two different types of dynamical transitions between two states.
