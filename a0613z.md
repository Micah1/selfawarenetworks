a0613z

Note a0613z on my 3rd github is a quick & dirty combination of Category Theory with Petri Nets for the study of dynamic systems (biology) to study state transformations (cellular reactions) between places (inside cells & between cells) and the functors (cell signals).

I don't know if there is enough computing power in the world to model even a single biological cell at the particle scale. So effectively a cell a black box, or a category that we can only reason about abstractly.

Category Theory in particular is interesting because it allows one to study an object via its transformation without knowing everything about that object, such as what that object contains, because we can study that object's functions. Object A at time step one is A1 and that morphs into object at time step 2 represented by A2. A1 & A2 represent the object before and after its transformation, and the transformation is the arrow between the first object & the second and could be written like A1 -> A2, in another scenario A1 could transform to A3, and it might look like A1 -> A3, but if it is possible for A2 and A3 to both reach the transition state of A4 through some other function then you can say that A1 -> A2 -> A4 is composable or isomorphic to A1 -> A3 -> A4, because the starting point and the end point are the same. Two different routes, with the same overall conclusion or meaning.

In that sense if I could send a mechanical wave to a cell, that causes the same result as sending a chemical message to a cell, then we can make an argument that the two methods for communicating with the cell are isomorphic, or that one is composable to another, and I frame it in terms of “we can make an argument” to allow room for differences between the isomorphisms. So we can study an overall similarity (or isomorphism) between two different ways of triggering functions (behaviors) from biological cells but also leave room to study the differences between the chemical method of signaling & the mechanical wave method.

I'm interested in studying multidimensional natural transforms, in particular for biology, so if you have a cell that sends a signal to another cell, that other cell has some physical change and then it sends out some message that might impact the first cell, causing it to change...

In category theory an object might represent the state of a function, then the arrow is the transformation to the next state of the function which is a new object. So the objects might represent the states of a single cell changing over time, but not multiple cells interacting.

So what I am imagining is how to track two sets of objects representing the states of two cells, transforming each other's state over time.

With an object that is a biology cell you could have transformation coming from 6 different directions, for example, with six different simultaneous message functors emerging from that cell in reaction to the incoming functors.

So if you want to work on mapping really abstract multi-cellular, and intracellular transformations & functors with me that is something you could do.

So it's like cell with the identity of object A can transform into B, C, D, E, F, G states which then emit specialized functors representing some response like a protein synthesis

& transport of the same protein to another cell with the identity of A2 which can transform into B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2 states.

A Category Theory teacher asked me if I had looked at Petri nets? 

On Petri-nets, I wonder how moving unremarkable tokens between places can help model how a mechanical wave triggers a nuclear deformation leading to gene activation & protein folding. I almost need category theory inside Petri-nets to do this.

But there is something that I can take from Petri-nets and that is the concept of places for objects.

So in my Category Theory Petri-net hybrid what I am proposing is that we put objects inside places, so that there is a multi-dimensional format for interlacing the abstract spatial location of a function mapping over time.

So we have Place 1, Place 2, Place 3 etc, and Place 1 represents cell one with Object 1a.
If we have a Place inside a Place, such as the Nucleus inside a cell, or the Mitochondria inside the Nuclear, we could represent that as P1.N1.M1

With numbers representing the object in category theory that is undergoing transformation, we are representing the object's state at some abstract interval of time.

So if Cell P1.S0 the Soma fires (Soma in State 1 = S1) & it creates an electromagnetic wave that stimulates the Mitochondria in P1.N1.M1 of produce more ATP, which then results in new protein synthesis in the nucleus & the construction of new receptors on the cell body, or some other behavior to happen in the cell then we can note the transformation.

For Place Designation 1 is a Cell identity A in state identity 1, and inside that cell the soma is in state 1 which means it has burst and we want to abstract out a description of how the burst affects other parts of the same cell.

So we could write that as P1 = Cell(A). Soma fired = Soma State 1 (instead of 0), or P1.S1

If we want to describe the function mapping from the Soma to the Mitochondria then we write.


P1.N1.M1 for Cell A, the Nucleus location, and the Mitochondria location. With the 1 represented the Mitochondrial state (at some abstract time interval, we don’t know exactly when its happening but it’s a different state from some other state at some other time)

In this case the researcher needs to include a key mapping to say to readers that M0 equals the state at which the Mitochondria isn’t producing ATP, and M1 equals the state at which the Mitochondria has already been stimulated to produce additional ATP and is doing so.

So then with category theory we can describe the function between the two places with their two states as P1.S1 -> P1.N1.M1 which means activated Soma function leads to activated Mitochondrial function.

Activated Mitochondria function M1 -> leads to Activated Protein Synthesis ps1 -> which leads to Activated Receptor Growth R1 and a change in the state of the over cell P1 to state 2 or P2.

Now if I could stimulate P1.N1 with a mechanical wave and trigger the M1 to activate ps1 -> R1 -> P2 then you can draw an isomorphism between

Soma burst activated S1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)
And Mechanical wave activated MW1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)
Or Electric wave activation of EM1 (P1.N1.ps0.M1.R0 -> P2.N1.ps1.M1.R1)

That opens the door for notation intended to study or log all the different mechanical wave frequencies/amplitudes, or electric wave stimulation frequencies/amplitudes to contrast and compare their effects on soma activation.

That’s just an example.

The point is that it's not just about studying the dynamic transitions of the states of abstractly or concretely defined Places with the categories representing state.

The States of each place are Categories inside each Place. A State could represent a Place at another time step, but it does not have to represent a time step precisely which leaves the door open for non-linear transformations (in biology) or user input (in computation).

In an entity component system the Place is the Entity, the Category represents the state of the entity, and the morphism or functor is the component of the entity or the component of the system that the entity interacts with.

Studying the abstract composability of natural transformations between two different types of dynamical transitions between two states.

As it turns out, other people had the same idea, but had different ideas about how to go about it. Here are some links:

John Baez: Structured cospans and Petri nets
https://youtu.be/2CjTs9lmEHI

In Baez's interpretation the Petri net is a commutative monoidal category, or he says you can think of it as a symmetric monoidal category.

In his thinking the markings are the categories, and the transition of the markings from one place to another place is the morphism between one category & the next.

However this does not solve a problem it creates a problem, because now, in his math, functions are tied to movements across places.

I had the idea to combine category theory with petri nets to study the transformations of places applying a function or functor to a category to transform the original category AND to study the functor's transformation of other categories that represent other places that are affected by the category that originated the functor.

In my version each place has it's own set of categories which represent the set of all stages of transformation, or the current state of transformation & subsequent tranformations (or changes) to the state of that place. The place for example may represent a cell, a protein, an organ, a transistor, a machine, a person, a city, or the shape (magnitude & frequency) of wave for example. 

A place might represent a topology or a system or a set of states, and yes places are a type of category. A place is abstractly the set of all possible categories for a given place, whether that is a real place or an abstract place. It has a location that is relative to some other place that is also being studied. Two places can be overlayed in theory, very close, or very far away from one another, but they cannot be the same place, because two places that are exactly the same would have the same identity. However places are not necessarily fixed in location or scale or identity. Places can merge with other places, they can shrink, grow, become deleted, or they can be created.

In my version of this categories are used in place of markers, but they do not denote the movement of anything, and there are no moving markers or moving categories in this version, because the point is that the map between categories inside a place represents the stage change, rather than moving markers.

The point in my version of this category theory petri nets combination is to study how the transformations to one place produce functors that transform other places, and the categories represent the states of a place, which is similar in concept to a time step in linear algebra, but it's abstracted to a state instead of a time step, with the timestep & the function represented by the arrow or functor between places.

You could have a transition box to contain a sequence of functors similar to having an array of functions.

Place 1 (Category A is state 1, Cat B is state 2, Cat C = State 3)

Place 1 -> Place 2
Category A might have an arrow to array index 0 in the transition box that represents the function produced by Place 1 in the state with the identity of Category A.

The transition box array might look like (function1, function 2, function 3)

The transition box could be a matrix or a set of matrices in theory, but the intention is for it to be a set of functions or functors or morphisms.

function1, from the above array, could, for example, be triggered by Category A inside Place 1 might trigger both Place 1 & Place 2 to transform to their respective next state which might be Category B for Place 1, and it might be Category B or some other category for Place 2 for example.

Depending on what you are doing it may be useful for you to specify whether the identity of your category is specific to a given place, or is more abstractly the identity of a category that is not specific to any place. In the former case the identity of Category A specific to Place 1 is (A, P1) or (A o P1), meaning it's Category A of P. If you want to make it clear that the Categories identity is not connected to the Place you could denote the identity as something like (A o P) or (A,P) or (A,) meaning that it's Category A independent of any P.

In this case the transition box contains a function that transforms both the original place to the next category, and the subsequent place to the next category.

This is helpful because every time a cell or a system sends a signal, it is a changed, even as its signal changes something else.

When I think about functional programming, like functional javascript, where objects can be functions, it makes me think that places can be transition boxes instead of places, functors could be categories, and so a place could represent a map of functor categories, useful for studying how a functor category transforms in reaction to signals from some transition box which represents actually signals from some other place.

In the context of Entity, Component, Systems (ECS in programming) a transition box could contain an array of objects that might represent component transformations, and a system transition box might have morphisms that point to the transition boxes causing them to iterate through the array of possible component tranformations. 

To represent non-linear state transformations of components, or computed component transformations, the array might contain the set of all possible component transformation, including an infinite set of component transformations, with the rate of iteration serving to advance the index of the array to the place where the calculated component would be indexed if it was produced.

I'm thinking of Willans' Formula which calculates primes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5s0h42GfvM

The point is that you would need a "System" to calculate the non-linear input (a biology system) or the user input (to a computer system), the system could represent a neuron or a neural network or a mathematical formula, the "System" would also need to define the formula or vector's place in the index in the array in the Transition box. In theory if the same non-linear input is received again the same index is triggered, in reality the same non-linear input may received twice, and so a constant stream of new indexes might be generated to represent a component that is a unique reaction to a unique input.

The point of unique components (or reactions) being indexed is so that they can be studied. Indexed components can be compared to one another, and they can be compared to the states of places that affected the components, and the states of places were affected by components and if the system isn't defined then perhaps it might be inferred from the study of the places & their interactions with the transition boxes.

Of course the array could be a log of states in a place. Just as it could be a log of component states in a transition box.

Each index in each array could be a variable, a number, or a category in category theory.

If the array indices are filled with categories those categories are essentially variables that could represent components (functions), sets, or topologies.

To use an array or to use a map.

Arrays & maps in programming are useful for non-linear iterations right? 

However a map might be useful for indexing variations to components that are similar, or isomorphic in some way but different in some other way. Studying the differences between isomorphisms is one of the tools of Category Theory, so if the output of a non-linear computation or the output of a user input to a system such as a neural network can be defined as a map, and that could be a map of the weights, or a map of the output, or a map of both the weights & the output of the neural network or system, then the indexed components could represent changes to a static map that represents the Place or field of all possible states for a Place.

In this way the Categories inside the Places and inside the Transition Boxes, whether they are inside arrays or not inside arrays (either way) might represent variables that represent Maps (in the context of Javascript Maps, a map is similar to a Javascript object, but it's iterable like an Array, and it looks like a matrix of value pairs.)

A Category representing a Map inside a place is a good idea, because then the Category has custom indexible complexity for novel states to be generated (from novel inputs), and new categories inside that place can represent complex transformations of state (such as the state of a cell or the state that is all the weights of a neural network (or a state that is the output of a system (such as a neural network) because more correctly a neural network is a functor that belongs in a transition box))).
