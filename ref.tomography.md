    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
    4  

   21  
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   23  

   43  
   44: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   45  
   46: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   47  
   48: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   53: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   54  

   61  
   62: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   63  for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations
   64  
   65: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   66  add to the discussion of the granularity of consciousness citing Jon Lieff, M.D.'s work.

   81  
   82: NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography includes communication with Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, T-Cells, Microglia, and basically any type of cell. NAPOT interfaces with all cells via COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, because all cells exchange signals, and have receptors, membranes, and other structures to receive signals & detect information from temporal cascades of coincident activations.
   83

  105: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  106  

  118  
  119: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  120  
  121  # New theory of evolution
  122: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  123  
  124: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  125  
  126: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  127  

  145  
  146: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  147  
  148  # "A synthetic protein-level neural network in mammalian cells"
  149: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  40: Is the Hippocampal Entorhinal loop overstated? or understated? because it looks like brainwide input is interdependent on Hippocampal connections.

  2: (oscillat, field, array, , tomography, cortex) Neural Oscillating Array Tomography is the idea that 
  3  the brain consists of sequences of arrays, from the sensor arrays in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin, to each layer of cortex inside each cortical column. I had this idea and then I saw this paper which talks about overlapping edge communities in the brain "The diversity and multiplexity of edge communities within and between brain systems" https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01514-X

  5: Essentially what they are talking about in terms of edge communities, like vertices between dipoles of brain activity, I am arguing could be imagined as overlapping sensor/transmitter arrays that are doing neural oscillator array tomography.

   16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   17  

   71  
   72: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   73  
   74: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

  121: Neural Oscillatory Tomography for constructing Self-Aware Neural Networks and
  122: Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networking for downloading uploading and linking the mind to other Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networks
  123: Neural Oscillatory Tomography Neural Network reconstruction, duplication, and mind extension, and mind transmission.
  124  We can pull your representations of you and the universe into a computer, and link to you to it, to create a black box recorder that can restore your mind into a new body after death.
  125  The output of the oscillations of the brain can be used to reconstruct the entire oscillating network at a moment in time, sort of like sending in sonar to probe and record the reflections
  126: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  127  

  130  
  131: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
  132  
  133  and we could do this by creating a multi-modal 3D reconstruction of brain signals
  134: determine the locations of signal origins (eeg source localization) trace their paths (electical impedance tomography, and contrast this with openwater's infrared and ultra sound holographic reconstructions, as neurons expand when they fire,
  135  all of this topological data can be combined when combined when aligned to a time series with technology such as Tim Mullen's openpype or neuropype. (Intheon).

  144  
  145: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  146  

  157  
  158: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to György Buzsáki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

a0127z.md:
   16  
   17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   59  

   66  
   67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

  3: Neural Array-Projection Tomography
  4  I am suggesting that a neuron is projecting its phase to an array of neurons connected to its exit terminal, and those exit terminal receiving neurons are simultaneously receiving phases from other neurons via other synapses, the neurons learn new patterns by adjusting their synapses, some synapses are told to speed up, slow down, fire, or become inhibited from firing, and they pass on one of each of these four signals to each branch of their exit terminal. Each neuron in the receiving array now represents how much of the pattern that it was receptive to was received by sending a phase that represents some indicator of how much it has seen.

  7: Neural Functional Isomorphic Tomography through Sequences of Oscillating Arrays of tonically synching with Resonating high frequency Phasic Signal Energy Dissipation, triggering large scale inhibitor patterns, that all the tonically firing neurons notice because their growth rate has been slowed in phase relative to other neurons that are firing in that same interval that they were inhibited, this includes decoherene patterns created by neurons that alternately oscillating in a splay state that decoheres the space between these neurons, dendritic spines fall apart, and the energy that was going to them is at the same time shift to a point in the configuration space of the neurons cell membrane that intersects with another neurons simultaneous firing somewhere else in the brain resulting in the growth of dendritic spines from that point in the cells membrane, the transformation efficiency function via scultping spacetime with decoherence patterns and the changes to spacetime are read by other layers of oscillating 
  8  

a0149z.md:
   17  
   18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   19  

  106  # Main Point:
  107: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

  113  
  114: ⟪ 260 characters skipped ⟫no meaning, it's just a wave. So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.

  18  # Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields
  19: When I close my eyes and say the word tomato I see a tomato, I see red, I remember properties of the tomato like the taste. Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

   9  
  10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  10  

  54  
  55: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  85: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

    8  
    9: The next project is going to involve EIT Electrical Impedance Tomography, again with WebVR, another VR headset, Volumetric Video and 3D Cross-hair Convolutional Neural Networks. The goal is to create or acquire a 3D experience, to acquire 3D medical imagining with good spatial resolution (beyond what EEG can offer, closer to fMRI but perhaps improved beyond fMRI) and then to use Object Segmentation (3D Cross-hair convolutional neural networks) to correlate brainwave patterns with patterns in the 3D experience to establish next generation nerve correlations.

  107  
  108: I am on the Vision Agency team that makes MicrodoseVR, I have a friend who is working on advanced technology to render volumetric video with a neural network solving a huge number of problems (with the typical firehose of data generated by lightfield capture) I am part of the Dreamteam of Neurohackers and I am part of the NeurotechX team which includes Neuroscientists who are willing to donate time money and equipment (such as the electrical impedance tomography machine I mentioned previously) to further the goals of Neurotech Research. I manage the Silicon Valley Global Network group (with 80k members) with Sheridan Tatsuno so he has been a team member on the media (group moderation and news) side of things.

  178: # Cellulary Oscillating Tomography: Biochemical Gradient as tempo-spatial signals
  179  Chemical Gradients outside or inside cells may help facilitate cell behavior that requires coincident signal activation. (this concept might apply to pools of ions & pools of neurotransmitters & chemical gradients from vitamin deposits & oxidative or inflammatory debris = antigens)

  184  
  185: # Cellulary Oscillating Tomography: Procedurally Generation New Biological Functions inside multi-cellular organisms.
  186  is not just about novel receptor growth that forms responses to novel new patterns, its about how cells inside an organism compute/generate new functions, or novel responses, to signals they have never seen before, such as how cell might respond to new types of inflammation, or new environments. The principle of natural selection should work in any multi-cellular body, allowing cells to adapt, mutate, computer future structures, and evolve inside a single animal. It would be like growing a third eye while you are alive, and then passing it down to your offspring if that meant surviving where two eyed organisms did not.

  206  
  207: Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.
  208  
  209: # Cellular Oscillating Tomography re-phrased:
  210  So the new theory of evolution, that I am proposing, has 3 steps,

  214: 2. Cellular Oscillating (Pattern) Tomography
  215  Cell based novel pattern learning plus novel computed cell & multi-cellular structures (like organs & bodies)

  221  
  222: The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.
  223  

  229  
  230: Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.
  231  

  239  
  240: Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.
  241  

  243  
  244: ^ ha I just invented a new term Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography CCOT but it is encompassed in the definition of NAPOT.
  245  
  246  # NAPOT Motor Control: Why you are conscious of your muscle movement.
  247: Notice that NAPOT, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, fits with the existing concepts of Hierarchical Tempo-Spatial Activation Sequences for incoming sensory inputs and outgoing motor sequences.
  248

  10  
  11: On top of that the concept of increasing or decreasing electrical valence maps directly to the concept of increasing or decreasing phase signals in NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. What is being projected from a neuron & a neuron array is a phase change, that phase change could also be described as a change in relative electrical valence. On top of that interesting connection, your behavior in effect is absolutely mapped to the phase changes or valences moving between your neural arrays (which including any neuron and any oscillating group of cells such as a cortical column or an anatomical structure like the amygdala)

   8: Cellular Oscillating Tomography means that the multiple activations of receptors & the subsequent cascading intracellular reactions & the signals that leave cells to affect other cells bind together via oscillation, and the changes in those oscillations create sensory patterns that we taste, hear, smell, see, feel, or sense in any other way.
   9  
  10: This article below that makes the case for multiple receptors being useful for Umami detection is a great example of the concept I am describing with Cellular Oscillating Tomography, and also with Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, multiple cell receptors are describe as being involved in the spatial & temporal detection of flavor & texture patterns over time.

After reading this I just think of Cellular Oscillating Tomography as a framework for organizing decades of prior research in computational biology at all scales. From waves to proteins, from Prokaryotes like Bacteria & Archaea to Eukaryotic cells including advanced multi-cellular organisms like people.

  3: Neural Array Projection Tomography Properties (3D Patterns?) 
  4  Could it be that patterns gain dimensionality when activated & transmitted? As if a flat pattern unfolds to become a 3D pattern when synaptic activity are magnified onto an oscillating array? The neuron is like a projector because it passes its phase pattern to an entire sensory array of neurons who are combining it pattern with the patterns remembered and projected by other neurons.

  6: Multi-layer phase field pattern representation (in brain wave oscillations), tomography with dendrites, and phase changes with exit terminal branches. Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and o

  115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

    7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).

And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.

  46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

  13: With the idea being that when you have two sets of unstructured signal data, such as heart waves, brainwaves, they might be comparable with a common baseline, reference frame, which in this case is a timeline, but also the neural network of your brain can compare signals by their locations in space, with location serving as another baseline or reference frame to compare unstructured signals. To construct a tomography representation that unites signals from the eyes & ears.

   9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.

  44  
  45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.

That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.

  13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.

   6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   7  01:12
   8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
   9  01:43

  61  15:02
  62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.

  15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  16  03:20

  22  05:28
  23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  24  05:51

  60  15:21
  61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

  80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

    12    18: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

    53:     3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
    54:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
    55:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
    56:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
    57:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
    58:    47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."

    60:    66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
    61:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
    62     92: All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.
    63:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
    64:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
    65:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
    66:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
    67    132: But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote. 

    83     25: in otherwords as an oscillation pattern we are literally absorbing and emitting spacetime simultaneously it is moving through us because we are dissipative vortexes

The oscillators propogate an inner rendering to neurons deeper in the brain, but the signature of those oscillations may appear to be similar because they are scaled up patterns

   544     6: How do two neurons that are not connected form a connection after each of them has fired? It's not that they wire together, its that synchrononous firing, or firing within some window that might be a few milliseconds causes neurons to oscillate together, it's not that they are wired together, its that the synaptic tree that connects them aligns itself so that they will fire together when they both detect a pattern that they have learned together, but this also allows an entire set of neurons to possibly be the one neuron to fire in response to a pattern that many have learned, it makes patterns invariant to any single synapse or any single neuron and any neural circuit inside a cortical column oscillator because the oscillator as oscillator as collective has learned to represent the pattern invariant to its original firing location, the pattern can be transmitted across the brain, to entrain other similar patterns, but also to vote with, correct, and fix the representations collected by other neural circuits but also add to them, like the display I described the oscillator as being had many layers, like photoshop layers, but these are layers of interlinked renderings, at different scales, representing different sections of the screen at different times depending on head position & orientation & incoming sensory data.

   579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

   587      8: Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
   588:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."

   726     6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
   727:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.
   728    12: Their (the post-synaptic group of one exit terminal) group shared a common temporal oscillation (the LTD neurotransmitter event) so they fire together, and the next row then fires together, the whole oscillator simulaneously learns many versions of the same pattern everywhere, stored in the synapses, but magnified in the vertically oscillating cortical column, and magnified horizontally across the brains interneurons between pyramid cells, plus the other highly connective brain areas. Including the corpus callosum, the parietal temporal junction, the thalamic bridges and this high level horizontal pattern might be coordinated with help from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which may also have an oscillator that is magnifying learned firing sequences. I am preferential to the idea, written about in "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins" that the cortical column is actually functionally mimicking the grid cell and place cell everywhere in the brain. That's interesting especially if this idea of consciousness being a rendering or an image that has to exist somewhere now has to include some idea of how the results of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop connects to the thalamus in way that might bridge information with the neocortex otherwise

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
   906:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography

So that the waves of inhibition that follow the action potential sequence cause a next level of adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
   908:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incoming data.

  2233    78: Then pair the notion of all your internal representations having space-time dimensional characteristics with the notion that your brain is like a super 3D graph neural / glial network with oscillating phase patterns being communicated between cell networks in your brain across the space & time of your brain.
  2234:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2419    72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  2420:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
  2421  

  2467      10:   18: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.
  2468:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2476     254:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

  2478     276:   15: I am reading a book called Sync and he just spoke about how body temperature at the time someone goes to sleep determines whether they are going to sleep 15 hours, 8 hours, or 5 hours for example. This is a really interesting book about how oscillators work but he talks a lot about sleep, the circadium clock, and the synchronized timing of neurons firing, fireflies, and mathmodels with oscillator fluid dynamics.

  2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  2660     509:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2772:     28:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  2800:    113:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2807:    136:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.

  2812:    184:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and o

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  2825:    265:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.

  2830:    355:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2837:    442:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
  2838:    451:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2897:    550:    257:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2904:    563:    309:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  2909:    591:    416:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  2911:    593:    424:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.

  2927:    676:    776:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2935:    742:   1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3000:    855:   1324:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  3007:    865:   1342:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  3014:    876:   1361:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3087:   1078:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3095:   1088:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  3115:   1113:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
  3116:   1114:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  3123:   1124:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  3130:   1135:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

  3152:   1205:   236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3363:     6:   48: Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.
  3364:     9:     3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
  3365:    10:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
  3366:    11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  3367:    12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  3368:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3371:    16:    66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
  3372:    17:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  3373:    18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  3374:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  3375:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3376:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  3377:    26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
  3378:    27:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

  3382:    38:   5: Essentially what they are talking about in terms of edge communities, like vertices between dipoles of brain activity, I am arguing could be imagined as overlapping sensor/transmitter arrays that are doing neural oscillator array tomography.

  3384:    43:   196: and so spacetime oscillatory tomography is why we have planets with people orbiting stars, and not a perfectly even distribution of positive and negative particles

  3386:    48:   20: The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.

  3388:    52:    16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
  3389:    53:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.

  3393:    58:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  3394: ⟪ 321 characters skipped ⟫ween cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
  3395:    61:   142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  3396:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
  3397:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  3398:    66:    58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
  3399:    67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

  3404:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
  3405:    84:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

  3409:    98:   19: When I close my eyes and say the word tomato I see a tomato, I see red, I remember properties of the tomato like the taste. Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  3411:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.

  3416:   133:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
  3417:   134:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
  3418:   135:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

  3423:   153:   6: Multi-layer phase field pattern representation (in brain wave oscillations), tomography with dendrites, and phase changes with exit terminal branches. Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and o

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  3429:   185:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.

  3431:   193:   95: ⟪ 553 characters skipped ⟫d so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience.

  3433:   236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3438:   275:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

   906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1226    2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  1227:   2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  1269    2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  1271    2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

   13:     3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
   14:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   15:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   16:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   17:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   18:    47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."

   20:    66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   21:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
   22:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
   23:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   24:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
   25:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
   26:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   27:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

   87:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.

I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?

  225:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  226:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  227:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

  230:   109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.

  233:   310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
  234:   361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?

  237:   225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.

  240:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  243:   301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
  244:   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
  245:   494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.

  248:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  249:   1620: It's just amazing and they're all they're all those like they're they're all have there's all like commonalities they're all basically like, you know coming down to vape in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way I think of of, you know, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  250:   1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  251:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.

  254:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  255:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?

   34: I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T.. Read note a0270z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md Note this note, like all the notes, is still under construction, further changes lay ahead.

   62  Regarding the terms evolution vs development.
   63: The consequence of C.O.T. Cellular Oscillating Tomography, is there is no more concept of development apart from evolution, there is only evolution. There is no more artificial that is separate from natural. There is no more man that is separate from nature. There is only nature.

  2074     907: ⟪ 411 characters skipped ⟫ adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1875     726:    6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
  1876:    727    10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  7024     579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  7071:    908    83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas).

  7425    2476:    254:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

  7508    2625:    217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  7510    2627:    222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  7528    2645:    362:   13: its frequency is an attractor to other particles, so they start clumbing together over time, eventual stars planets and even what we call life which is actually just a continuation of the fractal of the cosmos on increasingly complex scales because they follow the laws of entropy by exporting increating chaos over all to a surrounding environment and getting enough energy to maintain its oscillation equilibrium

  7532    2649:    416:   13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1.

  7545    2662:    513:   10: I think it explains how needing to urinate can wake up the brain, because chemical messages can change the frequencies of brainwaves, more chemical activity from inflammed bladder, can, in a way similar to pain signals, interact with the existing brainwave state the way two oscillating frequency bands in close proximity interact with one another

  7637    2754:   1137:   52: 16. I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

    40:    44: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
    41     45  
    42:    46: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
    43     47  
    44:    48: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

    70:   122: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
    71    123  
    72:   124: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
    73    125  
    74:   126: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.

    85:   149: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

I had this idea and then I saw this paper which talks about overlapping edge communities in the brain "The diversity and multiplexity of edge communities within and between brain systems" https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01514-X

We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   265    4  I am suggesting that a neuron is projecting its phase to an array of neurons connected to its exit terminal, and those exit terminal receiving neurons are simultaneously receiving phases from other neurons via other synapses, the neurons learn new patterns by adjusting their synapses, some synapses are told to speed up, slow down, fire, or become inhibited from firing, and they pass on one of each of these four signals to each branch of their exit terminal. Each neuron in the receiving array now represents how much of the pattern that it was receptive to was received by sending a phase that represents some indicator of how much it has seen.

   277     17  
   278:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

   419:   15: What I am saying is that the math of the brain, like the math in a computer becomes a conscious object-segmented self-aware rendering via Neural Oscillatory Tomography. The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.

   436    54  
   437:   55: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

The goal is to create or acquire a 3D experience, to acquire 3D medical imagining with good spatial resolution (beyond what EEG can offer, closer to fMRI but perhaps improved beyond fMRI) and then to use Object Segmentation (3D Cross-hair convolutional neural networks) to correlate brainwave patterns with patterns in the 3D experience to establish next generation nerve correlations.

The principle of natural selection should work in any multi-cellular body, allowing cells to adapt, mutate, computer future structures, and evolve inside a single animal. It would be like growing a third eye while you are alive, and then passing it down to your offspring if that meant surviving where two eyed organisms did not.

   506    206  
   507:   207: Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.

   516    221  
   517:   222: The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.
   518    223  

   520    229  
   521:   230: Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.
   522    231  

   524    239  
   525:   240: Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.
   526    241  

   528    243

   531    246  # NAPOT Motor Control: Why you are conscious of your muscle movement.
   532:   247: Notice that NAPOT, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, fits with the existing concepts of Hierarchical Tempo-Spatial Activation Sequences for incoming sensory inputs and outgoing motor sequences.
   533    248  

   536    10  
   537:   11: On top of that the concept of increasing or decreasing electrical valence maps directly to the concept of increasing or decreasing phase signals in NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. What is being projected from a neuron & a neuron array is a phase change, that phase change could also be described as a change in relative electrical valence. On top of that interesting connection, your behavior in effect is absolutely mapped to the phase changes or valences moving between your neural arrays (which including any neuron and any oscillating group of cells such as a cortical column or an anatomical structure like the amygdala)
   538    12  

   541     7  
   542:    8: Cellular Oscillating Tomography means that the multiple activations of receptors & the subsequent cascading intracellular reactions & the signals that leave cells to affect other cells bind together via oscillation, and the changes in those oscillations create sensory patterns that we taste, hear, smell, see, feel, or sense in any other way.
   543     9  
   544:   10: This article below that makes the case for multiple receptors being useful for Umami detection is a great example of the concept I am describing with Cellular Oscillating Tomography, and also with Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, multiple cell receptors are describe as being involved in the spatial & temporal detection of flavor & texture patterns over time.

As if a flat pattern unfolds to become a 3D pattern when synaptic activity are magnified onto an oscillating array? The neuron is like a projector because it passes its phase pattern to an entire sensory array of neurons who are combining it pattern with the patterns remembered and projected by other neurons.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.
   741    108  

   744    45  
   745:   46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

   772:   13: With the idea being that when you have two sets of unstructured signal data, such as heart waves, brainwaves, they might be comparable with a common baseline, reference frame, which in this case is a timeline, but also the neural network of your brain can compare signals by their locations in space, with location serving as another baseline or reference frame to compare unstructured signals. To construct a tomography representation that unites signals from the eyes & ears.

   776     8  
   777:    9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
   778    10  

   780    44  
   781:   45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.
   782    46  

   790    104  22:51
   791:   105: Now there are, there are basically hairs connected to neurons, basically hair cells that are detecting the vibrations of your of the sounds, but it's like again, it's like a sensor array that is doing that. That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
   792    106  23:30

   797    12  
   798:   13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.
   799    14  

   802     5  00:23
   803:    6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   804     7  01:12
   805:    8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
   806     9  01:43

   808    61  15:02
   809:   62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.
   810    63  15:46

   813    56  13:01
   814:   57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
   815    58  14:00

   817    60  14:25
   818:   61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?
   819    62  14:53

   827:   33: # Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)
   828    34  

   847    14  02:42
   848:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
   849    16  03:20

   851    22  05:28
   852:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
   853    24  05:51

   855    60  15:21
   856:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.
   857    62  16:00

   878    108  
   879:   109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.
   880    110  

   892    309  42:11
   893:   310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
   894    311  

   900    360  51:13
   901:   361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?
   902    362  

   909    224  02:02:58
   910:   225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
   911    226  

   918    79  
   919:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.
   920  

   927     300  58:42
   928:    301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
   929     302  
   930     303  59:02
   931:    304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.

   938:    494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.
   939     495  

   987    1096  
   988:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
   989    1098  02:59:12

   995    1619  
   996:   1620: It's just amazing and they're all they're all those like they're they're all have there's all like commonalities they're all basically like, you know coming down to vape in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way I think of of, you know, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.

   998    1622  
   999: ⟪ 351 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  1000    1624  04:33:13
  1001    1625  
  1002:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.
  1003    1627  04:33:47

  1024    1168  03:17:28
  1025:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  1026    1170  

  1028    1174  03:18:18
  1029:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?
  1030    1176  

  1033    367  01:03:35
  1034:   368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.

  1050:   122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.

  1161:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  1242:   2075:    908    83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography.

  1343:   4044:    465:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1511:   4913:    16     40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  1512:   4914:    17:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

  2494      20    52: I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.

  2498:     54:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
  2499:     55:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  2500:     56:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  2501:     57:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2506      62     92: All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.
  2507:     63:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  2508:     64:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  2509:     65:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2510:     66:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  2511      67    132: But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote. 

  2513      83     25: in otherwords as an oscillation pattern we are literally absorbing and emitting spacetime simultaneously it is moving through us because we are dissipative vortexes

  2541     377     8: Any set of points that you feed into the system's oscillating array they come out larger afterwords, like the enlargement function of a photocopier. The action potentials total area is magnified by a factor larger than 1 because it impacts a lot of other cells via the vesicle releases following the Soma burst event.
  2542     378    16: the transformed pattern, enlarged essentially retains an isomorphism to the original pattern, in that the cells that fire next at a higher level are representing components of a scaled up pattern, one that connects with other scaled up patterns which causes oscillators in the brain to integrate each others patterns, but also to scale down patterns, because 
  2543:    379:   20: The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.
  2544     380    24: So then oscillators are learning and recalling scaled up phase patterns, and these scales up phase patterns are the fabric of organisms internal representations, or its inner screens, because its what neurons everywhere in the brain are communicating, with pattern recognition at the synapse level scaled up to be observed as an effect on the global oscillator which is then observed by neurons the same way that the outside world is observed by neurons. The oscillators propogate an inner rendering to neurons deeper in the brain, but the signature of those oscillations may appear to be similar because they are scaled up patterns

  2579     544     6: How do two neurons that are not connected form a connection after each of them has fired? It's not that they wire together, its that synchrononous firing, or firing within some window that might be a few milliseconds causes neurons to oscillate together, it's not that they are wired together, its that the synaptic tree that connects them aligns itself so that they will fire together when they both detect a pattern that they have learned together, but this also allows an entire set of neurons to possibly be the one neuron to fire in response to a pattern that many have learned, it makes patterns invariant to any single synapse or any single neuron and any neural circuit inside a cortical column oscillator because the oscillator as oscillator as collective has learned to represent the pattern invariant to its original firing location, the pattern can be transmitted across the brain, to entrain other similar patterns, but also to vote with, correct, and fix the representations collected by other neural circuits but also add to them, like the display I described the oscillator as being had many layers, like photoshop layers, but these are layers of interlinked renderings, at different scales, representing different sections of the screen at different times depending on head position & orientation & incoming sensory data.

  2584     579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

  2586     587      8: Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
  2587:    588:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
  2588     589     21: "We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."

  2590     597     82: To go into more depth on how the physics of oscillations might manipulate information states, consider that information is not just a change in a phase pattern, but it's also a change in the synaptic pattern, and the phase patterns are not just electric, magnetic, chemical, there are also anything receptors are receptive to, such as mechanical vibrations, but the understanding the potential interactions of these phase based brain state transformations via the physics of oscillations will require some mathematical physics modeling.

  2593     600    108: I argue that the electric field and the magnetic fields in the brain are EACH relevant as attractor points in the brainwave oscillations (of tempo-spatially distributed phase changes), and these brainwave fields serve as attractors that drive oscillatory activities such as coupling, decoupling, synchronization, desynchronization, tuning, detuning, phase precession, and oscillatory phase coherence/decoherence (and my argument is that the phase differences are information states, like short term expectations, or attractors (that serve as information configurations) for short term memory oscillations)

  2610     726     6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
  2611:    727:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.
  2612     728    12: Their (the post-synaptic group of one exit terminal) group shared a common temporal oscillation (the LTD neurotransmitter event) so they fire together, and the next row then fires together, the whole oscillator simulaneously learns many versions of the same pattern everywhere, stored in the synapses, but magnified in the vertically oscillating cortical column, and magnified horizontally across the brains interneurons between pyramid cells, plus the other highly connective brain areas. Including the corpus callosum, the parietal temporal junction, the thalamic bridges and this high level horizontal pattern might be coordinated with help from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which may also have an oscillator that is magnifying learned firing sequences. I am preferential to the idea, written about in "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins" that the cortical column is actually functionally mimicking the grid cell and place cell everywhere in the brain. That's interesting especially if this idea of consciousness being a rendering or an image that has to exist somewhere now has to include some idea of how the results of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop connects to the thalamus in way that might bridge information with the neocortex otherwise

  2622     847     5: In the human brain the 'cognitive' Tensors are phase variations between synapses. Entification or unification of these vectors/tensors (in otherwords a neural network object segmentation + neural network classification = a 3D semantic segmentation process in the human brain) happens via Oscillation of Phase Variations created by signals between cells in the brain creates the 3D canvas of reality.

  2624     849    17: But at a higher level, the oscillations of many neuronal outputs, like the outputs of many parallel instructions in a GPU, can be united, or entified, into graphical objects, that can have bodies of causation & a reality that exists in a simulated 3D environment.

  2628     904    42: This is also key to the idea of why I think Quantum Teleportation works, in that I think a larger oscillation is carrying a signal between two smaller oscillations that are not directly connected.
  2629:    905:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
  2630:    906:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
  2631     907    71: This new idea I have is about action potential path tracing (actually a better name for this is excitatory neuropathways from incoming senses), each phase interval represents a vector that is being modified like a taylor series polynomial function developing a non-linear pattern in a dynamic linear sequence. So that the waves of inhibition that follow the action potential sequence cause a next level of adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  2632:    908:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas).

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incoming data.

You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
  2724:   2517:   1577:    67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

  2727    2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  2729    2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  2731    2645     362:   13: its frequency is an attractor to other particles, so they start clumbing together over time, eventual stars planets and even what we call life which is actually just a continuation of the fractal of the cosmos on increasingly complex scales because they follow the laws of entropy by exporting increating chaos over all to a surrounding environment and getting enough energy to maintain its oscillation equilibrium

  2737    2660     509:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

  2739    2662     513:   10: I think it explains how needing to urinate can wake up the brain, because chemical messages can change the frequencies of brainwaves, more chemical activity from inflammed bladder, can, in a way similar to pain signals, interact with the existing brainwave state the way two oscillating frequency bands in close proximity interact with one another

I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

  2759:   2762:     16:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  2760:   2763:     17:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  2761:   2764:     18:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology.

  2767:   2770:     24:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  2768:   2771:     27:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2769:   2772:     28:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  2790:   2793:     92:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  2797:   2800:    113:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2804:   2807:    136:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

  2827:   2830:    355:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2834:   2837:    442:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
  2835:   2838:    451:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2863:   2866:    500:     62:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  2864:   2867:    501:     65:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  2865:   2868:    504:     73:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2866:   2869:    505:     76:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  2867:   2870:    507:     86:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
  2868:   2871:    508:     90:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

  2887:   2890:    539:    211:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  2894:   2897:    550:    257:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2901:   2904:    563:    309:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2976:   2979:    829:   1282:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  2996:   2999:    854:   1321:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  3016:   3019:    895:   1392:   133:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

  3084:   3087:   1078:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
  3085:   3088:   1079:    14:    47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."

  3087:   3090:   1081:    16:    66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
  3088:   3091:   1082:    17:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  3089:   3092:   1083:    18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  3090:   3093:   1084:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  3091:   3094:   1087:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3092:   3095:   1088:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  3093:   3096:   1089:    26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
  3094:   3097:   1090:    27:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

  3112:   3115:   1113:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
  3113:   3116:   1114:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  3114:   3117:   1115:    66:    58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding

  3120:   3123:   1124:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
  3121:   3124:   1125:    84:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography).

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  3127:   3130:   1135:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  3134:   3137:   1156:   135:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.

  3220:   3366:    11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  3221:   3367:    12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  3222:   3368:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3228:   3374:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  3229:   3375:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3230:   3376:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  3251:   3397:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  3258:   3404:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  3265:   3411:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  3427:    906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3431     910:    766    1068:    237:   17: Already we can see that the brainwave hz adds meaning to the system. The electron pulse in the neuron has not only a frequency, but also a hz. This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain. Making that memory active for the whole neural network. In a digital brain you could not have a single cell representing an entire memory.

  3467:   1060:    500     17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  3476    1081     579:   10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

  3486    1226    2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  3487:   1227:   2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  3583:    14:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
  3584:    15:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  3585:    16:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  3586:    17:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3590:    21:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  3591:    22:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  3592:    23:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  3593:    24:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  3594:    25:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  3595:    26:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3596:    27:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.

And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  3795:   226:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing.

  3817:   248:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  3818:   249: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  3819:   250:   1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  3820:   251:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.

  3823:   254:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  3824:   255:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?

Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.

  3940:    34: I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T.. Read note a0270z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md Note this note, like all the notes, is still under construction, further changes lay ahead.

  3943     62  Regarding the terms evolution vs development.
  3944:    63: The consequence of C.O.T. Cellular Oscillating Tomography, is there is no more concept of development apart from evolution, there is only evolution. There is no more artificial that is separate from natural. There is no more man that is separate from nature. There is only nature.
