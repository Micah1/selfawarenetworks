In b0195y I talk for 2 hours, it's long, but worth it, because in a nutshell I describe the main thesis of my book almost completely.

I start out describing my eeg experience where I saw the beginning of time, but I dive deep into cognitive model making including predictive coding.

I talk a lot about my psychedelic medication experiences through out, starting at the 37 minute mark,

I talk about neural coding from fingers to dendrites, pointnet++, 3D neural network in Unity, rhythmic playback in a strange feedback loop, patterns in a temporal feedback loop, ink & canvas metaphor, different patterns from the inhibitory interneuron system, stages of perception, from a looping pattern to sculpting the looping pattern, always ready tonic patterns, phasic is a difference, and I make an argument that we are virtual beings, as if played across a piano, with our location being in different parts of the brain at different times
