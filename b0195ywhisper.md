In b0195y I talk for 2 hours, it's long, but worth it, because in a nutshell I describe the main thesis of my book almost completely.

I start out describing my eeg experience where I saw the beginning of time, but I dive deep into cognitive model making including predictive coding.

I talk a lot about my psychedelic medication experiences through out, starting at the 37 minute mark,

I talk about neural coding from fingers to dendrites, pointnet++, 3D neural network in Unity, rhythmic playback in a strange feedback loop, patterns in a temporal feedback loop, ink & canvas metaphor, different patterns from the inhibitory interneuron system, stages of perception, from a looping pattern to sculpting the looping pattern, always ready tonic patterns, phasic is a difference, and I make an argument that we are virtual beings, as if played across a piano, with our location being in different parts of the brain at different times

There was this time that I took this completely legal psychedelic drug called

salvia divinorum and I lost the ability to temporarily for about 15 minutes I

lost the ability to to distinct to just to make distinctions between different

objects which means it's like that's like the whole room becomes one sort of

object like nothing there's no distinction between like a couch in the

floor or between the sky and the ground it's this completely like space is this

undifferentiated sort of smoothness it's at the only time I've experienced this

sort of representation of reality there was there was another time with I was

doing what I called this this neomind cycle where my brainwaves were driving

the light and sound patterns that I was seeing hearing with LED glasses and

there was isochronic beats and audio and there was and so that my brainwaves

would drive changes to light and sound effects and you would definitely notice

that if the EEG stopped you notice it right away it's like falling out of

it had this it creates some pressure like you're just dropping out of an

airplane it's a dropping out of the sky from an airplane it's just like this

when you when you can feel a representation of your own brainwave

activity driving changes the light and sound effects you're seeing here and

you're in a sense creating a representation of your own brain

activity and you can get a sense of how your thoughts and feelings are changing

the light and sound effects after a while and so that was this incredible

experience and that I was doing in 2011 and then I moved to San Francisco to open

up a salon so I could do the neomind cycle salon where that was my business

where it's like EEG driving brainwave and treatment experiences and but I got

to a point where I I combined besides doing that I said okay well I'm also

gonna take some psychedelic medication and and I did and I experienced I first

tried to visualize the universe as a series of frames and you know like if

you see one if you see like right now in one moment you're it's like you're

seeing one frame at a time but if you saw two frames simultaneously then then

you would see like two of every person you felt through if you saw if you

doubled that you you'd see four of every person four of everything and it's

it's this it's this at some point if you keep doubling that perspective so

then you're seeing you know eight of everything and 16 of everything and 32

of everything 64 of everything 128 of everything 512 of everything and so on

and you keep doubling and when you double numbers they get pretty big pretty

quick and so pretty soon it was like a hundred and twenty thousand of everything

right but the and then you know then you're into you know 250 6,000 everything and 512

of everything and so on then you're into huge numbers pretty quickly but what

what changes is instead of the visual being like this sort of like really

choppy hard to distinguish anything it turned into like a smooth and creamy blur

where there is there's no real distinction between one thing and the next

you are just you're no longer making you're no longer distinguishing one

moment of reality you're sort of seeing that at some level at the highest level

the everything gets blurred together with these smooth creamy colors and then

everything becomes black and silent like the sounds all sounds cancel each other

out all frequencies eventually cancel each other out

yeah I guess it I guess I don't know I guess it doesn't have to be black I guess

it could be it could be just completely white like adding all colors together but

it went black for me in my in my experience like everything and some

point it was smooth and creamy and light and then completely dark like space and

it was this ever-present and they're they're in that darkness then then the

light came on and it was this it was the beginning of time as the beginning of

time as something that's outside time give this time as a spectrum from point

A to point B at the beginning the end of time but then but then if you could

conceptualize every frame of time from the beginning to the end and add them all

up together and create a symbol to sort of represent all of those frames I say

like okay well the physics of every single frame of time is bound and

connected not not in a way that we see in a daily basis but it but in a real

sense that space time is that they that everything in space time is anchored by

everything else everything in the future is angered by everything in the past

vice versa and that the gravitational effects of of planets and galaxies and

the curvature of space is all sort of because the past and the future pull on

each other because she because the future events it's just just an

idea that everything and because you know in it in quantum physics everything

is that there was a sad there's a sad YouTube lecture about how the weirdness

of quantum physics that everything is is related everything is relative to

everything else everything is defined by everything else and everything define

everything else defines everything I have to hold that quote but but yeah getting

back to the thing it's like if you run to if you run to be a human if you were

gonna say okay well how does a human being you know take some moments in time

and space space time and convert them into a conscious experience but some

point you know we can we can look at the human the study of human

neuroanatomy and your photons don't they don't go into your brain from your eye

they bounce off the eye they bounce they cause proteins to flip and that

creates cellular activity the transmission of neural signals and that

they have they have they have effects that that go deeply reaching into your

brain from your eyes along the optic nerve to the thalamus to the opposite

of lobes and and so on in the back of your head and we have to sort of like

say okay well you know your eye has a lot of different cones and it has this

blue cone receptors just it they just sort of like they're just for light and

there's certain it's like it's like it's like there's some it's not like it's

one it's not like an eyeball is is one camera it in a sense it's like there's

a lot of different cells in there and each of the cells is being sort of

independently affected and some of the cells they're only a fire if they're

seeing if they're noticing something moving from the left to the right or

from up to down and so that's their their job is they're only going to be

looking for certain criteria for certain patterns to happen and these cells are

going to reject other kinds of patterns so the goal is the cell doesn't want to

only become activated from stimulation it wants to only become activated from

information from the detection of certain patterns and the rejection of

other patterns that don't match but do not match what it's what's being sent

sent in and this is we're talking about the cells the nerve cells in the eyeball

ganglion neurons and so on and so forth and so the so I guess what we have to do

then if what's being taken into the brain is a lot of different points of signal

points okay so it's not like we're piping in the the exact like it's not

like a camera where there's like one lens it's like it's a whole bunch of

different sensors and the sensors are like you know it's like an array of

sensors like an array of camera sensors in the eye if we were just making an

analogy or comparing the eye to an array of camera sensors and they're used to

take them little points of light of where a photon hit and then from there

you're your brain is the job of your brain is to reconstruct the picture so

that if you if you look at a bottle of medicine and and it hits your the light

from that medicine hits your your eye and those signals eventually travels to

your occipital lobes in the back of your head and your brain reconstructs that

picture and the in the visual cortex or so it's believed from a city of

neuroscience and so there's the the idea is that your brain has to take all of

these different points all of these different signals that are received from

the surface of the eye and reconstruct an image and and what's also

interesting is that it all has to reconstruct the thing is like it's not

it not it not not not every person knows that the eye is covered in in blood

vessels that are blocking your vision they're not a hundred percent blocking

your vision it's like it's through the blood vessels but they're blocking some

of your vision in fact there's a there's a blind spot that you can detect by

holding up the pencil in front of your eye with a certain with a certain

distance away and you look straight at it you can't see the tip of the pencil

because that's where your blind spot is but you don't see your blind spot because

what you're you're you don't see the blood vessels that are that are covering

your the sensors in your eye because your brain is just taking the points that

it can detect and from those points it's reconstructing a picture which is a

representation an internal representation of reality and so my

argument with this book is that that you're going to have so there's it's

like if we could if we could see the brain is a 3d sort of 3d neural network

like like point net or like deep line so point net plus plus is a neural is a

deep learning neural network for 3d classification and segmentation and this

is a something that you can you can you can create point clouds it's you know

one way that's that's commonly used to create point clouds is with the light

are and there's you can use it you can use a depth camera or two cameras that

are arranged at a certain distance apart to capture depth data and construct a

point cloud from that depth data the point cloud is just done it's just a

lot of points in space that quote that you know if you look at this point cloud

you might be able to perceive the image of a mug or a table or a car but to a

computer they're just points in space a computer doesn't doesn't by itself see a

mug or a table or a car I just see there's just there's no perception it's

just there's points in space but a computer like with a point net plus

plus a computer can perform operations on this cloud of points to try to

I to classify what which points belong to sort of like to sort of you know

there's just objects which call objects segmentation say all these points

belong to one object because they're in close proximity to each other and the

classifications like these points are that belong to this object correspond to

a mug these points that are with this object correspond to a table and these

points that correspond to this object point to a car and so the computer has

to figure out which points belong to which object and then what that object

corresponds to in terms of classifying images so that in that sense you can use

like labeled data labeled images where the computer to make comparisons to you

know basically you would take like one perspective on that cloud points and

compare it to images until you find something that is sure as enough similar

features that the neural network says well it's an 80% chance that's a mug and

70% chance that's a table in addition you know more you know the point the

point cloud can can identify well these are the wings of an airplane this is the

the tail of an airplane it can do it's called part segmentation and semantic

segmentation you know like okay well there's here's the floor here's the

walls here's the lamps and the ceiling and it's taking apart the entire room

and you know just basically it's it's able to basically do objects it's

combining object segmentation and parts segmentation and and classification

into one process and we call that semantic segmentation and that's really

the goal of point net is 3d semantic segmentation but the argument is that

that I'm making which is not which is in part that our brains are doing

basically 3d semantic segmentation to reconstruct the the images that we're

seeing I think that bottle of medicine and then what happens is while the well

that that actually that that it's big it's there's a temporal component where

you'll have a group of neurons that will represent because because you know

there's like when you think of your there was this great analogy think of your

mind is like a movie for a second just isn't this is just an analogy it's like

the movie has frames so each each moment with what we'll say just imagine each

second like a movie could be 60 frames per second each second there's 60 frames

okay and we're gonna I'm gonna argue that that in each of those frames 60 frames

per second there's gonna be a different set is just a thought experiment I don't

what the actual frame rate of the brain is probably a lot more than that but

we'll just say that in each we'll just say for the sake of this thought

experiment that there's 60 frames per second happening okay and and I did on

the and the level of the brain it's it's brain activity is happening perhaps at

the millisecond level so maybe there's there's you know I don't know a thousand

frames per second or something but it could be even faster because you know

you could have basically you know there's so many neurons that you could

have while individual neurons can be so if you have a lot of them you could do

you could be doing operations much faster by basically you know having one

so one set of neurons might go off in one millisecond but and and then in the

next millisecond that happens a whole different set of neurons could be going

off and you might have many different it could be strategic could be that you

have that sort of subdivide it so you have you could have 60 different sets

of neurons going off every every millisecond just because the each set

of neurons is located in a different place in the brain so you have so you

have 60 neurons per second per millisecond I mean 60 groups of neurons

oscillate in per millisecond just because they're in different parts of the

brain just there's so many neurons so thinking kind of could be much faster

because it's it's happening on a larger scale now I'm not sure about the actual

situation where I don't know if the brain can how fast the brain is actually

operating that's a good it's a good open question there's lots of opportunity

for for more research there could be hundreds of years more research that

would be done on the brain after after this book many hundreds of years it

depends on you know how how fast technology is going to continue

accelerating if we think of technology in a linear acceleration then we're you

know then I guess that might inspire us to think that there are really many

hundreds of years left of neuroscience research before we figure out every

everything about the brain but if we're thinking about technology accelerating

along an exponential curve then the neuroscience may actually reach a sort

of rapid conclusion where we where science just advances so quickly that

we that it everything that there is to know about the brain may be discovered

sometime soon with the aid of the computers that will help accelerate the

rate of discovery of new technologies and and new features of of brains and so

science may accelerate in quite extraordinary ways and but I think we're

at the point now where we can make arguments about what is what is fundamentally

happening and the brain that causes human experience and so it's it's so

going back to it it's like there's there are enough frames okay that if you

think about 10 seconds of your own experience and you slice that up say

okay well my eyes traveled from we're just I'm just making up the story but my

eyes traveled from the left side of my computer screen over to the right side of

my desk where I saw the medicine bottle again and then they traveled back to the

left side of my computer screen again and and so that was if you say okay

that's the movie now you could you film you could film that with a camera or depth

camera so you move your camera you could film from the left side of the computer

screen past this the edge of the computer screen over to the medicine

bottle and move the camera back and you've created a movie and in each frame

with the movie the frame is a little bit different and the idea is that you're

you're gonna have a sequence of neurons that's gonna fire to represent each one

of those frames okay and the neurons are going to be the neural networks in

Iran are going to be sort of learning a sequence so that they can know when

they're going to fire they're going to predict that there's a theory out there

called prediction prediction coding or coding now predictive coding that's what

it is and it's also sort of the same a similar idea is it's found in a similar

idea to predictive coding is found in the book on intelligence by the Hawkins

where the idea is that your your brain is making predictions of the world and

those predictions are how it models the world and and so when you adjust one of

Jeff Hawkins and he talked about in intelligence one of his examples was if

you reach out and grab something like the medicine bottle and you and you you

touch it and suddenly you hear a chicken a chicken screaming you'd be very

surprised because you're you're not expecting the bottle to sound like a

chicken you're expecting the bottle to sound the way a bottle would sound if

it makes any sound you're expecting to feel the way a bottle would feel you

had the point is you have expectations about the sensory properties of the

bottle what it feels like what it looks like how it moves what it's gonna do if

you take the cap off how the cap is gonna feel when you're unscrewing it same

thing when you reach out for a door handle this was the door handle one

was one of the ones in Jeff Hawkins book on intelligence you reach out for a

door handle you have this prediction in your mind about how it's gonna feel and

if it felt very different it'd be a surprise and the fact that it would be

surprised points to the fact that your predictions are are happy that you're

making predictions about the world and in that your representations of

everything around you are in fact sensory predictions they're their

predictions encoded in in in light patterns and sound patterns that your

brain is accepting and in reacting but they're also encoded they're also

temporally encoded in sequences and spatially encoded so when you look from

let's go back to the example if you look from the left of your monitor to over

to the medicine bottle and then back to the left of your monitor then and I

mean my from the left of the monitor towards the right of the monitor towards

medicine bottle so and then from the medicine bottle towards right of the

monitor towards the left of the monitor okay so this is the medicine bottom

history is actually on the right side of the monitor if that wasn't I guess it

wasn't made clear earlier but but the the point is that your brain is making

sensory predictions of a reality and what's missing from this picture is is

where is the observer who's watching us is there a little man inside the head

where's how does this information become conscious how does it become something

that we think about that's I think that's what I can add to the picture a

little bit and so we so we know so you know this is a great book called

rhythms of the brain by Buzaki I think it's how you pronounce his name I'm

sure but I guess this book is in print off but anyway so he the book is really

worth reading it's probably mandatory for neuroscientists and neurologists to

read definitely covers a lot he's a newer book out that it's also sort of

mandatory reading that ran from inside out and but what I'm getting at is so

we have sensory predictions but we also we should look at you know how look at

the example of point net plus plus and how these your brain is as a 3D neural

network is going to be able to do at least the same sort of operations that

point net plus plus does which is where it's your brain is gonna be able to say

okay well all the points in space connected to that medicine model to find

the object of the medicine model and I have this sort of perspective which I

don't know if everyone has but I because I've tried to be a divin on I know what

it's like to not be able to distinguish the medicine bottle from the table right

I know what it's like when I can't tell one object from the next and so I know

that yeah my brain is doing an object segmentation and then semantic

segmentation simultaneously it's doing that kind of deep learning operation

albeit with a different sort of you know doesn't operate exactly the same but

even though it operates in a different way from how point net plus plus operates

that the the guiding principles of sorry the guiding operations of a neural

network that is going to notice that you know these these these points belong

together these features belong together these lines belong together these lines

represent letters on the bottle okay at some point you know if you remember so

you can remember back when you first started to read which I didn't know for

some of you was second or third grade I actually I don't remember when when I

first learned how to read it might have it might have been in the kindergarten

right they're starting to learn letters seems like a kindergarten thing learning

letters but the point is like some point letters are indistinguishable you

can see this when you see a language that you haven't learned get another

language out there that you haven't learned and you don't know how to

interpret those letters you don't know what the letters are you don't have a

way to distinguish what what or what what the shapes are in some other language

and so you may not recognize that you're looking at a letter that you've seen a

lot or or a letter that is or symbol you know that that is very common or

simple that's very rare you may you may not know probably don't know if it's a

language you haven't learned and and what are the associations you know with

that symbol or that letter what are the kinds of words or ideas that are evoked

by that character okay what is the context what is the social reality

context of those symbols that you are encountering that that actually that

matters and so without that without that context it is a it's a it's a it's you

know if you are if you haven't learned Chinese and the medicine one of those

Chinese characters you you on it you you may not know what medicine is in that

body meaning you may not even know that it is a medicine bottle you know unless

someone tells you right it could be anything but but you you might you might

know if you if you see the of course that an English version of the same bottle

next to like if you're if you're an English speaker and you see an English

version of the bottle and looks very similar to the Chinese version of the

bottle you might infer that the Chinese version of the bottle is the same

thing as the English version especially if you look at on the back and the

numbers representing the amount of medicine in each capsule are the same

maybe they both say 500 milligram or 500 something you know on the back and but

the beginning to getting to the thing is is what's interesting about the brain is

that your your your neuron activity not only has to happen in sequences where you

have neurons that are basically there in the dent and dendrite area they're

receiving signals and and dendrite in some areas receiving signals from

different nearby neurons and that is causing the the neural like the neural

firing rate to increase or decrease see the thing that it's not really like

sort of like explained clearly clearly in in like computational neuroscience 101

is that neurons are basically it's not really clearly explained the sort of

temporal reality of neurons they're basically always firing it like tonic

rates they're always trying they're always firing tonically like sort of like

an agostin or random sort of pattern or basically with with a with an

oscillator with a group of neurons that are all sort of firing tonically at the

same rate okay but in order to have a sequence where as you look from the left

of the monitor towards the right of the monitor towards the bottle from the

bottle towards the right of the monitor towards left of the monitor you have to

have a sequence of neurons that is going to fire for each sort of like place

placement of where your eyes are in a given span of time let's say you're

you're looking from the left and to the right over and over again at whatever's

in front of you okay and you're your your eyes are moving from left to the

right and you are filling that and so that you can say okay well this is ten

seconds of my conscious experience I'm gonna divide this I'm gonna divide this

into a millisecond so so millisecond is a thousand milliseconds in one second

that's ten thousand milliseconds each one of those frames then could have

different neurons that are being affected in that in that moment in each

one of those frames so ten thousand milliseconds is each one is a different

group of neurons that fire to react to represent that one moment so it's like

a good little point point net and the point net is going to recognize well

this is a table and this is a chair and this is a floor and this is a lamp and

this is a ceiling this is a desk this is a coffee cup and it does cement 3d

semantic segmentation well it's as if you're going to have an entire group of

neurons they're gonna be doing that in each millisecond for for ten thousand

milliseconds or ten seconds and what's happening is that the neurons that aren't

firing are listening for when they're going to fire but so that they can

predict when they're going to fire but the thing is is that they're also they're

not just in it we're arguing that the prediction of when they're going to fire

is part of how you're creating over the representation so it's predicting a

neuron is going to predict it's like it's like before you reach out for the

medicine bottle you have this prediction of what it's gonna feel like when you

before you grab it in your hand okay and so that is like those are dendrites

being activated in your brain just imagine this is the dendrites are the

first part of a neuron and it's receiving signals and it's predicting that

it's gonna that your hand is gonna close around the bottle and it's predicting

when the bottle is gonna feel like if the bottle doesn't feel like a bottle if

it feels like a chicken's head or a bug's head where you reach out and grab the

bottle and suddenly you're holding a roach it's gonna be very surprising and

that surprise is generated because you have this prediction in your brain which

is certain neurons are expecting to fire but different neurons fire instead

and that creates a surprise because your things didn't go as expected so you had

these predictions that weren't correct and and so when you get novel

experiences and then you're you know you're gonna notice that a little bit

more because creating like a novel activity pattern is creating something

for your brain to pay attention to which escapes the normal sort of expectation

but I what I'm saying is like okay so you so you have you know your brain

activity happening in multiple stages or multiple steps or multiple frames you

have neurons that are firing listening from when they're going to fire so they

can fire correctly in a nice sequence so you so that when your way when you're

moving your your eyes from left to the right you're not experiencing things in

the wrong order because your neurons are firing in the right order right if you

experience the right side of the screen on the left side of the screen and the

left side of the screen on the right side of the screen then then your neurons

will be firing in the wrong order that's this kind of that's the kind of weird

you know thing that can happen when people are hallucinating they see

things that are not not there they're just not rendered correctly you're not

seeing them correctly you're seeing you know patterns on top of things you're

seeing the shape of reality change certain hallucinations will take you to

other worlds and you know or or or make you see aliens talk to aliens because

your brain activity is being confused by the medication which which which which

I believe is very possibly very healthy sort of medication in certain

contexts there's definitely um it's not it's not negative to confuse your your

brain with psychedelic medication it definitely that could be it's very

creative thought and to you know like Steve Jobs was it was a bit was a fan of

LSD sort of one of the best things that he ever did was to take LSD and I think

that you know that's one of the reasons Silicon Valley has sort of like Silicon

Valley has become like a leader a leading representative as the sort of

like the beginning of the computer industry is associated with Silicon

Valley you know an Apple computer and and and of course you know later on

Google and other companies other tech companies Microsoft Microsoft I guess

is more Redmond but but a lot of tech companies a lot of computer companies

sort of got their start in Silicon Valley then another thing about Silicon

Valley was that there was a lot of it's a place where you can get LSD there's a

lot of psychedelic medication there's a lot of basically you know it's your

your your brain is is supercharged overcharged

creatively inspired and you may have amazing visions that go on to

revolutionize the world it's the psychedelic medication can be the door

it's called the doorways of perception by the doorway of perception all this

Huxley phrase that I think he coined that phrase a door of perception all this

Huxley and but what I'm saying is is that if you go if you go a step further

and you know we can look at you know your brain is listening to your brain

your most of your neurons don't have contact to your sensory organs so you've

got these got neurons that are in your eye and those are collecting sensory

data but after that you know after your sort of primary excitatory neurons then

you have your you know you let your brain you have the neurons that don't

have direct connections to to sensory inputs or direct connections of sensory

outputs like motor I'm sorry motor outputs and and those are the interneurons

and interneurons an interneuron inhibitory system is a system that I

think about it's like you know there's all these different ways that signals

can travel right and you've got you've got features you've got you know

basically patterns coming into the brain and let's say that you have this

representation of a cat and a cat's tail but you don't see how the cat and the

cat's are connected because the cat is hidden behind a pole well if you've seen

cats before then you know that the tail is part of the cat you've never seen the

cat and the cat's tail you've never seen a cat's tail on a cat before it's

possible you could be confused into into what the tail is or that or the fact

that the tail is connected to the cat if you don't see that it's connected to the

cat if all you see is a tail on one on one side of the pole and the cat on the

other side of the pole that tail could belong to a different animal I make that

argument because you know computers you know can make that mistake

computers that are tasked with computer vision and then and there's this thing

called that with that it happens a lot with two-dimensional convolutional

neural networks called where you're the it's called overfitting you know where

you have you use a process like gradient descent or dropout to to randomly

delete some of the data and you know I make this joke it's like you know when

you're killing your brain cells with alcohol you're randomly deleting some

of your brain data but that could have a beneficial effect in that it

forces your brain to say okay well shit we're missing the data that connects the

cat's tail to the cat but because we're missing data a lot that we have to learn

to make more creative connections between things that seem to be separate

because we can't because there's a there's a pole between the cat and the cat's tail

from your perspective because you because the cat is behind the pole but

because your your brain or because the computer is a dropout you know a gradient

descent is is able to make that creative connection to say okay well even

though there's a there's a clear gap between the cast on the cat there's

enough feature similarities similar fur colors similar you know they're both

moving nothing else is moving that it can make a sort of creative leap and say

okay well maybe even though they're not physically connected these two things

are are actually connected and maybe it can be into say okay well there's

something in front of the cat that's this is blocking the connection between

the tail and the cat and that I think is the sort of value of psychedelic

medication which can do weird things to your brain but those weird things may

cause you to have leaps in creativity creative genius which which can lead to

the creation of a flake Apple computer as the result of psychedelic medication

use and you know certain get said so maybe maybe I would say well the the

results of alcohol use haven't been as impressive as psychedelic use that we

you know psychedelics people invented computer companies with alcohol they

invented dictatorships right so so maybe the alcohol is a little bit too

aggressive for the human brain it's hard to say dictatorships I mean like you

know church cathedrals I'm just imagining that you know it's like a

giant cathedral and rises high up into the sky with the spires but all around

the landscape there's there's just little houses so the church just like

physically dominates space and anyone who visits that church just knows that

the ultimate power and dictatorship is there in that building and everyone and

anyone and everyone else is just a peon compared to you know sort of the

headquarters of the church this is what kind of like you know architectures that

it's creative but it might be more sort of it's not as genius as a computer

company you know a computer company that's genius that that is sort of like

a much maybe a much better way to tease your brain into into the kind of work

that will revolutionize the world and I I've really enjoyed for me personally

I've enjoyed psychedelics since I was about six age 16 when I I was in high

school and I I tried someone someone gave me LSD and I took it in class not

really knowing that much about it and I remember telling the girl in front of

me in class said I'm on LSD right now she said no way I don't believe you and I

just thought that was funny and I believe that was at Magnolia High

School it's okay LSD at Magnolia High School when I was a student there but

but moving on I think that the point is that you we still have this sort of like

question okay so I forgot this idea if the brain is a 3D neural network then it

should be able to do at least the kinds of operations that point net plus plus

does point net is by the way still even though it is a it does 3d semantic

segmentation 3d 3d object segmentation 3d classification on point sets it does

those things but it is not a 3d neural network in terms of its substrate in

terms of how it's constructed it's still a 2d computational process but in the

human brain human brain is an actual 3d neural network which means that that you

know a cortical column both a neuron and a cortical column which is several which

is many neurons they it's the receiving information from from every

direction from from above and from below from the left and to the right from

forward and from back it's sending and receiving information it's it's a

bi-directional 6-doff neural network right and it does in it in the inter

neurons right the neural columns in the center of your brain they never have

any contact with you with the real world they're in the middle of your brain

so all they get is the information you got to see from the from the cortical

columns point of view all they get is information from other neurons so they

have to listen to other neurons to predict when they're going to fire in a

sequence so that what when you move your eyes from left and to the right the

stuff that's on your left stays on your left it's on your right this goes to

your right there's this one time I'll tell you I had this story where I

experienced reality out of the correct time sequence where I I was I was taking

LSD at at home and I was still in high school the time I think I was still 16

and I I walked down the stairs and outside because my parents called me for

some reason and then I walked back inside up the stairs and into a lounge

area and then when I was in the lounge area I experienced myself walking up the

stairs it was in fact like my brain was playing back the climb up the stairs in

the wrong order so I saw I experienced myself having climbed up the stairs

after I was already upstairs it's like your brain it's like that's when your

neurons are firing out of order okay that's something that that that can

happen on psychedelic medication and so that's the thing is is you your brain

has to the neurons have to fire in the right order that means they're listening

from when they're supposed to fire they're learning temporal sequences

there is a so that they can find my daughters that you experience time in

the right order otherwise you'd have a lot of trouble navigating reality if you

weren't experiencing time in the correct order that would be very dangerous for

you there's all sorts of things that go wrong with you in perception but not to

get too far down that road I experienced in time in the wrong orders is one thing

but it was interesting isn't there this has been depicted in fiction science

fiction definitely remember episodes of Star Trek where Captain Picard was

experiencing time in the wrong order where he'd he'd experienced the past in

the future right after one another especially some of the the later episodes

the final episodes of the original Star Trek next generation series he was he

went to the future his his aversion of the future and then he went to the past

and he was traveling back and forth between the past and the future to try

to fix some catastrophe and and his future self has some sort of terrible

disease that was pretty serious and not something he can get out of but but

maybe he could go back in time and and fix something and I forget what that was

that he was going to fix because I haven't seen that a long time ago but

it's interesting that that's sort of like experiencing reality out of order is

has also made it into stories and friction and I've had experiences like

that and that is and so so I'm just sort of like making this point to say well

your brain actually has to learn sequences this is the reality so that

your neurons can find the right order to represent each stage of reality in the

order that you're experiencing it and not in the wrong order and predictive

coding sort of gives us part of the template of how this of how of how this

sequence can happen because if a neuron doesn't actually fire at like see let's

say that to create the representation in the neuron hand to fire but before it

creates the representation it creates a prediction by having a smaller firing

event it's called a forward dendritic action potential there's also even

smaller possible events like there's a synapse action potential event sort of

like a sin a synapse firing so synapses individuals synapses or receptors on the

on the dendrite so the dendrite is like if you look if you look at your hand

and imagine that your fingers are the branch or the branches of a dendrite

and where you touch your fingers each of those points where you touch your fingers

like each points of each each points of contact in your skin just imagine that

that is represented by is representative of the the synapse right so

if you touch your finger anywhere in different places touch different fingers

in different places I can imagine that when those touches those are those are

like synapse those are like your synapses receiving little chemical little

packet for chemicals and and where you've been touched in your fingers when

you're touching your fingers with other fingers that you're creating the sort of

analogy of synaptics synapses and now imagine that you clap clap all your

fingers together okay and that is like we clap all your fingers together imagine

that is that's closer to you're creating a much bigger signal on your hand and

that that could be you know closer to like the dendritic forward dendritic

forward action potential or a forward spike it's not really I think AP is

actually the wrong word is think of the is the sort of electrical spike from the

dendrite and the electrical spikes in the dendrite they go to the soma right

and you need to have a certain number of these arriving within a certain

frequency to to represent a pattern that has been that you know that the that it

means that neuron has detected a certain pattern right so if you get enough of

these dendrites then a certain pattern has been detected and in the cell has a

sort of duty to sort of like only fire when it receives a certain kind of

pattern within a certain millisecond range you know and you know like that

like it's like that cell in your eye that like only fires when something is

moving from left to right in your vision well that is a pattern that cell is set

to look for and it's like okay well each of your each of your dendrite to set to

look for certain patterns based upon previous patterns so the previous

patterns that it receives help help to set up what it's going to be looking for

okay so if it sees what it's been looking for then it fires also has to you

know not fire when it receives signals that it hasn't been looking for so so

there's this process where the anyway long story short is that it is at some

point you know you clap your fingers together and that's a lot of signal

happening versus you know just touching one of your fingers one at a time that's

a bigger sort of forward spike and then now the palm as imagine the palm of your

hand is like the soma and the soma is so your fingers are like the dendritic

branches and but they all ended in the in the palm of your hand the ends of

your fingers come to the palm of your hand that's this that's like the soma

but you're on and if you get enough signals from each of your fingers right

that the then what can happen then is the soma can fire and the soma can fire

it's like imagine you take your two hands and you clap them together so you're

making even bigger signals clap your two hands together loud bam that's like a

soma firing that's a big event okay and that event is when the big that's the

real action potential and in see the thing is the thing is I think was not

clearly explained sort of as a temporal reality of action potentials in it's

explained in neuroscience but it's not necessarily explained in computational

neuroscience one-on-one because we because it because the computational

neuroscience is about one sort of step of the neuron function but they're not

there's they're thinking about a single moment of a neuron function not about

how the neuron is changing over time so so when neurons fire tonically they're

all firing at the same time big in big clusters but it doesn't really seem like

like that may contain that much information if you just have a large

amount of neurons are all firing at the same time tonic firing doesn't seem like

it it it may contain information it might but it that'd be like using a whole

bunch of neurons so you were a little whole whole little it's like if they're

all firing they're all basically have the same information and you're using a

whole bunch of neurons to do something very simple some art so so how is it

that if you have an individual neuron it's designed to look for one pattern

right but all of that like basically it could fire it might fire and it might

change the firing rate of that neuron the firing rate could increase or decrease

but even if that happens the rest of the oscillation of that neuron pulls that

neuron back into awesome but back into tonic oscillation with the rest of

the neurons so even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired

sooner or later than it normally fires that's just this temporary pattern but

that's actually what we want because like imagine that when you're moving from

the left to the right not only is it the case that neurons need to fire you know

when you're looking as you move your eyes from left to right you're gonna need

to fire in the right order like a piano right but like like you know like you

play piano notes but you also don't want to be firing you don't want to continue

to be firing constantly it's like that'd be like hearing a piano note that

never stops that piano note needs to die away so the next piano note can be

heard and that next piano note needs to die away so the next note needs to be

heard so we kind of need the so if a neuron differentiates from the rest of

the group that needs to be a temporary thing in order for the transition of

perception to change they say well so no now where's the observer where's a

little man in your head observing all these patterns well it just so happens

that predictive coding gives us a sort of gives us a distributed man inside

your head it says okay well you have neurons that are listening if inter

neurons it they don't come in contact with the outside of the world but they

are listening to other neurons so you have neurons that wait for their turn

you see there's this example in EEG where you can put connect two people to

EEG separately in separate rooms and measure their their their brain their

power spectrum the brainway frequencies alpha beta theta delta gamma and

alpha beta theta delta and gamma

alpha beta theta delta and gamma so you can see what power spectrum is dominant

in the brain now you bring these two people together and you have to start

talking you know what you'll see is that their brain waves become in sync with

one another you can also see this in birds and other animals and birds

especially when birds are communicating their brain waves become in sync you

have without even measuring their brain waves you can notice that one bird will

be silent while the other bird chirps and then the other bird chirps while the

other bird remain silent so they take turns talking to each other but the

argument is that this is happening also inside your brain right where there's

this sort of where you know going back to the piano analogy to play a piano

music you need to have a tone that plays and then another tone and then another

tone but then because your neurons need to know when they're going to fire they

need to predict when they're going to fire so they can play a sequence like a

piano sequence that means your neurons are listening to other neurons firing so

it's like when two birds are listening one bird is speaking chirping the other

bird is not chirping it's like that's sort of an analogous of what's

happening inside your brain you have one set of neurons firing you have other

sets of neurons listening and then the next step neurons fire and other sets of

neurons listen one neuron fires other's are inhibited one no fires others are

inhibited one around fires others are inhibited and these sequences of firing

inhibitions happen in cascading patterns and then so then your your brain can

create temporal and spatial representations so you can notice when

you move your eyes from left to the right you have a temple you're having a

temporal and spatial recognition you're recognizing spatially what is what

objects are there all these points belong to this object like this medicine

bottle and all of these you know or that's my monitor that's the left side

of my monitor that's the right side of my monitor and and as I move my eyes

from left to right the stuff that's on the left stays on the left the stuff

that's on the right stays on the right and I can tell the medicine bottle is not

separate is separate from the table because I'm doing a semantic

segmentation but my brain is doing the temporal separation right because if it

was all because I wasn't doing a temporal separation separation

semantics of a temporal semantic segmentation in addition to a spatial

semantic segmentation then then I would see two bottles at the same time or four

bottles or eight bottles or I would see all the spacetime is blur so my brain

is really doing both a temporal and a spatial segmentation it's noticing that

there's one bottle it's not taking the past memory of of that bottle and putting

it on top of the same bottle like you might see you know if you had too much

to drink you might see two how many fingers am I holding up right if you

heard that phrase how many fingers am I holding up if you don't if like if you're

holding up two fingers and someone says four you have double vision because

they've drank they've drunk too much okay so double vision is like yeah well the

temporal sequences of your brain are are not operating correctly that person is

drunk but it is it it points to the fact that your brain is doing temporal

sequences in the first place the fact that you know that there's there's two

fingers and then someone else is seeing four because they're drunk so we have

these representations of sequences of the world around us and I'm saying that

you know we've got Jeff Hawking's book and we've got predictive coding on

intelligence we've got predictive coding then that point us to you know a method

for how the brain could be making temporal and spatial frequencies so how

the brain could be connecting the dots in in terms of recognizing temporal

spatial patterns from incoming streams of data okay so this is a this is something

that that's why part of the the point net is is definitely useful to if you

listen to like YouTube lectures on a point net plus plus yeah if you find a

good one then you'll get an idea you get a good analogy of how a computer with a

neural network can turn a representation of points that it's received into the

recognition of an object and classify that object to classify those points and

it's a semantic segmentation and if a computer neural network can do that

and it's really a human neural network can and so I've actually seen a friend

of mine a while back I won't mention his name he wouldn't want you to he wouldn't

want me to tell you who he is because because you know the government is a

conspiracy and all that right but he created a 3D neural network in in unity

and he I won't tell you how how he built it I know but it's it's not my place to

talk about his his work and expose his work but what I'll tell you is that he

is a 3D neural network in unity unit is a 3D game engine and the neural

network itself was was consisting of objects inside this 3D game engine and

what he did was he connected depth cameras like the Microsoft deserved

depth cameras to this neural network and it took the representations from those

depth cameras and created sort of like the neural network matched the

representations of those cameras so we saw we saw what I saw was a three

dimensional representation of the data from the depth cameras that the 3D

neural network was making and it was so easy to just take camera data and turn

it into us and apply it send the data into a 3D neural network and have it

output a representation of the camera data and I thought well if if we if he

can do this in unity you know what I mean like with it with it is points to

say yeah if you if our brain if we think about brains is a 3D neural network and

all our brains have to do is is sort of like accurately reconstruct pattern that

that matches what we are seeing then then then the parts of the brain that are

listening to that pattern can make the connections between the points that are

being represented and so the learning of an object a 3D representation of an

object can be extracted from from 3D points from from from from the points

received from your senses so your brain can learn 3D points and we still haven't

got to the part of like how this becomes conscious information or what the

observer effect is and so so my house so going back to rhythms of the brain by

basaki what we have and you know of course

predictive coding and work at Memento intelligence and so on we have is is

neurons that are listening to other neurons in temporal sequences to figure

out when they're going to fire so they're making predictions we have this

knowledge that basically when you when you have this prediction of how the

ball is going to feel that representation it may be consisting of

sort of like dendritic forward potentials forward spiking potentials but not

the action potential so it's like the neuron is collecting all this data for a

long time which is predicting when it's going to fire okay and the physical

collection of that data up until the point that it fires refers is the sort

of manifest representation of you of what a door handle is going to feel like

before you touch the door handle and at the moment that you touch the door

handle and it feels exactly like what you thought it was going to feel like

that's the moment when your neurons fire to represent the feeling of door

handle in time and space but up until you touch the door handle that

representation exists as activity in the dendrites and activity and below

threshold activity in someone so so the neurons so it's like yeah you have

neurons that are going to represent that door handle both before and during you

touching the door handle and so that's how you have these like pretty soon but

what that means is that is that you know going back to the birds is you know when

one bird trips and other bird listens and then the other bird trips the first

bird listens and so you have these sort of alternations in the oscillation so

the oscillations brainwave oscillations are alternations in neural firing and

when one group of neurons are firing another group of neurons is listening

and this is the analogy of you know when one person is speaking another person's

listening and when two people are speaking back and forth their brains

start to the power band spectrum of their brains is measured by the EEG

starts to synchronize because they're both on the same wavelength or in that

conversation and the and so the oscillation see that this is this is the

key I think it's that for a neuron a neuron is not just a receiver or a

sensor for information it's also a transmitter of information every single

neuron is receiving information and it's transmitting information so the

receiver and a transmitter and you have these you have neurons firing in

different one neurons when one neuron is firing other neurons are inhibited

because they're in there listening so most so it's it's um it's that most of

the time your neurons are listening and they're not firing but they fire

tonically they fire at regular rates and then when they fire because of because

they've heard a pattern that they recognize okay because they recognize

well hey it's my time to fire I'm going to represent what this person is

experiencing right now okay that's like the louder sound that a neuron can make

when the action potential fires from the soma and soma bursts okay that's that

that's that in the moment representation of something that's happening right now

boom boom this is the event boom boom I don't know if that's the reason maybe

that's not the right sound but but that is a that is a different it's not a

tonic frequency that's a phasic frequency it's a phasic pattern it's a phasic

frequency pattern and so you can say it we can go into well the brain is consists

of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns and temporal

and they also can can this it's also tonic and it's also this sort of like

dialectic between tonic and phasic firing patterns right so phase so phasic

firing pattern can happen which is you know it's a different frequency it's

much faster can travel much farther it's not regular it's novel it happens more

rare and as soon as it happens the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with

they they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency so that you

know when you play a piano the tone doesn't stay loud it dissipates so the

next sound to be heard and so some it's it's a it's designed to like hitting the

piano key boom but it's got to fade out so the oscillation pulls it down but the

oscillation itself by pulling it down means that every other neuron in the

oscillation is noticing it because because of the dynamics of power dynamics

of the oscillation it's it's they have to the whole group of neurons has to

reach sort of equilibrium so you have a neuron that fires out of order you can

see they're faster or slower the rest of the group can feel it the rest of the

group can sense that one neuron so the whole so that firing pattern that

happens is noticed not by not just by one neuron simultaneously but by the

entire oscillation simultaneously it's like the oscillation is the it's like

when I'm arguing it's like the oscillation is like the canvas and the

the the phase pattern is the ink on the canvas so the canvas of reception or the

or the the canvas of consciousness or the can the canvas of mental work space

and the ink on that workspace is the deviations from the canvas the

distinctions from the canvas right so so it's like the ground of the ground of

being which is just raw perception raw awareness that's the oscillation in the

objects in the mind that you recognize those are deviations from the ground of

being from pure awareness so it's like that the you know but there there's the

I'm using some mystical language but it's it's kind of like there is this

canvas of consciousness and then there's objects that are painted on that kind of

the canvas and the objects that are painted are what are what's being

collected by the neurons that are listening in predictive coding but the

deep but and so those are creating temporary etches and the oscillations

are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away

so that new tones can be played so the brain isn't continually moving to be in

a ready state to receive more notes to play more notes to represent more

things okay but then so it's like the brain is the brain is playing music to

itself right so the notes go off in one area like one bird tripping while the

other bird listens but like one set of neurons fires another set listens so the

brain is receiving and transmitting data but it's like one group of it's like one

it's like the it's like one group is creating a pattern another group is

observing a pattern and so you have this sort of well that is that's what I'm

saying is that's basically qualia it's basically an internal representation and

an observer the observer is one group of neurons observing another group of

neurons firing and that is the basis of it's the basic idea of of consciousness

is that you have one group of neurons that's listening to another group of

neurons fire and what's what's firing it has includes patterns that are temporal

spatial and phasic and phasic in terms of like you know these are these are

frequencies that go beyond phasic that go beyond phasic as opposed to tonic so

phasic is like satonic which is like slow and regular signals also slow and

regular tonic oscillation that is very regular and it's a whole bunch of

neurons doing it so there's not really information but then you have phasic

firing which is unique and that's like when the piano you hear a piano note

that's phasic firing and that phasic firing is much it's much higher

frequency that could be like a 200 Hertz gamma frequency or something but I'm

also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic

frequency range to the phasic firings and higher frequency ranges consists of

consists of temporal spatial frequencies between 0.02 Hertz and as high as

600 Hertz and in so that so my argument is also that the brain is brain is a

finite state machine and that the total the finite state machine is the total

summary of all the patterns between 0.002 Hertz and 600 Hertz that could

possibly happen in the brain in all in all spatial regions of the brain and

basically from synapses to dendrites to action potentials to oscillations no

matter what size the Hertz signal is coming from whether it's coming from

something really small like a synapse or something really large like a dipole then

what happens is you've got different scales of phasic or tonic oscillations

that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with

I'm sorry you've got different scales of phasic or tonic frequencies in

oscillation that are playing out between different scales of tonic

frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out at

different different scales from from synapses to dendrites to soma to you

know the activity of a small neural circuit to the activity of like a large

cortical column to the activity of a brain region in a dipole a dipole

representing the brain you know a magnetic moment or an electromagnetic

moment or an electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for

large oscillator such as a super charismatic nucleus and so we've got

these frequencies which you know there's that they they're they're these are

frequencies of you know they had there there's we can consider them in terms of

just like frequencies that are encoded with sounds like soliton waves or encoded

in you know sort of like like a magnetic wave and it's a very sort of like a

stable information containing sound and that can travel they can travel and

ricochet through the brain and so there was actually there's one time when I I

I tried meth mesculine I tried it a lot of pair not parody but some Pedro

cactus I've been mesculine many times but there was this one time that I felt

that I could hear my voice inside my head as a series of discrete moments when

different neurons were firing as if imagine if a neuron is a is a long

cable and along this cable there's a there's a bunch of different points of

which the sounds are are being are appearing and so like like the sound

could be like just part of the voice could be just part of a word and if you

if you progress like going back to like a movie like a time like a like if you

look at you know 10 seconds of your of your mind you go back and see your mind

is like a movie and now just think of your voice is a movie it's just like an

audio track right and different parts of the auto track represent this phrase

different parts of the auto track that represent this phrase different parts of

the audio track represent this phrase each part of the audio kits is going to

be a different set of neurons that fires just like you know looking from the

left to the right each moment in that frame or in the audio track is going to

be represented by a different set of neurons and as the neuron fires through

as then as the as the brain fires through through like you know we go to

through each stage when I when I was speaking you can hear a different vowel

or different sound here different sound in each moment and all the sounds to

add up to words and sentences and but the idea is that in each moment there's

there's a different in that pipeline that's that is that that is a neuron

there's a different or that's many neurons in the pipeline of neural

activity as we follow a neural circuit among across many different neurons

each each one of those neurons is firing in that sequence of neural activity

it's going to represent that one part of that one person's voice okay and so that

is it's like you're your brain saying okay well I'm going to represent your

thought I'm going to play your thought back to you as a sequence of bits the

sequence of frequencies you listen to your if you listen to your voice or

someone else's voice like if you just like pause on one sound on one sound just

pronounce the word just pronounce the letter D really silly D D that is a

frequency it's a frequency and it has a spatial characteristic too where's the

sound coming from how loud is it how big is the sound how quiet is the sound how

masculine or feminine is the sound or you know what we're non-genders sound I

don't know but it has spatial it has sound doesn't just have a frequency it

has associated characteristics has spatial characteristics where's the voice

coming from is it coming from this room it's coming from the next room is it

coming from yourself it's coming from somewhere else there's spatial

characteristics the sound has so I would argue yeah everything has spatial

characteristics and temporal characteristics and physics like your

feelings feelings they have a peak moment you know there's like you feel

there's a moment when something great happens and you feel great for a moment

there's that moment when it's the high and then it comes down and you and then

there's a low and then there's like you know people sometimes they'll drink the

hub drink and they'll feel high when they're drunk or when they have some

other drug they feel high for a while and then and then maybe the brain comes

down and they feel low for a while and like the next day someone sometimes

people feel very like sometimes people have hangovers after drinking the night

after drinking alcohol and they feel really low in the morning so they felt

high the night before and they feel very low in the morning and they're grumpy

in the morning because they're having a hangover and the brain the brain went

high but then their brain went low the low feelings might inspire them to drink

again because they want to feel good again even though the feeling bad was

caused by by them you know taking the thing that made them feel good so they

keep drinking like oh it felt good when I was drinking and that feels bad so I

want to drink again to feel good but even though that it's but it's the

drinking that's causing them to feel bad and if they just gave it up then their

brain is like it is more you're just like imbalancing stretching the brain

you know for for all the highs that people get with alcohol there the lows

come later on as a result of as the price of that high sort of the the the

forces of of the physical and functional forces of tensegrity where we

have information as the physical and functional forces of tensegrity and

information where you can have basically a moment where I'm gonna say about you

know like there's this dialectic or conflict between two different ideas

where if you have like if you push again if one culture pushes against another

it builds its own sort of dialectic opponent you know if you have an

element of government saying okay well we we don't like that there's feminine

men in movies this is something that China was saying there they are in fact

when they come out with a statement like that okay we're gonna get we're gonna

like since for all effeminate men in movies so we don't see movies with the

feminine men anymore that is creating a sort of pushback sort of dialectic

opponent sort of functional tensegrity where the the information which is like

simultaneously basic but also electromagnetic is being generated to

sort of push back against that force being pushed on the rest of humanity

and that's that is the reason why authoritarian regiments eventually

topple it's because they're creating their own opponents and their opponents

keep growing because they're because their behavior is is you know creating

too many negative waves and those waves come back that's the sort of like

principle of opposing forces in a confined space eventually the eventually

the the three chains will who are pushing to change other people's change

human culture to be what they see it all to be well we'll experience the push

back that they don't expect it will come in unexpected ways and so that could

that could involve some sort of revolution I don't know I don't know

what how that would manifest it could be it could be not a revolution but but

just another kind of unexpected change in the future that I don't know who the

people in charge of the country might be different people but it might be a sort

of non non non non-revolutionary revolution sort of a transition I guess

to a different group of people in charge who are a little bit more enlightened

and and progressive thinking but you know but then there's there's this that's

not good too far into that so yeah so this is some things like you know going

back to you know we've got your brain is capable of creating really complex

representations of sounds and images and we know that your brain is is listening

to your brain to you know neurons are listening to the neurons so that's the

observer right there that's them as the distributed man inside your brain you've

got part of your brain that's listening to part of your brain and and when you

put it all together that's pretty simple that you know consciousness or a

conscious perception at least involves this component of your brain listening

to your brain's representations of reality and that's how that's how you your

brain is part of how your brain is building quality there's a lot of other

things you know especially with the studies of you know anesthesia in terms

of what gets turned off and in pyramidal cells and what's the difference in a

waking brain and a sleeping brain there's in studies of anesthesia it's lots of

great stuff but there's also the you know the question of well what's the

difference between conscious information and the information that's not

conscious like your brain is collecting stuff it's listening for firing patterns

but it's not like you're conscious of everything simultaneously and that is

important because you know your brain has to in order for one thing to be paid

it to be in focus in one moment of time your brain has to inhibit something

else it's like you've got to turn off a lot of switches in order to turn the

light on to the thing you're focusing on so there's always going to be this sort

of like you know in order to in order for there to be in order for your brain to

make differences between one type of pattern and none other you've got to

turn off the patterns that are not relevant while you're turning on the

patterns an arm element that is where the the interneuron inhibitory system

especially comes into power sort of it's sort of like a live real-time I think

of the internet interneuron inhibitory system as sort of live real-time back

propagation system and it's kind of like okay well I see a cat's head and I'm

expecting to see a cat's tail but if I don't see a cat's tail then the

expectation of a cat's tail needs to become inhibited because there's no

cast out maybe maybe the cat doesn't have a tail right or maybe it's not a cat

maybe it's actually a rabbit I've never seen a rabbit before and I just mistook

it for a cat it's a rabbit's very different tails it's like a bushy it's

like a bushy short bushy thing versus a cast tail is a long longer thing and not

as bushy and so if I so at that point you know hopefully the representation of a

long cast tail is not something and I see I might see the only way I'd see a

cast tail on a rabbit probably would be if I was you know doing some really hard

hallucinations right there's no there's no cast tail on a rabbit but if your

brain is functioning correctly you're gonna have you know maybe maybe start

out with this prediction that you're looking at a cat but then you notice

it's a bushy tail a small bushy tail instead and so instead of representing

the cat's tail what you get is is some of the features of an animal your brain

is gonna represent some of the features of an animal and those features are

going to they're gonna require some changes because because it's because the

features of it of a bunny are different from the features of a cat so we don't

want to give you brain is want to give you the memory of a cat must represent

the bunny accurately so in order to accommodate those changes what happens

is we've got what I what I think of as the train track train track system of

internet of the interneuron inhibitory system so the so the train tracks the

train tracks get thrown and and instead of seeing you know because there's no

cast tail there's a bunny's tail and that means a different feature that and

what was expected has been seen and so now the representation is an accurate

representation of a rabbit you tell us was quite different from the previous

representation of a cat okay and and so you can have the same sort of neurons

that fire the same office the same oscillatory network that fired to

represent a cat has now been changed because of interneurons because it does

though they're they're causing inhibitory changes and how the signals are

flowing in that same oscillator how the signals are flowing in that moment so

that they that that the pattern that's emerging where in the area where the cat

was is not no no no longer representing a cat pattern it's representing a bunny

pattern or rabbit pattern with a rabbit with a bunny tail bushy bunny tail

bushy a bushy pony tail and so this is a this this is this this means that

basically like the idea is that you have an oscillatory network can represent

completely different sets of patterns like you know and thanks in the

interneuron system so you can have you can you can say okay well your brain is

right now your brain is going to represent the bunny and the same neuron

that represented the bunny now they're going to represent a cat now that group

of neurons can represent a dog because different patterns get turned on and off

because because of the inhibitory neurons system so it's not like you're

just it's not like your neurons are just excited to really activating some

pre-existing you know hard learned pattern the pattern is going to change

basically every time but and it's also like you know that points to the fact

that you know when you have multiple brain regions if you if you have your

memories are like tapping in a distributed way where maybe if you'll

see like a dog and a house and if we look at Jack Glein's work you know the

semantic map that he created through with MRI of where you know he saw you know

a lot of brain activity when people are looking at pictures of houses and when

people looking at pictures of cars people in pictures of cats and dogs there

was a core there's a spatial correlation and brain activity in certain areas

where the dogs and in cats were being noticed by your brain in terms of where

the blood flow was flowing afterwards and correlations between you know where

you know houses and motorcycles were being noticed by your brain where the

houses and the motorcycles would be closer together and the dogs and cats

would be somewhere else but closer to each other and so the computer could

then guess or if the person is like looking at a motorcycle or looking at a

dog based upon where the increase in blood flow is happening in the brain as

measured by MRI and that's that was the Jack Glein's labs semantic maps and his

experiments were pretty awesome Berkeley experiments and but the thing is like

okay well now what if we were to see a dog and a house at the same time right so

the idea is that not only you know so we have these these patterns that you know

the phase of patterns is like when phase of pattern is when a neuron fires out

of at a much higher frequency than the usual tonic frequency you get a bunch

of neurons in different areas all firing at a tonic frequency and they all

have and there's this there's there's some of the internal so they've got

neural columns you guys know so you got micro micro columns you've got large

columns you've got small neural circuits or just groups of neural neurons firing

and in temporal firing patterns that may be really responsible for short-term

memories and maybe long-term memories or are you know the result of sort of

like new proteins being generated that the sending receiving of long-term

memories or involve new protein synthesis that will modify the the patterns

that are the different neurons are going to expect and so you can have this

sort of like a sort of like the short-term memory is is what's happening you

know right you know what the sequence of patterns firing in a neural circuit but

in that sequences sequence of patterns is modified by the internal system like

you can have constantly have new patterns emerging in any area of the cortex

you have any other court any area of the cortex can be remapped to take on the

duties of any other like it for example if someone loses a hand and the parts of

the brain that were being used to for their hand then start to become used for

by the by the other regions of the brain right and so so in that situation you

get you get basically this you know it's David Eagleman talks about that how

like you know if you if one if one if you if person loses a limb then then the

rest then that part of their brain sort of gets taken over like a competition of

of a competition of rivals or a cooperation of rivals but basically it's

like each of your you know your visual cortex is is staking out a huge amount

of your brain's resources or so it's thought with to do visual visual related

tasks visual cortex would include the occipital lobes and in some extent the

parietal lobes stretching into the into the somatosensory cortex a little bit but

within the somatosensory is more about touch but there's a lot of you know

hand-eye coordination happening so there's a lot of like reasons for the

activity in in the touch air touch areas their feelings tactile sensations to be

flowing back into the visual station into the visual areas for correlations so

so the visual cortex is is maybe two-thirds of your brain activity but

that might be intermixed with a lot of there might be a lot of

multimodal patterns traveling back and forth and and that's what it's kind of

I think that's what we see in the brain is that you know and neuron neural

column doesn't know if it's a visual it doesn't know if it's in the visual

cortex or not it doesn't know if in the somatosensory cortex or not all it knows

is the patterns it's receiving from from the adjacent sets of it's receiving

and sending to the adjacent sets of neurons to the left and to the right in

front and back and above and below and so you know if there are if someone

starts to have if someone loses some of their eyesight or they lose an eye then

then you're gonna have then you know in theory you're gonna have like parts of

the brain that we're processing I don't have an answer for that is there's

something up stop there's nothing to stop here siri turn off siri turn off

you

Anyway, so, um, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

so, um, yeah, so the idea is that, you know, parts of your somatosensory cortex will be talking

to your parts of your visual cortex, to your parietal lobes, and vice versa.

And so you're going to have, you know, sections of the brain that are like,

It's part information that is from tactile sensations

and part information that's from visual data

and it's intermixing.

And then you're gonna have,

there's the audio cortex and then,

but there's the audio pathway, the audio input pathway

from your ears to the old brain and traveling up

the old brain and towards the thalamus and the neocortex.

And that pathway is to a great extent an audio pathway,

but that is also going to, at some point,

those signals are gonna be intermixing

with where the visual cortex encounters

the audio cortex and where the audio cortex encounters

the somatosensory cortex and where the visual audio

and somatosensory cortex is the three primary sensory

cortex these can act with the prefrontal cortex.

In all the regions of the brain,

you know, there's, I guess the joke is,

there's a motor, there's, even though there's like a,

it was called the motor strip or the motor cortex.

Or the motor cortex is not really a motor cortex

because all, because more modern analysis of neuroanatomy

is that basically all the, all the, you know,

cortical columns have since have,

have an input and a motor output.

And so, so everything I'm, you know,

all the time, like I, as I'm speaking,

there's some part of me that's listening.

And so there's that, the listening is like input

and the speaking is motor output.

And even thinking, thinking for me to pass on a thought

from, from one part of my brain to another

to pass a signal from one part of my brain to another,

it's like there's a solid ton of wave that's traveling.

So from visual cortex, right?

Cause you have to think, information has to travel to get

to the part, to get to the prefrontal lobes

because there's no sensory input to the prefrontal lobes.

And in most of the neural columns are consists of

interneurons, which are neurons that don't have

a connection to, to sensory input.

So the neurons, most of the neurons in your brain

have no connection to the outside world.

And so because of that, patterns have to be able to travel.

Cause if I can't get a pattern to travel from my eyes

to the back of my head in a way that's like consistent

enough that I can reconstruct a pattern of reality,

then, then I've got a real problem because it's like,

well, then all the patterns would have to be represented

in the first, by the first cells, right?

And then the rest of the brain wouldn't be able

to be used for anything.

So patterns have to be able to travel.

And that's why the concept of salt on waves

is really interesting.

It is a kind of wave, like a mechanical wave

or a magnetic wave that can contain information.

And so salt on waves, you can have a lot of different

basic patterns happening.

There are such, there's so high frequency that

they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency

tonic wave oscillations in a big way.

Like, like the, like the faster, faster frequencies are

cause all of the slower frequencies to pay attention.

Because then, because there's this sort of like,

you know, there's this,

the way oscillators work is that, you know,

they, that's the best thing.

There's like the principles of oscillators

of the physics of oscillators, not just in the brain,

but the physics of oscillators apply to the brain.

And so, you know, you can have a phasic signal,

a magnetic, soliton wave phasic signal oscillator.

And if it enters a big group of,

big group of tonic slower oscillators,

then the whole group is going to slow down

that faster oscillation and make it come into sync.

So it's going to like, and I described that again as,

it's like the piano note fading away

so the next note could be played.

But it's also at that moment when it's being taken away

is also the moment when those other norms

that are in tonic oscillation are listening

and perceiving that pattern that was played.

And so, you have a pattern when you have a sequence

of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies,

that are like different tones, different piano tones.

Like imagine each piano key that gets played in the sequence

is a different phasic tone, okay?

And if we're talking about 3D audio,

we've got different phasic tones happening

in different places.

And you've got large groups of neurons

that are listening to all of this

because they're firing in sort of like a tonic pattern.

So they're always ready to fire in a phasic pattern

if they come into contact.

They're always ready.

That's why they're firing in a tonic pattern.

But then they're able to notice

because of the principles of oscillators

when one or more members of their group

is not firing in a regular pattern.

And because of how interneurons can basically multiply

the number of patterns that each oscillator can represent

or that interneurons, inter and inhibitory networks

can multiply the number of patterns

that can be represented by phasic firing neurons

inside tonic firing oscillators made of lots of neurons.

Then we have a system where and the mental image

or a mental sound can be listened to

by the rest of the brain.

And that's what I think the observer of our perceptions

is going to be.

It's going to be the large oscillators

that are oscillating at tonic frequencies

and the content of awareness.

So the tonic oscillation is the ground of being

or pure awareness or consciousness,

just being the observer.

And the patterns that arise in that place

of pure observation are the phasic firing.

Those are the distinctions from nothingness.

Those are the distinctions between,

you know, if you have, if everything in your brain

was firing simultaneously,

there'd be no distinction between anything.

Distinctions, like the distinction between light

and darkness, it means that something is different.

And if you have an oscillator where everything is firing

at the same time, nothing is different.

What you get with phasic firing patterns

is you get a difference, a temporary difference,

because the oscillator will erase the difference.

But that temporary difference is a distinction

that your mind is noticing and listening to

in a physical way.

And that's why, you know, I sort of argue,

like, I don't know, what I just said is I don't know

if I've actually introduced any new ideas.

I think that science itself has solved consciousness.

And I'm just sort of like writing a narrative

of how the different,

how I think the different blocks fit together.

I think there's sort of like, you know,

there's a global workspace component that is,

I don't want to think,

it's not an integration of information theory,

but it is an association of information

in sequence patterns, or in oscillatory,

and it's a self-aware oscillatory network,

or a self-aware network that oscillates.

But the key is that the self-aware network

that oscillates is conscious,

because it's listening to its own representations

and it's listening to changes in its own representations.

But these representations,

because they manifest as phasic,

soliton waves that travel, and they need to travel.

Otherwise, most of your brain would be useless.

Patterns need to travel deep into your brain,

so your brain is not,

you know, it's largely, most of your brain

is not connected to the outside world.

So patterns need to travel into your brain,

and that sort of means that your conscious patterns are,

it's like, think of your brain as like,

as like what you have all over the place in your brain

are piano keys that have been tuned

to certain kinds of representations.

And these piano keys are tuned to certain representations,

they recognize certain patterns,

and they ignore certain patterns,

like they recognize what, you know, like,

it's only gonna fire, you're gonna have,

some patterns are only gonna fire

when you see a mock-up of Apple's new year of your headset.

You know, or some patterns are only gonna fire

when you see an Apple,

some patterns are only gonna fire when you see a mouse,

or a computer mouse, or a real mouse,

and or maybe a roach,

or maybe a joint,

so to play in words.

And, but these patterns are a location variant,

these are virtual patterns,

they're patterns that travel through the brain,

they have to travel through the brain

because you have, you know, multiple stages of analysis,

you have this prediction of what the medicine bottle's

gonna feel like, and then you have this,

then you, and then when you feel it,

it's like, does it feel the way you predicted,

or is it different?

Oh, this is different than I thought it was gonna feel like.

I was expecting one thing,

and it was not what I expected,

or it is what I expected,

because I have multiple,

multiple levels of representation,

I have predictions about how something's going to feel,

and then there's the actual moment feeling,

which is when the,

you've got those piano notes are being planted,

when you have the big,

actually potentials firing at higher phasic frequencies.

This is the thing that happened right now.

That's the higher phasic frequency.

Before that, the neurons are like,

listen, he's like multiple scales of data collection

from synapses to dendrites to the soma

to the activity output of an entire neural column

to an interneuron that travels between neural columns,

like a long distance interneuron

that receives, that basically allows patterns to travel

from one region of another

so that you can connect incoming audio data temporarily

with incoming visual data,

so that you can make a connection in your mind

between something you're hearing

and something you're seeing.

So if you see lightning and you hear thunder,

you can make a connection between lightning and thunder.

And if the lightning and thunder are in close proximity,

happening in close proximity,

then you know that the source of the storm is close to you.

But if the lightning happens in the thunder,

and there's a long time before you hear the thunder,

then you know that the storm is a ways off, is farther off.

And maybe it could be miles away

because the lightning is,

the light travels much faster than the sound.

And so if the storm is farther away,

you'll see it, you'll see the lightning flash

long before you hear it.

So you can kind of tell the difference

of where the lightning is,

how close the lightning is from yourself.

But yeah, if you're hearing and seeing lightning

simultaneously, that means it's happening right above you.

Right, it's really interesting to experience

lightning storms in Texas.

I've visited my parents out there.

Lightning storms are really interesting out there.

It's a little bit different from,

I don't have that kind of experience out here

in California.

It's a little bit more mystical out there in Texas

to be in a rain lightning storm.

And I feel like the sky is partially alive.

It's the sky.

Anyway, so let's see.

So yeah, so your brain is making association

between sensory data that's coming into your ears

and sensory data that's coming into your eyes.

And your brain is, it's a lot of travel,

a lot of distance between stuff that's coming

into your eyes and something that's coming into your ears.

But thankfully there are intern neurons that link

different brain regions together.

So you can have part of your brain that creates

representations of lightning, visual cortex,

surrounding the obstacle lobes.

And those representations have to

connect with the representations of the thunder,

which is where your audio cortex is gonna be representing.

Because, but it's like, here's the thing,

it's like, what's happening though, I think,

is that the audio cortex gets sort of used

to representing the particulars of thunder

and sounds of thunder.

And the visual cortex gets used to representing

the particulars of lightning.

And it doesn't matter if the same pattern

never happens twice, it's not that your brain

is creating fixed memories, it's that your brain

is getting tuned to be expecting certain kinds of patterns.

Or different regions of your brain are getting tuned

to expect certain kinds of patterns,

to look for certain kinds of patterns,

and to ignore certain kinds of patterns.

And which means that when they fire,

they're playing back certain kinds of patterns

that other parts of the brain are listening to.

So you have, the thunder comes in

and the first layer of your audio cortex

is representing that sound.

And then beyond that, whatever part of your brain

is receiving that sound,

is representing that pattern at a,

is representing that pattern plus the patterns

that it's receiving from other groups of neurons.

So like, if you see that there's a cortical column

in between the visual and audio cortex,

it's exactly like 50%, it says 50% mark.

It's at the halfway point between

the audio cortex and the visual cortex.

That cortical column is halfway at the 50 yard line

between the audio and visual cortex.

It's gonna, that might be receiving,

let's just say for the sake of a thought experiment

that is receiving 50% of data

from the audio part of the brain

and 50% of the data from the visual part of the brain.

And so now it has to create patterns

that are half audio and half video.

And I'm only making that argument to say that,

how is the brain going to integrate your audio?

Well, first of all,

it travels from one cortical column to the next

because you have these long distance internals

that connect the different cortical columns together.

You have these rich club networks

or default mode networks

or large scale long distance networks

that connect different brain waves together.

So different, so that means that you can have

spatial and temporal synchronicity

in the firing of lightning and thunder

that you can consciously notice.

And so the apical dendrites,

especially in the sixth layer of the upper layers

of the neural cortex are gonna be really part of the key

of sort of like integrating information

from multiple lower level data collections.

So when activity of a whole column sends a signal,

you know, it gets activated with a pattern.

So the pattern that that whole column represents

could be a unique pattern every single time.

But that pattern gets sent up to the pyramidal cells

and it gets into the inter-neuron network,

to the rich club network,

and it becomes a high level pattern.

It's a representation of a lot of lower level patterns

connected together.

It's like a bundle of waves

that are different every time.

But it allows the patterns to sort of travel

and to join up in groups

and to become part of any of the different types of patterns

and groups and to become part of any bigger collection

of patterns and it becomes what you pay attention to.

Your brain is activating around

where your brain on a larger scale is activating around.

That has to be noticed by even larger oscillations.

And that's when you get to, I think,

you know, sort of like the stuff that, you know,

why is it that when someone is,

when they take anesthesia and they're basically part

of the function of the apical neurons is inhibited,

then the brain isn't able to create

those like high level representations

that are integrating lots of lower level representations.

And so the sort of like integrating the apical neuron

is the point at which information becomes integrated

into large scale conscious representation

from the surrounding global workspace

of cortical columns and individual cells

and dendrites and dendritic branches.

So that's what I'm saying is like we have the,

you know, the global workspace is the whole brain

but the integration of information is into consciousness

is through the rich clubs that are represented

by the apical neurons in the rich club networks

that cross multiple regions of the brain.

So that patterns from multiple sensory regions

that, you know, basically large scale patterns

that incorporate low scale patterns.

So what that means is like, you know,

if you look at a keyboard,

there's lots of little letters, you know, or characters.

There's A, S, D, E, one, two, three, four,

you know, dollar sign, percent sign,

at sign, star symbol and so, you know,

at some point you learn letters

and those are low level features

and then at some point, you know, when you integrate,

if you, when your brain integrates all those patterns

into, okay, there's a keyboard

and the keyboard has lots of symbols on it.

It's a high level representation.

And then there's an office, okay,

now so you have, imagine you're in office

and there's a table and there's phones

and there's computer monitors

and all that stuff is made of a bunch of tiny representations.

But when you consider all these tiny representations

at a higher level, you're chunking up to a higher level

and includes all of these things on the table.

And each thing on the table has an incredible amount

of detail and the idea is that so you have,

when you chunk up to a bigger picture,

that bigger picture is, that's when you get to like,

that's the stuff you're conscious of right now.

It's the sort of like,

it's a picture that includes stuff you can see,

stuff you can hear, stuff you can feel,

you can feel your body, you can detect your hand,

your face, your nose, everything in the room.

That's the higher level stuff of consciousness

where you have this pattern of one thing

is in the context of everything else.

The pattern of a pencil is in the context of a room.

The pattern of a person is in the context

of everything else in space.

The context of, you know,

so we're defined by everything else, right?

The quantum weirdness of reality.

That everything is defined by everything else.

And so that's when you have this,

that's when there is consciousness

that is human level.

When all of these lower level representations

that are seen by small oscillators and large oscillators

of, you know, of individual neurons

as far as I'm representing aspects of individual patterns,

those patterns that are sort of,

they can be represented by,

in theory by any part of the brain

because the brain is a general learning algorithm,

but the brain becomes tuned

to look for certain types of patterns.

So if you're playing Tetris for six hours,

as some people have done,

you may start to see the shapes of Tetris

when you close your eyes or you're trying to sleep,

you can still see the game and you're playing it.

I mean, when you're trying to sleep,

you can still see as if you were still playing the game

because your brain starts to get used

to representing those patterns so much

that it continues to represent them

even when you close your eyes.

And that's sort of like my argument is that,

my argument is, someone else's argument

that the brain is a general learning algorithm,

that basically all the areas of the brain

are capable of representing anything.

And if you take one sort of like,

David Eakman talked about this,

Jeff Hawkins talked about this,

if you take an eye out of a rat's isoaca

and you plug that eye into the visual cortex,

the rat's visual cortex will learn to see

because the brain is really a general learning algorithm.

If you put an electric strip on someone's tongue

and connect it to a camera so that the pixels in the camera

are going to stimulate different parts

of the person's tongue based upon whether they're receiving

light or not and what frequency that light is,

then that person will begin to see via the signal center

of their tongue, even if they don't have eyes.

This has been demonstrated because the brain basically

is a general learning algorithm.

You can give it any kind of signals

and it can represent those signals.

You could plug in, this is from David Eakman,

you can plug in stock data into your brain.

Eakman, you're saying yeah, you could plug in extra cameras,

you can plug in stock data and the brain is going to learn

to represent that new brain activity.

It's going to learn to create sensory representations

of any patterns that you give it

because it's a general learning algorithm.

But that also means that if you take patterns

from one sensory input and you just send them

into a bunch of neurons and then those patterns

represent those patterns, then the next set of neurons

that receive those patterns that represent

the first set of patterns, they're also going to

have those patterns and you're going to have,

these patterns are going to basically ricochet

through the brain and that means that you can have

different areas of the brain representing the same patterns.

It means that basically we are virtual beings.

That the representation of my hands and my face

and my body and myself, it is a virtual pattern.

And it's like, think of the different groups of neurons

as like pianos and they can play music

or the piano can play light or the piano can play sound

or it can play movies.

It's like a piano that can play movies

or it can play feelings.

It can play the spatial and temporal characteristics,

feelings, emotions of any sensation.

Any part of the brain can do anything

because these are all temporal spatial patterns

encoded in between 0 and 0.02 hertz and 600 hertz,

temporal and spatial, phasic and tonic patterns.

I should say there are temporal and spatial

phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns.

That's actually more accurate.

On top of tonic awareness.

Temporal and spatial phasic differentials

on top of tonic awareness.

So what we have is like an oscillatory

differential neural network,

or a software network is an oscillatory

differential network.

And so, wow.
