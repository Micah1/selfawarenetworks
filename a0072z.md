get a video camera and point it at its own screen, thats a feedback loop. Next create a learning machine modeled on the human neocortex. So it sorts experiences into statistical memory which is used to predict what happens next. These predictions are our thoughts about everything. Next these memory-prediction-thoughts actually manifest as actual brainwaves in the em range. These in turn control all the muscles and send & receive info through nerves etc... so the brainwaves control sounds, movement, and the eyes and ears see this and make the association feedback loop on itself that is later called self. Which in turn is short for self awareness otherwise know as a learning self awareness. Awareness alone is the association or energy link between two of anything. or you could just read the book called "I am a strange loop" by Douglas Hofstadter
its a learning loop that learns itself, it refers to this association with its own loop as self
yes dogs and some other animals may also be learning loops that have learned themselves
a worm or crab it seems a lot less likely

Learning loop that learns itself. Does that prove that self exists?

Micah Blumberg
no intelligence is a process that produces the appearance of beliefs
the self is a learning loop that learns itself, thats what self refers too, thats proof the self exists
"yourself" refers to your learning loop learning to know itself as a learning loop 
Read the book "I am a strange loop" by Douglas Hofstadter if you don't believe.
Or try neurofeedback and know through direct experience that what I am saying is right.

I used to believe there was no I and no self, I am not someone who is afraid of that realization. I don't care if the self is permanent or impermanent, the word self and the sense of self come from you the learning loop that learns itself, it's so simple, you don't need any books to understand it, you can experience how profound it is with neurofeedback, but Hofstadter is legit if you do want more scientific backing.

Ilona Markedeternal
You say you used to believe, what happened? 
This is not about belief, rather direct seeing. Self does not exist as separate entity.

So, (Micah), I get it, it's seeing through the illusion, however constructed. Is that correct? And that is the cornerstone for disidentification with the loop, label, or sense of self. Guess the leap is from intellectual understanding to seeing it. Where are you in that, sorry if that has been asked before...

and of course we all know it's all just yappity yap. right? i mean, i'm not enlightened as far as i know, but, i'm here, and i know that, and damn glad i am. and i have noticed some teachers on here seem a little pissed at other people who think they are enlightened. argumentative in the poking fun kinda way. like, "come back here, you coward! ok yeah! run away! just what i thought you'd do cuz i'm so smart!" oh wait..like a five year old. ohhhh ok i get this thread now.

for the record, (Micah), that brain loop quote thing was awesome. helped me out a bit fo sho. ;)

Micah Blumberg
Ilona you have a double standard, somehow what I say is a belief but what you say is better than a belief.
I don't care if the self is a temporary illusion in your story, if your a temporary illusion then that is what you are, I'm fine with being a temporary illusion, but it is only the "story" that provides the "fictional context" for deciding whether something is temporary or permanent, illusion or real, without the story it's just energy
it doesn't matter if I believe or if I know through direct experience that the self is a "learning loop that learned itself" because I don't care. Fact of the matter is I know through both belief and through direct experience so your distinction is pointless, finally either belief or direct experience is enough, neither one is better than the other
well if you want something to win, your not enlightened, because that's called the game "white must win" you can think of it as referring to "chess" or the game "go" but really it refers to any desire to see anything/person/idea win, or to see anything/person/idea etc... lose. It's the win/lose mentality, it's immaturity. so if your in favor of either self or noself, that's not enlightened, got it?

Ilona Markedeternal
It does matter Cyp. It matters a lot. All this is is happening because it matters.
Enlightenment now is busy because it matters. 
You are here because it matters. 
You are just lying to yourself now.

Micah Blumberg
we are not talking about a leap from intellectual understanding to actual experience, first of all there is no such line, that's imaginary, there is no real distinction between intellectual understanding and actual experience, try to find that line in your direct experience, you can't. Second I'm all over the map in both on that one, this is both my direct experience and my intellectual understanding
how could I be lying to myself if there is no self to lie to Ilona your speaking nonsense again
you may have a direct experience but everything you say about your direct experience is a belief, everything you know about your direct experience is a belief, so reinterpret your direct experience or stay closed minded, but don't you dare accuse me of having inferior wisdom because my words are a belief and your words are beyond belief, that is so much bullshit your words are not beyond belief, no self is a belief based interpretation of your experience, you should recognize
I don't care what you call it, the belief only points to the feedback loop of self awareness, so it's not only a belief
it's a belief about the direct experience
it's not only a belief
he belief is the side effect of the experience

Ilona Markedeternal
Is there truth? 
What is belief?

Nipuna Ross Keller use the traditional 5 aggregates (all we got) is form (the body) self? how about feelings are they self? or thought formations are they the self? or the beloved consciousness is that self. are form, feeling, perception, mental formations, or consciousness permanent. do they in anyway have a form of stress in them? can you make them do what you want, like not get sick or change in any way. if not why are they regarded as self? really.

none of that is the self, it's not your beliefs, it's not your body, it's not your memories, it's not your ideas. It's just the loop of you.
There are three components to the loop of you, your senses, your brainwaves, and your actions. Ok? Your senses pull in information to form brainwaves which trigger your muscles to make movement and sound which get pulled in by your senses to update your brainwaves creating a loop. This is the loop of you get it? Does everyone understand how simple that is?

Nipuna Ross Keller ok but the loop is unstable to. after all its called a loop becouse its looping. right? it helps to differenciate between personality belief and conceit or becoming (bhava is the pali word for becoming)

I am referring to a loop, with three components, senses, brainwaves, actions got that?
it just goes around and around again in a circle
that's you
I don't care if it ends, that's still you
I don't care if the loop breaks, that's what the self is
I don't care if the loop is impermanent, that's what you are, that's what the self is
if you don't have a loop then you are missing one of the three components, it's either your senses, your brainwaves, or your actions do you get it? there is no way to lose your loop if you have those three things
you have a loop, between what you sense, which makes up your brainwaves, which makes your actions, which you then sense, and that is the loop we call self awareness, that's what the word "self" is referring to, this active loop, this physical actual loop
stop fighting me on this and realize it's the truth
you are a loop of you
not just anykind of loop either, your the learning variety
you learn as you loop
brainwaves actually are physical things actually, I can measure my brainwaves with an EEG machine
your thoughts actually are physical things also
sorry to break through the mystical bubble if that was your bubble and you thought your thoughts were not physical things or something, but check out any of the free neuroscience lectures on ted talks or youtube, you won't have to look far to realize thoughts are things, electricity is a physical things sorry to burst your bubble
take a class in Electromagnetism or something sheesh
‎"no self" is just an belief about an experience
it's not some primal truth or anything
don't equate the silly child nonsense of make believing you have no self because you think direct experience is better than beliefs with what I believe, because it's not my belief it's like universal, even dogs have a sense of self, a feedback loop
not every person has the same experience of existence so many your brain is just different, but it doesn't change the fact that you are a loop
the feedback loop can believe that it doesn't exist, and it can believe that it is just space, and it can believe there is no self, but the feedback loop is still there, it's still using the word self to refer to itself and it's still referring to you, so this is proof that your just being like a silly child with a pretend game
it's not your brain
it's not your tissue
it's not your cells
it's the whole learning loop, there is no reason we cannot create self awareness in a purely mechanical metal machine
in fact that's already happening
we don't need your brain your senses or your actions to create a learning loop, so your not any of those things, your just the learning loop, regardless of the physical hardware present in the real
it's not just a theory, it's a real world situation, you've seen this company numenta.com if you get out of the sandbox and into the cutting edge neuroscience world you will quickly find out it's a working reality, if you don't know that your just one of those people who is behind the times
by the way there is nothing wrong with being behind the times, that's ok too.
