I am a strange loop / with Neurofeedback Salon we are creating a feedback loop to give your brain a whole lot of information about itself, so the computer is just a high tech mirror, your brain does the work :)

The book "I am a strange loop" turned me onto Chopin, who is brilliant, and of course "Godel Escher Bach" Hoftstadler is an artist with words. One of my favorites is Moonlight Sonata (Beethoven) Classical music is an early form of brainwave entrainment, one of the technologies used in my Salon!"
