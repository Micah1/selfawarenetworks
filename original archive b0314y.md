Neurophysics NerveGear Happy Hour Vibrations & Oscill

00:00

Is other than just really excited that this technology is finally arrived on the scene after waiting for decades for something like this. Probably one of the neatest. Advances because it really helps to improve the automated detection of non-convulses status epilepticus, which is a real problem that goes undetected often in the hospital setting.

00:25

The web at the web address again. Sean was without CEREBL.com.

00:46

I think this is actually put together buy a neurologist in Southern California and it addresses the the current problem that we have in the hospital sending of the unmet need of rapid expedited brainwave pattern detection. You know, if you look at the current mode of or the current model if you will the business model for getting electroencephalography in the hospital it is.

\n 01:13

Fought with obstacles there are probably literally a dozen different things that can get in the way of of actually acquiring brainwave signals quickly. You know, you can do blood pressure you can get a pulse ox you can get somebody's temperature within seconds but are most important organ in the body can be.

01:33

Clocked away underneath the surface of the skull seizing away with no external manifestations and we may be oblivious to it. So to me, this is a an absolutely groundbreaking disruptive technology that is going to change the paradigm's moving forward for getting expedited EEG analysis in the hospitals setting. Oh interesting.

01:59

Yeah, so it looks like you've got a headband with. 10 electrodes and. They just wrap it they just sort of wrap around. So, it's not a cap. I mean, it's not like a traditional. Yeah, so at least seems very interesting. I just googled it. So what do you guys think about wearable new row devices?

02:22

I know cardiac devices are very end right with Apple watches and ECG algorithms. I recently saw these ads for durable which is like a device or headphones you wear and I don't know how accurate they'll be but they'll give you EEG signals and kind of show when you're working whether you're in like good PWaves or when you need a break or it'll kind of alert you okay, now your brainwaves are changing you need a break.

02:49

I know how accurate it's going to. Be but what are your or everybody's thoughts on that and if somebody's tried like a wearable device before in the neurospace? Well, um, I just want to say that sir cerebral is also a wearable device that that we're seeing I'm sort of like, I think so.

03:11

I think it's of interest everybody because it's the same sort of the same topic that both of you just write up and I guess I was on meet what I was trying to say that I'm noticing that Sarah Bell CER. I BELL is a 10 channel or 10 sensor EG headband that wrap that is it looks like a regular man.

03:32

I guess it wraps around like a swipe like a like a sweatpant what makes it different. I'm just curious what makes this stand out. Good question they might get I agree with you it is technically speaking a wearable. I mean, if somebody were really motivated they could get their hands on one reason and track their own seizure potential if they had epilepsy for example, so what makes it different and stand out well for one thing just the ease of use, you know, a standard electroencephalogram requires a technician and a lot of messy glue that smells really noxious to apply the electrolytes to the scalp they can fall off easily, you can get a lot of electrical artifact, it's just different.

04:17

Very cumbersome thing to get an EEG and the fact that requires a technician means that it's not always available 24 hours a day many institutions don't even have an EEG technician there's a lot of noise that can come from the system just countless variables barriers that get in the way so this is very convenient the electrodes pop on very easily it wraps around this scalp in a minute and before you know it anybody, you know can can can put this on a patient so a doctor who's not a, Physiologist or a nurse at the bedside could put this on in the ER and the ICU so really you don't you don't need a technician it uploads the signal to the cloud where a neurologist can read it from home or in Geneva wherever he or she is.

05:12

So instant access and then another aspect of it, that's really intriguing is that it's it has AI algorithms built into it that have a very high. Degree of positive predictive value and high sensitivity high specificity for detecting electrical electric graphic seizures. So even in the best of circumstances normally if a patient is seizing it will require the technician to get a the neurologist on the phone describe what's going on the neurologists will have to leave clinic or wherever he or she is and come take a look at the machine.

5:49

And make a determination here with this AI algorithm, it will actually set up an alarm right there at the bedside that of the seizures taking place again, you know, you don't need a neurologist necessarily to read. Yeah this it looks like this devices is intended for for the point for the point of care for for like a hospital or specifically a nurse.

06:16

Alright. Okay. Yeah, so it's a bit different I guess in in in terms of what you might expect from something like open BCI which I guess you wouldn't expect to see something like open BCI in a hospital. It being used for the EEG detect. I mean for for Caesar Caesar detections.

06:42

So I would agree with you on that. I think you know, this is an FDA approved device. So the company's obviously invested a lot of time and energy in demonstrating it's safety and effectiveness and. I think we're still a ways away from BCI. You know, hitting mainline clinical productions other than in very specific instances such as for correction of Parkinsonian tremor or people cervical dystonia, and those are quite involved in and specialized service lines of delivery.

07:20

So in terms of, You know BCI wearables that you're probably at Buju's question. I think you're gonna see those to be a more popular wellness oriented market that you're looking at there. Okay, did you have more thoughts on on that?

07:46

No I love all your coins seems a thing which is describing this more for hospital-based thing, but I agree that variable neuro devices are gonna become more commonplace because there's this big fascination to know for everything for most people to what's going on in your body like heart rate heart break variability, which somehow like ties to Euro coherent coherence and then neuroplasticity so I think there's just going to be a lot more things coming out and I'd be excited to hear if you guys have seen.

08:21

Something or in the pipeline that's coming out. I saw this durable device which was just headphones, but have you guys seen something else and the pipeline?

08:35

I I could also ask because everyone seen that that new video that nearly put out with with the monkey and the,

08:48

Talking about the one with the pong where where the monkey is playing himself with pong? Yeah, yeah that one. Yeah, it's quite striking and. Reminds me. 35-40 years ago longer than that when uh hung first came out and held my brother and I were just in trance as kids it.

09:08

Almost brings back that feeling now to see him playing himself with this BCI but I think I put you there's there's a number of different devices that are working the way through the. Wellness market that don't require FDA approval using you know, electrical conductance to. Gently stimulate portable function and maybe take advantage of neuroplasticity in neurogenesis probably where you're gonna see more of the really exciting advancements are in the FDA-approved market where we're using transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation.

09:49

To elicit specific changes in the lateral prefrontal cortex and people who are suffering from depression OCD schizophrenia. PTSD a lot of a lot of really exciting research going on there you may want to check out brain's way brain's ways got a pretty good product model delivery system for that modality.

10:15

For sure. I'm checking to thank you, so the happy hour part of it of the title is kind of like. This it is imitation for people to share what they want to share so if if if no one else wants to lead I'm open to it's John if John wants to go through the list of the new devices and I'll well what I would do then is just make a list of them to share with everybody afterwards and I'll post it on Twitter afterwards so John if you want to talk about what you're saying, I'm fine with that.

10:52

Pretty crazy list. I mean, thank you Michael for that opportunity appreciated, um. So I got before you start the 99 with a few things so there's this clubhouse like person. I think Jason Ma started a neurosurgery club and he also made me one of the hose so apparently there are many subscriptions how far can I invite you guys like Dr.

11:31

Shawn and the mica I mean, Dr. Raul I'm just search the club neural surgery so that you can follow and I'll invite you to the club and also given the name of the the title there's a physics in there, so for me it's a long time question that I just it the doom title reminds me of this, you know, my my interest in the whoever fashioner does that ring about we can you can Google you can see follow the the Wikipedia link on the cycle physics law of web.

12:09

Weber and the freshener is essentially says our senses be a vision or other, you know, touch vocals in like logarithm right is the linear so then the net natural question to what is the? All newer updates or the newer science scientific base of the slot, right apparently there's some apparent there's some research one on like in this direction recently recently, you know, 15 years I believe so if if the room is the expert in the room can come and not and also can someone explain the neural link the the the pump game the what's going on.

13:00

I just saw the video and a little bit confused so it seems the the monkey is just, A stucking on some rewards juice and also at the same time playing the game or what I didn't search an exhaust with the decision. I don't know what's the what's the setup um sure so so the monkeys being given a milkshake through the metal straw and the monkey is also an initially moving the the the cursor with the joystick and every time the monkey moves the the the cursor to the light on the screen the monkeys giving a little bit more milkshake and so the so the the light moves somewhere.

13:40

Else and the monkey moves the cursor to it it gets a little bit more milkshake and while it's happening the the neuro-link device that has been implanted in the head is is recording signals and sending those signals to the phone and so after a while they it the device has has has has trained on on the the data coming from from the from the brain from the device in the brain and what they do it then is the um as they unplug the, The joystick so that the monkey will continue to play the game and it will continue to use the joystick as if as if the you know, basically moving the cursor to where the to where the to where the light is on the screen right but but but now the only way for the cursor to get there is because the neural link because the signals from the brain in the neuralink device are being transmitted to the phone and that's the only way that the monkeys able to interact with.

14:47

The computer but the monkey still moving the hand and still moving the joystick because it doesn't know that this is this transition has taken place but you can see in the video that the joystick has been unplugged at that point and then that's so that's stage two is the joystick was unplugged and in the monkeys controlling it with with its brain, it doesn't know it stage three is they they take the joystick completely away from the monkey so it's not even in the picture anymore but the monkey continues to play the game with with justice with justice mind and it's um, and and we I guess we don't know if the monkey thinks that somehow the It by holding on to the straw that it's somehow able to to cause the.

15:31

To cause the like it's not it's not clear for me if the monkey really understands it that the mind is what's controlling because it maybe the there's some confusion with whether the straw is helping the monkey to control the cursor on the screen. I don't know but it's but it's really interesting.

15:58

So so it's an early link you can see on the monkey there the the part of the head with shaved and nearly cuz the wireless device so it it has a what happens is you is after the the sensors are implanted there's a wire that runs over the surface of the brain and it runs down to the the area behind the air and then that that is connected to a Bluetooth device somewhere behind the ear and then and then there's a, There's a device out the outside of it that that would be where you might put like a battery.

16:41

I think it's sort of like attaches behind the ear and then and but that but at that point it's it's transmitting to the phone wirelessly so you're not gonna say cable with an early device it it's using bluetooth. Just.

17:03

Enhancement of spatial and temporal resolution of detectors that track the neural urans firing and where is this neural link in terms of spatial and temporal resolution in relation to FMRI or called? It's way beyond those two it's evacuated at it's in a class of it's own so so like so ecology is you know, putting like a grid of electrodes on the surface of the brain but but this but this is putting this is putting sensors this is injecting sensors into the brain tissue between blood vessels with with the kind of precision that only only a robot can handle surgically and and it's using.

18:01

Oh and let me so the main bite. Scott up here and so again, we're just so that's. So the the electorals are like smaller than the human hair there's about I think I think there's like 10 I forget but I it might have been something like 10 electrodes per per thing and like 10 gosh.

18:33

I have to look it up but um. But it's like let's see how many lectures. I'm just gonna type this in my computer real quick see if I get a fast answer. Like a trose on an early link. So okay, so the so of it so. So I guess um, the initial arrays were we're thought maybe you could have a close to like 3,702 electrodes per array in the first versions let's see if I can alright is the question how many are on the monkey and the mindblowing thing especially resolution and the number of electrons.

19:20

I don't know the special resolution but I just saw a video that said it was 10-24 electric swan each atmosphere.

19:31

Where sorry the, That's not shanks because there's 16 electrodes on each on each shank. There's 16 electrodes on each channel each chain. I just like shank so for each penetration. I think there's 16 contacts for a total of 1024 contacts per hemisphere, okay? And the depth of penetration is somehow calibrated beforehand and then desired.

20:03

I don't know yes yeah the death of calibration is calibrated ahead of time it goes several millimeters in into the brain the level of the cortex, they're working out models now where they're going to be able to take it deep to the subcortical structures. Part of the advantage of using the robotic approach is that they can avoid the major complication of deep brain stimulation which is bleeding these these electrodes are a tiny fraction of the size of most deep brain stimulator electrodes and being very tiny and filamentous, of course, you can imagine they would break very easily and so the spatial resolution is incredible it's like nothing that's been invented before and, The idea here is to get a very high fidelity reading from cortical neurons so that very closely approximates real-time signal processing.

21:07

I want to like agree with that in terms of like it's far beyond, you know MRI and it's it's it's far faster than MRI and it's far more it's high. I'm much higher resolution, you know, it's like individual neurons but but I think that there was a project the nerve that was called neural dust where they injected and and also optogenetics right like we're in in both cases, they're they're manipulating they're they're manipulating their modifying single neurons, so they can manipulate single neurons.

21:42

And. I. Don't I mean, I guess yeah, I don't know if you I don't know how to compare it compare the resolution to optogenetics, you just can't you can't really do object genetics and human being right but um.

22:00

Technically you could might the problem is that from an antical perspective it's a little challenging or requires a viral vector to transfect neurons to start with and. With optogenetics you're looking more at a control feedback, you know, modifying behavior using input of light into the brain as opposed to sensing so much what's going on so the really different modalities the the neural dust idea is very very neat idea.

22:34

I think Ray Kurzweil is one of the early proponents of that. And the idea was to be able to use you know, essentially millimeter size devices that could either swarm in a high of fashion. But I think part of the problem was in you know, getting that getting information in and out they just hadn't been able to devise the right kind of I/O platform to be able to facilitate the neural dust stuff but they did they were being manufactured on a micrometer scale, so you're right about that.

23:11

Um, click comment on the optic genetics, another thing were worth bringing up is optimized for it's great in mice but all my sur basically almost clones of each other in the ladies the labs that we're trying to get up to to work in monkeys starting like 10 years ago or so you get way more issues due to genetic variability because monkeys are not all clones of each other and so some monkeys it would work and some monkeys wouldn't I think immune responses were a big issue there?

23:44

So in humans with even more genetic variability than monkeys you're gonna run into stuff like that. That's good to know um, yeah, I'm you know, man, I guess one of the the things that's been tatted about an early like was that the size of the electrodes and the fact that they're designed to miss blood vessels and that maybe that could reduce scarring and and and make make it possible to leave leave it in longer and it had us still be effective for a long time.

24:20

Reflections echoes from different layers, possibly stimulation. Like that.

24:38

Anyone else. I sort of missed a question would you rephrase it maybe a little louder? So I come from instrumentation background and every time I joined neurophysics rooms I get frustrated because a lot of stuff that people talk about are very indirect and then people say I feel like I feel that because I just want to see it.

25:01

So I've been looking for different progress in instrumentation and so this this room is up great great thing and thank you very much for setting it up. And I guess the ultimate goal is to be able to understand the other granular level. How the individual neurons firing gets all gets into a larger group and then turns into a certain things that we can actually experience and so and there's a lot of problems working invasive detection and we it seems like we also have a problem with a temporal resolution or this detector or something.

25:49

So, so two fold one in, Is either any nine invasive detection research going on. That's number one number two is am I just totally off envisioning my time maybe ten years from now maybe 50 years from now when we could actually, you know point a telescope type of thing to the person's head and then be able to actually see.

26:20

What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.

26:52

I mean that there's not like that hasn't picked up much. You know, I mean, I'm excluding like FMRI because you have to be in like a big magnet for that but like, you know EEG has been around forever, but just just the electrical noise is what I'm sorry. I'm just incorrectly FMRI that's not give you.

27:15

Dessert like a one second latency and doesn't give you temporal resolution that's necessary because these things are fire on your head hurts to like 20 minutes. Yeah, yeah. So so as if we're the high temporal resolution, you're gonna have you could have like EEG, but now you you lose your spatial resolution.

27:33

So there's always a trade-off. But I went to a talk by Mary Lou Jepsen who was kind of touting this new thing with they are getting like could get possibly high resolution by using perhaps. I think it's infrared that's coming out of like, That it should put it simply like a little like a hat or like a beanie is the idea and that they have fine spatial resolution because of the how many pixels you can get due on like LCD using LCD technology the how flat screens have so much more pixels than they used to so if you shape this into sort of like a hat and and you use infrared and and in some cases combining it with with a with with sound they're able to sort of pick up a resolution, but that's that's like a private company called like open water.

28:29

I think that coincidentally know a lot about the head company. I don't know if people want me to share but I'll let you keep talking and keep going yeah. I was just gonna say that and there's more but yeah like there's nothing great that has great temporal and spatial specificity that I at least that.

28:47

I know of that's uh commonly used.

28:53

Um, Sean Abbott, I bet you have someone to yeah, I actually uh helped to launch a company out of Israel back in 2014 that used a combination of laser light and doppler to image brain blood flow so I think Carl kind of what you're getting at here is is the trickiness that that.

29:21

We face when you're trying to interpret seasonals, you know electrons one modality that we try to use to infer what's going on at the neuronal level functional MRI is another but functional MRI depends on blood flow. So we have something called the neurovascular unit where the idea here is that when a neuron becomes more metabolically active a sensibly because it's engaging in more firing activity that activity requires more consumption of glucose and oxygen which then of course requires the greater amount of blood flow to that neuron so the neurovascular unit is the coupling of the blood flow the blood vessel blood flow and blood vessel to the neuron itself in functional MRI can take advantage of that.

30:13

Increase in essentially glucose and oxygen delivery to be able to represent indirectly electrical activity but there's there are temporal limitations the advantage to laser doppler is that we can get almost instantaneous signal representation of brain blood flow changes probably it's greatest limitation is the depth of penetration into the stalling the brain tissue is somewhat limited by power if you increase the power of.

30:48

Doppler too much, you can actually damage underlying brain tissue and blood vessels but. In terms of trying to get very high temporal resolution, it's almost instantaneous feedback and closely at parallels that what we see on the electron suffering. So that helps. Thank you. And then Sean if you want to list some of the other devices that you were you're gonna list earlier I can I can write them down as you go ahead.

31:18

Yeah sure. I think you know from the therapeutic standpoint in addition to transparent magnetic stimulation, we're also seeing transparent. I'm sorry transparent or direct current stimulation as a therapeutic modality. It's probably let's study but the idea here is pretty much the same and that is that if we pass electrical currents.

31:42

Through the skull into the underlying brain tissue, it's stimulates neuronal activity. And so there's a principle of of the brain that most many people have heard of and that is neuroplasticity and neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to changing the circumstances and alter its connections so neurons that fire together wire together as we say and if there's a demand on brain function that requires us to learn or to adapt neuroplasticity makes that possible.

32:20

So we can take advantage of that principle of. Disease and kind of hack it for a good reason using PMS in PCBS. Sorry PCS which are two different modalities that are now currently available on the marketplace. We can look at other forms of. Therapeutics think that cerebral and train them to their number of different devices on the marketplace and you'll see this if you go to to.

32:56

Physical medicine or rehabilitation conferences where they try to use infrared or near infrared lights to stimulate the optic nerve in synchrony with auditory stimulation the idea here is that if you have somebody who's suffering from depression, you know, they may be neuro adapted to a rather low level of energy you can.

33:24

Again kind of hack their system by introducing a higher level frequency. So alpha or low beta frequency waveforms to just improve their neuronal excitability and increase the mood and. There's some evidence that you can definitely stimulate increase levels of dopamine and stereotone and using this this idea of cerebral and trainment.

33:54

So those are probably terms of at least what's available in clinical production from the therapeutic standpoint those are available. Only one day it looks like Carl left the group, but if he comes back he can let him know Micah that Magneto electrode cephalography probably is where he would be interested.

34:14

This is a setup that combines MRI with EEG at the same time using ferromagnetic components in the EEG leads that are compatible with the MRI and do not interfere with. The. Image quality. So we can now actually image the brain using MRI at the same time that we're also getting synchronous.

34:39

Information from the electron supplegram. So much higher tighter temporal resolution, and so it's a very interesting modality. There's something I ask a questions if you if you know the answer um, what what do you lose when you when you start you I guess what do you lose when you mix the tutor together is it just like the cot the EEG part of it the contacts are a little less specific or?

35:13

Frank. I don't know that I was just frankner Scott sorry Scott, I I don't know that you necessarily lose anything. I think the I you know before these specific setups were created it was essentially technologically not possible to do an EEG inside a conventional MRI machine. And I don't know if you've ever been in an MRI machine.

35:41

I'll I almost personally lost this stethoscope into an MRI bore one time and that would have probably ended my career. As a budding young neuroscientist to make such a casual mistake, but any anything that has a ferromagnetic quality to it, essentially can. Impair the quality of the signal that's coming from the MRI.

36:04

So yeah, I've heard the horror stories from grad students feel like they help careful you have to be I was just curious maybe like materials person would know this like if you're not using magnetic metal electrode are there. I'll not magnetic electrodes that are as conductive or or not I guess as right.

36:26

Yeah, no good question. I see what you're asking. So basically with the magnetoon subflography, the the leads are are usually titanium. They're not as conductive as you know properly for example, but usually you get about the same quality of information. So it's not not even close to the kind of fidelity of EEG signal that you would get let's say from neural link.

36:52

I mean the, Well that's that's extraordinary but that's penetrating though that yeah right yeah. So, you know, it's I think you could probably say making people like to support our confused good enough to get some really interesting answers. You know, but I don't know. I kind of feel like we're poised for you know, disruptive jump in technological innovation here.

37:17

There's a new. Brand that have to look it up a we now actually have the ability to get bedside MRIs the new device just rolled out last year that. He can put in an ICU. It's a it's basically an MRI in a box which is something I've fantasized about for 20 years, so it's really exciting to see that come to fruition.

37:40

And in terms of the quality of EEG signal, we're just seeing improvements, take place all the time so. Yeah, I think we're we're poised to probably see convergence of a variety of different technologies and you know, when you throw AI in there and machine learning. I just envision or capability to do things in the IC setting is put it for the hospital settings to jump dramatically here soon.

38:11

You were talking about mixing AEG and FMRI. How But but uh, what for my understanding Magneto electrons. Sethography is the it is like if that's the one where so with EEG it's better with to pick up signals from the sulcai I think and then with MEG it's better to pick at picking up signals from the gyri or admit it could be vice versa because once directly reading out the electric field and the other ones reading out the magnetic field, but I think, EEG makes it applies.

38:49

It that's something else right? That's not related is it? You're correct. Yeah. I I don't know that we really have the ability to to. Co-locate EEG with FMRI, I mean, they're maybe there's somebody who's doing it. I'm just not aware of it, but you know a functional MRI is essentially a traditional magnet.

39:14

And really what we're looking at there is what we call blood oxygen level delivery which is something that's very susceptible to ferromagnetic interference. You know, somebody has a small hemorrhage even into the cortex of the brain the hemostitter and that's left over in the brain tissue can interfere with the single acquisition for a functional law.

39:36

So, We would not typically do any EEG at the same time as a functional MRI with the magnitude of encephalography really we are mapping out brain activity. And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.

40:18

So really is a an interesting a different way of. Looking at looking at the signals and we're getting from from functional MRI.

40:33

Okay. And so, does anyone want to talk more about Mary Lou Jefferson, that was brought up earlier or? Or we could go into a nutrition if shrine if you want to mention I know that you have no interest in no financial interest in promoting any of these companies, but if you want to mention them for references, we can we can I can make lists event of anything you want to mention.

40:58

Specifically.

41:06

You know what it would like I might just you know kind of think of best of brand here, you know, when you think about transcranial magnetic stimulation this is an area where there's a lot of innovation taking place quickly because there's such a big market for it. You know, I might direct your your participants to check out the movie the Sunshine or I think it's the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the movie that came out probably about 15 years ago, very beautiful sad story that kind of gets into the whole issue of mental illness and and what happens when you just want to erase system memory of a loved one from your brain and back then this is 2003 2004 sounded very fantastical but the truth is we're kind of getting to that point now where?

41:58

We don't have the precision to to erase, you know to modulate specific memories, but to overall change this the resting state of the brain and nurture towards a more physiologically beneficial. Fung level function, it's we're there, so if you look up brain's way probably is I think best of brand for transcranial magnetic stimulation.

42:29

There's there's a few others as well neurostar seems like they've got a good product. But these are all kind of you can follow the problem of the category of coming soon to a city near you if you're city doesn't have a device now probably will soon usually psychiatrists or neurologists or employees for people with resistant treatment depression, so um on that note, so I've read a few horror stories this event, oh and it and and you know, you got to take about you got to take some of those things to hear with the grain of salt, obviously there's a lot of crazy stories in the world in general, but what I'm saying is that like, So the comparison I heard what was you know, so what were you saying?

43:18

Sean that people are losing memories by comparing it to this bottomless mind that people that there's a go ahead oh yeah no, I mean, I guess theoretically that could be a side effect of using this device if you know, one one theoretical or well one practical side effect of using TMS is inducing seizures.

43:42

It's not common but it can happen because you are the polarizing large numbers of neurons at the same time and so when you. Lower the threshold for depolarization, it makes it easier for seizure activity to take place so and seizures could theoretically cause amnesia. I'm curious about the horror stories you've heard.

44:05

I mean every once in a while there. I do read a report where somebody had a bad effect but I've seen largely really good, you know reports of experience. Yeah, it's back in the and the days when when it wasn't about neuroscience, it was the best psychology right like I guess it's a 60s and 70s and there was a there was a attack there was a they zapped it was called electrical convulsive therapy right and so they put they they shocked your brain of electricity and so the so the horse story that I read was trying to compare basically like is trying to compare TMS to like a new form of electrical.

44:52

Therapy in principle I guess as much it's much more specific the amount of current is much more like specific the direction of where the current supply is much more specific but they were saying that they're saying that you know, a lot of people have very positive responses from it that they but a few people don't and then someone and at least one person route to maybe write this down let me look so it's EMS horse or I'm just gonna go with that if it comes up but I tried okay, so the article is called I I think Well there's a there's more than a few so the one of them is I tried TMS.

45:31

I tried transferring magnetic simulation, but then once it was too good to be true how I think this must have been too good to be true how TMS damage my brain now, um. But like I said this this uh, this this guy was saying that um, Some sort of skimming the article.

45:49

And by a brother feel free to and into just speak up and I'll meet myself but I'm sort of skimming article. So yeah he was saying that the nurses encouraged him to take like the maximum dose and then he was sort of have his symptoms started over the next few weeks his symptoms became worse and and he developed a disturbing news symptoms and including some terrifying hallucinations paid developed tendonitis and he was.

46:27

Yeah, so anyway so I maybe look up this article. I don't know if I should list it on Twitter or something so he's been finding it but in fact I'll be back it's good to be balanced because you know, anytime a new technology is deployed in this environment we are.

46:45

In a way experimenting with with something that's very new relatively speaking, you know, and so who who knows you know, it's not for everybody and the problem here is that with the new technology like EMS. We don't really have a way necessarily predicting who's gonna be a good responder, who's not.

47:08

You know, I think it gets challenging because when you think about, You know behavioral health and mental illness many times people who are suffering from let's say depression especially treatment resistant depression, they have something else that's going on there may be an autoimmune neurological disorder that's taking place, it could be undiagnosed multiple sclerosis and it can be dealing with a you know, some other you know, a neurotransmitter deficiency random b12 deficiency probably b12 deficiencies the most common thing that I see in my clinical practice that leads to a wide range of neurological symptoms that also have mental health.

47:49

Implications so you know, you can imagine that somebody who may have an uncorrected underlying a physiological abnormality that then goes through a physiological stress relief may get worse because they have an underlying problem that hasn't been addressed so I really feel like these these therapies have to be done in a comprehensive holistic approach.

48:16

You know, I'm seeing these centers popping up around the country where you can almost imagine that they're going to turn into conveyor belt care because there's a profit motive for using these technologies now but really I think they need to be done in a comprehensive holistic setting where you're addressing all those factors so you get the best outcomes possible so I have a hypothesis why why electrical stimulation whether it's it's a TDCS or.

48:51

Or a TMS may actually be the wrong treatment for some depression for some patients with depression and those pay those patients would be experiencing depression because they're basically they're having a metabolic disorder where their cells are not able to produce enough energy enough ATP. And so like so for example like there's a book that book that I read that it was just a layman's book but it was about how people who have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and depression, they they might be able to like basically there's like 20 different things they can try and one of those things was like the ribose because the ribos is if you take it like I think it was like five grams a day many patients saw like an improvement in their energy and in their happiness and reduction in their fibromyalgia and reduction in their chronic fatigue syndrome and in.

49:50

And. The explanation was that it was helping the body to to produce more energy more ATP and forget how to I always forget how to pronounce ATP with addendosine triphosphate yeah, that's it and that's yeah. It's not you're definitely on the right track there might you know, if you think about.

50:19

Think about sleep why is sleep so important to us, you know, and we you know can get weigh into the weeds talking about rem and dream interpretation center but from a functional standpoint asleep is when our brain turns on the glimphatic system, so you know until 2014 we did not think that the brain had its own lymphatic drainage system the just couldn't see it you could take a biopsy of muscle tissue for example and under microscope you can see these small little lymphatic tubes that will help to drain.

50:54

Muscle tissue of you know lip lymph tissue which is really waste products and immune complexes, so but to run 2014 researchers in Virginia were studying patients using MRI when they would sleep and found that lo and behold when they would go to sleep this whole lymphatic system would turn on the brain.

51:19

And we discovered that that lymphatic system was made up of glial cells which are supporting cells in the brain so they were given the nickname the glimpatic system so the implication here is that we have enough energy in our brain to do one of two things we can either be awake and doing and taking action or we can switch to the sleep mode where our energy then is devoted to open at these lymphatic channels and removing debris from the brain.

51:50

And that debris is basically the byproducts of oxidative metabolism so oxidative metabolism if you think of an internal combustion engine in car it consumes oxygen and fuel the combines them to generate energy and a waste product so our mitochondria inside of our cells in the brain the rest of the body, but especially in the brain do the same thing they combine oxygen with the fuel source which in this case usually is glucose and the combustion yields energy in the form of ATP and NAD and then there's this.

52:23

Byproduct of oxidative metabolism that builds up and that's free radicals and beta amyloid and tau protein and other things that accumulate in the brain and we can tolerate that to a certain point before we get exhausted and fatigued or cognitive performance that climbs and we go to sleep and we remove all of that junk from the brain during sleep, so when you're talking about depression in metabolic function, you're definitely on the right track there.

52:54

Probably for fists of the time people who we see in the clinical environment who are suffering from depression do so because they simply just don't have the right metabolic set up to support adequate metabolic function of the brain. So if the ribose is a really nice way of helping the supply more energy to the brain.

53:15

So as methylcobalamin which is a hormonepapolate and literally we could talk all day about all of the different components that the piracy. Tuning and searing the go into the formation of neurotransmitters. And then when you think about the metabolic stresses that occur during increased allosteric load, then the demands on neurotransmitter formation go up and we also generate more oxidative metabolic byproducts and so they need to clear that out increases.

53:48

So, I mean, anyways, yeah, my my thought is is that the team has clinics and the and the TDTCS therapies that are being proposed there ought to be like conversation like a global conversation with these folks just to you know, the brakes to bring up the What you just said basically that that some patients if they're having a metabolic issue that's that's the cause of their depression adding a bunch more stimulation which they're which just which makes their brain work a lot harder.

54:18

It doesn't on paper that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So you're right just like if you're car if the oil in the crankcase were almost out and then you go and try to raise your car on the on the expressway you're gonna just burn out your engine faster.

54:37

It's the same kind of thing in the brain if you don't have the right kind of substrate for neuroma function, and then you apply an external energy source you can just speed up that process of your rental damage. So yeah, you're on the right track. Very cool. So it decides this conversation is kind of popcorn style and it's that the happy hour part of it.

55:01

So, I'll let anyone. Share with their thinking and if you're in the audience, I'm sorry. I don't I mean, I don't like to say it's audience, but like anyone who wants to say anything just raise your hand and I'll bring you up.

55:22

Beyond the it's it's surprising that to learn that a what you just mentioned it to a glimpse addict system dysfunction is gonna I'm not at night. I remember reading it maybe last year or a couple years but a it seemed like I mean seems very logical to me that and at night what was sleeping there's a fluid I circulation right so taking away the waist.

55:52

So,

55:56

The I mean, I'm curious why why do you think this is at such a late stage there's a discovery like the important that just you know is a greed upon there is just like a new they are assisted by some new. Device or or tools, that's what. Yeah sure it really comes down to.

56:28

All things I mean, I think the quality of thinking in the quality of tools available to us so you know, our brains have these large chambers inside of them called ventricles which are full of cerebral spinal fluid and the ventricles are where the civil spinal fluid is actually made for the most part and we know that there's a circulatory pathway for that streamle spinal fluid.

56:53

What was not clear entirely is what is happening within the brain parenchyma or the tissue itself? I think it's it's taken a while for us to even recognize that. We needed more than just the venous drainage system to remove these waste byproducts because it was pretty easy to to conclude that okay, well the you know arterial blood brings the nutrients into the brain and then the venous blood removes the waste byproducts and when anatomists and pathologists would take pieces of brain tissue and look at it under the microscope.

57:33

They would not see lymphatic channels like you would if you were to take the he's a muscle tissue. But the reason for that is that brain tissue is a very delicate gelatinous tissue it has unique properties compared to any other tissue in the body so it's very easy to destroy brain tissue even at the best of circumstances so when we take these preparations a brain tissue and look at them under the microscope what we didn't realize was happening is that these lymphatic channels they were so delicate and they were running right they run right alongside the veins that are draining the brain so it's very easy to miss them and they're really technically they're Potential spaces, they don't open up until enough pressure develops inside of them to pop them open, so you could never really image those who emphatic channels.

58:29

In real time in somebody who's going through an autopsy or pathological specimen and I wasn't until MRI technology had advanced to the point where we could actually look at the bulk flow of water molecules through the brain. In real time that we can actually see those channels open up and witness the flow of watery substance like civil spinal fluid through those channels.

58:57

So it requires some type of logical advances and but really since 2014 since this is discovered it's really causes to go back to the drawing board and rethink. Everything. You know, if you think about Alzheimer's disease, for example, you know, we've thought that Alzheimer's disease is it was a disorder of the accumulation of something called beta amyloid in the neurons.

59:21

It's much more than that. It's also insulin resistance in the neurons. It's vascular damage. It's genetic influences. It's you know, many things but the central dogma has told us that data analytic accumulation in the neurons is toxin to the neurons. And so we embarked on clinical research to try to inoculate the brain against beta amyloid to essentially vaccinate it.

59:46

And none of those clinical trials really panned out we're scratching our heads and so when when the glimpatic system was discovered it. Set off this collective light bulb for all of us and oh, okay, so maybe Alzheimer's disease is a disorder of sleep. People are not getting enough sleep, you know, a melatonin production drops off around the age of 65.

01:00:10

So our sleep cycles start to get disrupted as we get older and maybe people are just not getting enough sleep to clear out the baby amlod from the brain. Same thing for Parkinson's disease. You know, we know that Parkinson's many different things. It's damage to do from an urgent neurons.

01:00:28

It's chronic inflammation and chronic loss of neurons, but also it's a failure to clear out tau protein from the neurons. So all of the nerve degenerative diseases inflammatory disorders, like multiple sclerosis seem like they may have in common this problem with insufficient clearance of toxic metabolites from the brain tissue.

01:00:51

So, I want to bring up another thing about a basically an Alzheimer study that came out that basically they said that what's common in. Alzheimer's patients is the like a reduction and in new protein synthesis like in a large-scale impairment of new proteins synthesis, which is associated which is an essential part of long-term potentiation.

01:01:16

And so they they gave the animals in the study some some sort of drug that increased. I wish I had in front of me, but they gave them a drug that increased that the, Near the new protein synthesis and they saw some immediate meat immediate improvements to the the memory at the animals had and so in the context of of of that it do you know, if new protein synthesis is also a factor and as you said Alzheimer's and the other one was what's the other major?

01:01:57

Parkinson's heart's Parkinson's yeah is that also a factor in Parkinson's? I'm not sure about the Parkinson's side of things I'm saying I haven't seen literature about that in the Alzheimer's side but we're referring to is a failure of synthesis of ribosomes and ribosomes assemble inside the cell on something called the endoplasmic reticulum, and that's where.

01:02:23

Messenger RNA that's coming from the nucleus gets transcribed into proteins, so the ribosome is really important for decoding, you know, genetic information and practically turning it into proteins that are used by the cells. So yeah it's it's um, it's a really interesting area of investigation for Alzheimer's and probably also for weight loss, you know, you deserve a lot of kudos might guys it's been neat to watch your your personal weight loss journey.

01:02:57

I wonder if any of this resonates with you the the endoplasmic reticulum in the hypothalamus and specifically in certain neurons that regulate our sense of hunger or satiety those neurons are very very. Easily damaged by the byproducts of oxidative metabolism and we essentially can experience what we call endoplasmic reticulum fatigue or failure in in that case what's happening is that those neurons are being overdriven by high levels of ghrelin and the bloodstream ghrelin is the off switch for our appetite but you know, when we eat a traditional western diet, that's full of all sorts of sugar, you know, and and, Mostly sugar really kind of overstimulates those ghrelin receptors on the hypothalamic neurons than the endoplasmic reticulum can get burned out and the ribosomes essentially get damaged and so those neurons needed a period to recover which is why we think fasting can be so useful to help with neuronal recovery, so you just said that basically the sugar is is damaging the ribosomes that are are essential for new protein synthesis, which leads which is leading to the issues with some of the memory issues with Alzheimer's something like that.

01:04:24

Sugars probably one of the most toxic substances known to man it probably doesn't get enough credit for being that way, but it's just as bad as crack cocaine for the brain. So sugar could be one of the major causes of Alzheimer's in theory. I guess yeah. I think it probably is a big contributor.

01:04:45

I mean if you think about, You know, there's some good evidence that would suggest that people who have Alzheimer's disease basically have type three diabetes of the brain so there's a failure to be able to metabolize glucose properly and in these neurons that are burning out they do not.

01:05:09

Any longer respond well to glucose and glucose is a primary, you know, energy source for neurons. You know, so for that reason we've actually started migrating towards a you know, keep totic diet for people with Alzheimer's and cognitive decline. So you can supplement ketones in the diet and that's been shown to be beneficial for people with memory loss or you can just cut out the sugar and let the brain work the way it's supposed to work.

01:05:39

So, I mean, these are these are like these are you know, national issues and global issues? This is like if we if we can just um, really point to the financial costs that our country has to pay in healthcare because of sugar and and you know that let me just pause.

01:06:02

Oh, you're inviting me to get on a soapbox here. Micah. There's there's a financial incentives in healthcare and sick care or. Really misaligned with having a healthy population in my opinion. So and when you combine that with the financial incentives in the food production and distribution. System that we have it's really a recipe for disaster so you shouldn't be any surprise to us that we we haven't you know, a pandemic of a tsunami of neurological diseases, that's washing over our world right now.

01:06:40

Shot at can I I was kind of learning a lot about the lymphatic system. I remember a couple years ago doing like a report where I had to bring that in a lot and it sounds like you know a lot about it. So a couple of questions came to mind and that you can tell me if you know if you know this off the top your head, but one thing you talked about was energy and so kind of in the big picture where does that come from in the sense of you mentioned lymphatic system when you sleep it there's a point at which it builds up.

01:07:15

A pressure so that the fluids can kind of move across the extracellular space the parent come up and and then there's roommate that kind of surrounding the the vasculature I believe and then so I guess my questions were is that the exit or the entrance would be the surrounding area of the vasculature and then what is responsible for building up the pressure and then what is the energy source of that?

01:07:42

If you know any of those let me know. I'll do the best I can I mean, there's a great questions. I might guide you. I'm just pulling up on my resources in PubMed there was a really interesting paper published in 2015 in the Journal of New York Chemical.

01:08:05

A short the journal is here, but the title is the the system I've beginners guide. So give us a kind of lays down the basic principles here, but in a nutshell energy production in any cell, but. Definitely in the brain is sustained by the mitochondria and the mitochondria are specific specialized organelles or tiny organs inside of the cells in the brain and there are different kinds of cells in the brain.

01:08:34

There are neurons and there are glial cells which are supporting cells that do not specialize in the transmission of electrical signals, but they support the cells that do transmit electrical signals. And so those glial cells could be oligodendrocytes or astrocytes their number of different. Kinds of cells they have different functions, they could enter sites create myelin that insulates the electrical conduction of neurons associates have an inflammatory role and they modulate the fluid that veins the brain.

01:09:10

So when they mitochondria are generating energy, they do it by combining oxygen with glucose in through the crimp cycle create ATP and NAD, so this is the two primary forms of energy that are our body uses and so ATP stands for density and triphosphate and it is. Nicotinamide nucleotide and they both have such a form of currency that are shoveled around the body and used for energy to create new proteins or to generate function at a cellular and organic or organ system level.

01:09:58

So when it comes to the glimpse system the lymphatic tubes run right alongside the venules which of these very tiny little veins so if you think about the order of things arteries lead to arterials and arterials than divided become capillaries and then when capillaries come back together, they form venules then the vein the venials coalescent is small veins and the larger veins that drain the brain.

01:10:28

So the glimphatic system runs, right? Along the outside of the capillaries in essentially they're a virtual space that are created by what we call podocytes or these are essentially the foot processes of the supporting glial cells. So you'd have to imagine the glial cells have these small projections that essentially come and wrap around the capillaries and avials and act as though they are an external insulating.

01:11:05

Membrane that. Is creating a potential space around the capillary. Now as enough metabolic activity takes place inside the mitochondria and we're generating waste product part of that involves water and water is very abundant throughout the brains. Makes up most of our brain actually and so that water dissolves different solutes and ions in it and can traffic different proteins like albumin for example.

01:11:37

And so as that material builds up inside the neurons the neurons know, Is. If that junk outside of the neurons into this what we call the interstitial space or the space between neurons as it builds up in the interstitial space it eventually migrates out into these glimpatic channels, but for the most part the fluid has a lot of capacity to build up before it starts to really drain.

01:12:10

When we are devoting most of our metabolic activity to thinking and to executing actions during the day. Our neurons are. Taking up most of that energy and can actually swell to a certain degree and the space between the neurons can also swell full of that interstitial fluid that's that's building up these byproducts of oxidative metabolism.

01:12:36

And it turns out that when we go to sleep and nighttime this is when now the glial cells can start their pumping action to create a gradient of flow. To remove this fluid and probably some of it involves the movement of cilia these are small tiny flatulate or like little arms and the surface of the cell that pause fluid to move in a certain direction and that's a very energy intensive activity to have ciliary movement, can I?

01:13:14

Have some confusion over neuroanatomy that I I would really love to ask about so um, so so I so I have I've often heard that you know, so that we've gray matter and we have white matter and in the explanation as that the the gray matters on the the outside or the surface and then the white matter is the the axon axon the fibers that track long distance, so yeah the axon might be the the body of a neuron I guess and it might go from the grey matter in your.

01:13:49

In your brain all the way down to your toes and you know and in one possible instance but then but then I but then if you look if you say well what are what are glial cells and and people say well so glio cells are or glia are and it says like if you've liked the heart of gray matter in the brain which is made up of cells named called neurons, but unless we don't type of brain cells what makes up bite matter and so now that they're like and they're like saying, okay, no glio cells are the white matter and I'm like what wait what like wait is it at our white matter the axon or is white matter glial so it's could you clarify that yeah.

01:14:25

And so there's like astrocytes oh look at your sites microglia. I'm forgetting one I think but the at least in the central nervous system that what makes up biblia is the oligodendrocytes so one of those types of. What makes up the myelin is those oligodendrocytes one of those types of Guilla?

01:14:48

So Milan is the in sheep as responsible for the in sheep thing of the axon. So if you think about like, A regenerative signal amount. So myelin allows sort of the the action potential, you know, this is all within like one minute to milliseconds or so that this sort of action potential conduction velocity is increased in most cases by by having that mile and around it.

01:15:20

So to answer your question, the white matter is axons in sheath by Oligodendrocytes in the brain and then outside of the brain it's Schwann cells, but they're they're basically to. Doing the same thing. There's some differences. Okay, so does that mean that a glial cell because it's from so someone might hear that and they might think well the glial cell is the it is the myelin but but it's not right.

01:15:48

It's so it is. One type of wheel, so let's just restrict this to the in the brain. One type of wheel saw the o logo dendrite is literally in the axons. So so that's the white matter. So the if you're looking at a white matter tract, you're looking at axons and sheets by glial cells and it it's I guess whiter because there's the glial cells wrapping itself around it the the axon making it more insulated.

01:16:16

Okay, because okay because I thought so I so does that mean that that like how large is the glial cell and it basically like are we talking about like like thousands of wheel cells on a single axon or or or what? Yeah, so in the brain and jump in a correct case I'm wrong but uh pretty sure in the brain you have so if you take a look at one oligodendrocyte, you'll see it kind of stretch out multiple arms and inches axons from different neurons, however, you're going to also have if you follow one axon multiple oligodendrocytes and she think different parts of that ox on so it's very much like every everybody's touching everybody else kind of thing based on its space that's going through.

01:17:07

Okay, okay, so yeah, so I mean, I guess I had the naive idea that that the myelin was sort of like a waxy substance. I didn't realize it was actually the elder site. Yeah it is only a dentist right but it's not like totally crazy to think of it as a waxy substance.

01:17:23

It's not always substance but the part that's doing the entry thing. It is the a part of the oligodendrocyte is doing the interesting thing and the reason it's so good at insulating insulating the axon is because the the outside of the cell is is a lipid membrane so that lipid membrane is is going to help like insulate it in a way, you know, like like sort of waxy and in a way because it's non-conductive.

01:17:54

They're non-conductive so it's it's kind of creating sort of I guess more less leak or more resistance on that outside part of the cell, super cool, thank you.

01:18:10

Oh hi shunt. I was searching for following up with a glimpse added type on the on the Google I remember read that this article. I mean, it's basically my bookmark list that lives by this doctor at a Washington University's Franklin Falls in the so the title of the paper is the cleansing power of a deep nice sleep and a it just to address one of my popular like practical question that the the frequency of the waves this is.

01:18:45

This seems to is confirms that a this function the cleansing function of this circulation of food is only for the deep sleep, right so it's debate that the the what it called the what's the slowest this is the data delta wave so there's this arm and off like like per second frequency is that correct he came from that yeah sure so yeah delta wave is generally the slowest waveform so you see, you know wonder.

01:19:20

Three hurts or cycles actually is not big enough for cleansing our brain is a resetting yeah actually REM sleep is is no different from being away from stuff that you're just asleep it's a very metabolically active time and uses a lot of energy in your cognitive circuits so it probably contributes to more accumulation of the byproducts of oxidative metabolism, but when you go when you fall back at around sleep, It into stage three and then stage really stage four of sleep of slowly sleep is when the delta activity kicks in and that's a very slow pattern of sleep and that's when they go emphatic system really optimally does its job.

01:20:15

I see the ice cream that you eat most of course you mentioned the. Melatonin right so there's a for me. I mean, I for a person that I in a mess of 40's that a is so not you mentioned the age of 65 one the this this melatonin function will decrease but however recently is it because the last pattern for you know workout from home that a I start to notice.

01:20:54

I mean, I'm very successful to I mean television. Keeping a time of one of my sleep patterns right it never happened to me that we wish happened to me in the last almost four months now every day. I mean, I didn't notice any, you know stress I just like even you know, because I'm reviewing my old like a install like, you know, I only get like a very sharply I will wake up no matter one night go into three.

01:21:29

I'll wake up like four hours like it's like a clockwork. I don't know what happens and then usually if I woke up due to some noises at night. I you know the draws in this world could be back to sleep right away but now it's very strange. I guess I'll be your you're not alone.

01:21:53

Frank, you know, I'm seeing this in my clinic. I think the fact that we're you know in one year we had a pandemic global economic meltdown and the craziest elections in history of anybody. Is alive, you know from the stress levels are are extremely high for everybody even people who are not necessarily consciously aware of their stress levels, so that's that's one thing to consider but then you know, there are other physiological things that are happening, you know.

01:22:29

Everybody should consider anybody's having difficulty sleeping occupancy or the possibility that they may be dealing with sleep apnea. And this is a so common for me to seeing clinic and it's so common for people to deny that they could possibly be suffering for sleep apnea it's it's a really interesting disconnect but aptly as a condition that causes people to lose the ability to breathe properly during sleep.

01:22:57

And you know, if you're if you're working a sedentary job and you're not getting a ten thousand steps in walking a day and you're not exercising properly probably your palate is getting a little bit soft and blocking off your airway, you know folks sitting around working on computers all day the muscle tone gets a little bit weak and then when you go to bed at nighttime, you live flat in your back suddenly, the air was getting blocked off.

01:23:27

And so this main manifest is snoring the main manifest is having heartburn at nighttime or being restless in bed it can manifest as just waking up in the morning feeling very fatigued and washed out it can manifest as having these irregular. Middle of the night wakings that sometimes are a company by sense of panic or heart racing but not necessarily I mean just wake up and can't get back to sleep and and all of those because your brain is trying to protect you from dying in your sleep from lack of oxygen because you're not breathing.

01:24:08

So I can use it. I just saw a patient this week. I can use it as an example. 67 year old man who is developing mild cognitive impairment. He is getting a large belly. It's not exercised. You eating a lot of sugar. It's inflammatory markers are very high and it's just washed out in fatigue and we did a polysomnogram which is a fancy way of saying sleep study.

01:24:35

And we found that at most he was sleeping four hours per night, it was very broken sleep and he was not going into the deep stages of sleep the slow wave sleep at all. He would get a little bit of REM sleep, but it wasn't much either. And so here he was thinking he was spending eight hours in bed sleeping when in reality he was getting probably around four hours of sleep and he was getting no time at all in that restful recuperative stage asleep.

01:25:09

When the Glenn Frederick system to turn on and clear out the debris from the brain. So when we track this back about three years ago is when he started getting more fatigue and tired, so he was just about turning 65 and. I see this probably four or five times a week in my clinic.

01:25:29

People who have the exact same story and the basically what's going on is that the pineal gland is burning out and it's just not producing melatonin the weight off to. And so it's sets off this cascade of altered sleep cycles and then when people get tired they don't work out, they don't stay on top of their nutrients the way that they ought to and it's official cycle that if it's not, you know, stopped to lead to premature strokes heart attacks out.

01:26:00

The disease and death at a young age. So and when I say sixties is young that's because I take care of patients all the way up to their hundredths commonly. So, I hope that gives you a perspective there. Alright, thanks. I mean, by the way, I mean, I happen here.

01:26:21

I don't think I have that up because I keep up the regular like I actually quite intense like swimming like, you know competitive style so twice a week. I don't think I have got it but I'll look I mean, definitely that's very good pointers. I mean, especially melatonin. I think there's probably some kind of what you're the cooperative like with the eating or diver.

01:26:47

I'm looking to that yeah, you may want to also contemplate. If the idea that you're sure tonal levels might be low serotonin is very important for initiation and maintenance of sleep and with increase levels of stress and that could be physiological stress also. So if you're inactive swimmer, I see this with my professional athletes that I take care of that often times, they'll be pushing themselves hard and then they will not be producing enough serotonin to keep up with the demands and that can also.

01:27:19

To create the sleep cycles. So an easy fix there would be to increase the amount of. Serotonin producing substances in your diet. My favorite go-to is called Sam E which stands for as a democrat mean. It's a great natural supplement that helps to improve your serotonin production. It's super.

01:27:43

Yeah, thanks. Sure. I will say that I why y'all were talking I I looked up to I looked up Parkinson's disease see if new protein synthesis is suppressed and in fact that is what the recent research is of 2020 is saying in several different articles, which is really fascinating because I just guessed.

01:28:09

And it thought it's actually the fact and then they're also connecting it. So there's a paper I guess I should say it's um, let's do the reference the references paper. There's a bunch of articles if you just look for the topic but the paper is a it's called ribose so I'm all protein S15 plus for relation mediates LRK2 neuro degeneration in Parkinson's disease.

01:28:36

And. Yeah, that's really interesting that basically you know, so there we have the the ribosome mentioned again, right? I and new protein synthesis inhibited now in both Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's disease. We're we're solving the not just kidding. You know, it's very interesting because sugar might be the factor in both the diseases.

01:29:04

So Michael that's a good point the large cheep protein which involves I think the elves pay which releasing is they're very important for production of energy in the cells and if you think about. For enough you've touched on this and the other conversations but but autophagy is the mechanism by which cells digest themselves and recycle their material.

01:29:33

So the nitrogen carbon etc all the different constituents elements that make up cells for the cell dies and goes through what's called apoptosis. It gets recycled through this process of autophagy or autophagy. And the lark2 protein plays a very important role in that autophagy and when that gene gets mutated, it can really cause problems or cells and for the normal proteins that this is fasting by the way is a great way to induce autophagy and.

01:30:12

It creates a you know by creating a caloric stress in fasting beyond 16 hours it turns on a really beneficial. Chain reaction of clearance of cells that are functioning or precancerous or even cancerous cells. So I think that we're probably seen down the road that data comes out that tells us that faster is not only good for cardiovascular disease and stroke but also good for Parkinson's disease.

01:30:49

I mitigation or what it's worth but but again it comes down to this large two protein and synthesis. So yeah, good good fine there. I'm really, So I have a hypothesis that I want to throw at the group and and anyone could try to chime in but what it is.

01:31:09

So so, you know we saw So basically yeah, the question is why does why does the inflammation results in so many different kinds of symptoms? It's almost like people have said that information is a mother of disease in terms of like it can it it's there before, you know, so many other possible diseases happen.

01:31:35

It's like a precursor to so many different branches of disease. And I mean, I guess I guess the biggest example of the past year was was perhaps was Copa 19 in terms of you know cove in 19. Information playing a big role in that. And I can describe it.

01:31:54

I I posted an article about it, but basically the way, Sort of the route is that Cove 19 is virus and used to self-replicate to perpetuate its existence. So it has to attach other cells and it attaches with the with a couple of receptors one of them is the ace to another one was the CD-147 Spike protein.

01:32:17

But the ACE2 is the big one. So the ACE2 was it's it's an enzyme that's attached to the outer surface of cell membranes in the in the lungs and the heart and the the arteries and the heart the kidney the intestines all throughout the vasculature system. Receptors in your NDO lining of cells, like basically, you know, everywhere in your blood vessels and your cells and so there's like an ample waves for this virus to find targets to replicate itself.

01:32:48

And so the NDL the other lining of of cells is a particular particularly big target both in and blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. And what happens is the AC receptors because the virus uses them to insert itself into the cell the AC receptors get degraded and that that basically throws a wrench and the angiotensin system because you need to have you ever your ace one receptors or causing vassal constriction in your AC2 receptors, or causing vassal delay dilation and you have to have a balance between the two.

01:33:28

That's the energy system. If there's too many ACE 108s too, you're gonna have too much construction or too much faster violation. And and so the so this this is so this you know, I guess the way I. I understand it is that you know, when when that when when the the degradation of the industry the lining is not just a matter of reducing the the is2 receptors because so now that the the vent the blood vessels want to constrict right but it's also a matter of degrading the actual tissue so so so then you know in you know, I guess fluid can leak through like an in the case of you know, what happens in the lungs.

01:34:07

I guess that's a part of what's happening is is. You know, the, The the what maybe the cell walls are breaking and influence is is filling up the lungs and something like that but um, but part of it is like, you know, the the the process of oxidative stress the part of the process of free radicals, you know attacking your body and destroying your body just like I like I am picturing and and I maybe this is wrong but that that it's it's kind of like free radicals are like little chainsaws, you know, like and they're just like shredding your your your tissue right and so you need to combat them with with them.

01:34:48

With with with antioxidants and and this could be wrong so I like I'm definitely like saying this out loud these these things that I think that might be wrong so that you go folks can respond to me and and tell me what where I need to correct money on my thinking on this and then so we have the oxidative stress happening which is basically like a like free radicals a bit but in this case, it's the it's the the degradation of the ace to receptors in the degradation of the end of the lining via that process and and so and so so so maybe so a possible thing.

01:35:23

You know is I've in my article I said, well, maybe robust could be a way to to deal with with oxidative stress but but I mean, maybe not um and someone else later on this a doctor can you was came up with the idea of using NAC he's this guy this kind of you to visit any seas and acetal system because it's it's has it's basically it really releases it helps your body to create glutath glutathione, which is a very powerful.

01:35:55

Antioxidant and so that's much better it dealing with oxidative stress but by going back to basically like yeah, so oxidative stress is perhaps like a precursor to when we're getting to to inflammation and and in addition to like, you know, when you're when you're shredding the cells, you're also releasing things that are supposed to not be released like von Willebrand's factor and other thrombosis factors and that those can lead to a blood clot so we've blood we have blood vessel constriction and we have blood clots and so then you know, the media we're like well, why is this like we thought this will?

01:36:30

Was something that was just causing it like people couldn't breathe and we don't understand why why people are getting heart attacks and strokes and and so now yeah if this thing is like infecting the lymphatic system and it's effect infecting the blood vessels and this is like all old news down right but well then then but why why why is it um, and then here and then here we have basically this story of inflammation?

01:36:53

Again it's like why are there so many different patient reactions to this and I think it goes back to like why are there so many different patient reactions to information like why did like why is it that you know you know I guess depression could be caused by a metabolic disorder but but sometimes, you know stimulate giving the brain a lot of stimulation helps a lot and and so that's so that means that there's another way that the depression can be caused, you know make so maybe it's like they have too much trauma but they have plenty of good metalloism and they interpret their producing too much information and so like here so getting really to the heart of my question.

01:37:26

I'd love for you to correct all everything. With the heart of my question is like and heart of the hypothesis is like I think that you know that the reason inflammation is causing different kinds of diseases in in different people has to do with where the inflammation is the greatest like if it's if the inflammation is happening in in the lungs the greatest and the chances of RDS would be greatest for that for that patient if the information is happening.

01:37:54

You know in in you know, maybe near the brain stem I'm not exactly sure where maybe the the chance of depression is the greatest it was happening in the vasculature system the chance of a heart attack is the greatest especially the heart if it's happening, so I'll stop there.

01:38:14

Up a lot of really interesting ideas there and a lot of food for thought think that you're on the right track with everything. I would like to invite everybody here to join us next Monday at the neuro nation club, we're gonna be talking about coronavirus and brain and I think that you know, what you touched on with the in acetyl system was really compelling this has been something that I've prescribed for years for my patients because it's such an effective.

01:38:44

Antioxidant and there's really good evidence that anesthetical system or neck as we sometimes call it actually helps to improve frontal lobe function, especially in people who are dealing with neurodegenerative disorders or obsessive compulsive disorder and other similar kinds of problems so really interesting idea. I tend to prefer. Natural supplement called proteandum, which is actually causes your cells to generate its own glutathione at a greater rate than normal.

01:39:17

So it's really a novel in interesting approved to. Get your cells to behave in a more protected fashion. I think with what really is fascinating about coronavirus is taught us so much and you're definitely on the right track in terms of the idea of inflammation being a highly conserved and broad spectrums pathological state.

01:39:43

Is that when it comes to chronovirus one of the things that that I've been seeing at least clinically and I think a lot of other neurologists are seen is that it really is a brain disorder almost more than anything else. And you could just kind of stop and say unbiased being a brain doctor but the truth is that when you get down to it so much of what we're seeing happening in the body and the lungs and heart perform vascular system relates back to disregulation at the level of the brain.

01:40:13

So the autonomic nervous system which comprises the parasympathetic in your sympathetic nervous system. Are the parts of the nervous system that govern how much adrenaline is being dumped into the bloodstream. How much cortisol is being poured into the bloodstream? It governs your heart rate your blood pressure your breathing rate.

01:40:38

And so what we're seeing when when people get infected with chrono virus and it works through its different stages of eventually people develop this uncoupling or this disregulation of the sympathetic nervous system and you get this massive outflow of adrenaline which then leads. To increased sharing forces on the line of the blood vessels and unnecessary damage and disruption of the empathy.

01:41:06

So not only do you have a direct viral effect on the endothelium, but now you have the secondary degradation of endothelial integrity. Which then really leads a lot of capillary permeability and flooding the lungs flooding that you know, heart tissue with fluid that is hard to get rid of.

01:41:27

There's really some interesting data to come out recently that's showing us that when somebody develops kind of virus in an invades the brain through the olfactory nerves in the front of the brain, right you're you know, these two nerves that dangle down at the front in the basis of brain right under the frontal load is called the olfactory nurse and when people lose their sense of smell it's because the viruses essentially infected that nerve tissue and it's crawling back through those nerves and making them dysfunctional but where do those viruses end up they crawl right up into the basil forebrain into?

01:42:02

Frontal lobes and they spread across the base of the frontal loads into the temporal lobes and then the brain stem and cerebellum. So if we do in these nuclear imaging studies like a pet scanner respect scan or functional MRI, we can actually see that in a lot of people with chrono virus even people with low grade supposedly asymptomatic cases.

01:42:25

That the parts of the brain that controll anxiety and memory and that control our behavior patterns are essentially being turned off because of this inflammation it's occurring in the basal for brain and temporal lobes. And so what I'm seeing now down the road people have been affected three six, nine 12 months ago.

01:42:46

Is there developing these cognitive? Disorders fibromyalgia type pictures, even what looks like early on said Alzheimer's disease and some folks. So you're really kind of keying on a really important thing here, which is that the dysfunction that we're seeing which is so broad spread has a lot to do with induction of the inflammatory system and a an overexpression of inflammatory mediators that are then causing secondary damage to.

01:43:23

Helium, but also to the nervous system itself. So I agree and that's still sitting is important but check out vitamin D. I think you'll find that probably as much as we're dealing with a viral pandemic we're also dealing with a pandemic of deficiency of vitamin D vitamin D is a very important neuro hormone that controls a thousand different genes in our body and when we're deficient in vitamin D it allows an overexpression of inflammation and so nowadays when somebody, Neat gets really sick with corner virus, we're actually loading them up the vitamin D to try to get control over that inflammatory system.

01:44:07

So our what about this proteandom? PROTAN BIM. That's really to me, this is such a fascinating product because it it I think it's signals the beginning of the legitimization of nutrients as medication. Which is a little sad because if you go back to the roots of medicine and hippocrates and he taught us that we should let our food be our medicine and our medicine beer food, but modern healthcare really kind of doesn't make it easy for doctors to be big advocates for proper nutrition.

01:44:54

So that has fallen by the wayside but, The researchers around the 1998 '99 who were 30 interested in this idea of oxidative metabolism discovered that they could use a blend of a number of different natural, you know ingredient turmeric and I don't know what they are handful of other spices essentially that when you combine them in the right proportion would actually significantly decrease the biomarkers for oxidative stress in the body.

01:45:31

And so it turns out that what they were. Modulating was a an important gene region called the nuclear factor Kappa which is a highly conserved segment of DNA that regulates inflammation. So when you modulate this with what's called NRF1 or NRF2, specifically NRF2 the modulates this region that's if you don't suppress it creates widespread inflammation when you do something.

01:46:11

It normalizes inflammation and so this. Protandim product kind of did key things number wanted to suppress this inflammatory region number two it induces the natural production of glutathione at a much higher rate than normal so busy and antioxidant effect as well. And what really caught my eye and keep in mind.

01:46:34

I'm an allopathic physician. I prescribe medications. I believe medications can be very helpful for people if they're used wisely. But when they should be the data that this natural supplement was actually more effective at reducing inflammation than a medication that had just been cleared by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, they're really caught my eye and I thought this is really fascinating.

01:47:03

So a lot of doctors have started to use. That particular product to help normalize inflammation in people who have conditions on you know, different medical conditions in you know, it's it's not FDA approved to treat anything but if you think about how our bodies function there's two versions of us right there's the salad and water version of us and then there's the crispy cream.

01:47:33

Dunkin Donuts soda version of us in what you put in your body does have a big impact on how it functions. So I think, This is such a an exciting, you know product and this kind of paved the way for a lot of other what we call nutraceuticals which are pharmacological grade nutrients that actually do have a predictable effect in modulating the human body.

01:48:00

They kind of have like a general question about the current state of medical practice. So I would think of vitamin D if doctors are prescribing that to to covet patients is my guess is that is it vitamin D addresses inflammation for most. Um, does it also address oxidative stress?

01:48:24

And okay and then uh, oh sure yeah. I guess I was gonna say that the side question is are doctors actually also and along with vitamin D actually mentioning protandim to to patients or no.

01:48:43

To cope with patients. I mean like broadly. You know, I'm not aware of anybody that would recommend protein or any other nutrient as a treatment for coronavirus just because we really don't have the evidence that would say that anything like that is effective, you know. So it's one thing to prescribe something as a treatment with the understanding that it's going to create a cure.

01:49:13

It's another thing to recommend a lifestyle change that will create favorable conditions for better health. So, I think there it's important to make that distinction because what we don't want to do is engage in quackery and you know start to get off into the weeds. I you know, I, you know, if somebody asked me well would you recommend that a person ten feet underwater be given oxygen?

01:49:42

I would say well, of course, you know, if you deprive that person of oxygen, they're not gonna last more than that's right same kind of thing here if somebody is sick with a viral illness. I'm gonna want them the best possible set up for success to fight it and so a big part of that includes making sure that they have the proper nutrients on board to create all of the different.

01:50:09

Proteins and substances that they need to fight off an infection so my so my question then would be like so is the current medical profession is is is there's a consensus that inflammations a major component of treating treating information component of treating coronavirus patients, but treating oxidative stress is not a major component of treating coronavirus patients.

01:50:35

I kind of disagree. I mean, I do think that treatment oxidative stress is important. That's right because in a way that oxidative stress actually helps to kill the virus, you know, just like it would help to kill any invasive bacteria that we get in your bloodstream but too much oxidative stress then can backfire and damage your own cells and lead to unnecessary tissue pathology.

01:51:05

So you know it's it's it's a balance but if you think about what's going on with Corona virus, we know that there's this explosion of inflammatory proteins in the bloodstream and massive oxidative damage downstream from there, so to the extent that we can get that under control and then the systemic inflammatory response can be modulated and beneficial way, so maybe my understanding was incorrect, but but I thought that the you know, the way that the path was actually like the Kobe 19 attacks the H2 receptors damages the end of the dealer lining of Cells which is the point at which oxidative stresses happening the later on down the line inflammation is happening is is that incorrect?

01:51:52

I mean the inflammation takes place from the very moment of our since the bloodstream it just if you think about it what happens downstream if you've got several lines of defense if the virus gets through the first line of defense and then the second line has to be invoked then that leads to much more dramatic release of inflammatory mediators which then can lead to secondary tissue damage, so it extent that you can keep it.

01:52:25

To the first line of defense by making sure that you've got enough vitamin D on board and that you've got good health and that your own natural inflammatory system is already under control. Then that can prevent the virus from getting through that first line of defense to the second line of defense, which is where we think that all the damage relationship take place.

01:52:45

So it sounds like the medical profession as at large might agree that oxidative stress is a major part of the the disease process of starscope too, but they would not prescribe something to treat oxidative stress at this point because right is that correct? I don't know. I think it depends on who you're talking to.

01:53:06

There are there are doctors who will I mean, we give steroids, for example, you know steroids are very powerful it reducing inflammation and an oxidative stress. So those are the big guns. So yeah, I think it's fair to say that that we are using different things but it's a it's a process, right?

01:53:32

We've we still haven't figured out the entire recipe that that guarantees, you know, good outcome. It's it's still under construction. Okay, I have some confusion about basically the process of so inflammation is associated with RDS but so is so is the the degraded antiothe lining and so I wonder which one is the bigger factor to causing causing RDS is it the the decimation of of the cell line or information?

01:54:09

Is the you know disruption of the integrity of the end of the limb and then that's just made worse by the secondary release of inflammatory mediators and adrenaline adrenaline plays a big role. So there's a neural hormonal this regulation that takes place later on in the illness because you're getting this invasive effect in the brain and so.

01:54:37

You know, where where maybe inflammation of the endothelium might have been manageable this secondary wave of damage then just as the second punch that puts people over the edge. Cool. I'll pause for a second if anyone else's questions. And if you're in if you're down below, if you want to speak just raise your hand.

01:55:18

Hey shall not have a quick question be so you probably at the beginning you mentioned that the your working on some devices, can you recap what what does and what kind of is it will each related?

01:55:35

Frankie I'm currently not working on any projects. I I've launched a number of and participated in the development of a number of different biomedical products over the years. I think the the one that I'm watching with the most interest is the cerebellum. Just because I've been waiting for a long time for a low-cost portable EEG to come under the market.

01:55:57

I think I'm really interested in that because I feel like I have a certain demographic that I take care of in my patients, it's the would like to.

01:56:12

I you may have cut out they're looking for any pathology, but just. Cut up yeah just for a minute and if you want to repeat your lessons. Yes, so some of my patients are interested in using. EEG to assess their own cognitive performance not looking for any pathology, but just understanding how well they're frontal loads are functioning at any one time, so I'm excited about that product there.

01:56:46

Well high at extra but welcome to the stage this is a newer nation and a regular clubhouse event with the doctor more as amor and the doctor mica and I noticed that you're more expert on the laughter. I think yeah so welcome yeah, well I'm just asking you know, some of the or what as the newer certain of what he's he's perspective from, you know, technology and a consumer like, Devices he recommended this cerebellum is up correct, so see our r i.

01:57:32

Yeah yes c r i v e l l cerebell.com great great device. I'm really impressed with the way they put this together but FDA clearance for looking for patients with non-convulsive seizures, so it is possible to have a seizure without having any actual motor manifestations to call that non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is a real problem because you know, these folks will generally just look like they're unconscious maybe that they're sleeping when in reality their brain is cooking away with a bad seizures, so.

01:58:07

It's pretty exciting concept but done I hate to stay up and I'm gonna have to duck out folks. I'm gonna try to turn on my glimplattic system now and clear out some of the debris that I built up here talking this yeah.

01:58:34

Wow that was just great it's fantastic well we could reset the room it's this is the neurophysics nerve gear happy hour vibrations in oscillations, you can bring up any topic as long as it's in some proximity to this topic. No but yeah. Welcome everybody. Just to say I'm waking up from a nap.

01:58:58

I've been working super super hard and I just woken up for like two hours but when you ping me into the room, it looks so good. I couldn't refuse so just so that's why I stepped up but I'm not gonna say anything for a bit. I have yeah. I've lose the coffee.

01:59:13

Jamaican teeth brush. Yeah I had I have to say that for me that conversation with Sean was just incredible. I was so pleased to mix done through this to me, don't ping me into room or someone goes okay folks good night thanks no. I mean, I was really good.

01:59:33

I think I think the room was gonna go for another, you know, three hours maybe but we'll see hopefully and I'm let me make Dexter I'm gonna make you and call make you moderators and just so that perhaps you can invite some some folks so we can keep this going.

01:59:51

As easy this is not my this room is not part of any club. I'm not trying to grow any sort of club. But my objective here is just have good conversation, so let me me also ping some folks. Well I'm at it yeah just yeah yeah grateful if you could just like yeah, well what brand you about what Sean has said had to say.

02:00:22

Um, am I so am I gone yeah okay, so I it was incredible so we taught so so Sean is hosting something on Monday, which is about corner virus in the brain because he's a brain doctor. But we we talked all about basically the well I so I so I I wrote about the the process of of how the carnivores affects the human body and and and why it attacks all over the place and and he said I was and I talked about you know, the role of information not roll of oxidative stress and he said I was right on with a lot of a lot of it with basically everything and but then I but then I also had a lot of gaps so I was like, okay well, so what's the with RDS, what's the big?

02:01:08

Deal is the information or is it that degradation of the end of the lining? And and so I got an answer yeah I definitely is the the bigger of the two factors is the degradation of of the of the cells that's what releases the fluid and that seems obvious right and the inflammation is is sort of secondary in terms of like they're gonna be a whole bunch of people in the room who have no idea they're what you're talking about but yeah, okay seems obvious yeah and right and like it right respect the same obvious but it's weird it's like before four hands it that I was as it wasn't obvious yes, no, no.

02:01:45

I I think you're right when did you try and Accountize this. Um, so the original article that I wrote was back in April. If you can. April of last year, yeah 20/20. Wow this is a real coincidence because that's when I was working on covered 19 stuff. I basically spent about a month and a half trying to figure it out well the thing so what's so in my in my article I'm I mentioned that we need to treat inflammation and we need to treat oxidative stress and so I mentioned, you know, before you go to the doctor you want to make sure you're getting your dribose and your vitamin D and your antioxidants and your zinc and I'm also mentioned vitamin C because the body depletes a lot of vitamin C fighting environments.

02:02:35

And then after about the article I found out that about something called NAC, which is which helps increase the glutathione production or powerful antioxidant and in the human body and and then one thing that I got out of this was really valuable was was that he mentioned. He managed to something that's even better than NAC, which is this product called Protandim which is like a natural right this down so so NAC.

02:03:06

Protein does people system, right yeah and I'll say so systems but in theory, but so but that increases your your glutathione production in this other thing does it even better so I don't know that you need both. Those two different one increases intracellular to find the other is intercellular and you want to increase your thyme in the cells because you're trying to come back radical oxygen species damn that's the that thank you for that nuance wow the knowledge that you contribute texture is just a major contribution, thank you, oh everything's interesting, you know, so yeah, I had that.

02:03:58

Scratched my head to do exactly exactly the same way because the trial had been filed now on. The efficacy of an NEC and they've been really disappointing no one quite understood why but I figured that would be the case and so yeah, I was a friend mine was working on this and I had my answer ready to email her I was like let me know how those trials go but yeah it was underwhelming but yeah, it's really inside the cell that you need of course so so so you're aware of any of the trials and you found out that they were underwhelming it wasn't people people had this hypothesis, they tested it, it didn't work the way they hoped.

02:04:34

But everyone everyone sold this has gonna be of course the most effective way of basically eliminating NADPH and other yeah, I'm reactive oxygen species and the end point is to increase by superoxide discontinues that's basically your sort of mass well inclusive times the final admaster antioxidant but in the endothelium as regards cells, it's the discontinues that you want, so that was the theory again there's no reason why it shouldn't have worked but no.

02:05:09

One would app. Actually look to see exactly where it was being increased by people just look at serum measures but but yeah, it was underwhelming just to say it's one study but in any case it's it's found in clinic in general just not to you it's not turned out to be the sort of well no one no one thinks so silver bullet but it's efficacy has been generally low but yet clinically we now have a pretty good idea as to why?

02:05:37

Okay so so unit so um, so protandim is gonna do intracellular the do you already know that so um, I do not know basically yeah we were looking at something else which does the same thing but I don't know what this is so I'll take a look at how do you spell it?

02:05:57

PRO TAN DIM.

02:06:04

Yeah, so I was just looking for tri I'm looking at trials right now to see if there's a trial for. Copenhagen and for tandem, oh yeah and so um your idea of this was around basically eliminating oxidative stress in the vascular endothelium because you see like inflammation and oxygen stress is being like hand in hand as the kind of like a like a favorable male for the virus to basically replicate them for the fire load to increase kind of radical thing is that right now.

02:06:45

So so it comes back to like, you know, I was thinking I was thinking about like, um, so there's something that I don't understand which which may have caused me to have this hypothesis but I don't understand really the relationship between free radicals and and antioxidants are so so I guess one idea that I have is a free radical is like a bunch of chainsaws that are floating around and destroying cell tissue in that in the antioxidants or are flying around and capturing these chainsaws and red.

02:07:20

Land during the neutral or something and then threaten them they get disposed of the body but that sounds it's probably wrong but what do you think well that's the classic idea the passive idea is like oxygen's bad oxidants get rid of oxidants side effects the I'm no expert right?

02:07:37

I just picked this up just because like so many other people it's like one to understand yeah, you know one to understand it and see if just the whatever background. I had kind of might be useful it's more the case there's a redox right so oxygen is used basically to yeah oxygen is essential in any case for metabolic processes, but it's also toxic and so there's like a redox converting the products of basically it's consumption back into kind of yeah, basically you have this thing it's basically a redox mechanism which keeps a balance.

02:08:30

You don't want to stress more or less but I'm no expert but it's not it's not like you know oxidization bad antioxidant panacea it's more just the balance which is in the redox between one and the other and and many things in many metabolic processes work that way by the way, so like nitric oxide is the same especially in the vascular endothelium is that the generation of nitric oxide enables it enables factor dilation, it is an entity.

02:09:05

But produced in two greater quantity compromises the vascular barrier and that's when you get micro pulmonary leakage and some of the yeah fatal like sepsis like downstream effects of coded 19, but generally exceptions come from basically this disregulation of nitric oxide so many things are like that but I'm not an expert on antioxidants, unfortunately.

02:09:34

I was scared away by how much everything was said to be an ante that was met antioxidant was said to be wonderful and, So I was like hmm. I'm not sure but yeah, it's basically the redox you want to a balance. So we had this so so going back to what the idea was it was that I thought well maybe because so so so that stars could be two was causing the degradation of the end of the lining and and that was similar to to oxidative stress and that the free radicals might be damaging nerve tissue and producing some people, you know, I think you're right for what it's worth right, um, but um, I'm really interested like your background is kind of broad but what um, Yeah what caused you to kind of attend to understand this such a level and very early days right there was like very very thin information on the ground at that point yeah no, I mean so like so so for example, I did a podcast so I did the neural podcast with a friend of mine who who runs like Andal which is a it he basically he created a like a peptide that was a pet that was designed to be a the first vaccine for covenant 19.

02:10:58

In and and so he has he's very suspicious about why he was shut down but but in any case like I so like and then I've also like so because I did I basically in 2012 because I did dedicate the focus of the rest of my life to three to solving three things three technologies, basically one is nerve gear and then the other two are artificial brain tissue and the third one is artificial brains and so so that is basically what I dedicated my life to and that's that's why.

02:11:33

I. I got it to a conversation with the sky from like Gandalf back in the in 2017 about what what I was trying to explain some of my ideas of how cognition works and I tried to you know, I basically we got into a discussion where we began to talk about the different commit networks of communication in the brain and and I was most interested in and what?

02:12:03

And what I learned would be called the ionotropic brain because he is much more interested in like we glial signaling and so that was a big part of our conversation anyway that was all recorded and so people can listen to that in earliest podcast if they want to and yeah.

02:12:19

And so how did you get so sorry my question is more how did you end up learning so much about two and that yeah that pathogenesis like yeah, I'm just curious because we have some really important that's how I. Mean I so I I throw my my brain around like a hammerhead shark at every concept that I can find and so I so I ended up at some point at a using my press pass as a journalist to get into a conference that was about cancer and amino.

02:12:55

I mean immune immunology treatments and especially using Cartesy cells and and so on and there was I was just like immediately overwhelmed in that conference with like, you know with stuff that was like way above my head at the time that at the conference, but but I really caught on quick and so that.

02:13:14

Like so when the when Kobe 19 happened and that's how everyone talking I was like, oh why I know what this is and and so like I started having deep into everything.

02:13:35

Okay, sorry about that this little conjecture about the exact kind of infective process and how that leads to endothelial damage basically but I think there's kind of a clearer and clearer picture so the first thing about coded 19 was everyone just assumed that it was a you know, that it was you know personas that it was a respiratory condition right sung to the lungs, it's kind of it's so bad what I hear in my voice is.

02:14:10

I hear RRRRR voice doing it gets in the lungs it does a hell of a number on him, um, that's not the case right so basically in in April March April, but really April the first autopsy started to come out where you had patience with fully compliant lungs as you say not much like Abiola pulmonary damage, but massive microvascular damage masculine sister systemic damage, so that was the big mystery this is not like of course you have like run fibrosis, but you look it's not like a classic viral influenza and So that started meat on the plants of looking at it from the same perspective as you have done and it sounds like yeah the guy that you were just interviewing that basically you're looking at the damage to the yet the systemic faster but also also particularly has concerns the brain microvascular damage and what results from that and there are lots of theories about about you know about that, but certainly, Hmm oxidative stress and super oxidation is involved in all of them the questions, how does that arise, right?

02:15:27

I so I believe I answered that question in an article in in basically in 2020 and so if you look at my most recent Twitter posts, it's too late and medium link you can see that article right now so you just click on my profile and click on Twitter and then click on the the thing I just posted which is a medium article and you know, I'll write it as about stars.

02:15:54

Cove to and I'll just paste. I'm just gonna tweet it again, but this time with the title um, and then so like if you look at it basically I walk you through it really quick yeah, please look like we lost one of our speakers but um, so okay, so the so the idea real quick was the the main attack factors it's basically like the virus itself replicates so it needs to attach other cells and there's two main ways that attach those cells one is to eat the main way is the aceto receptor and the secondary way is with the CD147.

02:16:27

Receptor or enzyme so the so the ace to is actually an enzyme it's part of the antigen system it's on the outer layer of of cell cell membranes it was interesting that you said that the there's a any review there's a balance between antioxidants and antifree radicals there's an ante there's a bounce between ace two and ace one ace is two will cause vasodilation ace one will cause vassal constriction.

02:16:59

I think. To an animal to. That's right, that's right. I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess I guess I was just you know, I guess it's spelled ACE to and that's why I was pronouncing it. I used a short version yeah show so I I understand okay and for and your tension converting enzyme.

02:17:25

I yes but it's actually what ends up the basically in the blood which is the angiotense is typically abbreviated to like ang2, but yes basically yeah yeah yeah agreed um, and so the any of you know aligning is being degraded because that's that's where the virus is attaching and and the anything is is out through is is running it's running all over your body it's running throughout all of your blood vessels, you know from your head to your toes and your lungs your arteries your heart kidney and test.

02:18:01

And that tissue is being destroyed because the that the virus is attaching via those receptors and they're being degraded. And that process is is is similar to is similar to free radicals, but like an extreme like storm of free radicals. And so, you know, so if so if we can call it oxidative stress and idea was that well, maybe at one possible treatment for coveted would be to treat a patient for oxidative stress.

02:18:30

And that's sort of like where where that idea came from. Yeah, so and then so the rest of article goes into like quite a bit more but I don't know if we need to cover all that cancer questions. The posters of therapy complicated but basically it was noticed in maybe January's February in some of the studies that came out of Wuhan that yeah because you have a competitive binding of well so theory when but you know, it has more nuance to it now.

02:19:04

It was basically the glycus spiked proteins binding to the, Se two cell membrane enzyme is a competitive binding which basically means that antichoo cannot enter the cell cannot bind an entrance cell, right? So one of the things that's characteristic is a massive spike in anti-tense and two in the blood.

02:19:30

That's one of the big findings. It's like massive circuit and that's where the notion of kind of a competitive binding or something like it came along and the point about ang two is the process by which it induces oxygen stress is. By basically increasing levels of have you heard did you come across something called aisle six or internal pan six?

02:19:55

Now no no, I I well, what do you spell it out, maybe I have yeah, I'll bet six and segue serves signaling. I'm sorry keen second yes, maybe I'm not sure the side of King's storms, right? So I so I don't know if that you're talking about if you're going that direction but yeah, this is actually before you get the right so it's basically inflammatory side token and end to basically increases the levels of into kind six.

02:20:30

To in any case is peroxidant. That pro-oxidant leads to an increase of radical oxidative sorry reactive oxygen species and those as specifically damage the ability of endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide. So they there's a superoxidation which is which causes something called entity vial dysfunction, but more importantly what's called decoupling of enormous endothelial nitric oxide and so what you have is the loss of.

02:21:05

Functional. Or magic oxide. This is important because nitric oxide is the only molecule that we know of that actually kills silos and it was discovered to kill Sal's calls and also as effective against Sasuke too. So basically you have this increase in anti-tense to this increase in into six this results in reactive oxygen species oxidation of the individual cells and basically their the new cerebility to.

02:21:40

Produce magic oxide important for two reasons, which describe the pathology. This is what I realized when I was looking at all chopsies in April is that you have fully compliant lungs, but you have massive kind of micro protein in the ambient pulmonary pulmonary microvasculature, right? And so that is maybe explained well, I think now we can say yep that is explained by basically the dearth of nitric oxide because nitric oxide leads to a lack of ability to vasodilate, right?

02:22:14

So you basically, Over a and your tension to by the way is also a base of constriction peptide. So you get massive base or constriction and you have a lack of nitric oxide which stops you being able to dilate those vessels and ensure efficient oxygen transport the other thing is that nitric oxide is essential for anti coagulation.

02:22:39

So it basically stops plate that activation and thrombin formation. So it's that it's the effect of oxidative of oxidization. On damaging endothelial cells reducing nitric oxide that basically runs renders them then further to the pro-inflammatory effects which are ventricles like barrier damage and that's when you get leakage and sort of catastrophic downstream effects.

02:23:06

That's more or less the kind of kind of arc. That's fantastic. I want to just pause myself for a second. You can keep talking if you want Dexter but also I want to invite Nick to speak welcome he has the only person on right now who hasn't spoken yet and everyone else down below raise your hand and all the invite you up to speak if you want.

02:23:28

Yeah, anyone who has a cure for coaching or you're welcome to the stage. Anyone at all? Hey guys yeah I'm just listening I you know I it's kind of funny because you know at the beginning of the whole covered 19 situation in our department so you know Center for Integrative Brain Research with a bunch of neuroscientists and and when I joined I did my dissertation in physiology, so I was pretty much the only one with a physiology background and ended up you know for the first like two or three months of the whole covet thing had to give a bunch of seminars to the departments to kind of get everybody on board with what co-ed 19 is or.

02:24:10

Not even one. It is but how does the whole arena engine system work and how might it provide some targets for things to study. Because a lot of the different institutions kind of especially ours, you know, we essentially shut down most of the non-essential research that was going on and then everybody was sort of hands on deck to develop either strategies to test for it.

02:24:33

There was still have a way to really test the board. At that time or to try to figure out what's going on and the amount that it is developed since then, you know, it's kind of laughable for some of the things that I was presenting none of it was wrong.

02:24:45

By any means but it was so simplistic you know the fact that despite protein would enter through the ace to receptor and you would get these increased amounts of angiotensin too by means of preventing the conversion to anti-tensin one seven and then you know from you know, that was pretty much when we started that was where we were at.

02:25:06

It was just kind of how do we figure out it's not run but it's worth the incomplete, right? Yeah, yeah, so it's been fascinating just to seek out a how it goes along and you know, we're still at this point, you know, I still have you know about 50 brains, right?

02:25:20

Now that are sectioned and sitting on my desk from patients that have died from cog in 19 and we're still trying to figure out the best ways to what we should label to sort of figure out is it infecting the brain whereas it happening and how is it working but one of the biggest hurdles is that all of the patient samples that we end up getting for the most part are ones of elderly people that have had so many comorbidities that you know, how do you decipher whether or not that this person has sort of a Functional pathological fact from the disease when the patient was 88 years old and had severe dementia.

02:26:01

You know, it's it's so it's hard to do that because we don't really have healthy controls per se because you're not really gonna have too many very healthy brains at that age and so we're still trying to figure out how the one where you know, ACE2 is even expressed in the brain because that's still unknown to this day and a lot of the antibodies and stuff to mark that are very very poor at best and so yeah, it's a it's an interesting.

02:26:29

Transgression or I should say progression of the scientific aspect of of studying it. There's actually been yeah, I think a lot that's come out of the pandemic, you know, very few good things to say about it, but one of the things is precisely that kind of thing right is that people who work on you know, the brain that don't net you of course, they talk about how it's embodied and relies on you know, the rest of the system have kind of had a very vivid demonstration right that these things these things exquisitely independent on one another so yeah, I mean, I know expert at this but occurred to me immediately that the you know, the focal brain damage that you were seeing that was reported early on was probably not the virus getting into you know, I mean, yeah, there may be a crossing of the blood rain barrier but it's far more likely to do these.

02:27:31

I think you know on my view basically covered 19 is an endothelial disease, it's a vascular disease and of course the brain relies upon, you know, very precise and exquisite. Arrival of oxygen on demand and the pulmonary microvascular is most vulnerable to necrosis right under but yeah, so difficult to tell whether that's just of course the case in all people too and that they're yeah.

02:28:07

Yeah I think curious, you know, I don't I don't know if anybody's published on it, but sort of there was that theory floating around that had some green convincing evidence behind it and not just from the bias that it came out of the institution that I did my participation in but the idea that for end up really function, especially with that that occurs from inhibition of or perturbation of the conversion of and to the Android 7 was that the when they took a look at the end of the lining and the mechanism that led to.

02:28:42

The base of dilation not typically that's a nitric oxide induced phenomenon and after the they took many different patient samples with I guess quote unquote end of the dysfunction because it's kind of a blanket diagnosis but were there refining was that many of the the patients had actually switched in that the blood vessels were no longer necessarily responding to nitric oxide but what they were doing was that they became almost completely dependent on hydrogen peroxide so the H2O2 in order to get that vasodilation and and anytime that.

02:29:17

You're switching to a hydrogen peroxide dependent vasodilation, you get a massive amount of this oxidative stress that goes along with it just because it financial is a little bit more of a promiscuous oxidative molecule. Yeah exactly so there's some this a differential function of production of endothelial nitric oxide under hypoxic conditions and I think that's something that's definitely worth looking into and that mechanism exists and that there are actually multiple way that there are there are so many things which converge upon area then sorry endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide and they are different.

02:30:06

Under hypoxic stress and so yeah that may be one of the reasons for instance there's a like classic synthase process but there's also a direct reduction as a production basically from nitrates and nitrate sorry nitrate and nitrite I think is it? I think it's yeah yeah, it's like a night hmm.

02:30:40

I actually just. Long since I looked at this it basically is production from the ions themselves and there's a reaction which can produce nitric oxide in endothelial cells, which basically just uses yeah nitro nitrite nitrate in actually syrup and yeah basically produces nitric oxide under um under hypoxemia, sorry thing.

02:31:17

's I've just woken up and I'm looking through something that I wrote like a year ago but I think as I recall when you say the production has become the production cop site has become reliant on like a super oxide how would that work exactly or roughly I don't know I guess but I was was talking about more was that when you expose the vessels to the nitric oxide they were from the, Patients with endophilia dysfunction, they're no longer getting that dilation to occur yet they were getting the dilation to occur with hydrogen peroxide and then when they actually took the rise samples from the patients that there was a much higher amount of hydrogen peroxide than that of nitric oxide so like it wasn't a perfect study by any means but it was certainly gave association that those likely to cause other.

02:32:23

So so yeah, it's definitely the case that you have this decline in endothelial nitric oxide and that's what well established now and an increase of super upside but I just I don't exactly understand yet maybe most likely a lack of understanding on my side how super upside in any case would cause.

02:32:47

Vessel dilation exactly hmm don't know but there is yeah, that's the funny. I don't know because if that was the case it wouldn't matter quite so much right that you had this suproxidation that you had this um oxidative stress and also one of the one of the portrait efficacies of antioxidants and and particularly like a superoxide disputes is that.

02:33:22

It alleviates that super observation so hmm I wonder so I wonder it was only in I think it was like only in 2015 when researchers from Helsinki sort of understood the the role of the lymphatic lymphatic vessels in the nervous system, basically the the articles called unraveling the link between the brain and looked at lymphatic system and 2015.

02:33:50

And so the things the surprising finding challenges current anatomy and historical textbook knowledge that lymphatic vessels are found in the central nervous system where they're not known to exist and so they're saying that you know, they were they were found connected to the eye and they're being used to you know, clear out basically to clean the brain but the lymphatic system.

02:34:15

I mentioned is in the the the lymphatic system is. Has cells that have endothelial lining so it's it might not be like because it's like a new sort of like a new thing I guess since it's 2015 that we're talking about the the role of the anothelial of the lymphatic system in the brain maybe that hasn't yet been kind of connected sort of broadly in the the the fact that the India that targets to might be in that in the lymphatic system in the endothelial lining of the cells and that's how the virus is getting to the brain and causing information the brain it was interesting as we we missed a you guys.

02:34:57

Doctor. Sean I'm his last name is I forgot his last name but he was here earlier and he was explaining how he thinks yeah yeah, right amazing guy, he's a brain doctor right and and he was um, he was describing how he thinks of Kobe 19 really as a brain disease first and foremost and that it's um inflammation in the brain which is sort of like, Allowing the the problems in the body in in other areas to not to not be solved the brain is not responding correctly to fix those problems in other areas of the body, so he so he sees the brain as having like a central wall this is really a brain disease more than what they more than a blood vessel disease his perspective was really really interesting.

02:35:50

Wow that is super interesting yeah. I never heard that before there's kind of a little I mean, you know to a man with that with a hammer kind of thing right and so with his specialism is in brains, but so he basically sees the brain as in some sense having governance over these processes, which would mmm, I don't know, you know the point about a the immune response to a virus from.

02:36:25

Right is that it's not in its supposed to I mean, there are all kinds of conditions of brain can be in and all kinds of activation states and all kinds of you know sleep wake and you know things relative to stress and the immune system while it's affected by these things and then you know, the two are basically intimately paired it seems.

02:36:55

So be counterintuitive because so many of the processes that we've been talking about are essentially processes which are you know, they operate in you know, mice they operate in things which are you know. Yeah, basically. They have very different sorts of brains but very similar sorts of immune systems which basically activate very similar manners, so who would just be it would be interesting to understand and yeah, I'm really sorry.

02:37:29

I've become really sorry I missed it how he would think that the brain would have governance over this because well, there's almost there's almost no literature right on the certainly if you look at like, you know, like journal viral pathology you you you hear about um, you know, there's always this like, you know can something cross the bloodbath barrier kind of have like, The downstream effects on the brain but almost never the causal error running in the other direction so that's amazing very interesting.

02:37:57

I'm just gonna say you're in luck because Sean or the PhD is going to do a presentation on Monday on Clubhouse on the brain and covet nineteen, so that's that's coming up I and I'm actually informal details. I was just a jump in I found the article by the guy we're actually went to graduate school together Andrew Cadillac but we're showing that the hydrogen peroxide directly stimulates PKG protein panties G which then directly leads the basal dilation, so basically under under basil levels the shear stress on a non-pathologic vessel shear stress obviously didn't can of transduction stimulates nitric oxide production which then.

02:38:46

Goes through reciprocal PKG and the dilation and then that nitric oxide inhibits hydrogen peroxide but then in the end of the function patients the sheer stress actually went to upregulation of the hydrogen peroxide which then directly stimulated PKG and then fled to the basal dilation so it basically activates the pathway to sort of viral another means more or less yeah, wow, that's super yeah, yeah.

02:39:21

That's amazing wow and so that would that was seem to be like in evolutionary kind of the compensatory mechanism right under certain conditions. Yeah, I would assume so I mean, I you know would be kind of like a redundant pathway to maintain dilation. Yeah yeah, so I don't know if you guys know but there are three what's seem to be like pretty effective therapies contracting like phase two trials now.

02:39:53

I think two of them and they are yeah, we have some therapies which are highly effective in patients infected with even like the dreaded like UK strain the worst of, Range for the UK to click Mustangs. But yeah, the UK strain and the South African strain and they basically have shown even in what they called heavily infected patients like precipitous drops in viral load like a 24-hour reduction in viral load of like 95% 75 as a 72-hour of like 99% and the operation of these particular therapeutics will shed a lot of lines on how.

02:40:49

This is actually playing out I think and yeah, it's um, there's a few something called sanitized just felt with a stubby something called approximatized PROX, it's a higher sentence he as I recall antigen binding receptor and then the other one is basically an exosome so like a an extracellular vesicle.

02:41:24

Delivered a signaling protein called CD24 which is if you've anyone who's kind of familiar with oncology CB24 is a a marker of yeah generally a prognostic for the so the poor it's a poor prognosticator for a breast. I think ovarian cancers, maybe a couple of others, but these are three different therapies but they all have this proximity the the statistics.

02:41:59

Like quoted were from sanitized which is just an intranasal as unlikely as the sound. Sounds is just an intradayal spray and approximately is an antigen receptor binder so it basically is reducing or essentially ablating the ability of testosterone to bind to receptors but also the same thing they have in a infected outpatient group of rather large.

02:42:34

Or they had a progression to severe symptoms of zero and hospital ambition and zero and in patients who were in basically in to a hospitalized but hadn't been intubated they had something like I think only a three or four percent progression of patients onto you intubation and so yeah these sort of therapies will I think give us give us some clarity on on what's actually going on.

02:43:07

And I'm only saying this because they support myself. Very. I wouldn't mention for any other reason. But yeah. Oh, very cool. Where did you say those came out of? So the first one is called sanitized. It's was basically the one of when the co-founders is Israeli, the company is Canadian and so they've run phase two phase one phase two human trials in in Canada and the UK and what they expect people was that it would be just prophylactic, right?

02:43:39

So the idea that one of the main entry vectors was intonationally and then this basic degree kind of went along with people reporting, you know, and knows mirror and that kind of thing but what they discovered was is that actually, It's administration to patients who are ready infected cause this precipitous drop in viral load.

02:44:01

All they're doing is increasing nitric oxide by their body. That's it. It's basically just a nitric oxide doughnut that's all it is. It's like I think it's a sodium bound nitric oxide donor basically. So that's a sanitized the other the other one is called inspired. Chinese company called produced by Chinese company called Clintor the they're like multiple.

02:44:28

Site clinical trial and the drug is called if I can spell it it's called proximal type so PROX a then LU. Lumatified you'll find it from that and then the other one is from Israel, but this one is just a observational trial but yes the same sort of remarkable results is interesting this therapy is delivered by inhaling.

02:45:03

The exosomes so it's basically the CD-24 protein contained within an exosome so it can you know diffuse through the pulmonary microvascular and yeah, it's basically my senses that the method of action in every case even though therapeutic agents are different is exactly the same. It basically is differentially down regulating the you'll have to.

02:45:38

Help me out in it. It is the the is it. Well, MK to do MK. Mm-hmm. Let me try to remember is it like. An it's an inflammatory pathway and it's like it's cover nuclear factor Kappa or NSF PNF capability and it's got to be thank you so tip the mic hungry so it's basically a differentiate differentiate differentially activating also down regulating part of this pathway and it very selectively suppresses human across this alpha into six camera interferon and what was the other one.

02:46:31

I only know it by it's like after the mic. Do you know and MCP sometimes referred to as CCL2? Oh yeah, yeah basically those those four I think there's one other but they all collectively inhibit entity on my tripod side and they eccentric mimic the function of estrogen. I don't know whether you know, but estrogen basically enhances the production of metric outside.

02:47:05

02:47:40

24 and its treatment for in cancer right they were just looking at its ability to suppress information the specific cytokines that it inhibits are exactly the same as estrogen yeah differently its major effects on it. I think about four or five specific cytokines all of which are implicated in reduced endothelial metric oxide production, so my suspicion is that what's really happening in?

02:48:15

His of course when you increase nitric oxide by availability, you are also decreasing viral load and nitric oxide is also in that sense able to act as kind of if you like priming antioxidation right so it would make sense that just increasing nitric oxide by availability would work and yeah you basically in the in the case of these other two therapies, they increase in the end the bio.

02:48:50

The production and via their ability of nitric oxide in the vasculature that's my there was my guess of April, well yeah these seem to follow those lines but yeah who knows how is this looking up studies on estrogen you to treat covered? 19 is the that exists? Crazy huh?

02:49:11

yeah yeah, but it does yeah. It's crazy now we're gonna read up on those therapeutic schools could be cool for even for testing it as well in the lab but I hate that jump in and then run away quick but I gotta get some I gotta go to sleep otherwise.

02:49:26

I'm not a single man if I don't go to bed. I was just gonna spend I'm just waking up from nap so I actually have to go and yeah make some coffee and brush my teeth, so yeah, I'm gonna mic down but yeah sleep well Nick and good to catch you even just for a few minutes.

02:49:44

Yeah see as well. Thanks Jackson. Thanks Mike, I'll put a room and everything. Thank you. You later. So, I think Annie hasn't had a chance to speak a few if you want to say something you may. Yeah a desk or maybe committed joke who had called it the jump on a station.

02:50:01

So yeah, I actually had a question turning but he's out maybe anyone can answer. So if so call it a message from Sean was a call it is a brain disease. So is it any at least? A criteria of how it can be identified is it any at least symptomatic, you know or heard which is available kind of or what kind of disease are more of frequent for after call it and how you can kind of estimate the damage.

02:50:45

Yeah. Maybe so I guess strong to get a doctor's getting coffee. Would you just for if I'm gonna answer that could you refer as your question and also if anyone in the in down below wants to try to attack all that one they can raise their hand. I'll buy you up.

02:51:01

But would you rephrase it? Andy.

02:51:13

Well how you want to fight the damage for those who went through the call? Is it any some particular symptoms? You know hurdles or is it any particular kind of you know, any symptomatic any any any direction available or you've heard or no? Okay, so um, this is a really tough question and so I've heard researchers say that it's to it's that still a problem and try in terms of trying to detect.

02:51:48

Over 19 in the brain. I have a couple of ideas. So so anyway, so you you may in particular want to tune in on Monday on a clubhouse when which doctors PhD Charlotte or he's going to present a covet nineteen in the brain but the you know, so his hypothesis is that Kobe 19 even more than being a vasculature system disease and a disease that it affects the lymphatic system.

02:52:18

He thinks that it is a at the core a brain brain disease. And his argument was about how the inflammation in the brain that results from you know, so I guess so I guess if I could sort of like make it new argument because as we last neck but but you know people are saying well, so there is there's in 2015 there the the role of the lymphatic system in the brain was kind of discovered so it's fairly recent.

02:52:46

And it's so there's a vast sort of like amount of of lymphatic system in the brain that is clearing out it's basically washing the brain when you sleep and that's everywhere and it's it's it has the cells in the in the in the lymphatic system have the endothelial lining so the virus is traveling into the endothelial into the lymphatic system and it's it's attacking the ace tube receptors in the in the, Lighting of the lymphatic system right a lot some like even nyquist hearings and neuroscientists we don't really know where the h2 receptors in the brain are well, they're in the neocline of the lymphatic system and then and and so that process is is literally destroying the walls of the cells that is a process that's similar to like inexplicing extreme version of of oxidative stress in a way like, you know, when you have free radicals in there, like little chainsaws and being thrown at your tissue and it's like just getting torn up so you need to take your antioxidants right to sort of like to to fight to fight these little chains.

02:53:56

To as you know basically to help them get fleshed out of your body, right? I mean, this is a it's a this I'm you know, I I still would like, you know other people do it who if I'm if I'm going wrong here to try to speak up and tell me if I'm making a mistake, but that's yet, it's my idea and that if you are gonna basically be doing a lot of destruction in the lymphatic system and antioxidal lining of the brain then you're gonna be creating at the same time at every stage of this a lot of inflammation and the inflammation is gonna be happening all.

02:54:31

Over the brain and as it does as what's showing up that that means that your brain is not gonna be able to respond adequately to to the rest of your body being attacked and so your response is gonna be inhibited so where's where is a healthy frame would be able to help you recover faster throughout your body as it's being attacked your brain is being taken down at the same time as your body and so your brain is not able to help your body and that's sort of the argument for why the coconut is a brain disease and why through inflammation it's being.

02:55:06

Inhibited from helping your body and at the same time the you know, what we what you might look for as a symptom would be symptoms of markers for other inflammation and and I guess I could I guess you know, there's what are the markets for information? I'm not the expert on the whole stack of markets for inflammation.

02:55:23

I barely know anything but you know, I think you know, And I guess isn't swelling like a like one possible reaction of inflammation, so I guess that could be one thing if you yeah in capitalizes is uh, yeah and so we we have we have you know, am I machines that detect blood flow and there's also you know.

02:55:49

We can we can image the brain with light and and but there's late there's laser imaging this is much faster but what I'm saying is like I think that if we have a fast enough like maybe if we can track like really blood footflow changes really really fast maybe with with optical imaging like f narrows or or HD dot or or you know, I don't know maybe or something if we can if we can track, you know, really fast changes and blood flow.

02:56:24

I don't know if images gonna help but but the in the situation actually but um the idea is that yeah that that could be a way to identify markers of of inflammation or oxidative stresses all just like really like hypothesis level stuff and not something that I'm expect people to be doing tomorrow in a basically like an at the at the clinical practice level, but but maybe maybe on the research side.

02:56:53

So at it thank you thank you yeah that's interesting and I'm sure he and so I'm sure with no because yeah brain inflammation is a classic consequence of brain injury right so insults to the brain from traumatic brain injury generally lead to a cascade of release of inflammatory factors and that's very often why you have the first one of the first things you do with a patient with severe brain injury is yeah you are.

02:57:28

Often just actually the effectively drill a hole in skull basically just to release that pressure because it's yeah a lot of patients die just purely through the brain inflammation but the interesting thing there is but that level of damage and that kind of inflammation there were certain kind of very common symptoms which are present when you have profound brain information which are things like seizures and the like and there has been.

02:58:03

Teachers reported in coded 19 for sure, but there are other rare and so hmm. I wonder I I wondered yeah to the extent to which that can be a sort of you know, this is the one thing which is always there which do you you know just regulates everything else that's kind of interesting to think about can it really be?

02:58:35

Yeah but but in case I think yeah wait till Monday, but you're saying it's really the fact that the it's really limp node and the the old damage which is in trading most of the effects is that right well just do not have that so that is just like a brand new hypothesis that I just came up with because there's a big question about how but you know how the virus can affect the brain, you know, besides creating recreating information somewhere else and information traveling to the brain or actually, you know, finding is.

02:59:10

To. After is in the lymphatic system in the brain and that's where it's attacking. That's I think that is the most likely case but it's this is like new territory.

02:59:22

Yeah, I tend to think that that's that that's also to do with the microvascripture that basically to the vascular microvascular vasculature also there was a recent study done imaging the vasculature of patients with long covet and who have focal brain damage and what they've discovered was massive damage to particularly the microvasculature and so interestingly this is kind of interesting.

02:59:54

If you look at the, Well you can look at the translation of it but if you look at the update that was given on November 13 by the what amounts to like the CDC trying to CDC they basically warn of this pandemic pneumonia and one of the symptoms that they signed astonishingly is a necrosis of yeah, neurological microvascular.

03:00:32

Which is very very interesting because that's not something that you you generally put in a flu manual but yeah nevertheless there it is. Wow. Wow. Yeah, that's what that's what I said the IEM was just the same as you right this was like I spent like a month and a half an April and yet there was so few sources, right?

03:00:58

I was still called when I started looking at the store called End calls 2019 and so I was having to look at like Chinese sources. I have a few Chinese friends were translating stuff for me. And yeah but I yeah, it's that was like a lights on moment like oh my goodness and so I began yet to look at it as being at least you know, at least we can say this it's not divorceable from the infractions to the vasculature and the vascular endothelium but yeah, it's very curious to find that in that's the data they updated the nationwide manuals that is a kind of like a update to the seasonal guide.

03:01:42

Lines and they've worn the pandemic influenza of unknown origin and they talk about yeah micro vascular necrosis in in the brain the very odd thing but yeah that's um that would explain a lot of the loss of function and also you were talking about anti-oxidants right and particular in particularly it's like that handles 15 and also glutathione peroxidase, right?

03:02:15

So basically, that's what, Any. He does is basically raised GS GSH levels so interestingly for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome you often get my brain fog in these sorts of conditions and one of the treatments have been sort of for quite a while to sort of gold standard treatments has been to raise intercellular through sothion using there's a kind of microfilted denatured way but also yeah NAC was.

03:02:52

Thought to be one of the treatments but this notion of antioxidation in some way relating to brain fog has been the thing for a long time so yeah this notion of like that's been a damage which is infracting the ability of the microvascripture to deliver, you know to basically, you know, entrain the efficient chemo dynamics and oxygen transport on which you know, neural processing relies seems these things seem to be the same.

03:03:27

One has been trained by just opposite stress and aging and the other may be by the fire so I speaking to guy from Yale a couple of days two three days ago and his view was basically one of a sort of a you know, having sauce got two is like having your vast literature, you know aged and accelerated great that was his you everyone has a view right that was his.

03:03:59

Yeah. I don't know enough about the process of aging to to immediately understand the amount the analogy.

03:04:10

I had basically observations so that there is a not that it's like settled science right but there's an oxidative or an oxidation theory of aging which is essentially that you know, the human body kind of rusts is the idea and so that's where observation fits in that picture where especially where the vast matures concerned.

03:04:35

03:05:22

Yeah, I kind of tied those things together just knowing about it. So, yeah. Are you writing books and papers? I hope so because I keep this knowledge needs to be preserved and shared. So, I hope you're writing. Oh, I'll tell you I'll tell you. I'll tell you what to do.

03:05:39

I basically spent a month and a half on this and I just happened to know some people at Columbia who are you know, kind of like they were one person in that group worked originally on isolating stars and helped set up like part of China's CDC. The infrastructure of the CDC with the head of the CDC in China George Fugel and so yeah, I just I I did what you did, right?

03:06:07

So I just wrote stuff up say look this is not my field but you know, if you think if you think paragraph one doesn't make total nons, you know, it isn't total nonsense you might want to keep reading and so yeah, I basically package this up there and sent it off and get just fired friend who was.

03:06:32

Yeah yes sort of whatever kind of mediating that being sent put together so yeah, it's all it's all basically there. I have the original sort of sort of lights on sort of insights from from April but I dropped it in. May basically because there was so many competing you know, that's two I'm sure if you looked at it there was so many theories of what this was and and I realized that though.

03:07:00

What I was sort of burgling on seemed to make a sense like I'm not an expert in that field. I sort of rapidly became one and just over the last two months. I have had a lot of questions back about you know, what were you saying and and what were the references so is funny that we're talking about this but over the last two or three weeks.

03:07:19

I have just been going over my sort of not rambling that you know, it's pretty pretty well laid out and yeah, it's it basically has a causal sequencer explains lots of things about the following pathology. I thought But yeah just the request for like, you know, what is the underlying evidence and what's too much since what papers and what research findings what clinical findings and what drugs support your view of the pathology, which is how I know about these three emerging therapies.

03:07:51

So yeah, I mean it's I was finally done with it about two days ago, but yeah, it's um, it's written down but I mean, it's not I don't know that it's gonna be sort of published anywhere but yeah, it explains a lot about all sorts of different oh yeah just one thing.

03:08:10

Is kind of an example. Do you know that UV has turned out to be I think this only came out maybe like a day or two ago UV light has turned out to be quite an effective predictor of where you get major outbreaks and coke 19. I don't think that.

03:08:30

What's the what's the story behind that UV light or yeah you're sorry sorry yeah you'll be like basically ambient light has turned out to be an effective geographic predictor of where you get major outbreaks and major clusters of outbreaks in code of 19 and so I basically predicted that this was a result of the two things of course latitude, but then also pollution pollution can attenuate ground UV inert.

03:09:05

Polluted city by up to 40 percent. I looked at Athens sorry up to 70 percent I looked at Athens and also some cities in China some really polluted cities but in Athens I think ground level attenuation of UV and Athens even in summertime is something some around 40 percent but in I think it was like Guangzhou or yeah some particular city in a in a problems they had done a study of ambient UV and they found a 70 percent attenuation what what's important?

03:09:40

About this is of course everyone knows that UVB is involved in the synthesis of vitamin D right and so there was this sort of vitamin D sunshine theory which is actually tied to nitric oxide but the important thing is is that in addition to UVB both UVB and UVA actually release nitric oxide precursors so nitrous ovals and nitrites and nitrate precurses from continuous storage upon.

03:10:15

To UVA so I reasoned that basically it was this reservoir of yeah nitric oxide precursors that would be massively attenuated under insufficient UV and that would mean that you had basis between less bioavailable magic oxide to call upon to defend endothelial nitric oxide production and then of course nitric oxide in the end is as I said, the only molecule we know of that is capable of actually.

03:10:50

Imactivating or yeah basically nitric oxide isn't is extremely effective in inactivating bacteria protozoa and viruses it's used by macrophages and the primary by macrophages in viral clearance, so I reasoned just be lack of bioavailable nitric oxide would. Basically potentiate, you know, a great your massive disease vulnerability, so if you Google covered 19 and UV and if you just include not vitamin D.

03:11:36

I think it's a search you should come across some research that came out a couple of days ago from Edinburgh University hmm but yeah, it's a process which was has only recently been discovered that nitric oxide is stored in skin what am I supposed to? Say. I'd say what let me just I'll just tell my mic off and I'll just try a Google search and then I'll tell you exactly what to look for.

03:12:02

Okay. Hey Mike and the texture it's such a information overload for me and as they they personally just a generally interested in frame but I learned a lot and think thank you so much for running this okay, so I just say Frank just played mine I think from Mike about like I this is just some research that I did I did with some confidence and capable people but who are you know have years in the field but I'm not one this is just the some research that I did and on my decide none of us are experts.

03:12:40

In code. 19, just to be clear. But sorry go ahead.

03:12:51

I think that was for your frank what were you saying? Frank? Yeah, so so yeah still I mean, very interesting. So it doctors young or like mentioned what time on Monday the 2 gives a? He'll run the clubhouse on coded prank. He might have but I I forget so what I did was I went and and and looked and I looked him up and and sent him a message and said can you can you tell me more deep more details and so he may reply back and not that I'll be able to post that on Twitter.

03:13:34

Okay, just so that for a rep and pointer. I you know. Googled of irrelevant article title is a effect of Kobe 19 on the nervous system. It's a radio article. I think the pointing to the pathways and is to to what was some of the in those associative related.

03:14:01

So, maybe I you know, hopefully that before it's a talk tomorrow, but yeah, I just throw it. Out there, just go. But but I I'll you know, I I need to sign off and hope you know to to I will have the this meeting. So again next week, yeah.

03:14:23

Thank you very much. Frank thanks for coming. I want to encourage more people to come up on the stage and just hang out with us. You don't have to answer neuroscience questions if you don't want to but we would love that as well. And. And then also if folks want to invite if you want to invite someone a recommend someone I think you need to be a moderator.

03:14:49

So just let me know if you if you want to advise someone and I'll. I mean just makes you feel a moderator. And so I don't know if if if the moderators can take a minute to just invite some some people who are would be interested in a talk about neurophysics nerve gear the brain vibrations and oscillations, maybe we can get the group to keep going and up so I mean, I guess I can't do that.

03:15:19

So I'm just gonna take a minute to invite some folks.

03:15:27

See.

03:15:31

And and also and this is like this it does a double purpose so it's like while I'm inviting folks. I'm actually giving my brain a little bit of a rest because the it's this is not an easy conversation for sure. Let's see. I'm fighting. There's so many people who follow me, oh shit you.

03:15:59

I guess there's a fun there's a lament you'll see. I'm trying to just click a bunch of people. I don't know. It is a past 11, so I guess some of these people might not. Be around it's. Okay. Hang on. And we'll resume talking in just a minute. Just I'm just gonna exhaust my invites out if folks want to to send out a bunch of advice for it.

03:16:28

You don't have to be specific yeah. Mike you just say I have some search terms for you when you're done you'll be able to find this article. Okay, go ahead so let's let's type let me type in article, so it's gotta do that, so I'm done. I've maxed out my invites for now, so anyways.

03:16:46

If you search for a if you just search for some might so my um covered and then just sci t e c h s cite it's a kind of like popular science article but it links to the study study from Edinburgh University they've been tracking this for a while trying to figure out why UV had this effect and they originally reasoned which I didn't think was right, but they've converged on.

03:17:21

Nitric oxiders yeah possible possible cause and the interesting thing about this is just they non-cononical means of deriving magic oxide which is yeah fairly recent and it's within the last 10 years that it was discovered that basically heat and light in trade the rapid release of nitrous affiles nitrate and nitrite anions from your storage.

03:17:56

Direct. You into blood where they're reduced to nitric oxide in blood cells and that this is basically a likely well no. I hypothesized that this is one of the reasons that body temperature is elevated in in disease state is one of the things it does is releasement nitric oxide which basically kills, you know, bacteria bacterial infections and viral infections and the like but yeah.

03:18:31

That a little bit of it's a it's an interesting prediction it's interesting to look at something when you're looking at a very small kind of bit of the kind of vascular architecture and thinking just like where on earth is all this nitric oxide come from like where is it stored and so when I thought that way I realized it must be some massive store we don't eat reliably massive amounts of microscopic side, so yeah, it's basically taken in and stored for current as needed and then, There's a cyclical process it's kind of reduced back and since the skin is the largest organ, you know in the body made perfect sense that that was a place to look and so yeah, I discovered that that is a recently observed phenomenon that you can basically, you know on call trigger massive amounts of the release of nitric oxide which was yeah interesting and it was a very odd way to stumble upon it, let me add just um, I do have a question that I want to drilled in deeper, but I also want to give Cecile.

03:19:42

Chance to talk welcome to seal.

03:19:54

Bleeder and then cutting okay, so it sounds like this this is gonna decease those gonna talk later because the signal is bad, it's okay, so um, I would like to then oh but this is ours in it in the down there. I mean invite. Um, and then anyone else who wants to come up and talk just let me know and I'll invite you up just if I.

03:20:23

And okay. All right, so let's keep going um, so the question I had for you Dexter was what do you think the precise mechanism is for for nitric oxide to attack the source curvy to and specifically? Oh you mean the means by which it disables it precisely yes, it's it's I I don't know when a kind of like very deep biomolecular sense but not nitric oxide is broadly toxic so yeah, it's if you like it is.

03:21:05

Used in just about every instance where not just about everything but in many many instances where a broad range of as I said persons that bacteria and viruses are attacked so there's no particular kind of yeah for the purposes of kind of my inquiry the exact method of that action.

03:21:26

I didn't need to investigate right it's just well characterized and we already knew in 2005. I that end nitro supplyles were capable of reducing the replication. On hope so of was one of the few agents found reliably to do it and the thing about magic oxide is that it's basically inherited to the body right so you're not you're not using any sort of, you know foreign many of you treatments which have been tried are incredibly expensive have really nasty side effects profiles, but are yeah, they're essentially modulating immune pathways in very unorthodox ways in some cases, it's not even clear.

03:22:15

Exactly how they do work, but they but you know, they're they're efficacy is very very low so you know like red desert beer and the line car yeah but nitric oxide is basically native there's one thing interestingly. I don't know whether you heard but maybe in around mmm ginger lifetime there was a kind of breakthrough reported about which related to dexamethasone so basically good accords anti-inflammatories.

03:22:48

I don't know whether you heard about that, but there was something like a, Dance cover yeah so so the story around that is basically that that's well the story as writ around that is a dexamethasone basically is an anti inflammatory and so you're trying to fly fight information but that's a double edge sword because the sort of classic, you know, as the royal anti-inflammatories anti-inflammatory medications reduced, you know, they suppress the immune system, do you really want to be doing that and so the effective dexamethasone is interesting because, What decks actually does is under conditions of hypoxia, it actually conserves the production of endothelial metric oxide so I think the method of action is to wide that particular due to cortical turned out to be so effective and others have turned out to have moderate or actually deleterious effects is actually because of the specific action of decks relative to endothelial magic oxide that's that's my thought.

03:24:00

Yeah I you know so I the downside the decks which can so dextromethon which can be abbreviated as dx that I read was edit increased oxidative stress and and that is basically the core issue with what so it addressed information but the the core issue was it was oxidative stress index actually increases it so it could be effective in a late maybe in the late stage of kobid when when when the patient is is primarily dealing with inflammation and less so with the cause of the disease in the first place so I but on the whole on the whole I think it's just it's, A.

03:24:35

It's something that treats a sort of a symptom that of a cause but that symptom of a cause is a cause of another symptom and so it's it's it you can see that it's being effective but it's not treating the root issue which is so dexus is really the wrong idea but I I had of something else so I'm gonna throw in there when we got yes, oh, oh yeah, so okay, so okay, so okay, so nitric oxide.

03:25:06

And hydrogen peroxide are they both they're both toxic to germs right they both killed bacteria they both they both kill a viruses and just like, you know, just like rubbing alcohol right but the thing is like I think that in the body the that, um, you know, they're both the way the way that they're acting is different so in the body.

03:25:32

I think that both hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide are as we've been talking about this entire three hours they. Are vasodilators primarily and they're improving the exchange of of gas in the lungs for for one example or improving the the blood to better oxygenate oxygenate because it did because the blood vessels are the because okay, so, you know the aim to your system or the ace to receptors or degraded right and and so you have too much faster constriction and so I what I think is it that the nitric oxide and the hydrogen peroxide is being vaseline dilators are allowing the the the blood vessels to.

03:26:16

To consume oxygen to help your blood to consume oxygen because the the the otherwise the blood vessels are too constricted and in oxygen can be consumed right that's just a hypothesis and so hasn't it so it may have nothing to do with killing the virus the reason my nitric oxide might be useful in the battle against Kobe 19, maybe really just about one thing that's vasodilation, so you're body can uptake more oxygen and in which case you could substitute nitric oxide for any kind of a facet dilator and you would have a similar.

03:26:51

Benefit if that's true. Yeah, I can see why one would be that to that conclusion but the effects of nitric oxide so there's basically nitric oxide of courses involved ambassador dilation but it's also involved in the inactivation of you know viruses and the like but it's also involved in the down regulation of platelet activation and also platelet adhesion so the catastrophic clotting that you see in coveted.

03:27:29

Can't be explained in quite the same sense by super oxidation right but it can be when all of it can be explained theoretically by a lack of bioavailability of magic oxide and also a biofasic switch to inducible nitric oxide so massive production of nitric oxide from macrophages, which yeah in the end, you know, it becomes one level the production of endocrine nitric oxide and a production in.

03:28:04

Macrophages is great, but once you get this cytokine storm which leads to an upper leg regulation both these cytokines and also entrains the massive production of inducible magical site you get something which is yeah extremely basically yeah in trains barrier function comprised of barrier function the point about this is actually more than anything.

03:28:30

I can say is that there are two things which are absolutely kind of staples of the endothelial comorbidities. Which potentiates severe cover 19 disease or mortality and all of them basically feature as a general feature vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, but also a lowered nitric oxide by availability and so that initial bioavailability is kind of like a lowered viral defense but also is a kind of diagnostic of a pre-existing endothelial.

03:29:14

So the the the the reason that I hung it on nitric oxide because it just explains so much right the nitric oxide explains why you see the geographic distribution 

enhanced synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide something like that basically protects endothelial.

03:29:50

Nitric oxide production under hypoxia and they're just so many facets of the disease which were complete mystery when you look at them from this angle it begins to yeah explain them but who knows so I you know there so when it comes to thrombosis factors or blood or the blood clots right there, there's a lot more to then so so the the lot the loss of ace to receptors and the the loss of nitric oxide is going to contribute to the constriction of the blood vessels, but, In and also the the the degradation of the blood of the tissue is going to release a whole bunch of thrombosis factors or blood clotting factors like like von Willebrands factor, it is an example and.

03:30:42

So I mean so like I mean, I see that I see nitric oxide is is is a big part of the story but but the blood clots are explained by more than just that the release of the the the construction is is is not just nitric oxide it's the ace to receptors and the in the in the the blood clots are not just the lack of nitric oxide it's it's the final element one vanilla branch factor and other other thrombosis factors that are released from the cell lining.

03:31:12

Idea. I'm not saying it explains everything but if you don't have nitric oxide to basically counter those thrombotic effects, they'll just run away from themselves right the whole thing about really sarcopto is that it trained in trains a series of vicious loops right one, which basically leads to the overproduction or the surface of sear and serum hang to right basically as the virus spreads you basically reduce or ablate the ability of this kind of like conversion of an.

03:31:47

Gered to hang one through seven right so you just get lots of ant to in the blood that entrains into Luca and six then increases oxygen oxidization that depletes endothelial nitric oxide that allows the virus to replicate unchecked and that's the kind of chain reaction which just begins to run away with itself and actually eventually doesn't need the virus to be there which will explain why in long covered you have people who have long recovered but they basically have a progressive degenerative endothelial condition but the point about nitric oxide relative.

03:32:22

To from what your relative to like hypothyroid hypo coagulopathy is that nitric oxide is yeah, it does two things it basically reduces cellular wall adhesion right there, so the kind of stickiness of clotting factors to the endothelial lining at the vast mature but it also reduces platelet activation so the fact that you have like one will abandon factor and thrombin.

03:32:57

It's the fact that these are basically in abundance without nitric oxide that basically yeah in trains that catastrophic clotting so I'm not saying that it's just your nitric oxide on or your on good or bad it's more complicated than that but I'm saying it's involved in all of the major manifestations of the pathology, even at the level actually of the, The the infractions to the heart and the like yeah it's involved there too and so I maybe kind of one of the place we're talking about the one of the features of covent 19 is a hypocalyptic hypercalenia and renal failure right so the vasculature of the renal vasculature is basically extraordinarily fine the innovation of.

03:34:07

Yeah, the renal system is exquisitely fine yeah yeah vessels and they are extremely susceptible susceptible to this kind of endothelial dysfunction uncoupling of enos and so it would make sense that one of the most vulnerable parts of the entire system rather than the liver or the heart would be yeah kidney failure renal failure, so I don't know, you know, there's a, As I come into previously, right?

03:34:43

It's like if you have a hammer looks like everything is an elf but it's just yeah, it's a it's effects are so apply tropics that you you begin to see that all of these things basically are connected to production of nitric oxide for instance vitamin D deficiency, so you were talking about vascular antioxidation and antioxidants right so the endothelium is richly populated with VDR receptors and vitamin D receptors big.

03:35:16

Ly act as the primary antioxidant which prevents the uncoupling of Enos. So basically if you like stops the degradation of the micro RNA, which allowed this synthase process to occur. So that that connects to to why it is that pre-existing vitamin D deficiency eventually results in the slack of bioavailable magic oxide.

03:35:48

So there are some studies done on. Basically umbilical chords like whovex treated with let's see treated with vitamin D and they were basically protected by vitamin D against superoxidation, so you could rescue endothelial nitric oxide if you had a pretreatment with the yes steroidal work well with them. Cowser trial basically the kind of.

03:36:26

End bioavailable component of vitamin D so these things tied together in a particular way vitamin D and nitric oxide which have kind of longing implicate vitamin D is now a well-recognized, you know prognostic indicator of poor outcome. I think it's really just an indicator that you have low nitric oxide by the bioavailability and likely pre-extent endocytosunction.

03:36:56

Yeah this is a really yes, I've learned an incredible amount today. I know I'm gonna I'm gonna shut up actually like it and we're gonna wait till our Sean's talk right because I'm super interested because his take is the causal arrow runs the other way, right? And I'm yeah a really interested to hear how that how that plays out is that's super cool.

03:37:17

Yeah. I mean, I would love to I shut up now. Yeah, no, I mean, I I was just I was just googling. I Shawn or and finding all sorts of astonishing things that he's been in the news. About which I won't mention tonight, but but people can Google if they want.

03:37:38

And so, I don't know exactly what to. I know what but it should be interesting, so I will.

03:37:53

Oh okay so so hey Dexter, what do you think about these like in terms of what these pre-workout like like our vassal dialers you can buy over the counter so there's like been posted and and like like there's a whole bunch of like nitrogen, you know, I guess nitric oxide boosters that that weight bodybuilders use do you yeah do you like any of those?

03:38:19

I don't take him because okay, um, well get showing the pandemic so. I just I really just couldn't comment. I don't I know you of course athletes take nitric oxide boosters just to boost the by their ability of nitric oxide specifically for yeah as you know, like vasodilation yeah, but one of the studies kind of been known for for quite a while but just if you increase the dietary intake of nitrates, they will be reduced to nitric oxide so a good dietary intake.

03:39:05

For the average person is is really all you need but there was a study done which was done with a concentrated beetroot goose which showed some performance increase. I believe it was in sprinters pretty sure it was but yeah, it was kind of like after some days of taking this concentrated feature juice which is in the end just the nitrates like it's just like increasing dietary nitrate intake they showed some yeah increased level of performance and it maybe actually one of the reasons why.

03:39:40

Me exercise has prophylactic effects against the viral infection because you are basically you are yeah if you like in training the release of these precursors from continuous storage, but yeah, I when it comes to stuff that athletes use they use so many strange things often just because companies have been able to make them sound scientific and expensive.

03:40:10

I just that really don't I yeah, I I don't know enough. To say so yeah, sorry okay so Carl's here. Carl if you want to talk for a little bit I I definitely need to give myself about 30 seconds to 60 seconds to recover so I'm just gonna meet myself.

03:40:36

I'm so did you advise guys? I still got my at some point you're not competition, but did you once say something?

03:40:54

Please. I know this one surprise you but I'm sick of the sound of my employees, please just.

03:41:03

Let me just invite everybody up. I hope somebody says yes. Invite yes.

03:41:16

Hi my name is Chris and thanks a lot. I am completely unqualified to comment on this discussion but I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it and I especially wanted to commend you Dexter on the rigorous typography of your profile, it's really it's really beautifully laid out so I gotta say just as a retired graphic designer it's probably much good that's fun thank you just me too for my former yeah, well I sometimes still do graphics design but, Yeah, thank you so much if you're a graphic designer of a certain kind of band right you look at a profound you're like, ah this bothers me type outfit it's not right and yeah that's something that sort of never leads you alone to come from art school time, so thanks for noticing oh well, I mean, you're you're credential I'm really just been satisfied to.

03:42:15

Make decisions about what things look like but your profile is is much more impressive and and a wide range of interest and I just thought I'd comment that my own sort of amateur interest in neurophysics neurology consciousness, etc actually. I was cultivated in graphic design as I was. Obligated to have conversations about why we should do something why we should make certain choices and and you know, I used to laugh that being an art director is just being paid to be the most opinionated person in the room, but it was actually I was actually, I think the person who in the room who was the most interested in the sort of consequences of the subtleties the visual decisions, we were making had consequences and I was prepared to play with it so clubhouse has been wonderful in this regard.

03:43:17

I mean, I I've actually kind of shunned social media. I'm I'm not. You know, I'm not really all that conversant in a lot of the topics that are hot here, but I've been delighted to find so many highly highly credentialed conversations about neurology consciousness the intelligence artificial and natural and I've been really quite inspired by the the clarity of.

03:43:50

Some of the language so that's that's that's what I got I can yeah I can really relate to what you're saying just say that kind of conversation about Sal's Club too not my speciality just like, you know, it takes years to really understand that sort of thing and I just yeah been working with people who you know know the subject much better than I do even though you know, maybe I had some yeah, I guess now I can say yeah.

03:44:24

I I know. These things fairly well and but yeah just to say that that discussion I wouldn't include in that category but um hundred percent yeah that's exactly the way that I might kind of inspiration for wanting to understand was unlike all the other kids at our school. I just seemed to be thinking so much more about like why why does this kind of like drops to position of things work so well and you know, whereas so many other all the, Yeah so many other of my contemporaries were just kind of do and either would have went is kind of hit or miss right they there was no particular process that they were could be explicit about if you like and it wasn't that I wanted some sort of rule set or system.

03:45:16

I just made many securus the first time I painted something I was like, I wasn't just interested to kind of duplicate what I was looking at. I wanted to understand light and I think that's yeah for anyone who is an artist or who's kind of played around with. Anything like that the sense an appreciation that gives you of the world kind of exquisite appreciation of the world at the level of perception and musicians.

03:45:43

I think experiences too and heard many musicians say it just like heightens your sense of all sorts of other things but yeah, that's what art did for me and it led to an eventual like wait a minute. I am really interested as much as I am in you know design and art and eventually film which is why I said most of my time creatively.

03:46:05

I'm interested in the same kind of understanding of just. How the world works how you know how does this all of this magic you know, which which which you know magic is kind of a romantic word but since since you know, we're both from my graphic design land let's throw that word around.

03:46:23

I became really curious about what is what is beneath it this rigorous and that isn't just sort of like talked about and sort of very metaphorical kind of terms of the kind of terms that you can hear an art critic use right which could mean almost anything. I wanted to know really yeah, there's so many.

03:46:45

Delays to the experience. I think that was the first fascination for me before I had any of these concepts or vocabulary I had this experience. In which I was just fascinated by. The the layering and the subtlety and how you know shifting one thing has a cascading effect and you know, this this looks better like that and and you know, just simple things like an art teacher telling me to look at my picture in a mirror and see it in reverse and how that changes things and then it was only later that I spent enough time with it and took on responsibilities and including the responsibility to converse.

03:47:29

Yeah, there was a. There were I'm sorry once again. I'm gonna mute for a minute. I have to take care of something. I'll be back in 30 seconds, okay, no worries take your time.

03:47:46

So have we heard from Hazel yet you want to talk.

03:47:57

Baby should wait for Chris to get back he's no problem. I'm I'm having on call function and I just have to deal with something of indeterminate time, so thanks sir thanks for listening and I'm complete.

03:48:18

Hazel, that would be okay if you want to speak. Oh yeah, um, thanks for inviting me. I am actually very interested to know more about vitamin D. I recently got checked got checked and my doctor found out that. I don't have enough vitamin D in my system, so she gave me like 50,000 units of of that and she answered this collide like.

03:48:58

Why because you know, it's covered. I live in New York City. I'm always endorsed. Recently. I've just been like forcing myself to go out there. I mean, I'm not a plant. I don't know just being humorous about this but I'd love to know more actually. I you know when you were explaining how it works.

03:49:20

I was like looking at it. I was like, oh my goodness, it has a lot to do with you know the heart and. You know, my my dad actually passed away because of a heart attack and. A stroke like three times so this is obviously like something that I have to be like very aware of so if you can just like, Operate on that and I'd be very grateful, thank you.

03:49:46

Okay just quickly and it's not really the subject of the room and definitely to underscore and not a doctor so it's yeah just these are kind of prompts for stuff that you might be interested in kind of looking into but definitely not medical advice and then kind and yeah I this is yeah just from research just related to some some some investigation I did into somewhat and skin covering and vascular health a while ago, but then, Yeah.

03:50:21

Code of 19 that's all became kind of yeah, this was just seemed like it was pressing to the syndrome so it just invoked this in terms the story around Bittman D is that it is common because you find common insufficiency of vitamin D in a whole range of different diseases, you know, it's associated with so many different syndromes but particularly with diseases of the vasculature and there have been as your study on.

03:50:56

Study upon study where it was thought that well, hey if you just put vitamin D back in then, you know, you're just gonna reverse the fact there is this deficiency and you know everything will basically just quote unquote return to normal the the system will you know, it's kind of like it's under some kind of arithmetic load that it can't kind of return from right it can't reach homeostasis because there's just this, you know, very low vitamin D levels just add between these supplements and you know this just like, Vast sway the health conditions should go away but this is actually the reason that so many people in the medical community were skeptical of this idea that vitamin D would have anything to do with coded prevention or a mediation of symptoms or even clinical treatment because vitamin D has failed time and time again, it's a failed and failed and failed and failed syndrome like young reliable diagnostic criteria vitamin D depletion, and then reliable failure of treatment putting, you know, vitamin, you know, Vitamin D supplementation, and so I personally opinion.

03:52:10

I think that.

03:52:16

The experimental data suggests something which hmm which makes sense. I think and explains why between D is so good in a preventive role and but why it basically has this kind of failure to rescue, you know, all sorts of syndromes and again not medical advice and not qualified and just like a bunch of work.

03:52:43

I did with some people who are kind of virologists who are yeah far better qualified than I, But my my basic conclusion was this that it's important to maintain visibility supplementation or not supplementation vitamin D levels sunlight is best you obviously don't want to be exposed to too much UV but sunlight is best but also dietary supplementation is good it's basically when vitamin D reaches a state of depletion where it loses its antioxidant effect in this case.

03:53:26

Can be if you're talking about, you know, after sclerosis and cardiovascular disease and that kind of thing it's basically that you get chronic oxidative stress and once that occurs you get irreparable damage to the endothelial cells, you get endothelial cell necrosis and once that's happened putting vitamin D back won't help anything really any sort of antioxidant has don't have a limited effect so the important thing is to.

03:54:01

Just the maintain healthy levels that that's really the story and vitamin D in the vascular endothelium is as I mentioned kind of critical for defending endothelial nitric oxide production, which is important for just general vascular health for defending it against a superoxide oxidation and the kind of damage that I've been talking about and so the vitamin D deficiency that you see in class.

03:54:36

Decree in coveted it's a fairly reliable, you know, negative prognostic indicator doesn't mean that you can just like treat patients with vitamin D and they will you know, all will be well what that vitamin D deficiency is really telling you is that there is an increased likelihood of compromised vascular function and it doesn't mean that it is the case in your case, but it's just important, you know, Just to maintain healthy levels to prevent that yeah that oxygen of damage which over time over kind of life course is eventually very difficult to rescue so they go that's my unqualified opinion worth every penny you didn't have to pay for it so yeah just some things to look into and if you're interested but yeah just a triple underline.

03:55:35

I am not a physician but yeah just get some research on it. I think so much better. I really appreciate that and you know for me I am surrounded by doctors, you know, my closest friends are actually positions and right yeah, you know sometimes it's you know, not to.

03:56:00

Say anything negative, but I actually. Sometimes you know, some other people who actually didn't go to school have like a lot of knowledge so not I'm pretty aware that you know, some people that are actually don't have a diploma and medicine actually have a lot of knowledge so don't worry about it.

03:56:23

I mean, that's a double edge sold right there are people who yeah maybe haven't studied a particular aspect of physiology or disease and may have some useful things to say about it. I work with some people at the National Cancer Center. And who wanted the heads of labs there has he has just developed so many different therapies across so many different areas he's kind of fairly remarkable in that sense because you do tend to encounter a sort of hyper specialization not always but but quite often but just to say there are lots of people who don't have diplomas and also talk absolute nonsense, maybe very very dangerous, you know, people who have far too confident that they you know, that something is the answer to everything.

03:57:15

You know, and so I would just say yeah treat anything I said is literally some lunatic off the internet and if you do your own research and it concurs that's a good thing but um, yeah, I I definitely agree with you it's doctors often because you know, they are very often running on established knowledge and they are not necessarily reading the latest research nor should they because the latest research often turns out to be you know, then kind of walked back by something.

03:57:50

Could findings so they're using a kind of aggregate of information which is sort of known to be the case canonical knowledge which which has its pluses and minuses right they're very unlikely to kill you by you know, some crazy experimental treatment but they're also unlikely to be at the sort of forefront of an understanding of something so yeah, it's a double absorbed and so yeah, I've endeavored to get just give you sort of, you know sensible advice which is you know, fairly standard to the literature, but again, this is like my six on the line.

03:58:26

You know, not a physician so yeah just just say that but yeah cool thanks I'm glad you found interesting and you know hope it leads you somewhere to use I would like to say something about vitamin D, there's a paper you can you can look up it's called vitamin D and inflammation potential implications for the variative.

03:58:47

Copenhagen, it's a 2020 paper another paper you look up is vitamin D and inflammation in major depressive disorder, that's also 2020 paper on they're both on the PubMed. And there's there's a 2018 paper the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D and two more genesis. And and so the reason I point to those three papers is as you can look at them and and consider the role of vitamin D in reducing inflammation.

03:59:21

I just took quickly coming to the point of vitamin D use in. Inflammation it is restricted specifically in the upper respiratory infection where your. Sales started responding and you generate some cytokines and lead them in the actually chile tools that's how it will becomes anti-inflammatory the main point of this I think is the how determine the health so my research spins around this cardiac health and determine the sometimes it is really helpful in using the stress through various mechanism where once you.

04:00:16

Have generated stress so it activates specific pathway which we called l2 so that downstream helps capturing the Ross and and promoting some good genes who which helps us fighting against any any kind of stress and this is also in the the cardiac function how we supplement it with astronauts often shelled in challenge to it vitamin D.

04:00:51

6, they do have one loss and they are that the good supplement is vitamin D3 in the heart actually it helps pumping because one of the major element of carrier function is calcium and its supplementary and and soca if vitamin deficiency has been very prominent so you have to be regular with vitamin D supplements and of course this been found with covalent 19 that it helps really in upper respiratory.

04:01:26

Information, which is specifically we considered as. In the lungs when when the contracted with cognitive vitamin D place a very crucial road thanks so so just ah have a second just to be clear when you said um captures Ross would you summarize that as an antioxidant process?

04:01:52

Or directly it don't act as a roast cavender, however the wind d3 boils down and helps downstream expressing energy to pathway. I don't really know whether you've been familiar with how this process all works it break down through through a enzyme which is called the cytochrome cytochrome some enzyme number.

04:02:22

I am forgetting but cytochrome yeah like before 50 or so. We think some some variant of it and then it activates a couple of couple of rows preventing genes, which is mainly NRF2 and NRF2 is actually a very helpful gene reducing your cell. Large stress so that's our similar mechanism and we use vitamin D to some time reduced trace in the cells that's basically like pan special right that's not localized to any particular organ that's a systemic effect right absolutely absolutely okay that knows who mechanism will be done in D3, at least it's always been supplemented as given as supplement directly medicine effect in.

04:03:22

Mostly bone loss case, we came across we generate some kind of model to simulate, however vitamin did always add such as supplement. Yeah and also vitamin D has been implicated as a down regulator of the renal and terms of system as well and that's thought to play some part or at least a hypothesized to play.

04:03:50

I don't know whether you know, but there have been some studies which have observation studies they were predominantly out of Spain but there was one that was conducted somewhere else so one using one used basin. Degree metabolite so it used a calcified dial at high doses it was a study conductor and they had you know, an extraordinary results so claimed for high dosage administration and vitamin D like kind of mega dosage administration in yeah hospital in hospitalized and I think in I'm not sure it was incubation patients, but the theorized role there was basically yeah an anti.

04:04:41

-flammatory role, which was a hypothesis being a down regulation of the rest you do know anything about that. Not like I cannot play right now remember maybe it's morning and maybe if I really looking into but of course with MMD did she's very am for me I think crucial role in enthrallial like adiabaska and our modern system what we work is stem cell derived atomicides we extract and we expose them to different microgravity and then we realize the, That the the stress which has been marked and we try to chill with the couple of cross scavenger and with the supplement like vitamin E vitamin D and we really observe that vitamin D also very helpful in the like bringing back the stress down and bring a restoring the contractility functions, so maybe my work area spins around that so I don't really like cannot inside missing something so I cannot answer right now.

04:06:00

Until sorry about that. I don't know what I wanted to say welcome every second is I think it's that the correct ways to your name is um, would you I I've never heard of a gravitational biologist before but I feel like I should have could you tell me about your work?

04:06:19

I'm just so interested. Okay, so I'm currently used to some in Germany and we're working with German aerospace center. It's similar to NASA where Ms. Research Center people work with different kind of modal system and basically we our team is looking for microgravity and it's and it's usability what does it mean like we have to utilize the ISS or international speciation for some better cause and where we can very quickly as utilize for the production where we cannot.

04:07:05

Skip gravity when we do some science in the lab, so what we do, we simulate gravity by several devices on the ground, we have parabolic flight which goes and simulate. Gravity for couple of second and different other like satellites small satellite rockets, and and of course you have ISS for real and then how does this happens because in stem cells they they've been resource that when you grow stem cells on space basically if you look at the bioreactor it continuously spin, it keeps the the cells in a floating condition, which is free falling a free falling, it's means like you.

04:07:56

You go to a ride and I don't know what's like the big wheel, you know, then you when you come back you really feel that you are losing or you are you are your weight becomes 0 and you are falling down so so this is a kind of scenario where your.

04:08:16

Body doesn't act in the in the similar direction of gravity vector so that is the idea like if we consider cells on microgravity condition, so we can produce a lot of cells compared to to ground, so these are the things which mostly me and my. Colleagues here we do so we do basically human biology to understand how we can simulate disease on on gravity condition in the zero, g or moon g or mass g then how it beneficial to to to the to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology being affected by gravity.

04:09:08

All by didn't take much time. Now, I I for me personally I I still would love to hear more but but it is anyone else have any questions about what they about. Gravitational biology.

04:09:29

We get a hand raise. I mean, bring this person up. Okay, so hi thanks for bringing me to this stage that's actually a very interesting enough like you are never heard of this before. I'm a neurologist. So I'm on the other side of the spectrum. I mean the clinical field.

04:09:48

So simple a couple of simple questions the first one is. What's your for the gravitational biology that you're studying. How much time of exposure to low gravity do you have by using these methods that you're around that you have at your hand? And then another question that must be it's probably very silly.

04:10:11

I just hope it doesn't sound inappropriate but how much money do you spend in these studies and who's funding it? Thank you. Hmm. Nice. The simulation studies did actually doesn't cost much. First of all that this simulations are ground waste where we create a rotation device. You can very quickly look maybe sometimes RPM random positioning machine.

04:10:37

So these are ground-based facilities which cost very nominal and your exposure time is on your hand depending on your expo experiments. Since it's a rotation so mostly the the exposure time limits to continuous exposure time limits for for our study or when we start when we expose the stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.

04:11:04

And the limits to forty hours the continuous exposure because since they are rotating and they are cells also generate some kind of gases and that's gases over the time accumulate and become very dangerous to the to the since the ones the cells produce the gas and the gas is bubble that bubble heats continuously so that brings another aspect of of physiological challenge than the gravity.

04:11:34

So before like because we studied 24 hour 48 hours. 72 hour. So then we realized okay 40 hours is very limited limiting time and pushing it to 72 hour we observe some some at a man's other bubble rated stress and scratch. So that that may be answered for the ground simulation and then we have parabolic light where you have only 20 seconds exposure, but that will be repeating for for 30 times.

04:12:08

So hyperbarity micro gravity, then hyper gravity is basically crazy flight which goes up and, Perform some maneuver where you generate hyperbarability then micro gravity, but those are very limited like 20 second so which is very tricky to design your essay and perform something which you want to achieve during that time then you have then you have rockets sounding rocket which goes and stays up to 15 seconds to some 15 minute 5 minute to 15 minute and they are also you have to very careful design some experiment and perform and then, You send some satellite which is sometimes come back sometimes and then you design your study accordingly what you want to get out from the experiment or you want to retry sample for some downstream study like gene expression some protein look out or you send it to ISS through the so you mostly so use now specs is ramping up it's a exploit so all the the institute are line up for the species and then it usually comes in sometimes two months three months of.

04:13:24

Our day drop it simply without astronauts traveling back this is how the the experiments goes in a line so ground base and parabolic flight then then rocket science rocket sounding rocket then then satellite and then ISS and also the money also goes in the same proposal for ground-breast study which do not much investment users small instrument and you create moon or marsh gravity and then you expose yourself it's very dominant.

04:13:56

The parabolic light like little bit expensive compared to ground which is like because of logistic because you have to support your experiment with some hardware so and then then of course sounding rocket another little bit high and satellite, of course, you have to. Budget for the maintenance for the radio team so and ISS yes that's also another big chunk of money goes there when you design some experiment because of mostly because of hardware limitations backups all these things we have to keep in plan because often space experiments a fun win challenge to with lot of failures and this is not ground that you will repeat again, so we have to send with some backups that's how also money money trends.

04:14:48

And you modify ask you I hope I'm not taking too much of everyone's time so what are you trying to measure here you trying to measure muscle contractility or are you trying to measure sales survival functional efficiency, what are your outcome measures for this please that is a good video because the hazard last question about vitamin D deficiency, that's how I ended up here, so we when we expose the cells these are the very unique.

04:15:23

Kind of. Cells and symptoms cell derived we came across this this heart cells it's they've been when we expose we find a whole parameter. I am like movement change we find mitochondrial changes, we find stress huge phase being on here, we did some all the parameter basically proteomics transcriptomics, then we saw some imaging and expressions there are lot of.

04:15:58

Things actually change calciums so this the basic function is if you stay long in floating condition or free flowing condition, so your heart needs to behave different way and we have to generate that signal just by quick example if I say this imagine the fees the fees is actually swimming in the river and you see they are saved changes why it is like that and how it cope with beyonds because that weight is less and they they do not have to pump.

04:16:33

Blood to their tail and that's how their tail is the the more compared to thinner compared to their belly but as case of human when we when the heart pumps blood so that we cope up with our leg when we are in ground the moment we go to space and try to offload our heart doesn't respond that way our heart becomes very slowly they try to pump blood and then often since astronaut fly they.

04:17:08

They they they develop a syndrome called chicken leg so that leg become thin because the pressure is no more they are and the blood supply become also no may not because they don't use it they don't use it neither there's something pulling factor and gravity. I have then this is why we have to understand why this and how we can help by understanding the hard physiology how we can if we are planning to.

04:17:38

To explore moon for long time for mass longer time how we can help at the same time how we can model the cardiac biology for the ground, what are the new things we observe and how we can for the aging for one we interesting thing we found that when we simulate with the we use cardio cells for the simulation we found that they are becoming the aged cardiac cells, so which to very good model can be for some some of drugs when people go age.

04:18:13

And how they can go for with the aged heart. Mmm. I'm not taking much time now please so I kind of can I just say so I saw the reason I come to clubhouse and the reason I create groups like this is because I want to hear from the expert so if if if George who's a neurologist and Abby Saka who is a gravitational biologist want to spend the next hour asking each other questions.

04:18:40

I am fine with that if anyone else wants to ask them questions. I'm fine with that, so I'm just going to meet myself and listen. For my amazing my case is yes mica. Mike I guess Mike yeah, thanks Mike it's very hard to ask questions when you know, very little.

04:18:58

Objects obviously I can now I can ask open questions and let him talk because he sounds like a very interesting guy, but I think I I think if anyone has a more directed question I was thinking initially maybe this this group is studying this thinking about future colonizations of the outer space and that sounds very interesting but I I have read a lot about space and physiology and I I have learned before about muscle and bone did.

04:19:33

Degeneration and all these things but I don't think I I ever had anything about heart muscle so that's really interesting and I think so has a question.

04:19:50

Now that was it yeah thank you that's really interesting. I want I hope one day someone does the same with nerve cells with neurons that'll be very true they do they do because when the fluids sleep the the fruits sit throughout the the head it creates a tension in and the brain and it actually pushes the brain and it tried to to corner the brain the the fluid shift happens in the space and where the sensory been lost so people are.

04:20:25

Really doing lot of. CNA study and how they can help because I think I can remember which group I think rightly from amps and here in German also they are doing a professor professional and for getting his name professor Bunga probably they they have a good research team on the on the neural activities and how I think I'm if you don't mind me interrupting.

04:20:57

I think you would be very interesting to see what business to microtubule train. Ing sport and not the reason why I'm interested in this is because there are some fears because we don't know what consciousness is and the sense of self is and there's a lot of people thinking that microtubular function is key in this type of fun yeah function in the nerve cells so as wondering whether and I'll probably look it up whether this is something that might be pointing that in space or consciousness has a different way of working do we get more biject or more sharp when we are in space and what sort of effects that would have enough cell transport yeah.

04:21:37

Yeah, I think this is a very interesting area forking. I think I'm sure pretty sure people are working on it, they they're pretty. I'm pretty sure it's. Some. And even when when we read reports from people who came back from space and they started having having different thoughts and maybe seeing things that they don't see not.

04:22:02

I'm not talking about hallucinations, but facing reality on a different way. Oh God, he might be sorry.

04:22:12

Cuz I'm accident on my part. Oh, no, that's okay. Excuse me. But that's fine. I don't I don't like the sound of my voice that much show up. I like when people talk with me but I think I wonder whether this is what causing the astronauts and people who work in space you have this sort of thoughts when they come back and they become very introspective.

04:22:33

Yes, yes, that means that is a club. I think a couple of. Nineties come from from the from the NASA Ames and who do real human astronauts behavior study and I think you guys probably know this twin study where Scott and Mark been thoroughly studied for the closely one year they've been in space and there are a lot of.

04:23:02

Skin sensories, they found been changed in Scott and they that was not been even published so it was been a good discussion in in class as well. I think you should follow Jim I think he is in the some some other club though their team is studying the the the entire.

04:23:25

Homemix and the physiology that you can get some good insight. I'm sure this is no I'm for me why this because when astronaut comes back they develop a syndrome called orthostatic endurance, which is like if it's simple terms I explain like if you are sitting for a while and you suddenly try to stand up you fall down because your heart doesn't really understand that whether how when we stand up your hat is to produce more place.

04:24:00

To pump blood to to brain and to your leg and that time your heart get confused and it doesn't. Doesn't pump that way the way you expect it. So astronauts are fall down. And it's a common feature in some of the neurological conditions like garnets because I was able to develop autonomicing sufficiency, that's why we call it.

04:24:26

Yes, he has that's why I say this and there were exactly we are trying to address at one part at least to boost the heart and, Make it somewhere we can able to address and and exactly their the the neural thing involved which not my area research. Sounds like artificial gravity is going to be really important for long distance travel.

04:24:56

Yes, they are creating their I think Boeing or Boeing is constructing one circular simulator, which will be continuously rotating and creating a gravity to help with the astronauts health. Yeah, that's the that's the right news you have.

04:25:23

Okay. I'm I said done if you anyone. Um, so I know I was I was just started. So Jen, welcome to the room. Did you want to tell us a little bit about what you do? Oh, hey, sorry about that by the way. Well right now I'm just a student and for electrical engineering and I just kind of do side projects for research like with other friends in different departments, you know.

04:25:51

And mostly just kind of like we're reading their paper and kind of rewriting it sometimes. So I kind of just jump into a random fields not really but yeah, I kind of switched over from the medical side. Which I did for my first degree and then I ended up deciding that kind of hate that so now I'm trying out electrical engineering, which is why I'm in this group.

04:26:21

Because it kind of coincides with me each other. I think. Yeah, that's that's a that's exactly right. So so you've got the you've got the medical side of things and then electrical engineering is you know at the point where we're connecting devices to our biology so that we can we can try to read and write to the biology but you're but you want to be an electrical engineering side of things that's very interesting.

04:26:46

Yeah, I just kind of want to. Think of honestly and kind of be in my own world instead of working with the people to be honest and well, I actually live in Oklahoma where Boeing is and so we've got Boeing Tinker Air Force. Yeah, quite a few programs around here for specifically that and what you guys were talking about as well because yeah, there's quite a few electrical and engineers around here this.

04:27:19

So, I'm sorry, keep going. No, I'm good. Thank you. I was gonna say can you speak to specific programs that that are happening around that happening or around the there are happening anywhere that's doing about in terms of combining electrical engineering with with biology with it with the brain or with the heart.

04:27:44

Just in Oklahoma, or just in general. I thought to first ask you about Oklahoma, but if but if you want to mention others is fine. Well, Oklahoma. He has a stepped up their game and with a robotic surgery.

04:28:03

Usually to be honest because of the fact that I was in the Farmersville pool side of things more like so I didn't really get to see more of the biological terms where it would with, uh, With with the networking that I've done. I'm kind of like I feel like a newborn which is kind of why I've been jumping around in these groups to kind of actually figure out a way through this with trying to work on different projects and see which one I want to actually work on specifically because we also have like prosthetics as a huge thing over here the way it's like this one company that kind of done it for like decades or so.

04:28:56

It's asking feel free to mention these companies by the way. I'll write them down and clear my list later. I'm going to share um, I can tell you later. I'm not going alright. I kind of get a really flustered when I talk to you know, a lot of people.

04:29:12

The problems I'm sorry, maybe real. Maybe we have to run. That you've explained help us understanding your part of science and technology is a biggest part which I think slowly getting infused to to biology and nano sensors even if I think the way which we are seeing also you must been hard about neural links, right?

04:29:46

And then what did you say with that last part numeral links from your links? Yes, so that's happening in the implantation in the organ label but in cellular. Label also we are looking for some nano chips which can go into single cells and give us some output. So this is been also in a lot of already one been published but that's with the with the group of cells or we call it organoids, but we are trying to to to make some nano materials, which.

04:30:25

Can be can be good to the cell and then outside we can read their signals. So maybe we need engineering team which and they're who have knowledge about signal readouts out there and these are the facts also we are currently looking at at in a large scale so how you can do the future studies.

04:30:51

As really interesting. I am I actually have to read that in the next couple days and if you don't mind I would love to discuss it with you or you know within the group or whatever appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks. Jen, can you explain alternating current to me? I'm not kidding.

04:31:16

This is just like, To say something in any language. I literally go blank. I'm not lying. I couldn't even sit think of hello or get everyone. Everyone I meet who has any kind of qualified relationship to electricity. I ask them to explain alternating current to me, you know much like, You know in a certain type of restaurant there's a certain dish you want to ask for to find out how they do and I've actually I have not yet met anyone who really felt confident.

04:31:52

That they could explain it the most qualified people really as ignorant because I'm literally looking it up right now. Not my field but as I understand it ultimately ultimately current is to do with the efficiency that you achieve by switching. And with direct current there's an attenuation a loss over time and the basic thing with alternating current is the phase prevents the yeah, the loss of transmission has understand it.

04:32:25

Actually now I think about it. I do have a book that I haven't finished. I was actually that I had a graph about that. Oh as you sent me just left the room I just posted two studies to my profile which explained the importance of vitamin D receptors in the heart how it down regulates the arena and tense instances them and also if you knock out vitamin D receptors in the vascular endothelium, you get a drop in nitric oxide so I thought that would be useful to astronauts but I guess they'll have to get by.

04:33:06

You guys like to check on my gig thanks a lot. Michael thanks very much for the informality my ability to come.

04:33:20

Thanks Chris so you know some right on. Hey Dexter did you say that was on your Twitter? I'm like looking on your profile here Twitter, so I can get that link. I.

04:33:32

My profile. I've actually posted this study titles for both of those things. You should find it. Okay. I got it. I'm gonna I'm gonna write it down or maybe I'll screenshot.

04:33:50

Yeah, it's just the these things are so complex and there are so many different areas of research that you meet people who are often quite specialized in the field and there's just so much to know that as a I think that several people have said it's surprising sometimes what some people don't know it was just too much to know and also to figure out what's relevant to what kind of tricky Jen how are you doing on AC current?

04:34:19

I just I have. Yeah, just a vacant tuition that it's to do with phase and efficiency so that you don't get lost when you're transmitting energy of a long distances. Think that's the big thing about ACDC, but you may know better. I say you might be completely correct and it seems like with also it kind of does with the pulsating in the alternating yes and the current of that but um.

04:34:55

Yeah now I have learned that I forgot everything at the beginning, you know, all your general studies. I added. I'm actually having to start over entirely in the mathematics. You got quiet you became quiet. Oh, sorry. I don't know what happened there. But oh gosh, I lost my train of thought.

04:35:22

So something about starting over in mathematics and then yeah, it was I could think I'm just having a pork connection that's showing me that. So if you guys want to go ahead and talk. Oh. I think it's just my room. It's just like that.

04:35:45

Alright, well, I'm I'm getting pretty tired over here. I I guess I can leave the room and to you folks if you want or or I don't know what you want to do, but. Actually likewise yeah, I've got stuff by I'd like to get on with but um, I just want to say like it's just so interesting to me that you and I both sat down yeah as kind of expertise in different subject areas basically the same time and looked at basically the same thing and that's pretty cool.

04:36:19

It's really interesting to hear your perspective on that and especially to yeah, I mean, I think it's so great. It's a general phenomena of the pandemic that anyone. Who kind of yeah so many people wanted to help right and so it's just so interesting that you investigated these things and engage with them and it'll be yeah, especially interesting to hear a short noise perspective on it and just say do you have time for that yet course at school to be decided?

04:36:54

I will. I haven't heard back yet. So I'll I'll post on Twitter or I don't know. I'll probably talk to you before that. I guess if you're on clubhouse again. Yeah, that'll be great cool. Yeah, I'm sure okay or anyway thanks for the roof and yeah. I'll be on my way.

04:37:11

Thanks to everyone and yeah just to say super cool that you do that and really interesting and, Perspective on it and yeah to empty a chance could be super cold all righty catch you catch you guys later, okay. I'm just gonna say good night everybody. I think well we're probably close the room.

04:37:31

And all right goodnight, thank you.
