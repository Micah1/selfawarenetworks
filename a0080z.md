Pixels, seeing nerve cells as like pixels lighting up on a transparent background for other not firing pixels & their tonic oscillations to collectively listen to

To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing itâ€™s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative. The neuron understands how many little dots were needed from which direction before it became overwhelmed and had to fire, there is a literal three dimensional chemical counting process going on with a dendrite collecting charged ions in various branches, or the soma collecting charges (from soma branches with the pyramidal cell) increasing or decreasing its likelihood to fire or its readiness to fire (turning the volume up or now on its readiness to recognize certain patterns (or recall certain events or people or names, do you ever play tetris for hours and then see tetris shapes when you close your eyes, imagine that your cells that are recognizing shapes have their readiness to recognize those kinds of patterns turned up.)

So just as something that appears as pixels close up appears to be an image from far away, so too could a frame of consciousness that is barely a distinction between two temporal patterns (a distinction made by attention, when some of the brain fires and other parts of the brain are inhibited and other parts are listening or predicting their turn to fire in the temporal sequence) so to could a frame of consciousness take on the appearance of irreduce-able human experience if seen at a larger temporal scale, or with many frames considered all at once, or basically with the frames sped up enough.

An action potential is not passed on from one neuron to the next, the spike does not travel between neurons, instead the spike is broken up into little chemical sacs containing neurotransmitters, that diffuse the spike across the branches of the exit terminal distributing one large spike so that it is read by many neurons downstream as small spikes connected to their postsynaptic membrane. Imagine instead of exit terminal branching that the spike was being chopped up into small pieces and distributed radially like a solar flare being flung out from the sun, going in many places at once, not to one neuron, but to many.

A large spike might cause more vesicles to be released, resulting in a larger synaptic spike for each of the receiving neurons, more vesicles means more neuro-transmitters are released, and it indicates that more receptors on the receiving membrane are opened up. Which could mean things like more potassium channels opening, more sodium channels opening, it could change the shape of the spike in the next neuron if the repolarization happens faster because a greater number neurons 

But the idea is this, what each layer of neurons is representing is like a series of star bursts read by the next layer of neurons, but not just starburst, also dark spots, negative action potentials, or inhibited neurons, because neurons fire in tonic oscillations, there is an expectation they are creating that they will continue to fire, if they stop, there is a dark spot in the wall of neurons between the first layer and the second layer of neurons

So if you could imagine a screen between the layers of neurons, with bright spots, and dark spots, but they are rendering higher level features at each layer to the next layer.
