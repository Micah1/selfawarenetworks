what I do
what I want

this is what I do
who I help
what solution I provide

and this is what I am looking for now

I work with entreprenuers, business leaders, students, althletes like pro golfers, adult adhd, autism, adults with ptsd

who may want to perform better, who struggle with stress, and or need optimal brain chemistry, for creativity, confidence, focus

so my solution is to harness the latest research on brain plasticity with a novel new usage of existing technologies combining neurofeedback, with brainwave entrainment, with both light and sound effects attached to your brainwave patterns, to create an engaging, stimulating, surreal, altared brain states that stimulate your whole mind, resulting in more happiness, more creative ideas, more confidence, built on the principles of the new science of "brain plasticity"
