(ATP, synap, dendrite, criteria, causation, neuron)
*Your lack of fitness, your lack of willpower, and your depression may all have a common cause. I bet it has nothing to do with evolution, culture, the human condition, your conditioning, your epigenetics, your heritage, your feelings and instead that it has everything to do with your metabolism, what your eating is causing the depression, lack of willpower, and the being out of shape at the same time. If you increase your ATP production your cells will be able to make more energy, and that means more zest for life, no more depression, more willpower, and more fitness.

To take a page from Paleo diet theory, our metabolism is about 200,000 years old, we are genetically similar to humans from 200,000 years ago, and only recently in the past 10,000 years people have started to eat wheat and beans, but it really got a lot worse since the industrial revolution. Wheat and beans have all these nasty anti-nutrients that clog metabolism, then processed sugar and flour came along and now people are able to consume toxic amounts of sugar and wheat very quickly. Since humans have not evolved very much in the last 200,000 years this really isn't about our evolution, but instead it's about our metabolism, respecting our metabolism with the foods we eat, and the nutrients we get.

Willpower might be a myth in some sense, if your body is unable to produce enough energy that might feel like you have little willpower, if your body is able to produce a lot of energy that might feel like a lot of willpower, to your cells energy is ATP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate so you could take supplements like Dribose, Creatine, Nad, Acetyl-l-carnitine, 7-keto, Nadh, and you can stop eating grains, beans, and sugar (including sweet fruit, juices, and smoothies) and eat a diet that is 60 percent fat and I guarantee that will empower your willpower a hundred fold, because your metabolism will be producing a lot of ATP, you will be building muscle, losing fat, and feeling like a little deity. fyi I have only lost 170 pounds since January 2010 and gone from size 58 pants to size 36 pants. So it worked for me.

There is the issue of choices, or the inner mechanisms of learning from errors and change, its about cell based criterial causation, neurons recognize information as coincidences in the timed firing of other neurons, and the transmission of neurotransmitters resets the coincidence detection firing criteria of other neurons, what fires are axons, and dendrites, the criteria is not only synaptic weight from neurotransmitters, its also spines, dendritic spines which change rapidly, and they are connected to the mitochondria in the neurons, the mitocondria create ATP in the aerobic metabolism of a cell, and they work so hard they import ATP from glial cells that are interconnected with the neurons metabolism. So if you don't think ATP has anything to do with your executive function, think again.

If you didn't realize this sentence I guarantee this will empower your willpower a hundred fold] was intended to be funny and not serious, then I must clarify, it's humor. There are no real guarantees in biology and everybody knows this. Please don't make fun of me for using humor to promote a really cool idea with a lot of research behind it. The idea that metabolism is at the core of energy production, cell function, decision making, willpower, and executive function isn't a controversial one. It's an ordinary idea, and what I am sharing is akin to sharing a cheese platter, you don't have to eat. I'm not pushing "The Answer" on anyone. 

I do not mean to imply that ATP enhances or creates either habits or traits. Since ATP is energy, having more ATP means having more energy. Having more energy does change the criteria that is considered in the deliberative process of decision making. For example if I have a hundred times more energy I might plan a very active day, I may choose to get ten times the tasks done, I may work out extra hard at the gym, I might do these things, but also I might not. Having more energy can change some of my criteria that goes into my decision making process, but there are other reasons, other criteria that are factored into my decision making process, and its possible that no new behavior results. Having more ATP makes a difference and you might choose to be more physically active, I know that was true for me. I went from a sedentary life, weighing 405 pounds, to an active life weighing 235. I actually go to the gym six days a week, and I walk for hours outside the gym daily. My 405 pound self could not keep up because his energy was going into fat sacks, leaving his muscles weak, his metabolism was inhibited by grains, beans, juice, and smoothies, so his (my) ATP production was really low. A sister once said to me, when I was that heavy, that I was "not trying hard enough". At that time I might have been scratching my head wondering why my willpower was so weak. When I started optimizing my ATP production it all changed, I had more energy, so I wanted to workout, or walk for seven hours, or climb stairs, taking my dogs with me. Eventually I was running which I don't do now because its high impact. Will ATP empower your willpower?  I said suggested it in humor, but its interesting to think about. Did I become more active because I had more energy? Would you become more active if you had more energy?
