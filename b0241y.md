It sounds like a platelet cell might share properties with a neural network because has to be aware of its surroundings to actually work.

it has to recognize different kinds of patterns has to recognize, has to be preloaded with specific patterns because it's preloaded with specific RNA molecules, right.

07:49

And each of these RNA molecules are supposed to basically address certain problems. So in order to in order to fire off a specific RNA molecule because there's all these specialized or any molecules that are given from the mother care cell, okay? So there's all these different instructions that has been given, but it doesn't program these themselves, it receives them from another cell so it receives like a package of missiles.

08:19

And each of these missiles is meant for. As is has a is met first specific type of thing. So it has like it just like vocabulary of responses that can fire. But in order to like respond with its own vocabulary, it has to recognize the pattern, so it is by itself, a pattern recognition device, the pattern recognition device.

08:42

That's it's like a it's like a it's like a weapon that's loaded with a bunch of different weapons and so or it's loaded with a depth bunch of different methods. So it's it's like a weapon that's looking for a bunch of different patterns. So that is like what? So the plate of cell could use a bunch of different patterns.

08:59

Like in a sense it's like a bunch of different scenarios provides a different things, you know, the best of situations that it can detect attacked. And so there are certain situations in which it needs to reach out and call other playlist cells or call white blood cells, or call different types of cells, okay?

09:18

So, it's gonna release certain certain RNA molecules to call certain cells. But in order to release those certain molecules, it has to recognize a pattern and the way patents has to. So you have one platelet cell has to recognize a pattern. And so it's like, so we? So I'm saying like well one platelet cell is a computer but not only is one place a cell computer at one point this cell is by itself until network that dispatches messages to other neural networks.

09:51

A pattern recognition, a sequence recognition the temple spatial phasic resin recognition. Pattern recognition has to be physic temple spacial physics because you can have a pattern because like a piano is a pattern is like piano music. Okay, so music has these like I guess me. I wanted I want to argue the music has facial characteristics, right?

10:13

But but in truth music has basic characteristics and temporal characteristics. Temporal and physic music is temporal and basic, right? Like a note is a phasic identity? Notice physic and notice hurts, right? I don't know. Just music at what are the different qualities because I guess you might have to say, I don't know temple, spatial phase, it would be hurts.

10:49

The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.

11:34

That's a small chain reaction, okay? But so that's like a neural circuit but that neural circuit might cause more neurons to like it's it might, it might cause a group oscillation like that is, that is basically, the norm of the brain is that neurons fire in groups of oscillations.

12:00

But they're driven by the microscopic oscillations at the root of it at the root of every big oscillation. There's like a whole tree of microscopic, oscillations. Let's just say that the small oscillations drive to big oscillations but it is also been. It's also been argued success. I believe successfully at the big oscillation actually modulate and regulate the small oscillations and you'll see that when there is, you'll see that.

12:39

Because okay, here's the thing. If you have in the supercharges medic, nucleus? Right? Let's say if I, it hires that, what what does it fire at? Oh gosh. I forget, but let's just say fires like you have 20 million neurons. They're all firing at the same frequency, all right?

12:58

They're all firing, maybe I don't know if it's 20 hertz or 60 hertz or what, I can't remember at the moment. But but you have 20 million neurons and they're all firing this in oscillation the psych. Okay? It's like, well, wait a second, I have huge numbers of neurons.

13:13

Yes, but huge number of neurons oscillate together. So, it's not like you it's not like

13:26

It. I mean, it's not like there's no for, it's like there's no forms and structures inside the brain. There's a structure of oscillations, okay? And and that means that the supercharges super charismatic. Nucleus is one of the structures of oscillations because it is specifically, a group of 20 million neurons that all oscillate together.

13:46

Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.

14:09

This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.

14:45

So you have a group and there their wheel. There's that an actual electromagnetic force, that is pushing through the brain and this oscillation this electromagnetic wave that's oscillating. And if which is means it's it's it goes on and through cycles, like a heartbeat like a heartbeat, just think of a heartbeat is oscillation is like a heartbeat of electromagnetism.

15:10

It's like, oh, it's big and it's big. In fact, your heart beat is also, waves is an oscillation of electromagnetism. That is also one example of of cells oscillating together. They're all oscillating together and they exert a much more electromagnetic force. And then one cell would have they have the kind of electromagnetic force that can move muscle and that's much greater than what a single neuron can do.

15:43

And so oscillations are sort of at the root of how neural activity can drive movement. So you can have. So brain is going to have lots of different neurons. But these neurons are going to work together to move a lot of energy. They're going to move a lot of energy.

16:05

A lot of electromagnetism and that is going to exert a sort of physical control over muscle and so on organism can move an organism can move muscle and it can in muscle, of course, is protein. So there's an tremendous amount of basically Harley coordinated movement. That is enabled when neurons, when groups, of neurons can drive muscle movements but how the muscle moves, well, it matters a lot to the muscles in the survive and so it's the revolution the movement of muscle and has that has favored the growth of brains.

16:53

And so we keep getting, you know, our brains of all the human brains of to be very big because we needed to coordinate a muscle and in in really, really precise ways. So navigate a very complex world, and, you know what happens is, like, if we are, they care if we're the caretakers of other life, then where we continue to be dot to dominate all of the life.

17:31

That if we fail to take care of other life, the other life, the basically that just means other life is is out of our control and over the course of evolution could could become more out of our control. That's this, that's that's not something I'm worried about. But I'm just saying like you know, if in a long enough timeline, if you're not able to control viruses or bacteria or like basically like the evolution of life.

18:10

Like, what if we? Okay, so, I mean, I guess it is possible actually that we could start to have really and really intelligent self aware computers that the really intelligent, but different because they, they have the sort of architectural, accomplishments of a brain and muscle. But with with different with different needs like they in order to like exist and to sort of like continue to exist.

18:44

I mean, it's at this point, like they there's a huge. This was like and we can't even get to the point where we can talk about how their dependency on human beings is is ever going to end. Like we can't even like imagine that machines are going to be independent from mankind, we cut.

19:06

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

from this point onward the note is about a science fiction story idea that is not relevant to the book but is interesting enough to include in the notes, the audio transcription needs to fixed for clarity, its barely readable

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

But because, but they could become sufficiently intelligent. That someday people will be discussing well shit. What you know, what if the what what does it mean? If this thing becomes out of control in this and they maybe that means it's just escapes and hides or get or or you know, manages to get off the planet and you know, at a speed that we can't catch up to maybe it, it embeds it.

19:41

So maybe it starts to embed itself inside people and animals and plants and like like a little bug, it just flies around into somebody's ear and takes over their brain and just caught and then just like causes them to go crazy mad and who's going right? And they dislike things, like it can take over someone's mind and then, that person becomes a soldier that eliminates like, like everyone else, it becomes a terminator.

20:16

Like it's like the terminator is like this bug that takes over any person and takes over their mind and then uses their body to attack you. And so just like, yeah. So like there's a whole new concept for me and then, yeah. And then the other will. The other concept was wait a second.

20:40

We could we could actually go to have that to hold their perceiver right where I make a basically. It's a

21:03

Another receiver is like, okay so imagine a the machine's are like they know exactly which protein sequence to fire in order to make exactly which protein shape they need. And so they're able to basically program proteins and program biological structures. And so you could have an AI beholder perceiver that is like the it's like a monster movie.

21:37

It's like a monster movie. So it's like to be holder from dungeons and dragons, just had all these eyeballs, but what if like okay, but to these eyeballs like so the computer ship could could reprogram any flesh to fold, any proteins from any flesh, so it could disassemble flesh in real time and turn it into something else.

21:59

Okay, so yeah. So it's like I can take your proteins and and to end like it can grow like a new eye out of your skin. It can like change your skin to become whatever it wants, and so if it can next, if it touches you, then it affects you.

22:24

And the thing is like, what's cooler? Like the eyeballs, like I thought of them as, like, sort of like mindless and out of control, but I never thought of them as like an AI. Do you know what I mean? So we were being chased down the street by these balls balls.

22:44

I balls we're being chased down the street and I was running from them and I was trying to leap into the air fly away like Superman because they're just coming everywhere. Just like eyeballs bouncing down the street with long, just like that. That okay. What is the thing on the beach?

23:01

That that with the long seaweed and the seaweed has this ball and there's like a long tail. It looks kind of like like like a tadpole. Looks like a tadpoles a tadpole is like a baby from the baby frog, right. The thing that becomes a frog especially it's just like it has this bulb and it has a tail and that's how like these eyeballs are just like bouncing.

23:29

Like it was just burst out of. So if someone was infected with the rest with the the disease it which just jump out of there skin and into someone else's skin. So like you could be walking down the street and you like, if you get too close to someone and an eyeball go back like make a little mouth or something and like put on hand.

24:07

And and even if you brush it off real quick like it's like even if anybody touches the ambassador real quick, the machine operates at the genetic level. Like it's once it's DNA is on you. It invades you like a virus and uses your own cells to reproduce itself into a machine again and then it begins to turn your body into a factory.

24:35

So you have like after you've been after you've made in contact with it, you have like 45 minutes, it's depends on how much is permitted. You. But if it only touched you, you have like 45 minutes. No. No, no. Actually, we have to correlate this. So it has to be, like, the amount of service area that you've been exposed to.

24:56

has to use your body to energy without killing you. So the so the thing is like, okay, so the only way I could do that is it would have to like grow it would have to grow very, very slowly.

25:21

So if it barely touches you, then you have days because it has to grow very, very slowly. You have days but at the growth slowly and begins to turn the individual in. It begins to like like you might start growing eyeballs all over the place right? And and you might fall you might fall like you maybe you hide because you have these eyeballs going out of you, do you hide somewhere you go to the oriented in the hospital under and and so what happens is that you okay, wow, so I'm gonna start this and like leave that the sci-fi part of it and that into it at the end because that will blow people smile.

26:07

So just like, it's like start with just the eyes. Okay, and then we'll like but like we were like, we won't explain it until like the end, so like but they'll be part like, it'll be partially explained like people like will understand that there is like a rogue AI.

26:30

But like, like until like, there's gonna be like, okay, so first, you like him, like, you don't meet the monster, like, there's a like, so, like you start on just a French. Like, this thing is so weird that you, you're just like, you're out on the fringe and your encountering, these eyeballs, and don't know what's happening and your whole town gets taken over, right?

26:56

It's sort of like raccoon city, right? You don't know what's happening though and then at the end, like the cop wins but then he's, he like he gets a drop on his hand and then and then like, at the end of the tournament, I can hide, his hand is like an eyebrow but looks like he had him from underneath the skin of his hand.

27:18

Like at the top of his of his hand, is his training translucent, and there's an eye like that. Wow, this is gonna be an awesome story.
