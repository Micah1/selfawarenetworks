(electromagnetism, emotion)
I'm quoting myself making the same point in the same debate with two totally separate people 
"Mathematics is not outside reality. Information can't be separated from physical reality. Information is physical, despite the fact that it can transfer between physical mediums. Your ideas are based in the illusion called dualism, where you think your mind and abstract thoughts are not unified with the physical universe, but everything is electromagnetism, your brainwaves, yourself, your information, your thoughts, your emotions, your brain, your body, the earth, the cosmos, its all physical, math is physical, I reject the conclusions of your article. I believe that my conclusion is supported in part by constructor theory."
