# SciSummary Summary:

The paper explores the self-aware networks theory of mind, discussing how neuroscience decodes neural correlates and the inner representation of reality in the brain.

The main concept is the Neural Array Projection Observation Tomography (NAPLOT), which posits that different cells in the brain act as both detectors and broadcasters of images and sounds.

Brain activity is bound together by oscillations, and consciousness is explained as a space of oscillating activity.

The author compares the brain to a computer rendering graphics, emphasizing that everything we perceive is composed of phase wave differentials, or vibrations.

The fabric of consciousness is described as a vibration, aligning with ideas from Abraham Hicks.

The discussion also touches upon the author's website containing detailed notes and recordings, as well as the Neuralace Podcast on YouTube.

The paper engages in a conversation about consciousness, oscillations, and vibrations, and how the brain predicts the future and makes beliefs.

The author asserts that every belief is a vibration and that all entities are interconnected through phase wave rhythms.

The self-aware networks theory adds depth to the understanding of consciousness and brain activity, contemplating intricate concepts related to the nature of reality and perception.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription:

 Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and try to explain my theory of mind in a short period of time, and I'm going to record myself explaining it to Halo here.

 So the main example is, you can see that what neuroscience does is they look for neural correlates and they try to decode what the neural correlates are.

 So you might get into an MRI machine, or you might do an EEG scan.

 And they'll get some signals from you.

 And in the case of MRI, you'll get images.

 And they represent your blood flow activity that correlates with when you were thinking this, when you were thinking that, when you were seeing this, when you were seeing that, when you were thinking that, when you were seeing this, when you were seeing that, when you were hearing this, or hearing that, and they try to figure out, okay, what does this movement, blood flow in the image mean in terms of your brain activity, in terms of, does it correlate to what you were seeing or hearing when the medical imaging happened? But the question is, okay, well, if you have a representation, the idea is, okay, you have a representation of what you're seeing and hearing inside your brain that can be measured, but how is it that that turns into something that you can see? The hard problem is, how does the inner representation that's measured in terms of the changes of biology, in terms of your cells and your, the cell activity, the electrical activity, the blood activity, how does that become something that is your internal representation of reality? What you're seeing, what you're hearing, right? How does it get there? And so the self-aware networks theory of mind, like the core of it is called NAPOT, it's called Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography.

 It's like imagine that, it's like where's the inner, it's like you said the question is where's the inner screen that is representing the world, and what's observing the inner screen? Because if you just had an inner screen and an observer inside your head, well, how does that that observer work because it's like this is a smaller observer it's just shrinking the problem right so the idea is where is the inner observer and where's the inner screen and the idea is that all the different cells of your brain all the different parts of your brain there are each inner screens that are also observing.

 They're each producing an image that other parts are observing.

 And so you have cells in your eye will receive an image and they all detect what the image is and they all output signals to other cells.

 And so you have the first the first set of cells that receives the image is the first neural array, and their output is like a TV screen blast to the next set of cells, and the next set of cells is now also an observer.

 It's observing the signals that came to it, and it's outputting something to the set of cells behind it.

 So you have many, many different arrays of cells that are each detecting and broadcasting.

 So each cell is a detector and a broadcaster, or a sensor and a transmitter.

 So you have a distributed sensing and transmitting.

 Observation is detection, and it's detecting the observations.

 Anyway, so then the question is okay well how do things bind how do if you're making representations your brain how to be blind together and and there was a neuroscientist who's there's many neuroscientists who've explored this topic and your brain activity is bound together with oscillations, electric oscillations, chemical oscillations, and there's a... but specifically the electricity and the waves and heat and the magnetism, electromagnetism, so it's also magnetic waves, they're all basically creating, there's two kinds of things happening.

 One is you have a tonic oscillation, which is like a baseline oscillation, so you have just regular activity going.

 And then you have the new activity that differs from that baseline activity.

 So that is the stuff that, so you have just regular activity going.

 And then you have the new activity that differs from that baseline activity.

 So that is the stuff that... So you have... It's almost like... If you imagine your brain as a canvas, the tonic oscillation is the canvas, and the new activity that comes in is the ink on the canvas.

 So what you're conscious of is the ink on the canvas.

 So, what you're conscious of is the space, so imagine the consciousness is like a space that your brain is of oscillating activity.

 And oscillation binds that space together.

 And the new activity that comes in changes the oscillating activity that's there, and it creates what's what you know, engrams or what I call phase wave differentials because they are differentiating from the wave that's there and their phases, their waves, their waves that are caused by disturbances like when when you see something, what they're measuring, they're measuring the differences in your brain activity, that is a difference that happened because of something that's outside of you caused a difference inside of you and that difference is a phase wave differential and it oscillates or ricochets through your brain wave oscillation through your cell your brain and cell matrix and it creates these these patterns in time and space wave patterns and these make up everything that you see.

 Everything you see is a dominant, like if I hold up a box of like, you know, Trader Joe's onion confit swirls, right, or golden rounds crackers, these are dominant in your consciousness because they're dominant phase wave differentials.

 Or they're dominant differences, and the differences are materially consisting of waves that are ricocheting through your brain.

 And so basically the concept is that your brain is like an artificial neural network, your brain is rendering graphics, computer graphics.

 It's like you're a robot.

 You are a robot that was evolved.

 It's like all of us are robots that evolved.

 And we're graphically rendering reality to ourselves.

 So it's like your brain is a computer and it's making images and the images are sparsely distributed across the whole brain and it's making sounds and the sounds are sparsely distributed across the whole brain and the whole brain is not only distributing images and sounds across the whole brain it's detecting images and sounds across the whole brain and when those images and sounds oscillate together they bind together in dominant phase wave differential rhythms and then they make up the fabric of consciousness.

 And you got it! That was it! It took only seven minutes and you got it.

 That was it.

 It took only seven minutes and you got it.

 You got the concepts.

 That's the self-aware networks theory of mind.

 There were so many questions I had to answer as you were going but I didn't want to interrupt.

 Go ahead.

 Let's hear the questions.

 That's the problem is I would think of the question but I was just so into what you were saying that I lost it so I need to like think about it.

 Like everything that you said.

 I would think of the question, but I was just so into what you were saying that I lost it.

 So I need to think about it, like everything that you said.

 Alright, so Estelle, go ahead and answer any other questions.

 I mean this one's kind of off topic, but how the brain dies with Alzheimer's.

 But it's not really related.

 It is related.

 Oh, okay.

 Yeah.

 Yeah, I'm just kind of like, because I had a friend's mom who had an early onset Alzheimer's and I literally saw her basically just her brain dying and everything dying.

 And it was very devastating to me because I'm like.

 That's actually what happens with Alzheimer's.

 Their brain cells are dying.

 But what freaked me out was one kind of thought in my mind was experiencing that made me feel like we are just, why, like, why like we are just, we are just a creature.

 There is no necessary... Well, it's really interesting because, like, it's not, so human beings are, like, it takes, it takes, every cell is oscillating, and the whole brain is oscillating, and the whole room is oscillating, and the whole room is oscillating, and everything in the universe is made out of phase wave rhythms.

 It's all vibrations, all the way down.

 The whole universe is a fractal of oscillations.

 And so there's like no difference between the room being the universe and you being the universe, and everyone else around us being the universe.

 it's all phase wave rhythms.

 All connected.

 So like your brain has alpha frequencies and beta frequencies and beta frequencies and delta frequencies and gamma frequencies but so does the room.

 All those frequencies are on the room around us.

 Everything is made up like the universe is a big vortex and our cells are big or little vortices everything is a vortex.

 It's a dissipative system.

 A dissipative system is like a hurricane that has to consume energy and export chaos to the surrounding environment.

 What do you think of, do you believe at all in psychics? Do you believe that there is people that have a capability of... So, I don't know, it's interesting because basically what the human brain does is the human brain makes predictions, right? The human brain predicts the future.

 Fundamentally, that's the algorithm what the human brain is doing, is making predictions about what to do next.

 When you reach for a door handle, like you're going to grab a door handle, you're predicting how the door handle is going to feel.

 Because if it feels weird, you're going to notice right away.

 You're going to be shocked.

 If it feels like, if you reach for the door handle and you hear a chicken scream, you're going to be shocked, because that's not what you're expecting.

 Because you are always, whenever you expect something, you are predicting something.

 When you step on the floor you expect it to be solid and if you fell through it you'd be shocked.

 Yeah.

 Because 24-7 all of your beliefs everything you're thinking feeling it's just a prediction.

 It's a belief.

 That's the fabric of our mental reality.

 Everything's a prediction and a belief.

 I'll sit on it, I'll think about it, because I did, I had some really good questions for you.

 But I lost them because I was really into the other thing.

 So, I'm not going to.

 Have you listened to Abraham Hicks? Okay.

 Abraham Hicks.

 Because what surprised me when I realized that my theory, this theory of self-aware networks theory, was basically saying that the fabric, like the engrams of consciousness, the fabrics of our, the fabric of consciousness that makes up what we see and hear is basically a phase wave differential.

 It's the same as saying it's basically a vibration.

 And that's what Abraham Hicks talks about.

 She says that you're basically, a belief is basically a vibration.

 She's been saying that for 20 years.

 I just came up with this theory like last year.

 So you should listen to her because she's like, to her, because she's known all about this stuff.

 I feel like just even hearing the basics of what you told me about the vibration, like I get that, but I feel like there's so much more that I have, it leaves so many more questions than answers for me, other than the vibration.

 Like yours goes more in depth.

 Oh yeah, so much.

 Way more in depth.

 It's like.

 Oh, I've got, if you look at my website, which you in depth.

 Oh yeah, so yes.

 Way more in depth.

 All right.

 Oh, and I've got, if you look at my website, which you can look at right now, anyone can.

 What is it? It's on GitHub, so go to GitHub, or you can just type.

 Will you write it for me? All right.

 And I'll check it out.

 You can go to, It'll be, oh my gosh.

 GitHub.

com forward slash v5ma.

 Do you get with social groups to talk about their use? Click on software networks.

 It's the first repo.

 And then that's it.

 You can read it.

 Those are my notes.

 They're public.

 Yeah, they're public.

 Anyone can read them.

 And then I'm working on the book.

 I'm working on the book.

 Yeah, so Yeah, new theory of gravity Unified field theory and also a new theory of Mind.

 So with that kind of brain and interest that you have it sounds like you're very comfortable in your own skin learning it but do you I think because when you know something so well and you can't really talk to other people necessarily because they don't know, so do you have any outlets like or any people that you get to hash out? Yeah, I mean I Yeah, I mean I Actually actually reads like hundreds of thousands of people every month just by doing this by tweeting this bacteria social media so I Have and I run lots of large groups.

 I've loved lovers with like Tens of thousands of people Yeah, so I reach a lot of people.

 I've talked to a lot scientists.

 And I have a lot of recordings with a lot of scientists, neuroscientists.

 Very cool.

 Yeah.

 I have a podcast called the Neura lace Podcast.

 What? You have a podcast? You can read my podcast.

 You just told me that now.

 Is your podcast on there? On the website? Like a link or something? No, no, but I can give you another link to my podcast.

 Yeah, sure.

 Or you can just YouTube the Neuralace Podcast and I will get you.

 Well, you've got to type it in because I will be down there.

 I'll type it.

 Okay.

 So, I'm going to go ahead and type it in.

 Or you can just YouTube the NeuralAce podcast.

 Well, you've got to type it in, because I will be down there.

 It's kind of old.

 Like, I haven't updated it, but I'm going to do more.

 Oh, OK.

 Yeah.

 Oh, what's up with it? Let me send it to my bio page, and you can read that.

 You have a really nice voice, too, Micah.

 Like, I could totally see it.

 A very calming way to get the message across and on the podcast is, that's nice.

 Well done, well done.

 That's fascinating.

 Thank you.

 Yeah, this is the podcast, right there.

 The narrowest podcast on YouTube.

 Okay, so I'm gonna save this is the podcast.

 Oh, yeah, that's the one.

 The narrowest podcast on YouTube.

 OK.

 Yeah.

 So I'm going to save this to watch later.

 I'll go ahead and pause the recording.
