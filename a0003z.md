(Perception, graph, neuron) Perception through the senses is required for mental processes." it's actually not true, if you separated a brain from all it's senses, it would still do it's mental processes

what is awareness without thinking? when I am generating sequences of characters, in my mind, or sequences of patterns that result in language, inner language, that is thinking, the inner dialog, what am I thinking about, this pattern develops itself, because neurons are predicting plausible next sequences, I am thinking to myself because a neural network is predicting what I might be thinking about, its predicting each next word in a sequence.

 "Where does awareness fit within the construct of the mind?" Awareness and observation, is actually prediction and expectation, it's actually a physical reaction to previous experiences, it's manufactured by neurons in a hierarchal dynamic structure, where specific connections change with experience resulting in concepts, or associations built by network connections between cell memories

"Dzogchen references perceiving and doing without thinking." Dzogchen is in error, conceptually, all the spatial and temporal metaphors you use to perceive and do without thinking are actually are thinking, movement reflects the firing pattern of thought, seeing where you are is a prediction of where you are, an expectation of where you are and where your stepping next, those are thoughts just like all other kinds of thoughts. Dzogchen is ill conceived nonsense

‎"But it's luminosity has to be seen as empty as well."
Rephrase: Because knowledge also references an immaterial or intangible process, we can not define it by observations of itself.
Question: Can define knowledge through observations of actions systemic of knowledge.

this empty luminosity is a spatial metaphor, it's knowledge all the same

"...we are protected from such beliefs by either our application of prasangika deconstruction or direct yogic insight into the empty nature of awareness itself.""

I think awareness is not a holistic thing, rather it's a highly coordinated galaxy sized ocean of activity.

It's the activity of memories that become linked in concepts, aka distributed sequential associations, aka sparse distributed representations.

There is a core algorithm to it, prediction, aka expectation aka observation aka awareness.

The sea of past events gives us an unknown readiness for whatever may come next, even if that ready state is the most simple spatial metaphor, an empty luminosity, a pure waiting area, a room, devoid of mental objects, because it's filled with the spatial metaphor of "no spatial metaphor"

‎""So the term "empty" isn't being misunderstood, it's meaning just expands into a more experiential holographic 3D representation in time/space articulation, as opposed to a purely conceptual, one dimensional representation."
Rephrase: So, the term empty is experientially expanded.
Question: Do you mean it has been expanded to include experiences?"

It's a shape that is as smooth and simple as possible, negating itself, a spatial metaphor, a symbol of readiness for any concept, an imagined experience of experience itself.


this is his concept of awareness, it's as old as dirt, and it's completely false
"...As awareness you have no location in space or time, no name, no identity, no substance and no history. "

Awareness is not independent from your brain and body, but it might be conceptually valid to say that as a concept "awareness" does not have specific location in space, time, name, identity, or history. However this is as a conceptual model of awareness, a map of reality, this map is not the territory it's just a conceptual map of the territory.

This much I think I have: MInd says "What is this that can sense? What is awake and awaring?" If you don't leave this awareness alone, mind makes a "me" out of it or a higher level of a me. (Tells a story about the awareness) This is all ascribing attributes to awareness that is empty of attributes. Awareness is empty, this is what Dzogchen points to. All phenomenon has to be seen as empty. 

I think the spatial metaphor of "awareness being empty" has two branches for me, one points to brains being for movement, we seem to be seeking knowledge all the time, being the seeker, and yet it's not particular, we are seeking knowledge to coordinate movement, the knowledge itself is empty, we don't really care about it, except in the context of movement, if it does not effect our future movement, it becomes irrelevant.

and the second thing it points to is a spatial metaphor that is resourceful, imagine if you know that knowledge is empty, that it's for coordinating movement, then you continue to be aware, your mind is less full from small concepts, of course this pertains to the organization of concepts in the mind, and life experience makes this spatial metaphor seem important during a certain stage of cognitive development that you won't understand before you get to it, and you won't care about later on in the next stage of cognitive development

My conclusion is that none of the people actually understand the development of their own minds, yet their minds are developing, and so they try to explain the newer concepts they are learning, talking about them helps them develop the new concepts even more. Dialog is food that feeds cognitive development.
