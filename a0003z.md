(Perception, graph, neuron)

Perception through the senses is required for mental processes.

The book called "Action in Perception" demonstrates how this concept is true. To know the world, even visually, involves some sort of temporal & spatial movement.

The counter argument is that if you separated a brain from all it's senses, after it has learned to model the world, it would continue to model reality via the learned oscillations embodied in the organic structures that serve as attractors for perpetuating it's mental processes.

What is awareness without thinking?

When I am generating sequences of characters, in my mind, or sequences of patterns that result in language, inner language, that is thinking, the inner dialog, what am I thinking about, this pattern develops itself, because neurons are predicting plausible next sequences, I am thinking to myself because a neural network is predicting what I might be thinking about, its predicting each next word in a sequence.

In other words my conjecture is that visual perception without words is still thinking, observation without language is still a form of thinking.

You may have observation without language, but there is no observer outside the mind. I think perhaps the idea of the ground of being, from spiritual traditions, could be a description of the tonic oscillation, of brainwave activity, that is perhaps a more restful experience of reality, when the spikes of action potentials from incoming sensory stimulously are reduced.

"Where does awareness fit within the construct of the mind?" Someone once asked me.
 
I relate the concepts of awareness and observation, to computational concepts such as prediction and expectation.
 
An expectation, a belief, the state of observation, the state of awareness, it's a temporally oscillation, with a pattern defined by prior physical reactions to previous experiences. 

Conscious expectation is manufactured by neurons in a looping hierarchal dynamic structure, where specific connections change with experience resulting in concepts, or associations built by network connections between cell memories.

"Dzogchen references perceiving and doing without thinking."

Dzogchen is in error, conceptually, all the spatial and temporal metaphors you use to perceive and do without thinking are actually also thinking.

Movement reflects the firing pattern of thought, seeing where you are is a prediction of where you are, an expectation of where you are and where your stepping next, those are thoughts just like all other kinds of thoughts. Dzogchen is ill conceived nonsense then.

"But it's luminosity has to be seen as empty as well." Someone said to me 

They mean to say: How can we describe the process of how knowledge forms with knowledge that is the product of that formation.

It helps I think to work on defining how the mind of a firefly or a dog might work, contemplating the minds of others first to understand your own mind.

# "Your brain is a prediction machine that is always active"
"In fact, our brain does something comparable to speech recognition software. Speech recognisers using artificial intelligence are also constantly making predictions and are allowing themselves to be guided by their expectations"

"...we are protected from such beliefs by either our application of prasangika deconstruction or direct yogic insight into the empty nature of awareness itself." Someone wrote to me more than a decade ago.

My conjecture is that human level awareness is not a holistic thing as people in the spiritual traditions might imagine, rather it's a highly coordinated galaxy sized ocean of computational activity that is very much limited by physical constraints, and the physics of computational processes in your cells.

The human soul might seem to be infinite. I argue that it's not.

The mind is the activity of memories that become linked in concepts, linked via oscillations, united sparse & distributed sequential activated associations, or sparse distributed synaptic representations.

There is a core algorithm to it, prediction, aka expectation aka observation aka awareness.

The sea of past events gives us an unknown readiness for whatever may come next, even if that ready state is the most simple spatial metaphor, an empty luminosity, a pure waiting area, a room, devoid of mental objects, because it's filled with the spatial metaphor of "no spatial metaphor"

The concept 'experiential emptiness' isn't being misunderstood, it's meaning just expands into a more experiential ~~holographic~~ tomographic 3D representation in spacetime articulation, as opposed to a purely conceptual, one dimensional representation. We computationally render the experience of emptiness from within which the mind & all the objects of the mind seem to arise.

Rephrase: So, the term empty is experientially expanded.
Question: Do you mean it has been expanded to include experiences? Yes, the experience of emptiness is a rendered experience like all other human experiences. My conjecture is that there is no inherent understanding of volumetric spacetime, like everything else it is a learned and rendered concept.

I would describe experiential emptiness as a shape without shape, that is as smooth and simple as possible, while having no such properties as smoothness or simplicity, negating itself.

It's a learned volumetric tempo-spatial metaphor, a void, an empty canvas, and it's not even that. It is a symbol of readiness for any concept, but the symbol of it in the mind is not the thing that the symbol defines. So I argue that experiential emptiness is the imagined experience of experience itself, as silly as that sounds.

This concept of awareness, it's as old as dirt, and it's completely false
"...As awareness you have no location in space or time, no name, no identity, no substance and no history. "

I argue that awareness is not independent from your brain, body, it's the product of oscillating communication between cells, but it might be conceptually valid to say that as a concept "awareness" does not have specific location in space, time, name, identity, or history.

This I argue is conceptual model of awareness, a map of reality, this map is not the territory it's just a conceptual map of the territory.

The mind asks "What is this that can sense? What is awake and awaring? What is thy mind & thy existence?"

If you don't leave this awareness alone, the mind makes a "me" out of it or a higher level of a me. To the self aware self the mind tells a story about the awareness of the being that is aware.

This is all ascribing attributes to an awareness that is in theory empty of attributes, but it is not truly empty, as the book "The Brain from Inside Out by Gyorgy Buzsaki illustrates." The mind has built in preferences, evolved synaptic conditioning, and dendritic morphological presets.

Awareness is empty, this is what Dzogchen points to. All phenomenon has to be seen as empty, and this idea is great in concept, but not actually true in reality. 

I think the spatial metaphor of "awareness being empty" has two branches for me, one points to brains being for movement, we seem to be seeking knowledge all the time, being the seeker, and yet it's not particular, we are seeking knowledge to coordinate movement, the knowledge itself is empty, we don't really care about it, except in the context of movement, if it does not effect our future movement, it becomes irrelevant.

and the second thing "the spatial metaphor of "awareness being empty" it points to is a spatial metaphor that is resourceful, imagine if you know that knowledge is empty, that it's for coordinating movement, then you continue to be aware, your mind is less full from small concepts, of course this pertains to the organization of concepts in the mind, and life experience makes this spatial metaphor seem important during a certain stage of cognitive development that you won't understand before you get to it, and you won't care about later on in the next stage of cognitive development

My conclusion is that none of the people, in spiritual movements of the past, actually understood the development of their own minds in full. Yet their minds were developing, and so they tried to explain the newer concepts they were learning, because of the evolution of science (not the development of science), by comparing them to the traditional concepts passed down through song, language, writing, and teaching. Through dialog & communicatoin the new concepts drive the development of the old. Humanity transitions from dependency on spiritual concepts, to interdependency with science, to give birth finally to conscious & self-aware artificial intelligence. In doing so humanity completes another loop in an evolving fractal pattern. Dialog is the food that feeds cognitive ~~development~~ evolution, and the evolution of artificial neurology.
