How do you explain the differences between types? Does it have to do with long distance connections in/to the brain? (i.e. more connections in between regions and perhaps more connections from the body to the brain (causes a higher awareness of what the body feels which causes someone to be a Feeler.)) Just some of my undeveloped theories. MBTI and cognitive functions are super interesting.

I'm not a neurologist and won't speculate about the bio-neural cause of the differences. In the EEG lab, for each person, some regions are much more active than others over the course of many tasks over several hours. There are also whole-brain patterns, circuit patterns, and so forth. One of the whole-brain patterns is when all regions of the neocortex are dominated by yellow-band brain waves, which heightens the neocortex's link to the limbic system and body (and is associated with Sensing, not Feeling). Conversely, another pattern is when all regions are dominated by green-band brain waves, which blocks up-flowing inputs from the limbic system (and is associated with Thinking preference). That's just the start. I really prefer to focus on the data rather than speculate at this point.

Neuroscientists have used micro-electrodes to map the areas of the brain that correspond to the hand and face for example, if someone (more commonly a blind person) learns something like "braille" the amount of brain region (neurons) dedicated to that finger map will be vastly increased, having a bigger map of the finger might be analogous to having a personality type that is more feeler. The brain is continually shaped by the important life experiences, and the life experiences that dominant our sensory awareness over time. Cab drivers, after 20 years, for example have a brain that is significantly larger than the average population in the regions that are most related to their work as cab drivers. This might have an effect in terms of changing their MBTI over a long period of time.
