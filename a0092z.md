(criteria, causation) 
like a can I will keep kicking down the road, kickstarter maybe
it's about criteria, criterial causation in my neurons, that and noise, it's about noise, and how the physics seems to conjure spontaneous harmonies

Crowdsourcing is generally the best way to go now. I'm very interested in nanomanufacturing. I wish you luck. 
That is fascinating
Anyway, in case you're interested , I'm launching a vlog series on YouTube in a few weeks called the Technarchist. I can send you a link when it's up if you're interested, our you could just keep an eye on my wall.

I insist that you send me a reminder, that is very interesting. I can't predict that faceobok will even show me a friends status when it's important. faceobok doesn't know how to do AI lol. That sounds like it
I want to watch!

Very well. 
The videos will largely be like shots of mental espresso.

okay so, I will look forward to the experience of mental expresso, (do you mean as opposed to calm and sane expressio? ha a joke)
oh, I am filling my youtube channel also
creating short films that will eventually be pieced into a documentary about the people who have helped me do research with Neo Mind Cycle

Basically just short videos to express different ideas and propagate memes while not taking up too much of your time. It will largely consider matters of technological growth and how that growth is mutating and uprooting the entire socio-economic system.
Btw, can you send me a link or explain Neo Mind Cycle?

a series of brain optimizing technologies and nutrition products combined synergistic-ally to experimentally exploit the principles of plasticity

K, thanks.
