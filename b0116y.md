The Natural Selection of Space-Time

Have you ever wondered if neurons resonate with each other within the electromagnetic spectrum? Specifically, can we interpret the electromagnetic exchanges between neurons—both electric and magnetic—as forms of resonance? Perhaps electricity corresponds to high-frequency, low-amplitude signals, similar to neural spikes, while magnetism relates to lower-frequency, higher-amplitude oscillations, akin to tonic firing patterns. Exploring these analogies might deepen our understanding of neural communication.

In the brain, the waveform of an action potential could be more than a mere electrical impulse; it might be an information-containing electrical pattern, such as a soliton wave. A soliton wave maintains its shape while traveling at a constant velocity, potentially conveying complex information like a tone in audio signals. This suggests that neurons might transmit information through three kinds of soliton waves: mechanical (vibrational), magnetic, and electric. Each of these waves carries distinct temporal-spatial frequency characteristics recognized by dendritic functions, enabling the transmission of detailed information.

Consider a neuron as a sophisticated unit that senses, remembers, and transmits signals across three different modalities of waves simultaneously. The synapse—the junction between neurons—may possess acoustic properties, allowing it to transmit and receive signals across the synaptic gap through the surrounding fluids. This implies that at the synapse, the neuron translates its resonance into a vibrational pattern, much like how sound waves carry information.

The action potential is not solely defined by its electrical properties but also by the shape of the dendrite, including which synapses are connected and when they fired. The temporal and spatial sequence of synaptic events shapes the electric soliton, which then travels along the neuron. At the axon terminal, this wave is divided, creating multiple copies of the wave pattern. This process could be seen as fractalizing the signal, making smaller-scale copies that are transmitted to other neurons, potentially shrinking a four-dimensional representational pattern into something that can be carried by neurotransmitters.

This mechanism allows a neuron to pass along an analog waveform to the next neuron, facilitating complex information transfer. Mechanical waveforms, magnetic fields, and electric charges interact, causing changes and differences within the neural network. The brain, therefore, might produce a global soliton wave pattern—a four-dimensional pattern that encompasses both time and space—integrating and transmitting information throughout the neural network.

On a broader scale, we can think of space-time itself as a fractal of oscillations or vortices. Just as galaxies, hurricanes, and atoms display vortex-like structures, so do human cells and even the patterns within our brains. An oscillation is a vortex in that it represents a repeating cyclic pattern. At the most fundamental level, space might be randomly expanding and contracting, creating fundamental oscillations of space-time. In this view, we are one with space-time, embodying what space-time looks like at a certain point in its folding process—a process that exhibits remarkable organization emerging from fundamental randomness.

This perspective leads us to consider the concept of the natural selection of space-time. Just as biological evolution is the natural selection of life, the universe may undergo a natural selection for physics. The universe began with simple elements like hydrogen and helium, but over time, through physical processes akin to natural selection, more complex elements and structures formed. Events at the quantum scale organized into increasingly complex structures—from atoms to molecules to stars and planets—eventually leading to life and human consciousness. The universe continues to evolve, and human life is a continuation of this cosmic natural selection.

When we delve into consciousness, it's intriguing to think that every thought is a distinction that divides the indivisible whole of reality into parts. The brain must create distinctions to generate awareness; without noticing differences, there would be nothing to be aware of. This idea challenges theories like the resonant theory of the mind, which posits that consciousness arises from synchronization or integration. However, synchronization alone may erase distinctions, reducing awareness. Instead, it's the disruptions—the decoherence—that encode patterns with differences, adding details and enhancing awareness.

Therefore, the brain might function by encoding synchronized patterns with disruptions, much like how information is carried within the variations of a soliton wave. This interplay between synchronization and disruption allows for the complex patterns of thought and perception.

In summary, viewing neurons, consciousness, and even the universe through the lens of oscillations, soliton waves, and fractal patterns can deepen our understanding of how complex systems emerge from fundamental processes. The natural selection of space-time offers a framework to explore the evolution of the cosmos, bridging the gap between physics and consciousness.

The natural selection of spacetime Wave Oscillation

So, is a neuron, is it resonating with other neurons in the electricity spectrum?
I mean, can we interpret the electromagnetic exchanges, specifically the electric ones?
And separately, later on, we'll consider the magnetic ones.
And we'll have to consider, I mean, so actually,
what's interesting is, like, the difference between electricity and magnetism.
Electricity's, I think it's, I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike,
and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude.
And maybe electromagnetism is, like, an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern,
which is, like, higher amplitude, but lower frequency.
So, I'm interested to find that out.
But I also want to know if the waveform of the action potential is characteristic of an information-containing electrical pattern,
such as a soliton wave that would contain a wave shape that could convey a tone, right?
Like a tone, like the component of audio.
So, music is a pattern played out in sonic waves, right?
So, in the brain, we have the soliton transmission of three kinds of waves.
Vibrational or mechanical waves, magnetic waves, and electric waves.
And all three of those types of waves appear to be soliton wave transmissions, right?
Or information-containing waves.
So, they're information-containing because they have distinct temporal-spatial frequency characteristics.
It's as if the four-dimensional temporal-spatial frequency is being transmitted that is basically acknowledged by dendritic functions.
So, I want to combine-combine-like, imagine a neuron that is basically a combined-
has-that's-that basically every-like, the neuron is a sensor with a memory with a transmitter.
And it's sensing, remembering, and transmitting three-three different modalities of waves simultaneously.
So, there's an electric soliton wave, which is generated by the action potential.
Like, all three events are generated by the action potential.
If you notice, if you notice that the shape of the synapse seems to have acoustic properties, right?
The bouton seems to have acoustic properties for transmitting and receiving signals,
for sending waves across the junction gap through the fluids in between.
So, you have, but you know, you have to send-
Here's the thing, it's like, so the electricity is going to move a lot faster, potentially, than the other waves.
But the electricity also gets kind of slowed down by the fact that it has to go through the chemical process of-
There's a chemical delay in transferring, um, the electrical solitons.
So, what I'm proposing is that, so the mechanical solitons are going to transmit a mesoscale pattern
that basically sends the vibration-
So, at the synapse, it translates the resonance of the neuron, it transmits that as a-
Think of it as similar to an acoustical wave pattern, but just defined by electromagnetism.
And it's like a, um, um, it's an acoustic-
It's like, it's imagined as an acoustical wave pattern that can, uh, define any kind of data.
Like a sound, like a sound wave, or, um, or light waves.
Um, and, uh, the same thing is like, okay, so then, the action potential is defined by the shape of the dendrite.
Uh, but the shape of the dendrite includes which synapses are connected to which other neurons,
which synapses are active, and when, uh, those synapses fired.
So that, like, that's sort of like the event-
The temporal and spatial event sequence of the branches of the synapses combined defines the shape of the electric soliton.
And then that becomes, uh, so that then gets divided by the, the, the branches of the exit terminal.
And, um, so that potentially becomes, like, uh, fractalized.
So what I'm saying is, like, imagine that you have this convergence.
So you have, you have the electric signals converging into, uh, you, you have disparate, you, you have, basically the neuron makes an image.
It takes all these dendritic signals and makes an image out of them, or a sound out of them, by, um, by translating temporal spatial patterns into a single, uh, electrical wave that is, uh, that is, that is transmitted over the body of a single neuron.
And then, uh, what might happen is that the exit terminal, uh, when it, when it divides that, that, um, that wave, it's basically making a lot of copies of that wave pattern.
That temporal spatial wave pattern.
And each copy is, like, a little fractal mini copy.
So it's like, it's like, it, it, um, it's demagnifying or shrinking a representation, uh, a four-dimensional representational pattern into, uh, from a big action potential into, um,
a, um, a, uh, something that is carried by a neurotransmitter, right?
I'm just, like, just, like, imagining how that could, could seem.
But at the very, at the very least, that, like, so the production of a specific electric waveform, um, would at least allow a neuron to,
you pass along that sort of analog waveform to the next neuron.
And, um, but, so in terms of signal transmission, um, in terms of synapses, so, so there's the, there's the, uh, mechanical waveform,
and then, um, the magnetic, obviously, you know, the magnetic fields, the electromagnetic fields,
uh, is being, is, it's, it's, the charges are being, uh, displaced, which is causing differences to happen.
It's causing differences to happen.
And, um, and that's another, that's another thing, is that, you know, basically, you know, I got really into, like, um, Buddhist ideas,
thanks to the Law of Attraction movement, the Law of Attraction movement.
I got into Buddhist ideas, and, and, and also the Matrix film.
So the Matrix film, and the Law of Attraction movement, and I, that really, like, drew me into studying,
uh, the experiential side of, of beingness.
And, um, what, what, what, what I'm, what I think, you know, what I think, I love, I love the sort of analogy that, um,
beyond the thinking mind, there's no distinction, that the, the mind knows that every thought is essentially
a distinction that divides with, with, with the, the whole, the whole on, the indivisible whole on of reality into parts.
Because any time, there's, any thought that makes a distinction between light and dark, or any kind of distinction,
between red and blue, between this thought and no thought,
between, between, yeah, between any thought and, and, and, uh, and any other thought.
Like, any kind of distinction at all, uh, or any kind of awareness at all, um, is a division of, of, of space.
It's, it's a division of, of, um, it's a distinction of, of space.
Space-time.
And that is a division of space-time.
Mechanically speaking.
Uh, there is a difference that is being noticed,
because if no difference was noticed, then, um,
nothing would be noticed.
It would, it would, it would,
if there were no differences to notice, then there would be nothing to notice, there would be no awareness.
And so that idea is that at the root of it,
the brain has to be able to, um,
at the very least,
create distinctions.
And that, that's, that, that, that is why, um,
basically, you know, people who argue that,
you know, resonance,
the resonant theory of the mind,
the, the problem with the resonant theory of the mind,
it's, it's not that,
um,
it's like,
okay, there are reson, there's,
there are resonants happening,
um, resonance is, is,
uh,
an event that happens everywhere,
including in your mind.
But the problem with the resonance theory of the mind is it's imagining
that, um,
that consciousness
is, is
sort of caused by,
by synchronization
or integration
or integrated synchronization.
It's like integrated synchronization theory,
but it's all,
like,
excite, like,
it's all like this excitatory network
that's just pulling things together
and combining things.
It's all convergence.
And, and,
um,
there's no,
uh,
it's sort of lacking the,
the,
the,
the,
the polar,
um,
mechanism.
Which is,
uh,
you know,
it's all convergence
and coherence
and combination
and integrated information.
I mean,
it's like,
there is,
there is an important role
for,
um,
for,
uh,
disintegrated theory.
Or decoherence.
Or,
uh,
there,
or,
or,
um,
basically,
like,
um,
it,
it,
it's interesting
that they picked
the word resonance,
but,
but,
you need a,
you need,
like,
in order for information
to have a pattern
that has to be distinctions
in it,
synchronization is,
is merging
and erasing
some distinctions.
the more synchronization
that happens,
the more
awareness disappears,
the more advantages,
uh,
the more
contextual
relevance,
the more,
the more,
um,
how did I get on this side?
Oops.
The more contextual
relevance,
relevance,
uh,
that has,
it deletes your,
it deletes,
it,
it,
the divisions,
uh,
inhibitions,
uh,
the,
the negative
helps
to make,
to add details
to the patterns
that you see
so that there is
a growing awareness.
if you have,
if you have a brain
that is
where
synchronization
is being
constantly disrupted,
um,
you have a brain
because
you have,
like,
you have,
um,
it's,
it's only by
encoding the
synchronized pattern
with disruptions
do,
do,
is,
does that,
is that,
uh,
carrier of
synchronization
which can
be thought of
as the,
um,
as the
container
of a solitone
wave,
the,
uh,
of an,
or the
container
of information.
So,
so,
um,
so,
yeah,
so,
so,
a brain's,
um,
a brain
produces,
uh,
like,
a global
solitone wave
pattern,
a four-dimensional
global solitone
wave pattern
that
inside,
and it
produces this
inside a,
goddammit,
I just,
like,
want,
like,
some space
so I can
fucking record
my book.
Let's go back
this way.
mathematician who wrote
sink
describes,
uh,
uh,
basically,
the entire
human being
as a,
um,
fractal of
oscillations,
um,
and,
it,
it's,
I've,
for a long
time,
before I even
read this book,
I've been
thinking of,
of space-time
as,
as a
fractal of
vortices,
and I,
you know,
or dissipative
systems,
like,
like,
like a galaxy
looks like a
vortex,
a hurricane
looks like a
vortex,
an atom
looks like a
vortex,
I didn't realize
that,
uh,
vortexes,
which include,
you know,
human cells,
human cells
are vortexes
inside vortexes,
with vortexes
beside those
vortexes,
it's like a
fractal of
vortexes,
um,
but,
oscillation,
but a vortex
is an
oscillation,
and an
oscillation
is a
vortex,
in terms
of,
like,
there is
a
repeating,
uh,
cyclic
pattern,
there's a,
there's a
cycling pattern
that has a,
temp,
is a,
uh,
a temporal
resonance,
or temporal
oscillation,
you know,
so a resonance
is a decaying
oscillator,
right,
instead of a
continuing
oscillator,
but the
very,
but the
oscillator
itself is,
is even,
even in
resonation,
it's,
when it's,
or when it's
decaying,
it is cycling
through,
um,
the same
sort of
fractal
pattern,
from the
large scale
when it
peaks,
to increasingly
smaller scales,
that signal
that signal
is shrinking
in magnitude,
shrinking in
amplification,
and frequency,
but maintaining
its shape,
until it,
until it
dissipates,
dissipates,
even if it,
even if its
frequency
increases,
and its
amplitude
decreases,
or its
amplitude
increases,
and its
frequency
decreases,
and I
kind of
think of,
like,
yeah,
so,
um,
if we
could think
of
particles
as,
um,
being
space
itself,
like,
space being,
like,
the large
scale,
uh,
version of
particles,
but it
exists as,
but both
particles in
space exist
as,
uh,
frequencies
between,
um,
intervals,
between the
intervals of
oscillators,
either,
um,
continuing,
continuing,
or resonating
away,
dissipating.
So,
if you have a
dissipative system,
the,
um,
uh,
the,
the oscillation
doesn't resonate
away,
it,
it cycles.
So,
you just call it
a regular force
there.
But,
um,
but,
yeah,
I think of,
you know,
like,
space is something
that is expanding
and contracting,
and that is
the expansions
and contractions,
um,
you know,
are creating,
um,
uh,
oscillatory
movements
at the most
fundamental scale.
so,
yeah,
so I think
a space
is like,
it's something
that is,
um,
at the most
fundamental scale,
it's randomly,
um,
expanding and contracting,
creating,
creating the fundamental
oscillations
of space-time.
and so we,
so we are,
so right,
I,
right now,
I am
one with space-time,
we all are,
uh,
in terms of,
like,
uh,
I am what
space-time looks like
at some point
during its
folding process.
Um,
and it's a
folding process
that has
amazing organization,
so I'm,
I'm saying,
like,
it starts out
in a,
at the most
fundamental level
in a sort of,
like,
like,
um,
the most,
uh,
at one end of,
at one end of the spectrum,
it's,
it's,
uh,
completely random.
Uh,
it's,
um,
it's random
sort of like,
like,
um,
you know,
I'm,
I'm talking about,
like,
uncertain,
like,
the uncertainty hypothesis,
right?
You can only see,
the quantum,
the,
the,
um,
the particle
jiggles
because it can,
it,
it,
it,
because you can either
see its momentum
or its position,
but not both
at the same time,
so it has to constantly
alternate between states.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's physically uncertain
of what it wants to be,
and the uncertainty
principle
applies to basically
all of space-time
creating micro-oscillations,
um,
but then,
uh,
what happens is
these,
these oscillations
serve as attractors
to,
um,
attractors that are,
that are sort of like
having random encounters
with,
um,
with each other,
and,
and so,
but attractors,
like,
attractor is,
is,
um,
and it's like an event
that,
that is
going to continue
the oscillation,
but like,
but they're,
they're,
but they're attractors
in a different way.
They're like
attracting other oscillators.
They're attracting
other particles.
They're attracting
electrons.
They have,
um,
and they're doing it,
they're,
the,
the attraction is
being caused,
uh,
in a mechanical way
because the interaction
of one oscillator
with another
is causing,
um,
a reaction,
like,
a,
a reaction
where it's like,
it's,
so forces have
collided in space
and they bounce
off each other.
Right?
There's this reaction
to space
folding and then
hitting itself.
So it bounces off
itself
with these folds
because they,
because they have,
like,
they pull each other
together because
they're oscillators
and oscillators attract.
And so everything
in space
clumps together
and you get rocks
and you get
gases
and you get stars
and you get
every possible
atomic generation
in a long enough
timeline,
uh,
in which the universe
is able to
sort of
follow the
physics,
uh,
the,
basically a kind,
a natural selection
for physics.
So there's,
so,
you know,
evolution is the
natural selection
of life,
the,
the,
the process
of natural selection
for life,
but there's also
scientists who've
shared a theory
that there's a
natural selection
for,
for physics
and,
um,
that doesn't,
that there's,
there's,
there's a lot of,
that's a,
that's a good idea
and there's a lot
of easy examples,
right?
Like,
the fact that,
um,
most of the,
most of the chemicals
that,
that we
have here on Earth,
including our own bodies,
were made in stars.
Like,
the universe started out
with,
like,
a lot of hydrogen
and helium,
but not much else.
And so the universe
went through phases
of physics-based
natural selection,
where,
um,
where events
at the quantum scale,
uh,
sort of
became,
uh,
sort of,
um,
went from being the,
so there was a transition
from the
complexity of what was
happening at the
molecular scale,
or at the atomic scale,
to the molecular scale,
to the chemical scale,
like,
there's,
there's transition phases
in the timeline,
where the organization
of,
of oscillators
into increasingly
complex structures
up until,
um,
you know,
human life
and the present moment,
which is,
human life is still,
like,
a continuation of the same
natural selection
of the cosmos itself.
and,
it's sort of like,
it's,
it's,
so I'm like,
yeah,
so I'm thinking,
yes,
in a way,
space-time
emerged everywhere
at once
simultaneously,
but,
there's nothing
from,
there's nothing
that's,
that is
going to
fundamentally
prevent,
um,
uh,
the
continual
sort of,
um,
uh,
natural selection
of space-time.
Um,
the natural selection
of space-time
should be the chapter.
is there?
no,
no,
there is nothing
there.
Okay.
All right.
Um,
um,
let's go,
let's go and see.
Oh,
that's good.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
