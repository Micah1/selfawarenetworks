Like many of the audio files that were auto transcribed to text with Google Recorder this has a lot of broken sentences and incorrectly captured words so it will have to be fixed later with a more direct transcription of the audio.

is a neuron resonating with

00:14
With other neurons. And in the electromagnetic spectrum, I mean, can we interpret the electromagnetic exchanges? Specifically, the electric ones and separately later on, we'll consider the magnetic ones.

00:42
And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)

01:28
But low frequency. So I'm interested in financing but I also want to know if the way form the action potential is is characteristic of and information containing electrical patterns such as a soliton wave that would contain a wave shape. That could convey a tone, right? (it doesn't have to be an audibe tone, because it's in the context of information theory it's an information pattern because of the rarity of its distinctive signal relative to the tonic signals nearby. So it creates contrast in the mind of the brain that the organism's collection of cells is perceiving at multiple scales)

02:09
Like a tone, like an, like, like an art, like expect the component of audio, right? So music, he could music as a pattern played out in Sonic waves, right? So in the brain, we have the soliton transmission of three kinds of waves: vibrational or mechanical waves. Magnetic waves.

02:40
And electric waves, and all three of those types of ways appeared to be trans appear to be soliton on wave transmission, right? Or information containing waves.

03:04
So, their information is contained because they are distinct. Distinct tempo. Spatial frequency characteristics. As if the four dimensional temple, spatial frequency is being transmitted.

03:36
That is basically acknowledged by then by the dendritic functions. So I want to combine like, imagine a neuron, that is basically a combined has, that's the basically, every like the neuron is a sensor with a memory with the transmitter and it's sensing remembering and transmitting, three, three different modalities of waves simultaneously.

04:21
So, there's an electric soliton wave, which is, which is generated by the action potential, like all three events are generated by the action potential. If you notice that the shape of the synapse seems to have acoustic properties, right? The bouton seems to have acoustic properties for transmitting and receiving signals for sending waves across the junction gap.

04:52
Through the fluids in between. So you have, but, you know, you have to send, but here's the thing, it's like you. So the electricity is going to move a lot faster.

05:25
There's a chemical delay and transfer and transfer of the electrical solid arms. So, what I'm proposing is that, the mechanical solitons are gonna translate our measles scale pattern, so basically sends the vibration it, so at the synapse, it translates the bite the the resonation, the, the residents of the neuron.

05:52

It transmits that. To think of it as a sim is similar to an acoustical wave pattern. But just defined by electromagnetism and it's like a, it's an acoustic. It's imaginary is an acoustical wave pattern that can define any kind of data, like I said, like sound waves, or lightwaves.
06:23

And the same thing is like okay so then the action potential is defined by the shape of the dendrite but the shape of the dendrite includes which synapses are connected to which other neurons which synapses are active and when those synapses fired so that like that sort of like the event, the temporal and spatial event sequence of the branches of the synapses combined defines the shape of the electric soliton.

06:59
And then that becomes so that it then gets divided by the branches of the exit terminal. And so that potentially becomes like fractalize. So what I'm saying is, imagine that you have this convergence so you have, you have the electric signals can converging into you have disparate you that you have basically.

07:40
The neuron makes an image, makes it takes all these dendritic signals and makes an image out of them or sound out of them. But by translating temple spiritual patterns into a single electrical wave. That is his trance that is transmitted over the body of a single neuron. And then what might happen is that the external it when it divides that way it's basically making a lot of copies of that waste pattern that temple space away pattern and each copy is like a little fractal, mini copy.

08:33
So, it's like it's like it. It's demagnifying or shrinking. Representation a four-dimensional representational pattern into from a big action potential into a something that is carried by a neurotransmitter, I'm just like, just like, I'm imagining how that could seem but at the very edge at the very least that like so the production of a specific electric waveform would, at least allow a neuron to pass along that sort of analog way form to the next neuron and but so, in terms of signal transmission in terms of synapses.

09:39
So, so there's the, there's the mechanical waveform. And then the magnetic, obviously, you know, the magnetic fields the electromagnetic fields are being is, it's the charges are being displayed, which is causing differences to happen. It's causing differences to happen. And that's another thing is that, you know basically you know I got really into Buddhist ideas, thanks to the law of attraction movement, the law of attraction movement, I got into Buddhist ideas and that and also the matrix films.

10:29
So, the matrix film and the law of attraction movement, and I that really like drew me into studying

10:41
The experiential side of being this. And what what what what I'm what I think, you know what, I think. I love the sort of analogy that beyond the thinking mind there's no distinction. That the mind knows that every thought is essentially a distinction that divides the whole lot of reality into parts.

11:20
Anytime, there's any thought that makes a distinction between light and dark or any kind of distinction between red and blue between this thought. And no thought routine between yeah between any thought. And and and and any other thought, like any kind of distinction at all or any kind of awareness at all, is a division of space.

11:48
It's a division of, it's a distinction of space space time, and that is a division of space time. Mechanically speaking. There is a difference that is being noticed because if no difference was noticed, then nothing would be noticed. They would if there were no difference to notice, then there would be nothing, you know.

12:25
There'd be no awareness. And so that idea is that at the root of it, the brain has to be able to, at the very least, create distinctions and that that's, that is why basically, you know, people who argue that, you know, resonate the resonant theory of the mind. The problem with the resonance theory of the minds, it's it's not that

12:58
It's like, okay, there are residents, there are residents, having residents is an event that happens everywhere, including in your mind. Let's redness theory of the mind is, it's imagining that that consciousness is, sort of caused by my synchronization or integration or integrated synchronization. It's like integrated synchronization theory, but it's all like a site.

13:37
Like, it's all like this excitatory network. That's just polling things together and combining things. It's all convergence. And and there's no, it's sort of lacking the, the quote, the the polar mechanism, which is, you know, it's all convergence and coherence and combination and integrated information there. I mean, it's like there is an important role for this integrated theory of decoherence or there.
14:26

All right. Or basically like it's interesting that they picked the word resonance between. But you need at this, you need an order for information to have a pattern that has to be the same. Since synchronization is merging and erasing some distinctions, the more synchronization that happens.

14:54
The more awareness disappears, the more advantages, the more contextual relevance, the more, the more. How did I get on this site? Oops. The more contextually relevant relevance. That has it debates your it, deletes it, the debate, the divisions. Inhibitions the negative helps to add details to the patterns that you see.

15:40
So that there is a growing awareness that if you have a brain that is where synchronization is being constantly disrupted, you have a brain because you have like you have it's it's only by encoding the synchronized pattern with decoherence or desynchronization or disruptions that are meaningful in the context of information theory, rare patterns among the common tonic oscillation. Does that happen? Is that carrier of synchronization, which can be thought of as the container of a soliton.

16:18
Way, the of an, or the container of information. So, so

16:29
A brain produces like a global soliton wave pattern? A four-dimensional global solitude wave pattern that inside and it produces this inside,

17:17
Mathematician who wrote SYNC describes.


Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU. 




for a long time before I even read this book. 


I've been thinking of spaceTime as a fractal of verdicts and I you know we're dissipative systems like a Vortex like a galaxy.
17:52

Looks like a vortex. A hurricane. Looks like a vortex and the atom looks like a vortex. I didn't realize that vortices include, you know, human cells. Human cells are vortexes inside. Vortices with vortices are beside those vortices. It's like a practical vortex, but the oscillation of the vortex is an oscillation and an oscillation is the vortex.
18:24

In terms of like there is a repeating cichlid pattern there's a cycling pattern that has a temp. Is it a temple? Resonance or temporal oscillation? Yeah. So resonance is the decaying oscillator, right? Instead of a continuing oscillator, but the very, but, but the oscillator itself is, is it even in resonation?

18:57
It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.

19:28
And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

20:34
So if you have a dissipated system, the oscillation doesn't resonate away. It's like but yeah I think of you know like something that is expanding contracting and that is the expansion contractions.

21:05
You know, our creating

21:13
Isolatory movements at the most fundamental scale. So yeah I think a space is like it's something that is at the most fundamental scale. It's randomly expanding and contracting, creating us, creating the fundamental oscillations of space time. And so we, so we are so right? Right now I am one with space time.

21:47
We all are in terms of like I am what space time looks like at some point during its folding process. And it's a floating process that has amazing organization. So I'm saying like it starts out at the most fundamental level in a sort of like rent, like a the most at one end of what, one end of the spectrum.

22:19
It's completely random. It's it's random sort of thing. Like, you know, I'm talking about like uncertain, like the uncertainty hypothesis, right? You can only see the quantum, the, the particle jiggles, because it can because you can either see it's momentum or it's positioned but not both at the same time.

22:52
So has to constantly alternate between states. It's physically uncertain what it wants to be and the uncertainty principle applies to basically all of space time creating micro oscillations.

23:16
But then, what happens is these oscillations serve as tractors to attractors that are sort of like having random encounters with each other. And so, but tractors. Like a tractor is and it's like an event that is going to continue to oscillate but like but there but they're attracted in a different way, they're like attracting other oscillators, they're attracting other particles or tracking electrons they have and they're doing it.

24:03
The attraction is being caused in a mechanical way because the interaction of one oscillator with another is causing us to have a reaction like a reaction where it's like it's so forces have collided in space and they balance off each other. There's this reaction to space folding and then hitting itself.

24:34
So it bounces off itself with these folds because they have like they pull each other together because they're oscillators and oscillators attract. And so everything in space clumps together and you get rocks and you get gasses and you get stars and you get every possible autonomic creation, you know, long enough timeline and in which the universe is able to sort of follow physics, basically a kind and natural selection for physics.

25:11
So there's so, you know, evolution is the natural selection of life, the path, the process of natural session for life. But there's also scientists who've shared a theory that there's a natural selection for physics and that there isn't that there's there's there's a lot of it's that's a good idea and there's a lot of easy examples, right?

25:34
Like the fact that most of the chemicals that that we have here on earth, including our own bodies, were made in stars like the universe started out with like a lot of hydrogen and helium but not much else. And so, the University went through phases of physics based natural selection where, where events at the quantum scale,

26:12
Sort of became certain sort of went from being the. So there was a transition from the complexity of what was happening at the molecular scale or at the atomic scale to the molecular scale to the chemical scale. Like there are transition phases and the timeline where the organization of oscillators into increasingly complex structures up until you know human life.

26:44
And the present moment which is human life is still like a continuation of the same natural selection of the cosmos itself. And it's sort of like it's so I'm like yeah so I'm thinking yes in a way space time emerged everywhere at once simultaneously but there's nothing from there's nothing that's that is going to fundamentally prevent.

27:24
The continual sort of natural selection of space time. The natural selection of space-time should be the chapter.
