(oscillat, dendrite, synap)
Talk about Koch
basically how the gamma wave frequency was one idea for how consciousness might work
then oscillations
but each time the idea was sort of pushed aside. because the complete concept picture of how and what was happening was missing.
 
A new way to look at what the human brain

A new way to look at what the human brain is doing.

So I can list all of the great names in the first couple of pages, sort of an intrologue

We had this thing called compatible canvas's
 
I mean the brain's oscillations are canvas's for phasic neural circuit firing, except the canvas is temporally observing and collectively learning the synapse, dendrite, neuron, and neural circuit firing.

look up dipole electromagnetic wave scattering

and dipole electromagnetic wave focusing

is there any EM wave focusing to the center parts of the brain, which areas?

the indentations on a record or the holes on a cd rom both become something when the record or cd is played,

the bumps or dots will often become music that is played back

so imagine that if we can encode music as bumps, or files as dots on a cd rom, or 
we can magnetize the harddrive or change the magnetic alignment of cells in some other kind of memory chip that it is not inconceviable for the human brain to play back music with remembered hertz freuencies stored in audio patterns

but what I am saying is that the neurons are helping to store the memories and to play them back, 

they are helping the oscillator to have a pattern that the oscillator can observe, learn, update, combine and integrate with other patterns
