# ChatGPT 4 Summary

The text examines the parallels between human social networks and neural networks, discussing how communication, connections, and influences function similarly at both micro and macro levels.

# CbatGPT 4 Key points:

Human interactions can result in varying degrees of happiness and outcomes, much like how neurons communicate.

In both human relationships and neural networks, connections can strengthen, weaken, or break off.

Fractal parallels exist between human social networks and neural networks, providing potential insights.

Breaks and unions in human relationships can lead to profound, significant, and transformational changes.

Neurons communicate through both electrical and chemical synapses, with electrical synapses acting as a building block for chemical synapses.

Excitatory network oscillators allow small neuronal events to trigger large cascades, providing energy for coordinated motor function.

Inhibitory neurons and chemical synapses contribute to sensory distinctions by breaking down and distributing information, allowing network oscillators to learn complex patterns.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription:

I think what all in this, I think you could argue that any person is in the sort of situation

where the people they interacted with in the past have responded to them with varying degrees

of happiness.

Some of them significantly less happy than others, and some of them a lot more happy than

others about the past interactions.

That's not to sort of point fingers at who did what first and what was their causality

and their responsibility, you know, oftentimes people become in the course of a conversation

where there's back and forth conversation, you're becoming an oscillator with that other

person and if things are, if the result is a positive outcome, both persons probably

contributed to that positive outcome and if it's a less positive outcome, if it's not

as positive, both persons probably contributed to that less positive outcome.

And so in some cases, you know, the communications with people that you met in your past or strengthen

in some cases, they're decreased, awakened, broken off, and this is sort of like a factor

of what happens with your neurons on the micro level.

It's a factor because, yeah, so the neurons are connected by synapses and sometimes the

connections grow and sometimes they dissipate and the big picture analogy is that the human

social network and the social network of neurons, they have some interesting fractal parallels

that can be considered for potential insights.

One of those insights might be that people that we are not talking to now that we were

talking to in the past, they still exist in a shared network, but it's not like this network

has to, it's not that this network has to become diseased or cancerous, maybe there

was some sort of event or lesion that drove people apart or drove the neurons apart and

maybe it was traumatic for both, I don't know, but the point is that if you think of

it as a human being, it's kind of like a neuron as a functional fractal, a functional fractal

isomorphism of a neuron in terms of resonating with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving

patterns and storing patterns to replay patterns.

The fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neural circuit, it's the fractal of a cortical

column, it's the fractal of a neural oscillator, it's the fractal of the whole brain, it's

the fractal of a person in the context of their social relationships.

Sometimes we have, I want to say we have breaks with other people or we have unions

with other people and these breaks and unions can be profound, significant, transformational,

they can cause changes to the people involved and, you know, when there can be, so there

could be, so think about it this way, so there could be high level configuration reasons

for why two neurons don't communicate with one another anymore, it has nothing to do

with what either neuron actually did, but it comes from a high level sort of like interference

pattern. You can see that in the case that neural oscillators will, if you're looking

at EEG, at the frequency bands of alpha, theta, delta, gamma, you have these horizontal

bands, sometimes you'll see these vertical bands intersecting the horizontal bands across

the spectrum and that is higher level dipole activity exerting a sort of top down influence

on, it's a high level configuration structure exerting top down influence on lower level

configuration structures and the reverse is also true because the system is sort of

electronically cycling neurons at a flow rate that can, that has the effect of, this

hyper readiness state can allow the individual perturbations of small scale firing to exert

an influence on a larger scale assembly in terms of being that tipping point thing that

shifts the entire assembly from one state to another, but the tipping point idea is

sort of like accomplished because tonic oscillations give you a bridge which means you do not,

which means you do not need, so small oscillations have a hand, it's like weight displacement

machines at the gym. The weight displacement machine means that you can do pull ups if you

don't have enough muscle to lift your weight as long as the machine is helping you to lift

yourself. The machine is giving you like, okay, so instead of needing like, let's say

that in my case, I tend to oscillate around 200 pounds for most of the past several, maybe

the past six months, I've been oscillating around 200 pounds and there's a certain amount

of muscle that it takes to do a pull up if you're 200 pounds and in many cases that's

more muscle, in many cases that's, in my case, that's more muscle than I have, but there's

a weight displacement machine, a pull up machine that says, okay, well, you can use

your smaller muscles that are not, that can lift, I don't know, 100 pounds or 150 pounds,

I'm not sure exactly what it is. If you can do, if you can lift a smaller amount, we will

support you and displace the rest of your weight. It's sort of like the, you know, like

when you exercise in the water, right, after a broken, maybe someone had a broken arm like

I had a broken arm this year, and exercising in the water removes a lot of weight, which

allows you to perform movements with muscles that have either been destroyed through injury

or at your feet from inactivity during the recovery time, so that you can grow those

muscles with less weight. It's like, okay, so like, I was like, imagine like a small

event is like a, I mean like a single neuron firing is like trying to pick up a 30 pound

barbell with an arm that has an amount of muscle that's going to be really comfortable with

lifting a 10 pound barbell, but not anything heavier, right? So trying to lift a 30 pound

barbell without, when you can only really like comfortably lift a 10 pound barbell, that's

going to be hard to do. And what you do is you just, you do more with a 10 pound barbell

and you grow some muscle, take some protein or, you know, increase your protein content

and, you know, after you work out your muscle with the 10 pound barbell and then you move

to a 12 pound barbell or 15 pound barbell or 20 pound or 25 in that order, preferably,

so that as your muscle grows, you're taking on slightly higher amounts of, slightly greater

amounts of weight. Now, there are, you know, in order for your neurons to cause your muscles

to fire, they need to send a lot more than a single neuron transmission. It's not like

a blinking LED is going to trigger your, is going to be enough energy to cause your muscles

to fire. So we have, you know, for the muscles, we have these gap junctions, which are, you

know, the electrical synapse, which are basically every chemical neuron starts out as a gap

junction neuron. It starts out as an electrical synapse for transitioning to being, in some

cases, becoming a chemical synapse. The chemical synapse is sort of like, the electrical synapse

is sort of a pre-requisite structural building block to a chemical synapse. So the electrical

synapse, there was at one point an electrical synapse inside every chemical synapse. And

whether that's still active or inactive is a different question. But if you want the

ability for signals to quickly amass power to move muscles, there is a way for that.

And those are excitatory network oscillators that allow one small neuronal event to trigger

a large cascade of excited neurons. And that produces, through the process of LTD, long-term

depression, that produces group oscillatory activity that is going to provide the amount

of energy necessary for coordinated motor function. But that's different from what you, it's different

from what you might need for making sensory distinctions. So there's, what's useful for

making sensory distinctions are inhibitory neurons that can really divide up patterns

in all the ways. And chemical synapses that can break down, basically they can break down

and distribute the phase information of a single neuron in a way that allows a network

oscillator to learn high-level invariant patterns, multi-dimensional, multi-scale patterns.
