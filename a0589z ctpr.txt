We evolved to pass down Cultural Identity Software (The human mind is essentially software that we learn & copy from one another passing our "identity software" down through the ages. I wrote a short story about the Tetris effect on the brain and about how I feel like I become the protagonist of some movies after I watch them. This is )

Are you like me with the sort of mind that seems to temporally absorb the traits, persona, and characteristics of any person you really focus on for a significant quantity of time?

I know some of you are thinking that sounds weird, implausible, and possibly mentally ill. Usually I would think the exact same thing, and I would repress that side of myself, but today however I decided to do something different.

I decided to walk embrace the odd chameleon like nature of my weird brain to feel like I am actually becoming whomever I'm aware of for an extended period of time as my superpower instead of my sickness.

Have you ever played a video game, like maybe Tetris for example, until like 3am in the morning and then when you tried to go to sleep you could almost see Tetris blocks falling with your eyes closed as if your brain was trying to keep playing the same thing?

Well today I'm rethinking this situation, in light of Tetris and all the games, and or books, that would keep me awake at night, repeated by my visual cortex, seeping into my dreams, as being very literally related to the odd personality absorbing traits that I seem to have often.
