  54: Neurons are information programs that transmit their shapes theory: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topoi is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topoi is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.
  56: The argument is that you can store infinity in a curve, in mathematics you can, but can the protein structure of a neuron represent the infinity of a curve? and what is transmitted is argued to be an SDR, a sparse distributed representation of the whole, a tiny statistical fraction of the vast amount of information that might be in the ever changing topography of a neuron!

    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   63: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  60: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

  896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

   16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   71: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

  123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  128: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

  142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

a0123z.md:
  33: Direct connections are not the only means of influence and communication. If an electron can represent a snap shot of a unique topography (potential difference) then this topography (a spatial representation of number sets and functions, ie a program) can go anywhere it needs to go in the brain, regardless of whether it has a direct connection. So in this event the brain network can be redescribed as sort of internet of spacial temporal messages that are each a differential calculus represented by a whole neuron's changes, where the dendritic branch represents the change in Y and the synaptic branch represents the change in X, and the axon represents the division.

a0127z.md:
   17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
   58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

   18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography).

So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.

  17: Already we can see that the brainwave hz adds meaning to the system. The electron pulse in the neuron has not only a frequency, but also a hz. This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain.

  10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  25: ⟪ 285 characters skipped ⟫ikely, as data comes in, that the key frequencies at issue for human and other animal consciousness is electromagnetic field resonance of various types. This is measured by tools like electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. By achieving a shared resonance, the bandwidth and speed of information flows increase remarkably, allowing far more energy and information to flow between the constituents. This will, all else equal, result in a new higher-level consciousness. Where before there was a lack of resonance and rather chaotic energy and information flows, now there is a smooth transfer of energy and information. We call this “the shared resonance conjecture” in our theory. 
  31: What do boundaries even mean in the context of a seemingly immaterial thing like consciousness? What we’re referring to is the boundary of the physical energy and information flows that provide the content of consciousness. It’s something like axiomatic that for any information (like perceptions or internally-generated thoughts) to become part of consciousness, in each moment that information needs to reach the physical geography generating that consciousness. This would be the brain, in the case of humans and other animals (though not exclusively the brain, as we’re learning).

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

So it the total amount of bits that represents the whole electrical acoustic topography of a neuron were X, then with each new "memory imprinting occurrence" is like X +1.

Including the synaptic changes, and the dendrite changes.
  19: If the neuron is X, and the dendrite registers a +1, then the whole topography of the neuron is X+1, but if the neuron fires and transmits X then it would be as if the dendrite did not register +1.

His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.

The goal is to study how to do semantic segmentation or object segmentation on 3D data such as point clouds, voxels, meshes etc that might be collected with lidar, RGBd cameras, fMRI machines, FNIRS functional near infrared spectroscopy, openwater (Mary Lou Jepsen's technology), EIT (electrical impedance tomography, or new highly spatial EEG (reference: https://www.techexplorist.com/gentle-method-unlock-mysteries-deep-brain/21231/?fbclid=IwAR3HPPRuBUUc617f9MxlV9NHB6HJ-f3k9WntYhmkHQfFKU3fi7ZUw8YMPTg )

  5: In this talk there is a slide called "Cortical-Wide Neuronal Assemblies" he has a chart to show where brain activity has changed, and these changes were tracked with MEG Magnetic Encephalography, but interesting the chart looks like a sparse distributed representation SDR but also it might remind you of information theory, because the number of changes are small, rare, or sparse, which means they are more meaningful because of their sparsity or rareness, the same idea works with a single cell, and it's receptors, a small percentage of its receptors might meaningfully identify a pattern that the cell has learned.

  36: You can take any topography, any three dimensional surface area, and convert it into number sets and functions, a program that is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing. There is no difference between the version that is functions & number sets, and the actual three dimensional structure, it's just a conversation, so for numbers to not exist, is the same as saying that space doesn't exist

a0506z.md:
  6: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis, is that a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topoi is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topoi is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.

  115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

b0009y.md:
  41: It's it's it's a kind of tomography, right? Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.

b0038y.md:
    7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).
  180: And they might notice when suddenly their truth is contradicted or something is not quite right? You would notice this through sort of what I think of as like a Neuro Array Tomography, Conceptual Tomography.
  182: # December 26th 2021 was when I coined the terms Neural Array-Projection Tomography, Neuro Array Tomography, and Conceptual Tomography.
  223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.

  82: And then you have basically that's at some point in the brain. You have cortical columns that are also receiving and learning virtual representations of information. And we can describe this as as as akin to holography. But but also the, this is the key to why the human brain is is has awareness and has and why it generates self-awareness.

  107: It's able to learn from multiple variations on the representations of of different perspectives of incoming, sensory data and and and also your movement. And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.

b0075y.md:
  46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
  93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
  95: ⟪ 557 characters skipped ⟫ on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.

b0080y.md:
  29: That's right. I'm arguing that our brains are making a computer program but it's a pure, a computer program that is about the and narrow tomography and neurofunctional, tomography of sensory, input data and muscles and muscle data. The he analysis of both.

  17: "The Star Trek holodeck was inspired by inventor Gene Dolgoff, who owned a holography laboratory in New York City.[1] Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry met Dolgoff in 1973."
  19: This actually ties into the discussion of using holography or the reversing refraction of light for medical imaging with which is what Open Water (A company by Mary Lou Jepsen) is doing.
  23: Combining near infrared spectroscopy with ultrasound & holography.

b0097y.md:
   9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
  45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.

b0100y.md:
  150: You can extend this idea to 30 cells or 3000 cells, or 30,000 cells, you can see a pattern emerging in the 3D topography of fired & depressed neural activity emerging on both sides of the brain in the same frequency spectrum, and 

b0106y ctpr.txt:
  105: Now there are, there are basically hairs connected to neurons, basically hair cells that are detecting the vibrations of your of the sounds, but it's like again, it's like a sensor array that is doing that. That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
  107: Okay, and four dimensional tamography. Basically is like collecting all of the signals of of a four-dimensional phase field. So that the so that the brain can at some point but those signals together and construct, a four-dimensional phase shield to represent the modality. That's being studied to represent the the world that's being refracted by light to represent the details of sounds of where they where the sounds are coming from in that world and the details of what's being touched.

b0131y.md:
  13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.

b0132y ctpr.txt:
   6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
  62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

b0134y ctpr.txt:
  57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
  61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?

b0153y.md:
  29: ⟪ 379 characters skipped ⟫ patterns to create a lightfield. That's not what I predict is happening in the brain. Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

  11: And cephalography are not distorted that all by the skull, or the brain tissue around the brain, underneath the schools, and the mercy of that. The amazing features of that I guess are that you get a really nice high level non. I guess I don't know. Like would would have diffuse like if you can't capture the detail at the neuronal level with Magneto and self-loggery, With that being similar to applying like a diffusion like a diffuser filter over and image captured like putting and putting a diffuser on an image.
  13: Is that is that is there a similarity there? But the point is that we're considering the magnet, the false spectrum of the magnetic holography readout as the as a graph based upon the brain being a network that creates keeps component of the magnetic spectrum and a different area. It's like imagine a so meant.

b0181y ctpr.txt:
  60: Spectroscopy and ultrasound and holography That is the alternative sort of pathway that I think we're going to get to and noninvasive range computer interface but doing something like option, human being it's like actually Kennedy DNA. That is far finished. It's not too far finished because if they're not if the knowledge, you know, we have the ability to ability to, you know, hey I was used to to basically predict most of the approaching folds a few minutes.
  72: Because, you know, contrary to a max product is didn't neuron does expand when when it fires. And so, therefore it should be viewable with light at great distances to infrared light. As long as you can reverse their fractions, as long as the holography of works, the holography here for lightening the brain works.

b0187y ctpr.txt:
  15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

b0189y.md:
  13: Okay. Okay. And then I want to dive, I want to do a deep dive into. How how tommography works will. Do like all the different kinds of demography in terms of like how to market works throughout medical imaging in terms of like electrical impedance demography, but they won't do track, targety and then we'll do four years, slice projection, theorem.
  17: And then we'll have to the point is to like discuss all the different ways. Then this included at the topic of like choreography but also like it's all about, it's really about all the different ways that that we can do imaging. Now that are causing huge advances in like light are, there's like light are RGB fusion, there's deep learning, on light.

  22: And so they came up with the, they decided to bring EG your electroencephalography inside the school during epileptic seizures at surgeries epileptic surgeries. And so they cut into the person's goal for for the, for the epileptic surgery and they would place. The the ecog was called ECOG just basically EG but it's it's it's ecogos inside the skull but on top of the brain and that's a lot closer to the brain cells.
  78: I get really good next generation images from the brain, like they're using, they're like, oh, this company open water, which is a project by Mary. Lou Jackson is is it is plant is using is using holography to reverse the refraction of light to get really good medical languages of the brain and she's talked about using ultrasound to stimulate the brain.

  109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.

b0210y ctpr.txt:
  33: Interesting, thank you. Would anyone else want to our standard? And I I know that there's a lot of different brain computer interface technologies in the works that are designed to democratize the technology and make it vastly cheaper than the with the cost of, you know, like an MRI medical image cost today and one of those projects is called open EIT open electrical impedance demography and for a few hundred dollars, they're trying to bring something that can within, when combined, with deep learning approximate, you know, medical imaging that could be as useful in some cases for some, some kinds of scans as MRI.

b0252y.md:
  301: It's this is about advancement in imaging technologies and imaging concepts. And, and so, that's why there's a link, I think between like this renaissance and archeology and a renaissance and medical imaging is is, you know, there's there's, there's many different sort of branches of. I think of them as branches of demography, branches of democracy or image, sort of like, I mean, I guess, I guess maybe one of the oldest oldest ideas, that's still one of the most powerful ideas is for your transform.
  310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
  355: If you're, if you want to do multimodal medical imaging. But, but it's exciting because just like that, the principle of demography. Is anyone still in the room? I went. Did everyone leave? Let me just check. Oh, so have people left. But yeah, the really cool thing about this is that is that it's like,
  361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?
  430: So nearly has multiple branches of medical imaging, that sort of branch into it. So there's implanted electrodes and implanted electrode arrays, which are part of, which are also like grandparents. And then there's EG and ECOG which are also like grandparents and and basically you know anytime you're trying to measure voltage with a sensor that is sort of like that is electroencephalography which is the short word for EEG in tech and I think you know you could make an argument that the technically narrow link is the EG you could you could make that argument but that's not usually what people mean when they say EJ, they specifically mean like the scalp electrodes.

b0276y.md:
  225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
  705: And then you're traveling to. The different they're having to from v1 to v2 to v3 for 25 and 6 and in some cases those patterns are traveling all over the brain just like a lecture like EEG Electro and I mean, just like I'm. EG. EIT EIT is electrical impedance demography.

b0281y.md:
  80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

b0296y.md:
  142: I believe the answer is holography, so you know, hologram everyone likes holograms, right and you know, you can. Store you can store like really amazing three-dimensional even four-dimensional, you know, we're gonna have VR headsets that are basically holograms basically like a hologram is generated for every frame of your of of the screen so your teeth your TV will be like holograms in the future right it's really and then so that that that actually brings us back to like the but the but think about it, you know, we're talking about real shapes and transferring topography right and and you know, when you we need, Dive into mathematics and and you know you you can you can dive into many different dimensions and intern in terms of you know infinity in in that topography, I guess right it's still three dimensional but you can which you can so that answers one question I think and but then that brings us back to the the topic of the group in terms of you know, I guess also Sierra's question that that was mentioned earlier was could could photonics neurophytanics replace other brain interfaces.

b0302y.md:
   301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
   307: EEG or the firing speed of you know base basically the same the same rate that the neurons are firing just like what what? Neural link is doing but it's going to be able to you're going to be able to basically have this high resolution holographic image which can by a command's laser with functional air for spectroscopy or laser with doppler and you're you're doing holography you're reversing the refraction of light so you can you you're combining this with ultrasound to get greater depth so you can get all the way to the thalamus although to the core of the brain through completely through the neocortex and and then the idea is then that's that's just for the imaging part so we have well very precise imaging.
   494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.
  1086: You need a faster camera to do it. That's also laser. Doppler is something that is being. Used combining with holography, which is similar to an open water is doing but it's a bigger machine. So laser doppler with lography or you know function ever spectroscopy with the EG but laser F nares.
  1780: It's a bit of because I never met her, maybe people were mentioning magnetic field detection. Yes, there is method magneto some sorry. I might say they're wrong magnetosphilography yeah yeah yeah that's it what do you want to say something that's wrong yeah that is actually very promising because it's a device that you can put on top of your head and if it's quite a big device it's very heavy and it's very expensive because it has to detect a very very subtle magnetic fluctuations in the magnetic.

b0308y.md:
   69: Yeah. Um, let's see another one sure long term definitely long-term big team long-term thing yeah. See another thing oh so I guess I took a note that so magnetto encephalography burger. So this is a funny point so he was a physician not a physicist had he understood Maxwell's equations he he might not have started electric recording electricity from his son's scalp in the search for the oh that was his son no oh that no way oh no, okay, no yeah, no, okay so so the story with with with hands burger.
  420: Just in case like in general. I just would like to get into it from my handsome photography of understanding better notes. Myself you don't have me so sure. To start.

b0309y.md:
  157: Using laser and doppler or laser f nares because you can you can do when you combine it with holography and you're in your basically doing like using really big camera sensors and you're capturing the brain you capturing images of the brain so fast that you're able to basically image the brain is fast as EEG like or faster like that, that's what that's kind of like what we're talking about if you're gonna do like holography then you do want to have like the best quality images labels really huge.
  160: Camera sensors and you want to be doing it almost faster than EG and so that the and then you know, and then for stimulation they're combined that with ultrasound so I actually like no chance that within 20 years we're gonna anyone's gonna be getting brain surgery anymore because because we're gonna have a devices that are cheap and affordable and external and they'll be like laser-based flography with ultrasound and you'll just you have like this wearable that'll do everything the neuralink could do in terms of reading and ultimate ultra precise super, you know, Basically ultrasound based stimulation of very precise areas of your brain to to read and write to your brain like a like it's a hard drive but without any surgery in a very precise way that's that's me another 20 years that's it's not possible that will not be have will not have this by then.
  166: Maybe you could delve a little bit deeper into the the right part. So certainly, you know, we've used a lot of neuroimaging techniques including EEG FMRI ECOG. Electrochronography and things like that successfully but when you say right so we haven't ever at least in the way that I understand, right?
  200: And two photons stimulation you can direct light to individual neurons. Now that same problem that I mentioned earlier where you could actually stimulate axons too by stimulating that area was solved by engineering a optogenetic protein that only lives in the soma. So now you don't have so now in this very mutated mouth you have the ability to stimulate individual neurons in an intact awake mouse using a basically really cool holography.

b0310y.md:
   216: Oh I found I think I found it so um, there's a there's um, it's it's it's it's called the title is Colonel. Flow a high channel count scalable TD - F nearest system and it says kernel flow is a TD NIRS system has been designed but it includes an eight channel electroencephalography, so it includes the EG.
   605: And if it's not anxiety it's depression. So that's what that blood neuroscience is telling right now. I mean, it might be anger too. There's a lot of people with CTE electronic traumatic disulphography that just you know, they get really. Um so I mean how they've been I mean, they don't really some of them don't even report depression.
  1076: Um, but it's closer to like extreme x-ray crystallography it's not so much the communication information but just as the shape of the molecules know it's more of a resonance phenomenology, which is what we suspect so it's not only the weights like the, Spectroscopy it's not it's not similar to that it's a little bit different but it's like a you require an array of sensors to be able to detect these signals and then using something similar to a multi input multi-output array of sensors, you can make these kind of characterizations.
  1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  1103: A quarter of a million dollars so trying to break it down a few orders of magnitude is actually quite possible again through a bunch of tricks that are more machine learning bass, but basically doing something similar to computational photography where you leverage machine learning to increase the resolution or resolution capability of a low-cost sensor by training in tandem with a high resolution sensor.
  1620: It's just amazing and they're all they're all those like they're they're all have there's all like commonalities they're all basically like, you know coming down to vape in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way I think of of, you know, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  1623: That belonged to that object in a 3d space has been captured with a camera but then but now we're like talking about okay, well, you know, we're gonna win a shine light into the brain with functional air for a spectroscopy and combining with ultrasound and basically reverse the refraction of of light which is holography which which is in but then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.

  1006: Maybe the most common and maybe like the bottom here but but the potential of f nurse is you know, like you know like you is is great there's also HD dot HD dash doT, it's another cool thing there's this company called open water that is is so again, they're they're using f mirrors and they're using ultrasound and they're they're using they're doing holography, so when you try and when you try and light through the brain so our brains are.
  1009: Our brains and our bodies are basically two infrared light, they're basically transparent they're basically as transparent as jellyfish to infrared light so light just passes red light passes through the human body, and but it will fly it refracts a lot so it's so it it scatters right and but if you can if you could accurately reverse the refraction of the light, then then you're doing the the exact thing that that is holography that it holography is the reversion that reversing the reflection of Light and producing an image from from that reversal of light scattering and so with that technology you could recreate extremely detailed images of the human body, especially if you have a very fast and very big camera sensor or CMOS chip and so and and if you like you could use you can use ultrasound to also extend the depth of the of the lights and, I I wrote about this no no I'm saying that I wrote a you wouldn't recommend it.
  1036: Interesting. Taking that potentially someday we may also do this wirelessly. This basically collects the same amount of data that we're collecting with our link. I'm not invasively with with holography and and functional narrative spectroscopy and an ultrasound. And that includes doing closed loop therapies. And in right in like, you know, when you know, I believe that that I think was max type mark that the guy who is leading the neural ink project that he.
  1039: I believe he said something like there is no other possible way to to detect a neuron firing in real time, unless you're gonna stick an electro like right up next to it. Like you just can't do it from outside the brain but but but I think you can. If you if you can do holography, you can reverse the reflection of light and you can do that process it laser speed, you know, if you can do it as fast as I you know, 200 times faster than MRI or something like that, but but so maybe so 20 to maybe 20 years from now you have a you have a device that can do exactly what nearly does.
  1063: Okay so shorthand for high density is used optical thermography for image income thank you and also what's your picnic what was your so you you mentioned so for me. I mean, hmm my gut feeling instead of for ultrasound this a mechanic mechanical signal would be slower than a light electromagnetic signals right, so they don't still depends on the the subject.
  1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?

b0313y.md:
  368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.
  371: With. New with new faster chips to basically detect neuron firing basically by reduced by by reduced by reversing the refraction of light which is called holography and doing it fast enough so that we can notice the expansion and contraction of neurons as they're firing without enable us to basically read things as as fast as an early link is reading them as precisely as nervous as an early because reading them, but in a non-invasive way and and with ultrasound we could stimulate the brain also non evasively so this so this.
  398: Oh that's great yeah anyone anyone of you guys you could just share some thoughts on geography where's all this happening. I mean with computing obviously the valley played a huge role in pushing things. Is this predominantly in the valley as well or are there other cities that are leading the charge?

b0314y.md:
   13: I think this is actually put together buy a neurologist in Southern California and it addresses the the current problem that we have in the hospital sending of the unmet need of rapid expedited brainwave pattern detection. You know, if you look at the current mode of or the current model if you will the business model for getting electroencephalography in the hospital it is.
  122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.
  152: So those are probably terms of at least what's available in clinical production from the therapeutic standpoint those are available. Only one day it looks like Carl left the group, but if he comes back he can let him know Micah that Magneto electrode cephalography probably is where he would be interested.
  164: Yeah, no good question. I see what you're asking. So basically with the magnetoon subflography, the the leads are are usually titanium. They're not as conductive as you know properly for example, but usually you get about the same quality of information. So it's not not even close to the kind of fidelity of EEG signal that you would get let's say from neural link.
  172: You were talking about mixing AEG and FMRI. How But but uh, what for my understanding Magneto electrons. Sethography is the it is like if that's the one where so with EEG it's better with to pick up signals from the sulcai I think and then with MEG it's better to pick at picking up signals from the gyri or admit it could be vice versa because once directly reading out the electric field and the other ones reading out the magnetic field, but I think, EEG makes it applies.
  178: So, We would not typically do any EEG at the same time as a functional MRI with the magnitude of encephalography really we are mapping out brain activity. And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.
  872: Hi my name is Chris and thanks a lot. I am completely unqualified to comment on this discussion but I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it and I especially wanted to commend you Dexter on the rigorous typography of your profile, it's really it's really beautifully laid out so I gotta say just as a retired graphic designer it's probably much good that's fun thank you just me too for my former yeah, well I sometimes still do graphics design but, Yeah, thank you so much if you're a graphic designer of a certain kind of band right you look at a profound you're like, ah this bothers me type outfit it's not right and yeah that's something that sort of never leads you alone to come from art school time, so thanks for noticing oh well, I mean, you're you're credential I'm really just been satisfied to.

b0318y.md:
  123: Um so going back to what people said earlier it it's not really necessary if the if the electricity is a good strong enough poles for the sounds if the sound being converted into electricity is strong enough like for example in the in the case of electrical impedance demography, you don't need to amplify the electricity at all for to flow through neural tissue or through a tree it is it what might what would happen if the electricity signal is strong enough is that it will flow through, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.
  644: To your point in physics, it turns out that you can actually look at the world in a different scale so if you look at it the human scale, you see the classical physics and then you can ask the question is there any meaningful questions that I can impose on this world to see if there's something else going on behind the scenes behind the, There is a theorem called homography.

  436: Because the, That would kind of go online towards a. I wouldn't say supporting the simulation but just adds more entry intriguing thoughts to that so I love that thank you is dependent on string theory being the fundamental kind of model. Of theoretical physics because holography as a mathematical model or a whole logger fee as a principal only really comes out if string theory is true or not, but a holography has been a way of us we stop.
  739: So this is a subject of my research and I'm pretty cool that you brought it up. I have a paper that just came out called space-time paths as a whole and it shows that it's an internet journal quantum reports if you want to check it out it shows that as we've formulated it quantum mechanics and the path integral of quantum field theory actually has these properties of holography and I think it's important to sort of back away from the idea that you need a surface like the surface of a black hole like a physical surface or like some people imagine that the edge of the Most is like this two-dimensional screen that's projecting us as holographic people there's actually just this relationship and the relationship underlying holograms is actually much deeper which is a relationship between the frequencies or the frequency representation of things and in the physical world and you can represent everything in the physical world and in terms of its frequency representation and in that sense the source of that hologram is really just all around us.
  754: Power brain assimilates or assembles objects depths and color and the emotions of color. I'm currently working on a photography project. I'm an artist exploring blindness through photography processes, experimental photography processes and. What input data goes in through? You know, the photoreceptors can be flawed or marred or what you see.
  904: I think I think the model is lacking there. So, I think that that, Is why it's useful to think about you know, I was talking earlier about this you take about photography and Adobe Photoshop. What's what's true about Adobe Photoshop images is that the information that. Composes them is distributed throughout the picture.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons.

    26:   56: The argument is that you can store infinity in a curve, in mathematics you can, but can the protein structure of a neuron represent the infinity of a curve? and what is transmitted is argued to be an SDR, a sparse distributed representation of the whole, a tiny statistical fraction of the vast amount of information that might be in the ever changing topography of a neuron!

    58:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
    62:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
    65:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
    67:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
    69:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
    73:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
    76:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

   176:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   178:    71: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

   191:   128: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

   202:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
   206:   33: Direct connections are not the only means of influence and communication. If an electron can represent a snap shot of a unique topography (potential difference) then this topography (a spatial representation of number sets and functions, ie a program) can go anywhere it needs to go in the brain, regardless of whether it has a direct connection. So in this event the brain network can be redescribed as sort of internet of spacial temporal messages that are each a differential calculus represented by a whole neuron's changes, where the dendritic branch represents the change in Y and the synaptic branch represents the change in X, and the axon represents the division.
   211:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   223:   107: # Hal 9000 & Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography
   228:   13: I did this great interview with a company at the GPU summit earlier this year that was about homomorphic encryption, which means computation can be run on encrypted data without decryption. I haven't published it yet, but in researching that company I found some great new research (new last April 2017) on category theory encryption or category theory cryptography, there are so many cool ideas out there!

   257:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.
   270:   17: Already we can see that the brainwave hz adds meaning to the system. The electron pulse in the neuron has not only a frequency, but also a hz. This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain.

   309:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

This is measured by tools like electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. By achieving a shared resonance, the bandwidth and speed of information flows increase remarkably, allowing far more energy and information to flow between the constituents. This will, all else equal, result in a new higher-level consciousness. Where before there was a lack of resonance and rather chaotic energy and information flows, now there is a smooth transfer of energy and information. We call this “the shared resonance conjecture” in our theory. 
   318:   31: What do boundaries even mean in the context of a seemingly immaterial thing like consciousness? What we’re referring to is the boundary of the physical energy and information flows that provide the content of consciousness. It’s something like axiomatic that for any information (like perceptions or internally-generated thoughts) to become part of consciousness, in each moment that information needs to reach the physical geography generating that consciousness. This would be the brain, in the case of humans and other animals (though not exclusively the brain, as we’re learning).

This was followed by a world facing VCSEL-SPAD (VCSEL = Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser, SPAD = Single Photon Avalanche Detector) LiDAR in the recent iPad and iPhone generations.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

   467:   3: #Laser Doppler imaging is as fast as EEG but not very deep, but what if we mix in holography?
   472:   14: Each "repeated" occurrence is a tiny change in the whole structure of a neuron. So it the total amount of bits that represents the whole electrical acoustic topography of a neuron were X, then with each new "memory imprinting occurrence" is like X +1. It doesn't matter at all that the overall structure is largely the same, because the SDR snap shot is going to be subtly altered because of the increasing changes to X as a whole. Including the synaptic changes, and the dendrite changes.
   476:   19: If the neuron is X, and the dendrite registers a +1, then the whole topography of the neuron is X+1, but if the neuron fires and transmits X then it would be as if the dendrite did not register +1. The only way the information gets passed on is if when the neuron fires, it transmits X +1. ie it's topoi, an SDR (snapshop) of it's shape.

HEG uses light to observe blood in the brain through the skull.In 2009, Hershel Toomim and I had the opportunity to discuss the wave. Had he seen it using HEG? His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.

   508:   5: In this talk there is a slide called "Cortical-Wide Neuronal Assemblies" he has a chart to show where brain activity has changed, and these changes were tracked with MEG Magnetic Encephalography, but interesting the chart looks like a sparse distributed representation SDR but also it might remind you of information theory, because the number of changes are small, rare, or sparse, which means they are more meaningful because of their sparsity or rareness, the same idea works with a single cell, and it's receptors, a small percentage of its receptors might meaningfully identify a pattern that the cell has learned.
   513:   36: You can take any topography, any three dimensional surface area, and convert it into number sets and functions, a program that is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing. There is no difference between the version that is functions & number sets, and the actual three dimensional structure, it's just a conversation, so for numbers to not exist, is the same as saying that space doesn't exist
   518:   6: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis, is that a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topoi is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topoi is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.

   557:   227:     Electrical Impedance Tomography
   562:   8: perhaps the morphology of the spine and dendrite encodes a memory in the topography or shape of the neuron, setting its shape as its voltage or waveform, the amplitude of its wave form or volume of its learned pattern, that changes long term with long term memory changes, its shape changes, because of new protein synthesis for growth in certain areas that are stimulated 
   567:   115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
   572:   41: It's it's it's a kind of tomography, right? Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.
   577:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).
   581:   180: And they might notice when suddenly their truth is contradicted or something is not quite right? You would notice this through sort of what I think of as like a Neuro Array Tomography, Conceptual Tomography.
   583:   182: # December 26th 2021 was when I coined the terms Neural Array-Projection Tomography, Neuro Array Tomography, and Conceptual Tomography.
   587:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.
   592:   82: And then you have basically that's at some point in the brain. You have cortical columns that are also receiving and learning virtual representations of information. And we can describe this as as as akin to holography. But but also the, this is the key to why the human brain is is has awareness and has and why it generates self-awareness.
   597:   3: For the ultrasonography test the
   602:   107: It's able to learn from multiple variations on the representations of of different perspectives of incoming, sensory data and and and also your movement. And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.
   607:   46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
   611:   93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
   613:   95: ⟪ 557 characters skipped ⟫ on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.
   618:   29: That's right. I'm arguing that our brains are making a computer program but it's a pure, a computer program that is about the and narrow tomography and neurofunctional, tomography of sensory, input data and muscles and muscle data. The he analysis of both.
   623:   17: "The Star Trek holodeck was inspired by inventor Gene Dolgoff, who owned a holography laboratory in New York City.[1] Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry met Dolgoff in 1973."
   625:   19: This actually ties into the discussion of using holography or the reversing refraction of light for medical imaging with which is what Open Water (A company by Mary Lou Jepsen) is doing.
   629:   23: Combining near infrared spectroscopy with ultrasound & holography.
   634:    9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
   638:   45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.
   643:   150: You can extend this idea to 30 cells or 3000 cells, or 30,000 cells, you can see a pattern emerging in the 3D topography of fired & depressed neural activity emerging on both sides of the brain in the same frequency spectrum, and 
   648:   105: Now there are, there are basically hairs connected to neurons, basically hair cells that are detecting the vibrations of your of the sounds, but it's like again, it's like a sensor array that is doing that. That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
   650:   107: Okay, and four dimensional tamography. Basically is like collecting all of the signals of of a four-dimensional phase field. So that the so that the brain can at some point but those signals together and construct, a four-dimensional phase shield to represent the modality. That's being studied to represent the the world that's being refracted by light to represent the details of sounds of where they where the sounds are coming from in that world and the details of what's being touched.
   655:   13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.
   660:    6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   662:    8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
   666:   62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.
   671:   57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
   675:   61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?
   680:   29: ⟪ 379 characters skipped ⟫ patterns to create a lightfield. That's not what I predict is happening in the brain. Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.
   684:   33: # Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)
   689:   11: And cephalography are not distorted that all by the skull, or the brain tissue around the brain, underneath the schools, and the mercy of that. The amazing features of that I guess are that you get a really nice high level non. I guess I don't know. Like would would have diffuse like if you can't capture the detail at the neuronal level with Magneto and self-loggery, With that being similar to applying like a diffusion like a diffuser filter over and image captured like putting and putting a diffuser on an image.
   691:   13: Is that is that is there a similarity there? But the point is that we're considering the magnet, the false spectrum of the magnetic holography readout as the as a graph based upon the brain being a network that creates keeps component of the magnetic spectrum and a different area. It's like imagine a so meant.
   696:   60: Spectroscopy and ultrasound and holography That is the alternative sort of pathway that I think we're going to get to and noninvasive range computer interface but doing something like option, human being it's like actually Kennedy DNA. That is far finished. It's not too far finished because if they're not if the knowledge, you know, we have the ability to ability to, you know, hey I was used to to basically predict most of the approaching folds a few minutes.
   700:   72: Because, you know, contrary to a max product is didn't neuron does expand when when it fires. And so, therefore it should be viewable with light at great distances to infrared light. As long as you can reverse their fractions, as long as the holography of works, the holography here for lightening the brain works.
   705:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
   709:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
   713:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.
   718:   13: Okay. Okay. And then I want to dive, I want to do a deep dive into. How how tommography works will. Do like all the different kinds of demography in terms of like how to market works throughout medical imaging in terms of like electrical impedance demography, but they won't do track, targety and then we'll do four years, slice projection, theorem.
   722:   17: And then we'll have to the point is to like discuss all the different ways. Then this included at the topic of like choreography but also like it's all about, it's really about all the different ways that that we can do imaging. Now that are causing huge advances in like light are, there's like light are RGB fusion, there's deep learning, on light.
   727:   22: And so they came up with the, they decided to bring EG your electroencephalography inside the school during epileptic seizures at surgeries epileptic surgeries. And so they cut into the person's goal for for the, for the epileptic surgery and they would place. The the ecog was called ECOG just basically EG but it's it's it's ecogos inside the skull but on top of the brain and that's a lot closer to the brain cells.
   731:   78: I get really good next generation images from the brain, like they're using, they're like, oh, this company open water, which is a project by Mary. Lou Jackson is is it is plant is using is using holography to reverse the refraction of light to get really good medical languages of the brain and she's talked about using ultrasound to stimulate the brain.
   736:   109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.
   741:   33: Interesting, thank you. Would anyone else want to our standard? And I I know that there's a lot of different brain computer interface technologies in the works that are designed to democratize the technology and make it vastly cheaper than the with the cost of, you know, like an MRI medical image cost today and one of those projects is called open EIT open electrical impedance demography and for a few hundred dollars, they're trying to bring something that can within, when combined, with deep learning approximate, you know, medical imaging that could be as useful in some cases for some, some kinds of scans as MRI.
   746:   301: It's this is about advancement in imaging technologies and imaging concepts. And, and so, that's why there's a link, I think between like this renaissance and archeology and a renaissance and medical imaging is is, you know, there's there's, there's many different sort of branches of. I think of them as branches of demography, branches of democracy or image, sort of like, I mean, I guess, I guess maybe one of the oldest oldest ideas, that's still one of the most powerful ideas is for your transform.
   750:   310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
   754:   355: If you're, if you want to do multimodal medical imaging. But, but it's exciting because just like that, the principle of demography. Is anyone still in the room? I went. Did everyone leave? Let me just check. Oh, so have people left. But yeah, the really cool thing about this is that is that it's like,
   758:   361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?
   762:   430: So nearly has multiple branches of medical imaging, that sort of branch into it. So there's implanted electrodes and implanted electrode arrays, which are part of, which are also like grandparents. And then there's EG and ECOG which are also like grandparents and and basically you know anytime you're trying to measure voltage with a sensor that is sort of like that is electroencephalography which is the short word for EEG in tech and I think you know you could make an argument that the technically narrow link is the EG you could you could make that argument but that's not usually what people mean when they say EJ, they specifically mean like the scalp electrodes.
   767:   225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
   771:   705: And then you're traveling to. The different they're having to from v1 to v2 to v3 for 25 and 6 and in some cases those patterns are traveling all over the brain just like a lecture like EEG Electro and I mean, just like I'm. EG. EIT EIT is electrical impedance demography.
   776:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.
   780:   142: I believe the answer is holography, so you know, hologram everyone likes holograms, right and you know, you can. Store you can store like really amazing three-dimensional even four-dimensional, you know, we're gonna have VR headsets that are basically holograms basically like a hologram is generated for every frame of your of of the screen so your teeth your TV will be like holograms in the future right it's really and then so that that that actually brings us back to like the but the but think about it, you know, we're talking about real shapes and transferring topography right and and you know, when you we need, Dive into mathematics and and you know you you can you can dive into many different dimensions and intern in terms of you know infinity in in that topography, I guess right it's still three dimensional but you can which you can so that answers one question I think and but then that brings us back to the the topic of the group in terms of you know, I guess also Sierra's question that that was mentioned earlier was could could photonics neurophytanics replace other brain interfaces.
   785:    301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
   788:    304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
   791:    307: EEG or the firing speed of you know base basically the same the same rate that the neurons are firing just like what what? Neural link is doing but it's going to be able to you're going to be able to basically have this high resolution holographic image which can by a command's laser with functional air for spectroscopy or laser with doppler and you're you're doing holography you're reversing the refraction of light so you can you you're combining this with ultrasound to get greater depth so you can get all the way to the thalamus although to the core of the brain through completely through the neocortex and and then the idea is then that's that's just for the imaging part so we have well very precise imaging.
   795:    494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.
   799:   1086: You need a faster camera to do it. That's also laser. Doppler is something that is being. Used combining with holography, which is similar to an open water is doing but it's a bigger machine. So laser doppler with lography or you know function ever spectroscopy with the EG but laser F nares.
   803:   1780: It's a bit of because I never met her, maybe people were mentioning magnetic field detection. Yes, there is method magneto some sorry. I might say they're wrong magnetosphilography yeah yeah yeah that's it what do you want to say something that's wrong yeah that is actually very promising because it's a device that you can put on top of your head and if it's quite a big device it's very heavy and it's very expensive because it has to detect a very very subtle magnetic fluctuations in the magnetic.
   808:    69: Yeah. Um, let's see another one sure long term definitely long-term big team long-term thing yeah. See another thing oh so I guess I took a note that so magnetto encephalography burger. So this is a funny point so he was a physician not a physicist had he understood Maxwell's equations he he might not have started electric recording electricity from his son's scalp in the search for the oh that was his son no oh that no way oh no, okay, no yeah, no, okay so so the story with with with hands burger.
   812:   420: Just in case like in general. I just would like to get into it from my handsome photography of understanding better notes. Myself you don't have me so sure. To start.
   817:   157: Using laser and doppler or laser f nares because you can you can do when you combine it with holography and you're in your basically doing like using really big camera sensors and you're capturing the brain you capturing images of the brain so fast that you're able to basically image the brain is fast as EEG like or faster like that, that's what that's kind of like what we're talking about if you're gonna do like holography then you do want to have like the best quality images labels really huge.
   820:   160: Camera sensors and you want to be doing it almost faster than EG and so that the and then you know, and then for stimulation they're combined that with ultrasound so I actually like no chance that within 20 years we're gonna anyone's gonna be getting brain surgery anymore because because we're gonna have a devices that are cheap and affordable and external and they'll be like laser-based flography with ultrasound and you'll just you have like this wearable that'll do everything the neuralink could do in terms of reading and ultimate ultra precise super, you know, Basically ultrasound based stimulation of very precise areas of your brain to to read and write to your brain like a like it's a hard drive but without any surgery in a very precise way that's that's me another 20 years that's it's not possible that will not be have will not have this by then.
   824:   166: Maybe you could delve a little bit deeper into the the right part. So certainly, you know, we've used a lot of neuroimaging techniques including EEG FMRI ECOG. Electrochronography and things like that successfully but when you say right so we haven't ever at least in the way that I understand, right?
   828:   200: And two photons stimulation you can direct light to individual neurons. Now that same problem that I mentioned earlier where you could actually stimulate axons too by stimulating that area was solved by engineering a optogenetic protein that only lives in the soma. So now you don't have so now in this very mutated mouth you have the ability to stimulate individual neurons in an intact awake mouse using a basically really cool holography.
   833:    216: Oh I found I think I found it so um, there's a there's um, it's it's it's it's called the title is Colonel. Flow a high channel count scalable TD - F nearest system and it says kernel flow is a TD NIRS system has been designed but it includes an eight channel electroencephalography, so it includes the EG.
   837:    605: And if it's not anxiety it's depression. So that's what that blood neuroscience is telling right now. I mean, it might be anger too. There's a lot of people with CTE electronic traumatic disulphography that just you know, they get really. Um so I mean how they've been I mean, they don't really some of them don't even report depression.
   841:   1076: Um, but it's closer to like extreme x-ray crystallography it's not so much the communication information but just as the shape of the molecules know it's more of a resonance phenomenology, which is what we suspect so it's not only the weights like the, Spectroscopy it's not it's not similar to that it's a little bit different but it's like a you require an array of sensors to be able to detect these signals and then using something similar to a multi input multi-output array of sensors, you can make these kind of characterizations.
   845:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
   849:   1103: A quarter of a million dollars so trying to break it down a few orders of magnitude is actually quite possible again through a bunch of tricks that are more machine learning bass, but basically doing something similar to computational photography where you leverage machine learning to increase the resolution or resolution capability of a low-cost sensor by training in tandem with a high resolution sensor.
   853: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
   856:   1623: That belonged to that object in a 3d space has been captured with a camera but then but now we're like talking about okay, well, you know, we're gonna win a shine light into the brain with functional air for a spectroscopy and combining with ultrasound and basically reverse the refraction of of light which is holography which which is in but then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
   859:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.
   864:   1006: Maybe the most common and maybe like the bottom here but but the potential of f nurse is you know, like you know like you is is great there's also HD dot HD dash doT, it's another cool thing there's this company called open water that is is so again, they're they're using f mirrors and they're using ultrasound and they're they're using they're doing holography, so when you try and when you try and light through the brain so our brains are.
   867:   1009: Our brains and our bodies are basically two infrared light, they're basically transparent they're basically as transparent as jellyfish to infrared light so light just passes red light passes through the human body, and but it will fly it refracts a lot so it's so it it scatters right and but if you can if you could accurately reverse the refraction of the light, then then you're doing the the exact thing that that is holography that it holography is the reversion that reversing the reflection of Light and producing an image from from that reversal of light scattering and so with that technology you could recreate extremely detailed images of the human body, especially if you have a very fast and very big camera sensor or CMOS chip and so and and if you like you could use you can use ultrasound to also extend the depth of the of the lights and, I I wrote about this no no I'm saying that I wrote a you wouldn't recommend it.
   871:   1036: Interesting. Taking that potentially someday we may also do this wirelessly. This basically collects the same amount of data that we're collecting with our link. I'm not invasively with with holography and and functional narrative spectroscopy and an ultrasound. And that includes doing closed loop therapies. And in right in like, you know, when you know, I believe that that I think was max type mark that the guy who is leading the neural ink project that he.
   874:   1039: I believe he said something like there is no other possible way to to detect a neuron firing in real time, unless you're gonna stick an electro like right up next to it. Like you just can't do it from outside the brain but but but I think you can. If you if you can do holography, you can reverse the reflection of light and you can do that process it laser speed, you know, if you can do it as fast as I you know, 200 times faster than MRI or something like that, but but so maybe so 20 to maybe 20 years from now you have a you have a device that can do exactly what nearly does.
   878:   1063: Okay so shorthand for high density is used optical thermography for image income thank you and also what's your picnic what was your so you you mentioned so for me. I mean, hmm my gut feeling instead of for ultrasound this a mechanic mechanical signal would be slower than a light electromagnetic signals right, so they don't still depends on the the subject.
   882:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
   886:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?
   891:   368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.
   894:   371: With. New with new faster chips to basically detect neuron firing basically by reduced by by reduced by reversing the refraction of light which is called holography and doing it fast enough so that we can notice the expansion and contraction of neurons as they're firing without enable us to basically read things as as fast as an early link is reading them as precisely as nervous as an early because reading them, but in a non-invasive way and and with ultrasound we could stimulate the brain also non evasively so this so this.
   898:   398: Oh that's great yeah anyone anyone of you guys you could just share some thoughts on geography where's all this happening. I mean with computing obviously the valley played a huge role in pushing things. Is this predominantly in the valley as well or are there other cities that are leading the charge?
   903:    13: I think this is actually put together buy a neurologist in Southern California and it addresses the the current problem that we have in the hospital sending of the unmet need of rapid expedited brainwave pattern detection. You know, if you look at the current mode of or the current model if you will the business model for getting electroencephalography in the hospital it is.
   907:   122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.
   911:   152: So those are probably terms of at least what's available in clinical production from the therapeutic standpoint those are available. Only one day it looks like Carl left the group, but if he comes back he can let him know Micah that Magneto electrode cephalography probably is where he would be interested.
   915:   164: Yeah, no good question. I see what you're asking. So basically with the magnetoon subflography, the the leads are are usually titanium. They're not as conductive as you know properly for example, but usually you get about the same quality of information. So it's not not even close to the kind of fidelity of EEG signal that you would get let's say from neural link.
   919:   172: You were talking about mixing AEG and FMRI. How But but uh, what for my understanding Magneto electrons. Sethography is the it is like if that's the one where so with EEG it's better with to pick up signals from the sulcai I think and then with MEG it's better to pick at picking up signals from the gyri or admit it could be vice versa because once directly reading out the electric field and the other ones reading out the magnetic field, but I think, EEG makes it applies.
   923:   178: So, We would not typically do any EEG at the same time as a functional MRI with the magnitude of encephalography really we are mapping out brain activity. And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.
   927:   872: Hi my name is Chris and thanks a lot. I am completely unqualified to comment on this discussion but I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it and I especially wanted to commend you Dexter on the rigorous typography of your profile, it's really it's really beautifully laid out so I gotta say just as a retired graphic designer it's probably much good that's fun thank you just me too for my former yeah, well I sometimes still do graphics design but, Yeah, thank you so much if you're a graphic designer of a certain kind of band right you look at a profound you're like, ah this bothers me type outfit it's not right and yeah that's something that sort of never leads you alone to come from art school time, so thanks for noticing oh well, I mean, you're you're credential I'm really just been satisfied to.
   932:   123: Um so going back to what people said earlier it it's not really necessary if the if the electricity is a good strong enough poles for the sounds if the sound being converted into electricity is strong enough like for example in the in the case of electrical impedance demography, you don't need to amplify the electricity at all for to flow through neural tissue or through a tree it is it what might what would happen if the electricity signal is strong enough is that it will flow through, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.
   936:   644: To your point in physics, it turns out that you can actually look at the world in a different scale so if you look at it the human scale, you see the classical physics and then you can ask the question is there any meaningful questions that I can impose on this world to see if there's something else going on behind the scenes behind the, There is a theorem called homography.
   941:   436: Because the, That would kind of go online towards a. I wouldn't say supporting the simulation but just adds more entry intriguing thoughts to that so I love that thank you is dependent on string theory being the fundamental kind of model. Of theoretical physics because holography as a mathematical model or a whole logger fee as a principal only really comes out if string theory is true or not, but a holography has been a way of us we stop.
   945:   739: So this is a subject of my research and I'm pretty cool that you brought it up. I have a paper that just came out called space-time paths as a whole and it shows that it's an internet journal quantum reports if you want to check it out it shows that as we've formulated it quantum mechanics and the path integral of quantum field theory actually has these properties of holography and I think it's important to sort of back away from the idea that you need a surface like the surface of a black hole like a physical surface or like some people imagine that the edge of the Most is like this two-dimensional screen that's projecting us as holographic people there's actually just this relationship and the relationship underlying holograms is actually much deeper which is a relationship between the frequencies or the frequency representation of things and in the physical world and you can represent everything in the physical world and in terms of its frequency representation and in that sense the source of that hologram is really just all around us.

I'm an artist exploring blindness through photography processes, experimental photography processes and. What input data goes in through? You know, the photoreceptors can be flawed or marred or what you see.
   953:   904: I think I think the model is lacking there. So, I think that that, Is why it's useful to think about you know, I was talking earlier about this you take about photography and Adobe Photoshop. What's what's true about Adobe Photoshop images is that the information that. Composes them is distributed throughout the picture.

  1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1269:    10:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
  1270:    11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  1271:    12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  1272:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1276:    17:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  1277:    18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  1278:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  1279:    20:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  1280:    21:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  1281:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  1282:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  1285:    26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
  1286:    27:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

  1311:    52:    16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
  1312:    53:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
  1313:    54:    71: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

  1317:    58:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  1318:    59:   128: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

  1321:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
  1324:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  1342:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  1361:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  1435:   176:   115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  1438:   179:   41: It's it's it's a kind of tomography, right? Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.
  1441:   182:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).
  1442:   183:   180: And they might notice when suddenly their truth is contradicted or something is not quite right? You would notice this through sort of what I think of as like a Neuro Array Tomography, Conceptual Tomography.
  1443:   184:   182: # December 26th 2021 was when I coined the terms Neural Array-Projection Tomography, Neuro Array Tomography, and Conceptual Tomography.
  1444:   185:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.
  1447:   188:   107: It's able to learn from multiple variations on the representations of of different perspectives of incoming, sensory data and and and also your movement. And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.
  1450:   191:   46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
  1451:   192:   93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
  1452:   193:   95: ⟪ 553 characters skipped ⟫d so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.
  1455:   196:   29: That's right. I'm arguing that our brains are making a computer program but it's a pure, a computer program that is about the and narrow tomography and neurofunctional, tomography of sensory, input data and muscles and muscle data. The he analysis of both.
  1458:   199:    9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
  1459:   200:   45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.
  1462:   203:   105: Now there are, there are basically hairs connected to neurons, basically hair cells that are detecting the vibrations of your of the sounds, but it's like again, it's like a sensor array that is doing that. That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
  1465:   206:   13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.
  1468:   209:    6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
  1469:   210:    8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
  1470:   211:   62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.
  1473:   214:   57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
  1474:   215:   61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?
  1477:   218:   33: # Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)
  1480:   221:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  1481:   222:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  1482:   223:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.
  1485:   226:   109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.
  1488:   229:   310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
  1489:   230:   361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?
  1492:   233:   225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
  1495:   236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.
  1498:   239:   301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
  1499:   240:   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
  1500:   241:   494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.
  1503:   244:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  1504:   245: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  1505:   246:   1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  1506:   247:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.
  1509:   250:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  1510:   251:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?
  1513:   254:   368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.
  1516:   257:   122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.
  1519:   260:   123: ⟪ 486 characters skipped ⟫ough, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.

  1629:    83: Let's say, let's take the topic of track target, which is usually assertion with MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to traditional courses of track photography. Is that you, you do, basically it MRI scan for multiple angles, at least three different angles and then you, then you combine the different. You like you have an X capture and why X capture and as you capture and you combine the different angles, the computer figures out the geometry of all the it's receiving the image capture from from different angles and is creating an image and three dimensions.
  1631:    85: That's a great. If you want to control your computer, while sitting inside this giant MRI machine in the hospital, this is get around. So let them know. Secret is well, is that track? Tography is not is is sport, is tensor, calculus it doesn't, it's not limited to the domain of joining magnetic machine or MRI.
  1635:    89: Even with, you know, the limits of what you can do with MRI though are not really recently. MRI, you know, you're getting like the boxel size could contain, you know, like a thousand miles for example, or many more than that. And that's not the definition. We're going to need for neuroase, but if you're taking 3,000 images from multiple angles, right, and you're doing photography with them, massive, not images.
  1637:    91: And then you're thinking about something to reality, which is called. People have made a try. There's, it's called photography where you can. There's an app on the vibe called realities, that I know where you can walk inside a virtual room that looks, it's photorealistic and you'll lean around. When I was a CS 2017.
  1641:   101: So, the next step, then of course, is to take the basic the core of that video. Grammation process, which is photography and appliance medical imaging like a massive that language camera was amazing. It's massive and it's super expensive and it creates like, you know, that's light field is amazing but it's it's also a firehouse data so high.
  1645:   111: So instead of like focusing on the outside world, we turn this around and focus it on the inside of the world with. So we take three thousand, you know, images of the brain with track topography from different, and we're combining it with not photography video grammatry, right? And we're just a massive, you know, computational problem, but we we do that and now we can track like, you know, basically like, you know, everything going through, a specific region brain or in at some point, we're gonna be able to do the entire brain within about.
  1649:   115: So for research purposes that it has halfway there then we need to transmit the stuff back into the brain. That's that's the other half of it. What I'm saying with what I'm saying is that but there's all these so we have so when I'm working on is is new science for combining new forms of track photography, with foot, with technologies, like video grammatry to, to do the to figure out.

I was spun around in order to do photography and that for me, that made O2y famous in my mind. And I'm glad that I'm glad that was the, the thing that got you interested.

   91:   896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

   10:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   17:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
   18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
   19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   20:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
   21:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
   22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
   26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.

   53:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   54:    71: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

   65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

The mind is a tomodeck.
  133:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

  176:   115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  179:   41: It's it's it's a kind of tomography, right? Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.
  182:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).
  183:   180: And they might notice when suddenly their truth is contradicted or something is not quite right? You would notice this through sort of what I think of as like a Neuro Array Tomography, Conceptual Tomography.
  184:   182: # December 26th 2021 was when I coined the terms Neural Array-Projection Tomography, Neuro Array Tomography, and Conceptual Tomography.
  185:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.
  188:   107: It's able to learn from multiple variations on the representations of of different perspectives of incoming, sensory data and and and also your movement. And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.
  191:   46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
  192:   93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
  193:   95: ⟪ 553 characters skipped ⟫d so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.
  196:   29: That's right. I'm arguing that our brains are making a computer program but it's a pure, a computer program that is about the and narrow tomography and neurofunctional, tomography of sensory, input data and muscles and muscle data. The he analysis of both.
  199:    9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
  200:   45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.
  203:   105: Now there are, there are basically hairs connected to neurons, basically hair cells that are detecting the vibrations of your of the sounds, but it's like again, it's like a sensor array that is doing that. That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
  206:   13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.
  209:    6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
  210:    8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
  211:   62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.
  214:   57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
  215:   61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?
  218:   33: # Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)
  221:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  222:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  223:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.
  226:   109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.
  229:   310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
  230:   361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?
  233:   225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
  236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.
  239:   301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
  240:   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
  241:   494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.
  244:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  245: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  246:   1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  247:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.
  250:   1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  251:   1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?
  254:   368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.
  257:   122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.
  260:   123: ⟪ 486 characters skipped ⟫ough, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.

   19: To learn more about FNIRS in this podcast I spoke to Jonathan Toomim who was in a valid sense grandfathered into it. His grandfather, the late Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh were awarded the US patent on HEG Hemo-Encephalography in 1999.
   46: 3. Highly Spatial EEG from Switzerland and Germany: “Now, scientists at the University of Geneva Switzerland in collaboration with Cologne University (Germany) have investigated whether a non-invasive method — electroencephalography (EEG) — could be employed in tandem with mathematical algorithms to measure this brain activity externally.
   86: “Hemo-EncephalographyIn 1999, the late Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh were awarded the US patent on HEG. HEG uses light to observe blood in the brain through the skull.In 2009, Hershel Toomim and I had the opportunity to discuss the wave. Had he seen it using HEG? His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.
   87: “Hemo-EncephalographyBut could it be a matter of filtering, i.e. very low frequency signals were being excluded? (The way we were able to see the wave plethysmographically was by eliminating the low frequency filtering of the state-of-the-art heart rate variability instrument.)Hershel and I agreed to consider it..He passed away in 2011 at age 95.

   83: Let's say, let's take the topic of track target, which is usually assertion with MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to traditional courses of track photography. Is that you, you do, basically it MRI scan for multiple angles, at least three different angles and then you, then you combine the different. You like you have an X capture and why X capture and as you capture and you combine the different angles, the computer figures out the geometry of all the it's receiving the image capture from from different angles and is creating an image and three dimensions.
   85: That's a great. If you want to control your computer, while sitting inside this giant MRI machine in the hospital, this is get around. So let them know. Secret is well, is that track? Tography is not is is sport, is tensor, calculus it doesn't, it's not limited to the domain of joining magnetic machine or MRI.
   89: Even with, you know, the limits of what you can do with MRI though are not really recently. MRI, you know, you're getting like the boxel size could contain, you know, like a thousand miles for example, or many more than that. And that's not the definition. We're going to need for neuroase, but if you're taking 3,000 images from multiple angles, right, and you're doing photography with them, massive, not images.
   91: And then you're thinking about something to reality, which is called. People have made a try. There's, it's called photography where you can. There's an app on the vibe called realities, that I know where you can walk inside a virtual room that looks, it's photorealistic and you'll lean around. When I was a CS 2017.
  101: So, the next step, then of course, is to take the basic the core of that video. Grammation process, which is photography and appliance medical imaging like a massive that language camera was amazing. It's massive and it's super expensive and it creates like, you know, that's light field is amazing but it's it's also a firehouse data so high.
  111: So instead of like focusing on the outside world, we turn this around and focus it on the inside of the world with. So we take three thousand, you know, images of the brain with track topography from different, and we're combining it with not photography video grammatry, right? And we're just a massive, you know, computational problem, but we we do that and now we can track like, you know, basically like, you know, everything going through, a specific region brain or in at some point, we're gonna be able to do the entire brain within about.
  115: So for research purposes that it has halfway there then we need to transmit the stuff back into the brain. That's that's the other half of it. What I'm saying with what I'm saying is that but there's all these so we have so when I'm working on is is new science for combining new forms of track photography, with foot, with technologies, like video grammatry to, to do the to figure out.

  8: Three of them, but I can too. Oh, toys, jewels are boxy CEO and founder of Moto Toy. And I'm Michael Moore. This DSLR that was waited by another DSLR. I was spun around in order to do photography and that for me, that made O2y famous in my mind. And I'm glad that I'm glad that was the, the thing that got you interested.
