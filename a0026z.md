The funny thing that I am realizing today is that the size of the ions in a neuron actually matters a lot more than I thought previously (In the context of neurophysics). I haven't heard anyone talk about this.

I see neuroscience as being primarily concerned with discovering neuroanatomy, such as mapping the connectome, the major brain regions.

I see computational (neuro)biology as being concerned with mapping functional connectivity, ie how information might be distributed and how it might flow in the brain.

I see neurophysics as being concerned with the theoretical physics of neuron function and brain function at both classical and quantum scales.

I see neurology as being concerned with the treatments & causes of neural dysfunction. I study neurology but I don't practice medicine because I don't have a medical background. It's just an area of interest.

That's why I think of myself as a neurophysicist which I think requires someone to study biology, theoretical physics, and computation as pre-requisites.

I'm thinking that biology (neuroscience), math (computation), and theoretical physics are all inline & sort of pre-requisite study areas for neurophysics. Does that sound right? Then if you combine cognitive neuroscience in there you get cognitive neurophysics.

space is a literal hologram

space cannot increase or decrease unless it has zero area to begin with

that the is the principle of the badpoints 

spacetime holographic tomography

holography and badpoints

it means that all of spacetime is compressable to zero area

because it has no area to begin, and so it can't ever have any area

what is happening though is that the speed of the particles can change relative to the speed of other particles,

where the dimensions of space and time are carved by orbits, or spacetime oscillations of varying scales because oscillations can combine with other oscillations

the entire field of space is an oscillating phase field, but it the total directional flow of particles does not add up to more than zero energy, so positive and negative energy split apart and we have particles, they combine and we have bose einstein-condensation or fermionic condensation, they orbit and we have atoms

It has to maintain a total of zero energy because it has to real area or space, in essence its like an information pattern that self develops and learns itself, but basically its space that is cycling between oscillations developing in information complexity and oscillations withering into entropic dissonance

gamma ray bursts are high frequency patterns in the hologram

and the rest of oscillating space absorbes their oscillation until that oscillation is in tonic sync, 

because holographic space is a harmonic oscillator its also in oscillation with itself and that means that fast and large oscillators matter, they each cause dissonance to the surrounding area that attracts more energy that perpetuates their structure, 

the separation of energys allows space to have a total energy area and size of zero

but expand in size

by oscillating in different information configuration patterns it creates a simulation of space area and time area by relative inference, 

the hologram is created by the harmonic oscillation that in total has zero area, the hologram learns patterns for eternity, through a process of natural selection

thermodynamics of space oscillators 

space can neither be dead nor alive in reality but what appears to be alive is the information configuration of oscillations into intelligent patterns.

In other words intelligent patterns emergy in space as a principle of extropy which is that information always increases, and entropy always increases, but the two forces are always in equilibrium so that space has zero energy

1. extropy always increases
2. extropy and entropy are inverted forces like positive and negative charge.
3. the total of the charges has to be zero
4. the total direction of particles space has to be zero other wise something with no real area would have relative area to something else that also doesn't have area
5. the directional flow of particles determines whether spacetime is expanding along the time axis or along a spatial axis or both
6. Heat is an expansion in the time axis
7. extremes of heat/cold is expansion in the space axis, but the neutral temperature of space is at oscillatory equilibrium and represents the tonic frequency of space
10. stars represent the left over resonating/dissipating remnants of gammaray bursts which are the highest frequence
11. The maximum frequency of space is equal to the maximum oscillation, where they become each other. A single oscillation, that splits into two, then four, then eight, and it doubles for infinitity and then back to maximum, like a finite state oscillator pendulem of spacetime

entropy, extropy, particles, heat, cold, expansion of space, atoms, mass, density, velocity, time, neurons, neural networks, perception, consciousness, I've gone and created 11 new ideas related to thermodynamics, spacetime, brainwaves, and gamma wave bursts and all these ideas are related

critically both the cosmos and the brain are finite state machine

"Bill Ross The problem is that I understand exactly what you're saying in different contexts."

neuropath intersection, for distributing a path driven phase field gradient that holographically represents different patterns/ and different perspectives on the same pattern, with different modalities in multiple areas

intersecting neural pathways of phasic signals, are oscillating through the tonic gradients along 'edge communities' are creating holographic representations in the phasefield between synapses

At this "rate" we might end up agreeing on everything "syncing"



It encrypts them with homomorphic encryption and then multiplies them with another homeomorphic encryption that encrypts a long string of random numbers & characters, with another long string of random & characters and numbers, that string is also the private key,

however the first homomorphic encryption takes the transaction identity card, finds an encrypted pattern, multiplies it times another encrypted pattern, and the encrypted result is sent to a server that checks it against a private key that could be encrypted inside the smart contract

Plant growth direction -> path integral theory -> 4th dimensional oscillation -> LTP / LTD 

Is there an upper bound on infinity?

Sort of like how there is order inside chaos because the chaos exists within a boundary

because what if infinity is like chaos or like a strange attractor or like a dissipating resonator, or like a decohering oscillation

I essentially built an oscillating doorway
in my memories, to tell a tiny part of my brain that kept shrinking a dissipating pattern that reduced in size in three frames blinking macro scale, off, meso scale, off, micro scale

it was this memory of a phase field configuration of how I wanted to write the first page of my book

As I have been writing this book I have all along been looking inside my mind watching my internal processes, studying and beginning to notice how I am reprogramming my mind, and using the insights to consciously rewrite the programs in my mind. I understand how to synthesize new 

understanding that my mind is a phase field, with a holographic soliton multi frequence range (solitons in fields of electric(ion movement), magnetic(ion), mechanical (acoustic), chemical(waves), and thermo (heat)

pattern being emitted in the synaptic cleft as a phase change in phase space that knocks another oscillator contributing to a phase pattern that the spike of a neuron 

 the change in the ion gradient is also linked to changes in the electric field, in terms of the fact that neurons fire multiple times before the ionic gradient is reset
