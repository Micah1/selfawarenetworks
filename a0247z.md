Self - from the talk tonight on simulation theory 

the perspective that there is no self,
no separate passenger that is observing and not involved in making decisions.

self is also a prediction

self is a simulation of the future
a prediction of future consequences both good and bad
we predict or simulate the self in the future so we can think about how to move towards good consequences and away from bad consequences
