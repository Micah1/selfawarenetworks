A temporally concurrent dramatization.

Micah Blumberg
a memory of spaces, points, distances, directions
your brain will lie to you, and there is nothing you can do about it,
there is no life that isn't fake and isn't real,
because the answers your brain generates are just guesses, just approximations

Osscilation & Entification
Through close proximal frequency synchrony phase variant entification of informations makes up the matter of consciousness, but also interesting the same phrase explains spacetime

where a rock is a temporal & spatial oscillating synchrony of phases when its in reality, it is also that when your brain renders a rocks

Infact the information of a rock is effectively imaged in a physical way inside the brain as a scale/location invariant compressed version of that same rock

You are the aggregate feeling of all of your cells, each of which is a sensor-transmitter, but via the neurophysics of biological oscillations, encoding the patterns of electric & magnetic brainwave & mechanical soliton waves become bound together in oscillation, or entification, meaning that the entity that is you emerges as unified sensor transmitter system that is a fractal of the individual sensor transmitters that are your cells.

In otherwords, the physics of oscillation causes your individual cells to entify, meaning sensor/transmitter entities (or cells) that oscillate together entify together to become a unified sensor, and a unified transmitter, or a unified sensor transmitter system.

What this system is conscious of are the dominant and or the persistant, or novel, or relatively excited or inhibited phase wave differentials or traveling waves that flow through it, changing it's temporal spatial (3D + time) time.
