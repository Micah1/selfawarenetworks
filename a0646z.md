A temporally concurrent dramatization.

Micah Blumberg
a memory of spaces, points, distances, directions
your brain will lie to you, and there is nothing you can do about it,
there is no life that isn't fake and isn't real,
because the answers your brain generates are just guesses, just approximations

Osscilation & Entification
Through close proximal frequency synchrony phase variant entification of informations makes up the matter of consciousness, but also interesting the same phrase explains spacetime

where a rock is a temporal & spatial oscillating synchrony of phases when its in reality, it is also that when your brain renders a rocks

Infact the information of a rock is effectively imaged in a physical way inside the brain as a scale/location invariant compressed version of that same rock
