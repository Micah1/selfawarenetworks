neuronal global resonation theory, like a pebble in a pond causing cascading ripples that magnify inscale as they ripple across the mind

if we put a sensor array on the brain we can learn all the brains patterns because all the patterns ripple everywhere,

but at the point they are arriving at our sensors they might be magnified a great deal, so it would be interesting to study the route of pattern dissipation or signal traffic 

Quantum Gravity from Fick's First Law
The Diffusion atoms & particles in space
slowing closer to the center of mass in part because of a higher concentration of particle collisions

If you are moving fast through space

the GPS satellites tick faster

space closer to the center of mass is more excited,  so the -

time moves more slowly if you are moving faster
but since gravity of a planet like earth has an equilent effect to an elevator accelerating into space

time intervals are relatively decreased (time moves more slowly relative to an object in space) at the same time that the frequency of particle movement increases compared to an object in space

as you accelerate your particle frequency with high density mass, you experience time more slowly, creating a time/particle diffusion matrix or field.

The increased frequency of movement is like a runaway cascade increasing the chances that each particle moves toward that increased particle frequency because its like a new area opening up with each iteration.

at the particle scale (meaning the diffusion rate (or movement rate) of particles is decreasing towards the center of a dense mass) the density also means that the frequency of particle collisions is increased (frequency inverted to time or duration) the dilation of time in space means decreased time intervals and the

on the part of you that is closer to the center of a larger mass like earth.

so I'm more likely to move towards earth because the time diffusion gradient means that particles closer to the center of mass like earth are accelerating relative to particles further away (such as satellites)

Objects with mass exert gravitational force on each other, but specifically gravity is like a wave of particle concentrations, where particles are moving faster in time, but their experience because they are accelerating is one where spacetime 

I am thinking that the mass of space is equivalent but perhaps not equal to space bending, such that protons, neurons, and electrons oscillate as a group, but its as if their topological shape is warped space wave reproducing in intervals of time a three particle wave oscillations that we think of as an atom. At the same time its movement in space over time is the movement of a smaller wave through a larger wave, so what I am suggesting is that space as a whole is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds 

what if every particle in space is like a vortex in an ocean

and the vortex is what creates density also known as mass

but all of space is essential a wave pattern of waves at multiple scales and they have fallen into an organized pattern because of natural selection
