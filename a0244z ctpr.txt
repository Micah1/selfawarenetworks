The ground of being
tonic firing

the neural basis of the ground of being

phasic firing

the neural basis of information carving the ground of being

it's so hard to understand because it's not a 3D dimensional sculture, it's a 4 dimensional sculpture

the magnetic field is a vector?

David Cohen the first magnetic waves of the brain (occipatal waves of the brain)

Lachaux et al 1999 phase locking statistics

a fuctional taxonomy of brain rhythms, International Federation of Societies for EEG and Clinical Neurophysiology in 1974 defined the EEG spectrum or frequency border classification

Markku Penttonen reasoned if we found a quantifiable relationship among power bands gamma vs theta ex

and fast oscillatoin 140 to 200 hertz, phasic firing, new energy bands slow 1, slow 2, 3, 4

all frequencies from 0.02 hz to 600 hze are continuously present

a non

the idea that a fast clock and time division would work best but faster oscillators were added to slower oscillators, because of how evolution happened

computation always means that information is moved from one place to another

fast oscillations favor local decisions?
the size of the activated neuronal pool is inversely related to the frequency of synchronization

the brain operates at multiple time scales

the suprachiasmatic nucleaus is 20,000 neurons these are a circadian oscillator
it takes 4-6 hours to make a protein
ultradian rhythms?

the measured brain state is a construction not a reflection that includes the users recent history

so the room, plus the tables, chairs, colors, plus what just happened like a handshake

highlighted note

what is transient stable phase synchrony

power density of EEG or lfp is inversely proportional to frequency in mammalian cortex

brain states are labile, self organized state

"oscillations allow for temporal predictions"

the brain is a clock
but the clock is like a lock with many tumblers, large slow, to small fast tumblers or clocks

Libet 2004, conscious experience requires the engagement of the appropriate brain networks for hundreds of milliseconds

consciousness is a temporally active pattern
this was solved by Libet in 2004

how does the brain manage inspite of oscillations

does the brain operate on multiple time scales vary between layers, or between cortical regions, or between old brain and new brain
