# The human mind is an Entified Tensor Field.

In the human brain the 'cognitive' Tensors are phase variations between synapses. Entification or unification of these vectors/tensors (in otherwords a neural network object segmentation + neural network classification = a 3D semantic segmentation process in the human brain) happens via Oscillation of Phase Variations created by signals between cells in the brain creates the 3D canvas of reality.

If you think about running PDE equations in a computer, the dimensionality of the equations seems to be too sparse to match the fidelity & richness of human experience

Especially if that math consisted of one dimensional polynomials that have no thickness & no inherent spatial dimension at the level of what the computer processor is doing. The idea that a computer could be conscious is counter intuitive for THIS reason.

In a 3D game engine, or in WebGL or WebGPU we can see a model of how two dimensional calculations can become 3D renderings, but on the CPU/GPU side it's all reduced to disconnected calculations, math.

If human experience could be described as rendered vectors in a matrix how then can a computer experience reality? It's like asking how can a rendering from independent signals experience itself? 

What I am saying is that the math of the brain, like the math in a computer becomes a conscious object-segmented self-aware rendering via Neural Oscillatory Tomography. The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.

But at a higher level, the oscillations of many neuronal outputs, like the outputs of many parallel instructions in a GPU, can be united, or entified, into graphical objects, that can have bodies of causation & a reality that exists in a simulated 3D environment.

# Tomodeck (Imagine a Holodeck, but replace Holography with Tomography, Neural Oscillatory Tomography)

What if the Star Trek Holodeck was fused with a Tomodeck so that you are essentially inside a brain

That could be a brain computer interface that links AI to the human brain with VR and or AR

I need to say more about the interactions between incoming sensor inputs and the tonic brainwave pattern to fill in some conceptual gaps.
I mean the sensory input neuro path ways are creating phase shifts that have via the duration of calcium channels opening & varying numbers of vesicle bodies a magnitude signal difference in terms of the quantity of neurotransmitters per interval of firing (frequency).

My conjecture is that the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern, embodied for example by Theta Waves (or other power band frequences) represents the short term memory structure that binds with incoming sensory inputs via the principles of oscillatory physics (that could be simulated in a game engine or with webxr)

# "The structure of prior knowledge enhances memory in experts by reducing interference"

# The Inner Eye, the observer, is a distributed & virtual system.
The sensor detection of patterns is at the location of the dendrite, and inner display of patterns is the exit terminal transmission (perceived by the next dendrite). Patterns in the mind are learned by cell assemblies, cortical columns, stored in synaptic connections long term, exist in the tonic oscillation pattern short term, they are evoked by phase changes (correlated with phasic & high phasic action potentials & inhibited firing).

"How the brain functions is still a black box: scientists aren't even sure how many kinds of nerve cells exist in the brain. To know how the brain works, they need to know not only what types of nerve cells exist, but also how they work together."
The quoted statement above from the article above is junk, there are variations in nerve cell types, but you are not going to find a neuron that has an eyeball inside it: meaning that the known parameters of variation across known neuron types is sufficient to predict the range of possible neural functions.

# Regarding the brain maps from "The Highest of the Mountains" 
These brain maps are really great work, reflective of a lot of research in Neuroscience, but they are also incorrect in many ways. I recommend looking at the work anyways. It's well done.
https://thehighestofthemountains.com/brainmaps.html

If you read the book "A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins" you realize that motor control isn't happening in one region of the brain it's happening in every cortical column across the entire brain. That's just one way that this map is actually incorrect.

The same thing with executive function, choices, these are not regional activities as many neuroscientists still believe. Choices are happening everywhere at the cell level (Criterial Causation via Peter Tse), and complex choices are happening at the neural circuit scale in the inhibitory interneurons (the concept of criteria causation again but applied to Buzsaki 2006 (Book) figure 11.5 the graphic on inhibitory interneurons neurons)

My brain is essentially comparing memorized numerical operations to predict the right answer, and the right answer is stimulating the oscillatory activity in my brain to produce the right result in terms of motor actions taken and words typed.

# "Neural tuning and representational geometry"
This article is hidden behind a paywall, but the abstract & the 255 references on the same page are worth exploring for example this quote "decodable information is captured by the geometry of the representational patterns in the multivariate response space." this quote fits the concept that I'm proposing that a phase patterns can be thought of as tensor polynomials in a Taylor Series.
