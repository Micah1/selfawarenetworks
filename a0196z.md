# Generative Models of Brain Dynamics
"In this paper, we demonstrate why focusing on the multi-scale dynamics of the brain is essential for biologically plausible and explainable results. For this goal, we review a large spectrum of computational models for reconstructing neural dynamics developed by diverse scientific fields, such as biological neuroscience (biological models), physics, and applied mathematics (phenomenological models), as well as statistics and computer science (data-driven models). On this path, it is crucial to consider the uniqueness of neural dynamics and the shortcomings of data collection. Neural dynamics are different from other forms of physical time series. In general, neural ensembles diverge from many canonical examples of dynamical systems in the following ways:"

# Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields
When I close my eyes and say the word tomato I see a tomato, I see red, I remember properties of the tomato like the taste. Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.
