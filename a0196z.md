# "Metastable Oscillatory Modes emerge from synchronization in the Brain Spacetime Connectome"
"brain rhythms are a signature of metastable synchronization, occurring at reduced collective frequencies due to delays between brain areas."

# Generative Models of Brain Dynamics
"In this paper, we demonstrate why focusing on the multi-scale dynamics of the brain is essential for biologically plausible and explainable results. For this goal, we review a large spectrum of computational models for reconstructing neural dynamics developed by diverse scientific fields, such as biological neuroscience (biological models), physics, and applied mathematics (phenomenological models), as well as statistics and computer science (data-driven models). On this path, it is crucial to consider the uniqueness of neural dynamics and the shortcomings of data collection. Neural dynamics are different from other forms of physical time series. In general, neural ensembles diverge from many canonical examples of dynamical systems in the following ways:"
