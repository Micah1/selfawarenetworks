(emotion, dipole)
can the brain sense it's own magnetic dipoles? I argue yes, we are doing that, but we may not have the context to understand what this is.
the brain separates pattern types, sensory input  patterns have their own paths, subcortical muscle pattern inputs have their own neural paths, the effects of dipole activity that crosses the whole brain is going to be a distinct pattern class because it is a pattern that the whole brain can detect that has different properties from other types of brain signals and is counter intuitive pattern knowledge, I think people might call these high level emotional intuitive abstractions or intuitions or feelings or emotions with some variation in the types (electric dipoles and separately magnetic dipole activity both ought to be recognizable by the brain on a global scale.
