(synap, dendrite, neuron) 

"neurons do not move around and the dendrites connecting them do not length or shorten." I was not suggesting that neurons and dendrites move.

(2022 update: Neurons actually can & do move around, lol)

Only that synapses connect, disconnect, shorten, and lengthen.
The old idea was strong and weak synapses. The new idea is connected or not connected synapses via the shortening and lengthening process.
