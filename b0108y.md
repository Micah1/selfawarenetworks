How spacetime

00:00

I mean so it's already like documented and predicted how particles in the in the electromagnetic field that we're going to move in response to to mass. There's there are pictures of, you know, art basically particles in an electric field sort of depicted as arrows, which indicates they're their motion up and down motion.

00:27

And so the behavior of the electric field, how it already, how, it's already been sort of like, this is how it's already expected to move, but I think that the essential distinction is that, you know, people are, maybe not thinking about the, the, the effects of the particles and over time on on objects, right?

00:59

Like you see? Okay, well here's here's the depiction of how the electromagnetic wave field but but it's like, okay. Well, if we just imagine that instead of pushing electrons that instead of pushing electromagnetism, which I guess as either electrons or waves, or both we're pushing air, I mean, it's like, it's kind of saying like, well how could air from a fan cause gravity because air is going to be pushing things away from it?

01:39

You know, but there's also if there's pressure with air it was just distinct. Whereas like I think that I know that yours there's pressure which is like I guess it's like an oscillating way pushing

02:01

But yeah, it's kind of it's kind of like well you know, well what so we. So we see gravity. It's like a reverse almost like a reverse fan where the air is slowing in the other direction, right? So, and and you can almost see like, well, how is that fan pushing air?

02:22

It's pushing air because it's there's a there's a blade that cycling. So there's an act. There's an oscillation inside the fan that is pulling in air on one side and pushing around the other side and essentially, like if like well, I mean, maybe a cyclone so it's like if I think of a cyclone or something that is pulling in warm air, it feeds in a warmer and the air helps make helps it to maintain.

02:53

It's it's, it's structure. It's equilibrium. It's cyclonic power. So it is so like a fan that it's displacing a cyclone as is spacing the the air. And as you can see like within the within the case of like you know jet engines, you know like the more powerful the fan more air is displayed in so you can have a jets can be like the fire gravity but so it's not so I feel like it's not.

03:27

It's actually not really controversial to argue that a psych that an atomic scale. Cipher is, is in a sense pushing I'd be like there's like if you could push air towards the center, it's like so imagine. So imagine like an elevator has been compared to grab. Like if like gravity has been compared to an elevator, that is pushing that is accelerating upwards, right?

03:59

And so like, yeah, the first rotation to earth earth rotates, and it exerts the centerfocal force. And, and the basically earth rotation is like a giant icon. And that centrifugal force, that is sort of like causing every like it's sort of, it's sort of like, whereas it is, I guess in one sense it's like, yeah, it's like it's it's almost as if the objects are on the cross of the earth are sort of orbiting the earth like we're fault.

04:42

Like we're falling sort of like because you know like an object that's an orbit just sort of like false assessment angle that it just keeps falling around. Or the never really like eventually like you know, atmospheric drag will, you know, pull it down but it can spin around the earth for a long time.

05:07

You can stay in orbit and, you know, I think of like, well maybe, like,

05:21

That. So maybe, like an antonic oscillator with its centrifugal force is in the electromagnetic field spectrum is basically creating this this this eye at this sort of

05:48

You know, I think like a fan like destruction of shields, right? Where this where this, where the strength of of its attraction is going to be relative to, to the, to the distance closest to the oscillator oscillating, atom?

06:11

It's a space is going to be a track. Like, at the atomic level space is going to be very attractive to itself. And of course, we see that with molecules and chemicals, it's very attractive to and then the further than that and then like but it's going to be, it's going to be like there's attractive to itself, but it's

06:35

It's also and pushing out into, it's it might, it's like, I just imagine that this the same process is creating vertical lanes, through through the combined oscillations of, you know, of groups of atoms. You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.

07:16

All right. And I'm saying or it's instead of saying it's a piece of space maybe we say it was a pizza. It's um as I think of particles is as pieces of space, but it's it's particles that have been pulled together and they're pulled together. And so, it's like you're taking a whole bunch of of oscillators and you're pulling in together and they make a larger oscillator and that as a as it has like a beam that that's like a bean.

07:51

That goes in every direction. Out away front away from the spherical oscillator. It goes in every direction but but to the electromagnetic field like a larger scales, that's just like a lane, it's like a line that sort of phase into the field over time and that but it's going to create a lane where you have a lot of different.

08:23

You have you have a lot of different electromagnetic flow that's now going to be flowing, sort of vertically towards towards that atom, front it for from every direction that the item is in the place field their vertical lines pointing to that atom and outwards into place of the sort of like if you draw a picture of the sun and you draw like like a kindergarteners drawing of of the sun in the sky with lines that go that that symbolize the sun's rays that are going out and all different directions around the sun.

08:56

Those those rays are sort of like an elegance to the through the rays of lecture of electromagnetism of the electrodes. Those rays are like the lanes of electromagnetism that I'm imagining come out of an atom or merge from an atom in face space. And those lanes would sort of cause time dilation around the atom because their interfering with the ability of particles to move horizontally because there's a lot because more of the traffic is moved vertically.

09:41

There's less traffic, moving, horizontally. And so, the amount of time that it takes for a travel for particle to travel horizontally around an atom, is lengthened proportional to, it's distance from the center of that atom. And but then but then so that just means that the like if there's if there was if you haven't placed field with no atoms that and then perhaps the chances that a particle moves in any possible.

10:18

Correction, let's say particle move in six directions up and down left and right forward and back and a three dimensional placement. So just hypothetically, it's a hypothetical. Let's say there's an even chance that article could move in any of six directions until you introduce in an atom into the picture, an atom is like that.

10:39

This space field was folding you know, it's folding a lot and eventually it folded on itself and became a cyclone and cycling was an atom. Now that there's an atom, there's there's basically like, you know, now you have particles that are oscillating out a particles oscillating around other particles or orbiting other particles and that, and that create that is going to warp space time.

11:06

And in the sense that it's, it's in the sense that instead of there being like and eat like a perfect distribution of lines going, you know, in every direction for every spot in the particle field. Now you have a clump where you have some lines are are aligned. So you have line squeeze together that are all pulling in the same direction and and that's what I'm arguing.

11:42

That that by itself is what's warping space and creating the curvatures of space time is is atoms and it's also causing the, the relative expansion of space and so it's in. So I'm arguing that like it's space doesn't have a fundamental size or or it doesn't have a fundamental

12:15

Time or size, but it's, but it's, it's just, it's just like as a place field. It's that it would, it's it's like is it the place fill itself is a metronome, and it goes from a state of having no oscillations to being potentially fully awesome. Fully oscillating.

12:44

And it does so because it has as no instructions about what to be, and it's just, like, sort of iterating through potentiality is iterating through the potential possibilities of existence and non-existence. And that which is a bizarre thing to say, like it's not, it's not, it's it's like it's it's some point in the universe, the the their uncertainty of existence caused existence.

13:23

Things certainly of whether existence could exist cause existence. And so, existence is just exploring the possibility of existence. Basically.

13:42

But but the, you know, I like the natural, so natural selection ideas, FaceTime and that sort of like that brings us back to like the idea of yeah. That, you know, I like the idea. Like, if we are basically branches of and oscillating tree in a sense, a tree of oscillations then then in a sense, the cosmos is in a sense.

14:22

If it's like if I am literally the cosmos like a branch of the cosmos and if I'm conscious then then the cosmos is right these. But it's but it's not like it's it's not like it's branches or conscious and it's not like all of space is in the key.

14:44

The key thing is is what would defines is like we have a second in, in the, in the human brain, it certain assist in certain systems of certain with certain can information. Configuration human life. Consciousness can emerge, and the information configuration is a physical configuration of oscillations. It's very specific.

15:08

Configuration of oscillations very specific classes of configurations of oscillations. So it's, it's not to argue so I wouldn't argue that. The whole cosmos is conscious. But instead, it's like just just a the tips, just the tips of the of the cosmos would be and and that it's like, you know what contest is is it's a delineation.

15:40

Or it's a perspective, it's perspective. That's that's it's car, is carved by distinctions extinction. So it is out of necessity. Consciousness is not the whole of the oscillator, but instead it is a it is the perspective of no, of a note of of the of a notal branch, if it's purposely the limited perspective.

16:13

It's if you if the whole, let's say that that all perspectives were combined that it was say that that is like if you combine all perspectives together, you'd have no perspective, right? And let's say that no perspective is valid at the same time as a respective. So it's just like.

16:34

So what I'm saying is like it's like we have a perspective in which time exists at our scale of reality and at the atomic scale time, scale your time should be moving faster and at the planks scaled, you know, time is sort of like, you know, I I'm just like I just imagine it somehow, you know, it's it's so fast that it's sort of like ever present at the playing scale and like all of time is is compressed into no time and there's like no time.

17:17

But all of time at the same time at the point scale and and around the plane scale there is time emerges as as the as the inspect time and space emerge. As as the distance, the particles has the intervals that particles now have to travel beyond the plank scale and in order to all right, so so just so it's like there's a pet, there's a bit of a paradox I think is it's kind of like saying that space in time emerge at scale.

18:07

But there but they exist as and delays cause but caused by not, if the quantum scale caused by nuts are basically caused by atoms and or caused by oscillation performance scale. So oscillations at the quantum scale cause space time to emerge at scales larger than the plank scale, but see it as the sea space time as the orbit that the planks here.

18:50

And, you know or that or you could see it as basically the the oscillation of the cosmos not being able to decide whether it exist or doesn't exist. Therefore, it sort of happens, this half the time and it's half existence was has a process that undergoes national selection which eventually results in the oscillations that are human beings and life firms and planets.

19:18

And and who knows what's coming next in the future? And yeah.
