a0607z Book Notes
Many of the ideas in my notes are similar in many respects to existing ideas by other researchers, with small variations, so as much as I can I am going to try to find sources for my ideas so I can highlight the work of others. 

**Sentient Self Aware Network Machines**
Next generation computer systems, what I call sentient machines, or self aware networks, are not just for Defense, they can also help grow crops, farm the land & build homes, feed & house people worldwide & advance medicine.

**A new memory hypothesis,**
My argument is that LTP & LTD are accomplished via oscillatory synchrony/desynchrony, in other words links grow between cells because of coincident firing, 

Just like signals of sunlight trigger plant growth towards sunlight, signals from neighboring cells literally excite the region of space between cells causing growth (of synapses) in the direction of the coincident firing. When the firing is opposite, such as in a splay state, the growth between the cells becomes inhibited and links (links meaning synaptic growth between neurons) expires or atrophies.

In other words LTP is mutual growth via coincident excitation, and LTD is mutual atrophy (of synapses) from splay states or opposite interval firing. The firing also triggers electromagnetic excitation in the cell body which stimulates the mitochondria to produce energy via ATP synthesis, so the cell the fires learns faster than the cell that didn’t fire.

**a new neuron model,**
Every receptor has thresholds, just like a neuron, the cells grow new receptors which represent a change in the information configuration that represents a new learned pattern, that when triggered causes a reaction from the cell, evoking a learned response. Receptors form basic nodes in a simple neural network or receptor network, the branches of a dendrite, and in the the case of pyramidal cell the branches of the soma also represent nodes for recognizing learned patterns, then the body of the neuron itself, via the action potential represents another node in a multi-cell neural network, when the soma fires signals are distributed to the network along exit terminal branches, so that the downstream array of neurons see’s hears smells or senses a pattern that at the cellular level exists as a change in phase or frequency and at the multi-cellular network level as a change in spatial distribution or amplitudinal effect in a local area.

a new understanding of cells &
the cosmos, and
a new gravity equation in an upcoming book

**Your mind is essentially software**, and when you understand how to read & write to the brain, then it makes sense that both sentient machine technology & mind uploading tech emerge at the same time as new technologies.

I actually had no clue that I was going to figure out mind uploading in addition to all the other cool stuff in my book, just as I had no clue that I was going to come up with a new equation for gravity. It might not sound plausible but

In hindsight it's actually implausible for one tech to emerge without the other in this case because the two technologies are related to the same discovery. 

Studying Cellular Communication is at the center of everything in biology, everything that exists in space is folded space, including information, essentially mass is information & information is mass, and while we can say that information is invariant to any particular mass, it is essentially always encoded in mass, including when information is in the brain, traveling through the air, or in the memory system of a computer. Regardless of its substrate, information is a pattern defined by variances in mass.

Information is literally folds in space. This idea is based on two things. 1 is the idea that when the energy from a dense object is released the density vanishes and in its place is the opposite of density, which would be expansion (expansion relative to density, in other words density is a contraction of space relative to less dense space) 2. When information is deleted, energy is released, making information analogous to mass, and mass is information in the context of information theory where information is distinguished by the variations in a sequence from rare signals to common signals and the entire spectrum of signals in between and around rare & common signals. 

Spacetime is a volumetric information configuration, and at the same time it is a harmonic oscillating field that is operating like a neural network that learns configurations the way oscillating nodes entrain one another. In other words information just grows in complexity in an open system. The oscillating nodes hit other oscillating nodes, like cells signaling other cells, or stars sending particles to other planetary bodies.

The dna sequences that we have encode information in protein folding, which dna folded, which is space folded, which is time folded, and time exists sort of as the encoder of information, the universe has learned information sequences encoded in the folds of time, because variances in spacetime are equivalent to information. So with space we have from a temporal & spatial observation an existence that is a fold in time relative to some other fold in time, so we have light, which moves very fast, or perhaps just fast relative to our time, so when spacetime has form, that form exists as a fold of time, so it must slow relative to absolute time, because at full speed, at light speed space & time collapse, and there is no mass, no density, it’s just light full speed. If we could get there we wouldn’t be there, if we could go at light speed we would become light.

So it’s almost like there is this argument with the universe, that says in between nothing, at negative speed, something must exist, on average, before we get to full speed.

So let's say the universe sums up to 0, but in between there are folds of time that exist as -1 or +1, or fractions there on the X axis, and those would be positive and negatively charged particles, but let's put time on the Y axis, because the speed of the particle, positive or negative, relative to C (light speed) is going to encode it’s mass effect.

So particles can travel faster or slower relative to one another, and their frame of time is therefore variable, but since that speed affects whether a particle behaves like energy or mass we have to plot a Y-axis to understand the element of time/velocity on relative particle behaviors

For brain each interval of time results in a total transformation of the state of information configuration, in terms of what exact pattern is on or off at that moment in terms of cell activity, these variations encode information that travels in between cells transforming their information configurations, their functions, their output, and your aggregate output.

If we think of information theory as applied to computational biology, then one can make an argument that biological configurations, in terms of learned genetic sequences that become functions, which including the literal development of protein & rna sequence development leading to protein folding, and protein shapes, unlock more cell functions, such as the shape of cells, the shape of receptors, the shapes of organs, and the special functions of organs, such as seeing for eyes, hearing for ears, information consideration by neural arrays in the brain, advanced specialized sensory configurations, that all of these physical biological configurations containing advanced multi-stage cellular functions can be rethought of as a physical system that has learned information configuration patterns, stored as sequences of learned patterns, obviously at the root encoded in dna configurations, but with additional information patterns emerging only once the organisms unfolding is completed

It's not just that,

Cells physically encode information patterns that can detect and respond to other information patterns encoding complex multi-cellular functions

So these are the basic system level ideas right ^ 

and there is an

I have this interesting idea that my goals can be accomplished by verbally encoding changes in my internal logic. So it's as if my internal logic is actually javascript, and my brain is executing one page of this code at a time in a linear sequence, like a central processor of multiple independent nodes each doing independent calculations, it’s like every character on the page of code is developing its own program in response to every other program.

A possible solution to Parkinson’s Disease is sound
What I mean is brainwave entrainment
You see it appears that the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease with DBS is due to the cancellation of the beta frequencies that are disrupting the function of the human brain in certain areas essentially from over excited / damaged receptors accumulating shit they should not be accumulating causing over excitability and general dysfunction

But brainwave entrainment with audio can also help normalize brainwave activity, so the whole brain is oscillating at the same frequency pattern.

It does not fix the disrupted areas in a permanent way in the short term
