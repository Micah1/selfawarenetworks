Title: Towards artificial telepathy?

In note b0105y, I talk about how my reinterpretation of attention schema coincides with the scaling up of a pattern from the synaptic connections of the neuron that fired to its inhibited neighbors and how those inhibition neighbors affect on the global oscillation, electric, magnetic, blood flow. In this note I'm comparing the lines of the tv screen of visual conscious rendering or representation to cortical columns, its a metaphor at this stage, later on (not in this note) I refine this to specify that individual synapses are akin to pixels in the mind. I speculate about how microtubules could participate as an extra memory mechanism, with sound (to the quantum scale and back) adjacent possible theory comes up

But so essentially, the oscillation is scaling up a small pattern to become a large pattern and the scaling at process means that that small pattern. Now, dominates a larger space, larger area, and now it now, it affects more reasons of the brain. That is that is a that it becomes what the brain is focused on it becomes a focused pattern.

00:28

It's a it's the physical manifestation of focusing is when a small pattern becomes the larger pattern in the attention scheme of the brain, when a pattern scales it from being from the neuron level to the neural circuit level to the column to the cortical column oscillator, to to the default network like like each time.

00:58

It goes each time like a pattern scales up so that it was represented at the neuron level, but now at the synaptic level, you know, but, but now it's represented at the global level of brain. And you can see that these fractals, these fractal patterns, do exist to the brain, whereas where you will you have at the global level can predict what you might find at the or which you take like, you can have correlations between correlated activity patterns at different scales of the brain that have been measured with EEG given measures with MRI.

01:41

They've been.

01:46

There's there's also they've been measured with energy or magnetic and simple ground and so that's already three different frequency spectrum. Okay? Spectrums three different frequencies back to them. I guess. So what so what I mean. So the electric and the magnetic to frequency spectrum is literally and then the the MRI is tracking blood flow, which is that in the blood flow is a is a another part of the, you know, when they're on fire blood, what gets called blood flows, where attention goes blood flaps are there the phrases blood

02:53

When neurons use up energy they the blood has to bring the new ATP, the main energy so blood blood flows where it's needed. It's yeah, it's it's part of the supply inter supply chain. So yeah, every time in your on fires, it needs more blood against we plan itself is just Spanish, just spent a lot of energy and just ejected this energy.

03:23

It's extra energy. So non-resector itself, the synapse brings it more ATP to the then your place out there, which is inside this summer. And I, you know, I guess it, it would make sense if

03:56

That the nucleus was somehow involved in the decision-making process. For whether a the synapse was going to be prone or grown and that's in. And so, I mean, the hypothesis is that, I am favoring. Is that the the microtubules might be? One of us, one of the storage mechanisms for a long-term memory, just one of them.

04:27

And that would be for the mechanical wave scale mechanism. So like the idea is yeah at the well I mean so the idea of the whole ear canal is that way can change scale, right? Wave can go from a large scale to a small scale. It's the same like the same sort of my mechanism for like a cone you know or like a portable electronic speaker.

04:53

You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.

05:23

So you have the amplified sound because wire magnification. And the reverse of amplification is, Well, I don't know what the exact time is, but that's basically it's, it sounds contracting. It's, it's for version and

05:49

Yeah, so I yeah. But anyways, the shrieking Sam. So, I mean, I guess if a mechanical wave really is a fractal of basically a largest scale factor over an electric wave, right? Mechanical wave, but they're just withers away. Fractal in, in the mechanical space is also electromagnetic space, so it's like a large scale.

06:17

Electromagnetic wave. That was that idea, but but there are some other differences by like, the mechanical soluton has. There's a pressure element, okay? Because the pressure is from, you know, the other atom screens. Please together and the pressure. Is it combines sort of like also a story effect or in?

06:51

So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.

07:21

Yeah, so that's interesting. It's like, you could be depth by something. I changing its by changing the oscillation patterns of the molecule. So, if you disrupt, the oscillations of a set of molecules, you would identify them, you know, that would be like But at the same time, if you, if you cause the, if you enter, if you could, if you could somehow and train the odds of the, the molecule of the material, to, to oscillate together, then you would densify.

08:06

And so, another way to describe space is you have space warps around.

08:22

Synchronized oscillations. And it expands with these synchronized oscillations. So and that's DC synchronized, oscillations are faster and move faster or no. No, the synchronized oscillation is removed.

09:01

Now, it's not the same movement faster, it's that

09:16

Possible.

09:29

But yeah. So the idea is the, when the brain is focusing on something, it is selecting some small scale patterns, it's okay. Small scale set of memories that are represented by synaptic configuration, and it's magnifying them through oscillations and multiple scales. The also, the focus for oscillation is sort of like that is, which internal representation is the center of your focus.

10:05

The one that's most magnified, but they even see that egg. The portable, the cortical scale because there's multiple peers at the cortical, calm scale, there's going to be like a lot of other big obvious things that you can pay attention to portable scale. So it's not like your brains is not like the high level.

10:26

Scale of you is always trying to and basically throw it through a box of Legos. The the there's a part of you that is sorted through the box of Legos and that's at the portable column scale. But at the highest scale, what you're actually focused on is your is just what's being presented to from the, from the, the quotable columns which includes that's like a mezzo scale that includes microscopes anxiety.

10:58

So it's like imagine each horrible column is a like it's it's a four-k screen, right? And the four case screen is like each line. In that four case screen is is a row is, is a row of the, is the layer each line in the. So you each column of your quote column is 4k screen and each line is a in that car in that screen is a a layer and the front is a functional layer.

11:44

I prefer like, you know, there's further from dementia, they have a paper and it says, basically there's six layers of the near cortex. But functioning speaking, it's more like 13 players are being a cortex. So I I I subscribe to that idea that there's like 13 functional layers potentially in, you know, and so maybe that is.

12:10

Maybe your screen is 13 volt kilometers through this, through the six layers of the new projects and that workflow. It's the coral. Column is a silo of cordovativity that has multiple, this has multiple layers. So there's the layers, go like horizontally and the cortical columns are vertically or vertical in the bottom of the portable columns are connected to.

12:42

They are connected to.

12:50

About technology too. There's a continent.

12:57

So it's interesting is that some people might think that it could be incidental for microtubules to be involved with memory as long as the memory can be represented by synapses but the but so why would they need to be stored? And I might contribute as well and and and maybe the depth of the possible combinations of synapses for creating unique patterns.

13:34

For structure for storing, you need patterns all the time that has has, has limits like me? I don't know, but it's maybe. There's like a total number of combinations and it's original not necessarily as clear anymore. It's like, if the thing that's representing memories contently being reprogrammed, like, what?

14:02

Well, what if it's past states or in a sense address for being overwritten and not being remembered as being distinct from your estates, right? So that idea is that the microtubule itself could be a value in terms of storing long-term memories lot more longer then let's what's more long-term than my patterns, then then the synapse line store.

14:36

So it's like each. It's like maybe each configuration of the synapse gets backed up into the microtubule and it's interesting because if you do think of basically the synaptic pattern as as the edges on a circular graph and you think of the divorce of a cylinder which is like a microtubules, a cylinder think of like the walls and cylinder.

15:11

If you can draw circle from one points all around the and cylinder to another point. Like in a, you know, you can stock circles and then you make a few stat troubles when they come, right? Yeah, I mean not account. Well, you can make a tongue but or you could make so cylinder.

15:30

And so it's interesting that, you know, it is a cylinder particular because you know, that means that it's a zone if a line in the cylinder that which is a circle and is it's a circle line and it's on there that the sort of like the differences, in which parts of that line are activated could be like the basically like the smart density, graph, the smartest distributed representation perhaps, right?

16:11

And so this synapses if you line them all up, it's like it's like it's like the the line in this particular video, representation or the line is the sparse of your representation that I dementia models. And so some of them are active and then and then the idea is okay.

16:36

So if the state of this changes the line contributor over time changes the structure, I get like imagine that every time that when you're on file fires it has a new pattern that's learned by the microtubule. And so you're you're, you know, I don't know exactly how many, how much data that I have to really store that way and so that would be something definitely too explore for there.

17:06

So I so I think. Yeah. So maybe the microtubule really could be used for in that sense for basically storing, a backup of the states of of the synaptic. Going into an and that would be that could potentially be informative. Computationally because you send it basically sending a sound into my contributor.

17:26

Like, I saved you some memory, but it may not just be saved as a memory. Maybe like it may be ringing that old memory to come out in a way that's modified by the new information. So let's see the new sound arrives in. The microtubule has all these old representations of old and old synaptic configurations and now it's got a new one.

17:48

Well, now maybe a reverberates backwards combining the old memory with the new memory together. And, and so, in that sense, your long-term memory would be retrieved. Every time you got a new memory and it's the new memories, which is the, it's the, it's like your new memories would be co-created.

18:15

You co-creating your old man? The revival of your old memories because it's the coming together of both that is going to define the information here that you're just going to reach your conscious mind. It's the combination of your incoming sensory data with previously, learned sensory data that becomes your your brain is facing and so your new memories are co-creating reality with your older eyes and then and then but that but you're all as your old memories of mass there, I'm just imagining that they become sort of there.

19:00

So they're so they're an assessment, attractor for and tractor part of the feedback loop, but they are going to of an also toilet, right? It's it's those old memories are going to be driving your behaviors. But there's no but there is no sort of by the like with the idea of adjacent opportunity, why I was forgetting, what I was calling because Jason something, let's look it up.

19:45

Every time you've become aware of a new

19:57

Possible. A decent possible theory. So every time you become aware of a new of a new thing that you could do, every time you get your information, the actual complexity of what your of what, you're of the complexity of what you pass memories can be, is altered by new information, which can result in a structural change so that, you know, so that and that and start to change is like, you know, our especially important when you can't figure out how to solve a problem in your life and it's such a big problem that you can't figure out how to solve it.

20:39

Like, at that point, that's when you are. That's when your brain your brain reaches a threshold and trying to deal with life and it really it, your brain goes through a developmental stage, and I really liked how I liked it. The way development stages were described in the book, thresholds of the mind, that was really cool.

21:11

That was by Bill Harris. And so, but that is like where you're basically, there's a tipping point where your brain is the complexity of the patterns of your brain, and how you change your, and how you think about the world that that can have sudden leaves for like, where you just are more capable.

21:42

And an example that is like someone who runs, you know, a major concert venue major concert events. Like Madison Square. Madison Square Garden, right? Where they, where, you know, this, like the money is just like huge the money. The small just huge. Net and famous people involved in. This is big money.

22:03

It's big money operations. And the complexity is enormous, right? These are not easy things to do. If they I mean, yeah. And so, you know, putting on a big show and it was lots of money is a highly coordinate activity. You wouldn't just say, okay, well let's just find someone around high school kid.

22:23

Ask them if they can do it right because the capabilities go random high school kid, you would expect are gonna be a lot less. They're gonna be a lot less capable of of doing your big projects to that scale and and so the arguments here is kind of straightforward, is that there is a, there are stages of development that we go through, throughout our lives, where our ability to handle the problems of life.

22:53

Well, it will increase, depending on whether the amount of difficulty, that we are facing, is presenting a sufficient challenge, or to challenge within certain rain. And then, and then it's up to our brains, to sort of like rise to that challenge by adding some complexity to their to operations.

23:19

So that's when you become that's when you level up, that's when you become you, when you become aware of other choices, you could be making and he began to become aware of other ways. You could be applying yourself and focusing your mind and you begin to, to change to change your decisions, and to make make decisions that you like more and you make increasingly better decisions.

23:46

As you ideally I do it. Unless I must, you know, in some cases people are hurt and ways that that leads to them making worst decisions because they're focused because they become sort of like trapped in a negative focus so they can heat on making more so much decisions, right?

24:12

But but that is a negative spiral, but, but in general, like if you're able to keep that, that is like, you know, we want everyone to heal because people who are a negative spiral, so they're gonna be hurting, they're hurting, and they're hurting other people. So they're hurting themselves, and they're hurting my people.

24:31

And every time they hurt other people, they are hurting themselves, even more. Right. So it's it's it's um, that's that's because they're playing because they're playing back, you know, they're getting more, they're focusing more on the stuff. They don't like and when they're focusing on the stuff, they don't like they're just making it happen, just making it manifest in their lives.

24:56

This is a focus now. They're also that's for their oscillatory activity is attracting them, you know. And in the same way they're gravity works my end in terms of like it's if you're creating a lot of signals, lot of synchronized signals and then that's going to work space time.

25:27

So so once you have the brain making patterns and remembering patterns, then you can you have feature representations and as we established the patterns, get scaled up into oscillations. So we have magnifying patterns to the brain, can focus patterns, it can they can and those patterns can now stimulate other patterns because they're affecting more areas of the brain simultaneously.

25:53

And so patterns are getting connected to other patterns. And so now we have thanks to oscillations. We have synchronization activity, that it happening in the brain that can't we can be triggered. Thanks to also things to interns or but also just like the result of like it can be initialized via internaries but isn't, but internet is not necessarily needed anymore because the the brain can maintain long distance synchronizations.

26:31

Because the, the pack the global pattern, the global because oscillation patterns of different at different. Scales are not, they're even if they're not in sync. They in terms of like at the same time the there might be like the sort of like global orchestra to to the temporal sink.

27:01

In fact, that's exactly what I'm saying is that there is a that there's a temporal orchestra to the, to the unto, the, to the desynchronized oscillations. And so, what looks like, it's not in a sink and a moment. In one moment of time is in four dimensions, possibly still in sync.

27:27

So, it's like, as if as if the pattern was being etched through time, as if the synchronization was traveling forward and it forwarded time at the in the end and not just in terms of space and so, but then it could. But then so. But then so like let's say that you have a small oscillate small, wave of activity, and one area of the brain, you know, like you know like a neuro circuit it is of firing that consists of firing action, potentials at the rate of it.

28:11

So that so action tensors are firing one after another in a sequence and it's forming a circuit that is, is it's not, it's not that they ended individually. This is not the same neurons are fine, but that in general that bunch of neurons is firing in a and in an oscillation sequence with other bunches of neurons.

28:39

And even if there's not necessary, it doesn't have to be activity that is connecting them because could because it could be that the activity that connects them was was one established by and by a signal sent over an intern. But afterwards, it could be that they're just both receiving the same global signal and so at some point, you know, even if you severed the internet on a connected, those two regions together, it could be that they could that their patterns could be both triggered by the same sort of larger scale.

29:19

Also theory event like the large scale magnetic dipole, event, might trigger, simultaneous smaller oscillations. That don't have a direct direct connection to each other and so the brain would have would have multiple ways to continue to maintain oscillations and separate areas of of the brain independent of whether or not.

29:44

They're continued to be a an actual connection between those two areas and so that that might look like the brain is sort of communicating wirelessly, but it's like as if two people remember the same oscillation right and maybe that oscillation is learned so, well that like, if you don't hear from someone that, that that's your, that you're unconsciously expecting your hair from at a certain interval, then you might into it to something wrong with them.

30:21

And so, and so, then you find out the news that you're intuition was right? Because because you just learned this interval for what, for how long may a grant to go before they reach out again? I mean, it's just like this unconscious thing in the sort of like it may look like telepathy happened by it could be that.

30:41

You've just you've learned through at some point when you had contact with this person, you both learned the same oscillatory pattern in your clocks, you had some part of your brain, had a, you know, saved a clock memory that that Save the memory. In this temporal clock, that associated with this other person's pattern.

31:02

And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.

31:44

It's that causes a small group of people to become inhibited by the news, right? But then larger group of people is now going to become aware of your injury, right? Because all right or they're going to become aware of your your good news and that and that's because the pattern got magnified essentially by the by the burst.

32:18

So that burst activity then becomes encoded by the people who are now. They're basically expecting news from you, right? There's, there's a clocks have been aligned and so you're starting the group oscillation. Right, and yes. So it remains to be seen in terms of, you know. So it's possible that if if let's say that the oscillation changes the global oscillation that that was a basically that triggered like you're connect your they triggered oscillator and also Tory memory as you have it, the other person that was retrieved with a certain cadence and so that memory like occurs to a certain time, but if the global oscillation has changed relative to that one oscillation, then the other oscillation might notice it.

33:29

So, what I'm suggesting is, let's say we have two global oscillations and they're disconnected. Now like they're they became connected, so they're oscillating together but they're physically separated. And let's say that one of those two oscillations because because here's thing is, it's the the largest scale oscillation is reacting to the light to the smaller oscillation.

33:52

The small obvious is reactive to larger oscillation. They're in lockstep. So something happens to one of your remote oscillations that's going to change the global oscillation in such a way that the oscillation that was connected to that other oscillation is now going to notice it and it's going to same like television, right?

34:14

Because you're because what you really sensing is is you're oscillation with that person. That's what you're really sensing and you're sensing that. It's changed because the expectation of what the global signal feels like relative to that person has changed. And so, you know, you'll know that something is wrong with the person at your most in sync.

34:42

With, if something happened to them, you would know it because you're it because you're oscillations are sync with the global oscillation. So the global oscillation helps keep track of that person. Informs you? And so that's the sort of like this is sort of like the interesting thing is there it there could be a sort of like

35:11

Telepathic connection that isn't telepathy at all but it's just a matter of. Yeah, it is kind of like celebrity a little bit. But, but it has to be established through through oscillatory scene. Synchronization like, you have to contain the same oscillations as someone else and in order to have that sort of like telepathic link with somebody, but then that but then that sort of like that's sort of like enables people to connect in a deeper way if they have the same oscillations, right, inside them.

36:06

And that could expect that could that explains like a lot of things, right? Thank.

36:15

Yeah, that that like you know like so it could be that like oscillators attract like oscillators

36:30

In terms of like how people like who people are attracted to

36:43

Yeah.
