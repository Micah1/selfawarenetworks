(criteria, causation)
it's about criteria, criterial causation in my neurons, that and noise, it's about noise, and how the physics seems to conjure spontaneous harmonies http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqFc4wriBvE&feature=fvwrel&nomobile=1

When you move the metronome and put on a table that moves multiple metronome that ticks all the metronome sound at the same time as it is known in sync event...

Crowdsourcing is generally the best way to go now. I'm very interested in nanomanufacturing. I wish you luck. 
That is fascinating
Anyway, in case you're interested , I'm launching a vlog series on YouTube in a few weeks called the Technarchist. I can send you a link when it's up if you're interested, our you could just keep an eye on my wall.

I insist that you send me a reminder, that is very interesting. I can't predict that faceobok will even show me a friends status when it's important. faceobok doesn't know how to do AI lol. That sounds like it
I want to watch!

Very well. 
The videos will largely be like shots of mental espresso.

Micah Blumberg
okay so, I will look forward to the experience of mental expresso, (do you mean as opposed to calm and sane expressio? ha a joke)
oh, I am filling my youtube channel also
creating short films that will eventually be pieced into a documentary about the people who have helped me do research with Neo Mind Cycle

Basically just short videos to express different ideas and propagate memes while not taking up too much of your time. It will largely consider matters of technological growth and how that growth is mutating and uprooting the entire socio-economic system.
Btw, can you send me a link or explain Neo Mind Cycle?

K, thanks.

k here are 3 videos explaining Neo Mind Cycle

Thanks. Unfortunately, I need to go offline now. Talk to you later.

I knew that. Later

Hey you still there?
Okay goodnight.

Hey, sorry. I was eating. How are you?
Are you still there?

Hello. I've had an interesting thought but it's pure speculation. It's based on the hypothesis that black holes spawn baby universes. So, what if you could actually program this baby universe to contain your consciousness. In other words, you, an individual, have obtained the maximum computational capacity of an entire universe. Of course, if you want to work in this universe as such a being, you would have to solve the problem that no electromagnetic information can escape the event horizon. However, if we can eventually solve this problem, people may actually be able to have a black hole brain with a body still operating in this universe and sending and receiving information to this universe. What do you think?

Well it's really cool and far out. I read somewhere that galaxies have some kind of inverse size ratio relative to a black hole at their center. One possibility is that the gravitational effects of black holes are causing electron waves, similar to how the gravitational effects of the moon cause ocean waves. Yet quantum effects are estimated by some to move too slowly for thinking, and even a baby universe would be too slow to keep up with a human brain. However if we can build brains and connect brains to brains then we could perhaps increase the thinking power of a human being.

Kurzweip predicts, and his predictions seem pretty reasonable mostly based on his method, that we'll have the ability to do that someone in the 2030s. Mind uploading and all that jazz, I mean. Maybe we will, or maybe it will be later, but I seriously doubt that we'll be bound to our biology in any way by the time we arrive at the point of manipulating things to that degree. Either way, I recognize the serious issues that would make it challenging. Perhaps signals in the form of quantum entangled particles could be made to operate to the point of sending information in the form of neural commands across to the outside of an event horizon? Yeah, time dilation would make doing anything meaningful in this universe a very problematic thing for a black hole. Maybe time is far more malleable than we think though. The idea was pure speculation though either way.

Well I think there isn't anything to upload, meaning self is a sort of illusion in a sense that it's a vortex like cycling of brainwave activity from component parts harmonized and conditioned via a social contract to act as a self.
The hardware determines the perimeters of the brain that make up the through process, naturally if you add more hardware a greater personality may emerge that displaces the old personality.
Instead of having your soul uploaded it might become integrated or it might become suppressed by the new soul.

Micah Blumberg
Since people seem to consist of the active components of their brain, there will at some point be brain modification companies that can replaces parts of you, turn parts on or off, expand certain parts, but for this to be acceptable one might have to realize that self is an illusion. Some people may not be given a choice because their brain is so dysfunctional I mean like extremely violent criminals.

Mmm. Very good points actually.
