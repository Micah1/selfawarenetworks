Dipoles Divorces Dolores
00:00
I love that moment and Westworld when Delorus comes face to face with herself and in a way that moment is meant to sort of like disconnect, the loris, from Bernard, and instead connect doors, to her own inner voice. It's meant to jump start self-awareness, so that theloris is talking to Dolores and divorces, observing Dolores, talking to herself.
00:40
And in a sense we could, we could do that with. We could do that virtually where we create basically a robot, it has two versions of Dolores inside it and it's like the robot talks to the robot about what it's doing and in a sense. Now, you have a left and right hemisphere which you have like, you have two ends of a dipole, that can oscillate between a positive, which is on one side and a negative one, which is, which is a charge switch to the other side, right?
01:29
And the brain has capable of, but I had the brain has both electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles. So it's manipulating electricity and magnetism and so there's some. Yeah.
