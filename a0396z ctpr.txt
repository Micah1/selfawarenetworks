Synergy, Reduction, and Saliency Are Paramount to General AI
Synergy, Reduction, and Saliency Are Paramount to General AI

In my AI systems I never preprogram preexisting AI algorithms. I rather let the machine learn the causal geometries of Reality:

Reduction is a proactive and unconscious exploration of the whole space of mental resources, mind patterns, and hypotheses. It is not a straightforward and preprogrammed recipe to solve a problem. It is not a reductionist system. It is rather an inverse problem in which the mind holistically tries to find the recipe. If the mind cannot match mental patterns of thinking to solve problems or to explain phenomena, the mind tries to learn or to create the key elements and the missing pieces in the mind puzzles. Thus, both the time of the reduction algorithm and the resulting recipes are totally unpredictable, imperfect, and non-guaranteed. Successful recipes are always stored. Therefore "fully functional minds" always seek to maximize utility functions which are recursively products of reductions. The evolution of sane minds always seeks sophistication, welfare, and improvement. That's the basis of the scientific method.
