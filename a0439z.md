(engram, holograph)

Holographic Engrams, that are encoded phase patterns that become the components of a holographic distortion change when new inputs enter the brain and change the tonic oscillating phase pattern

the brains scattered representations are holographic in the sense that representations for every learned memory are learned collectively by the whole brain, similar to how a group of fireflies can act as a single sensor

detecting the temporal coding variances in each others flashing oscillator discharges which bump their fellow oscillators towards threshold or inhibition
