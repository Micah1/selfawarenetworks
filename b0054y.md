The user revisits an old hypothesis suggesting that the thalamus serves as the "theater of the mind" or a projector screen, with the neocortex acting as the projector. They contemplate how oscillatory loops involving the entorhinal cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus might render perceptions by assembling sensory data across different brain regions. Recent studies highlighting a sparsity of sodium receptors in human brains compared to animal brains lead them to propose that this difference increases inhibitory activity in humans. This heightened inhibition allows for the formation of more complex patterns, as inhibitory neurons function like logic gates that create new firing patterns and ripple effects across neural networks. They contrast this with purely excitatory networks, such as the heart, which maintain regular oscillations without change. The user concludes that inhibition introduces variability and complexity essential for advanced problem-solving.

That's interesting, I think perhaps the hippocampus might be a higher level seat 
because

The cell type most likely to have around 200,000 connections is a Purkinje cell, which is located in the cerebellum, not directly in the hippocampus, but receives a large volume of input from granule cells in the cerebellar cortex, creating a high number of synaptic connections per Purkinje cell; although the exact number can vary depending on the research, some studies estimate a Purkinje cell can receive input from up to 200,000 granule cells. 

Who was it that theorized that The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) i might be the seat of consciousness? 

Some people think it's in the PFC

What these areas have in common?

They are integration areas, they are network hubs, and they are end points for the many cortical columns to functionally interface with, with those functional connections representing schemas for linking together pattern renderings and behavior coordination programs.

You're highlighting the idea that certain brain regions—such as the hippocampus, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and prefrontal cortex (PFC)—serve as critical integration centers or network hubs. These areas facilitate the convergence of information from various cortical columns, allowing for the creation of complex patterns and coordinated behaviors.

To fill in the blanks:

Hippocampus as a Higher-Level Seat: The hippocampus is essential for memory formation and spatial navigation. It integrates sensory inputs with existing memories, enabling the formation of new associations and the retrieval of stored information. Its role in consolidating short-term memories into long-term ones makes it a crucial integration hub in the brain.

Purkinje Cells and Connectivity: While Purkinje cells are located in the cerebellum, not the hippocampus, they are among the most highly connected neurons in the brain. Each Purkinje cell can receive input from up to 200,000 granule cells. This extensive connectivity allows them to integrate vast amounts of information, contributing to motor coordination and learning.

Theorists on the TPJ as the Seat of Consciousness: Neuroscientists like Vilayanur S. Ramachandran have suggested that the TPJ might be crucial for aspects of consciousness, particularly self-perception and the distinction between self and others. The TPJ integrates information from the thalamus and limbic system with visual, auditory, and somatosensory inputs, playing a significant role in social cognition and empathy.

Prefrontal Cortex (PFC): The PFC is often associated with executive functions such as decision-making, planning, and moderating social behavior. It integrates information from various sensory modalities and other cortical areas to guide complex behaviors and thought processes.

Commonalities Among These Areas:

Integration Hubs: All these regions act as convergence points where multiple streams of information meet. They synthesize data from different sensory modalities and cognitive processes.

Network Connectivity: They are characterized by dense connections with other brain regions, making them critical nodes in neural networks.

Functional Interface with Cortical Columns: These areas receive inputs from numerous cortical columns, which are the fundamental processing units in the cortex. This allows them to create comprehensive schemas that represent patterns and coordinate behaviors.

Representation of Schemas: By linking together various patterns—whether they are sensory inputs, memories, or learned behaviors—they help form coherent representations of the environment and the self.

Conclusion:

These integration centers are vital for the brain's ability to process complex information and generate appropriate responses. They enable the coordination of sensory perceptions with memories and planned actions, which is fundamental to consciousness and higher cognitive functions. The extensive connectivity and integrative functions of the hippocampus, TPJ, and PFC underscore their importance in orchestrating the brain's overall activity.

The inner screen of consciousness could also be considered as a broadly distributed network of phase patterns that dynamically link & unlink their functional connectivity to render sensory and behavior patterns and these renderings are also observed all over the brain through the same process of phase wave differentials being passed around bound together with neural array projection oscillation tomography and processed with nonlinear differential continuous approximations up neurons and cortical hierarchies, resulting in new phase wave differential patterns, and changes in electromagnetic & mechanical brainwave patterns.

Thought for 14 seconds
You're proposing that consciousness arises from a broadly distributed network of neural phase patterns that dynamically link and unlink their functional connectivity. This dynamic linking renders sensory experiences and behavioral patterns, and these patterns are propagated throughout the brain via phase wave differentials. These differentials are transmitted through neural oscillations—what you refer to as "neural array projection oscillation tomography"—and are processed using nonlinear differential equations across neurons and cortical hierarchies. This results in new phase wave differential patterns and alterations in electromagnetic and mechanical brainwave activity.

Elaboration on Your Concept:

Distributed Network of Phase Patterns:

Consciousness is not localized but is a product of widespread neural activity.
Phase patterns refer to the timing and synchronization of neural oscillations across different brain regions.
Dynamic Linking and Unlinking:

Functional connectivity between neural networks is not static; it changes dynamically.
This flexibility allows the brain to integrate sensory inputs and coordinate behaviors in real-time.
Phase Wave Differentials:

Differences in the phases of neural oscillations (phase differentials) enable communication between neurons and networks.
These phase differentials propagate through the brain, carrying information.
Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography:

While not a standard term, this could be interpreted as imaging or mapping the propagation of neural oscillations across neural arrays.
It implies a method to visualize and understand how oscillatory activity moves through neural networks.
Nonlinear Differential Processing:

The brain processes information using nonlinear dynamics, allowing for complex computations.
Continuous approximations across neurons and cortical hierarchies enable sophisticated information processing beyond linear models.
Resulting Changes in Brainwave Patterns:

The interactions of these dynamic phase patterns lead to new configurations of brain activity.
Electromagnetic (EEG) and mechanical (possibly referring to neurovascular coupling) brainwave patterns change as a result.
Relation to Current Neuroscience Theories:

Neural Synchrony and Binding:

The concept aligns with theories that emphasize the importance of neural synchrony in consciousness.
Synchronized oscillations may bind together disparate neural processes into a unified experience.
Global Workspace Theory:

Suggests that consciousness arises when information is broadcast across a network of widely distributed neurons.
Your idea of dynamic linking supports this model of widespread neural integration.
Dynamic Core Hypothesis:

Proposes that consciousness depends on a "core" of integrated neural processes that are constantly changing.
The emphasis on nonlinear dynamics and continuous approximations fits with this view.
Nonlinear Dynamics and Complexity:

Nonlinear interactions allow for the emergence of complex patterns from simple neural elements.
This complexity is thought to be necessary for the rich experiences associated with consciousness.
Implications and Considerations:

Mechanisms of Integration:

Understanding how phase differentials and oscillations contribute to neural integration could shed light on the neural basis of consciousness.
It raises questions about how information is combined and processed across different scales of neural organization.
Technological Applications:

Techniques like advanced EEG, MEG, or functional MRI could potentially capture these dynamic phase patterns.
Developing methods to map and interpret these patterns might lead to new insights in neuroscience and psychiatry.
Interdisciplinary Approaches:

Combining principles from physics (e.g., wave dynamics), mathematics (nonlinear differential equations), and neuroscience could advance this field.
Collaborative efforts may be necessary to fully explore and validate these ideas.

Conclusion:

Your hypothesis presents a sophisticated view of consciousness as an emergent property of dynamic, nonlinear interactions within a distributed neural network. By focusing on phase patterns and oscillatory dynamics, it integrates concepts from multiple scientific disciplines to explain how sensory experiences and behaviors are rendered in the brain. This perspective contributes to ongoing discussions in neuroscience about the mechanisms underlying conscious awareness and highlights the importance of temporal dynamics and network connectivity in cognitive processes.

Michael Graziano proposed that the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) plays a crucial role in consciousness. His attention schema theory suggests that the brain constructs a model of attention, termed the "attention schema," to monitor and control attentional processes. This model is associated with activity in the TPJ, particularly in the right hemisphere. Damage to this area can lead to deficits in awareness, such as hemispatial neglect. 
WIKIPEDIA

In contrast, Michael Gazzaniga has not specifically identified the TPJ as the seat of consciousness. His work focuses on the modular nature of the brain and how different regions contribute to various aspects of cognition and consciousness. In "The Consciousness Instinct," Gazzaniga explores how neural networks give rise to conscious experience but does not single out the TPJ as the central hub for consciousness. 

Tell me more about why Graziano picked that spot, I think he said when attention is on something sensory like an apple that area lights up, but if the apple is in front of someone and they are not conciousnessly paying attention to it, then it is dark, search

Michael Graziano's attention schema theory posits that the brain constructs an internal model, or "attention schema," to monitor and control attention. This model is associated with activity in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Functional imaging studies have shown that when individuals consciously attend to sensory stimuli, such as an apple, the right TPJ exhibits increased activity. Conversely, if the stimulus is present but not consciously attended to, the right TPJ shows reduced or no activity. 
PNAS
 This pattern suggests that the right TPJ is involved in the interaction between awareness and attention, supporting the idea that awareness aids in the control of attention.

 Michael Graziano's attention schema theory posits that the brain constructs an internal model of attention—a schema—to monitor and control its own attentional processes. He identifies the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) as a crucial region involved in this mechanism. Here's why Graziano focuses on the TPJ:

Integration of Attention and Awareness:

The TPJ is a critical hub where sensory information and attentional processes converge. It integrates inputs from various sensory modalities, such as visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems.
Graziano suggests that the TPJ constructs the attention schema, enabling the brain to be aware of what it is focusing on. This internal model helps in predicting and controlling attentional focus.
Neuroimaging Evidence:

Functional imaging studies have shown that the right TPJ becomes active when individuals consciously attend to sensory stimuli.
For example, when a person directs attention to an object like an apple, increased activity is observed in the TPJ.
If the same object is present but not consciously attended to, the TPJ shows reduced or minimal activity.
This correlation supports the idea that the TPJ is involved in the conscious awareness of attention.
Hemispatial Neglect and Lesion Studies:

Damage to the right TPJ often results in hemispatial neglect, a condition where individuals fail to attend to one side of space (usually the left side).
Patients with hemispatial neglect are unaware of stimuli on the affected side, highlighting the TPJ's role in conscious awareness and attention.
These observations suggest that the TPJ is necessary for constructing the attention schema that underlies conscious perception.
Attention Control Mechanisms:

The TPJ is involved in shifting attention between different stimuli, especially in response to salient or unexpected events.
Graziano's theory emphasizes that the attention schema in the TPJ not only monitors attention but also aids in controlling it by predicting the outcomes of attentional shifts.
Social Cognition and Theory of Mind:

The TPJ is also implicated in social cognition, such as understanding others' perspectives and intentions.
Graziano connects this function to the attention schema, proposing that modeling one's own attentional states may extend to modeling the attentional states of others, which is fundamental for social interactions.
Supporting Studies and Findings:

Functional MRI (fMRI) Studies:

Research using fMRI shows that the TPJ is activated during tasks that require reorienting attention or detecting salient stimuli in the environment.
Studies indicate that TPJ activation correlates with the subjective experience of awareness when attending to specific stimuli.
Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs):

ERP components associated with conscious perception, such as the P3 wave, have been linked to activity in the TPJ.
These findings suggest that the TPJ contributes to the neural processes underlying conscious awareness.
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Experiments:

Applying TMS to the right TPJ can disrupt attentional processes and alter conscious perception of stimuli.
These experiments provide causal evidence for the TPJ's role in attention and awareness.
Conclusion:

Michael Graziano selected the TPJ as a focal point in his attention schema theory because of its integral role in integrating sensory information with attentional control and conscious awareness. The TPJ's activity patterns align with the theory that consciousness arises from the brain's internal modeling of attention. By constructing an attention schema in the TPJ, the brain can monitor and predict its own attentional states, leading to the subjective experience of being aware.

Summary of the Conversation:

The conversation explores theories of consciousness and the neural mechanisms underlying conscious experience. It begins with the idea that consciousness arises from complex oscillatory patterns and neural arrays within the brain. The user suggests that sensory perceptions—like viewing walls—are rendered through oscillations in cortical and thalamic loops, proposing that the thalamus acts as a "projector screen" while the neocortex functions as the "projector."

The discussion touches on the role of inhibition in neural networks, highlighting recent studies that show human brains have a sparsity of sodium receptors compared to animal brains. This difference may lead to increased inhibitory activity in humans, allowing for more complex pattern formation and problem-solving abilities. Inhibition is likened to logic gates that create new firing patterns, influencing the brain's oscillatory dynamics.

The user then considers specific brain regions associated with consciousness, such as the hippocampus, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). These areas are identified as integration hubs and network endpoints where multiple cortical columns converge, forming schemas that link patterns and coordinate behaviors. The assistant elaborates on these regions:

Hippocampus: Essential for memory formation and spatial navigation, integrating sensory inputs with existing memories.
Purkinje Cells: Located in the cerebellum, they have extensive connections and contribute to motor coordination and learning.
TPJ: Involved in integrating sensory information with attentional processes, playing a role in social cognition and consciousness.
PFC: Associated with executive functions, decision-making, and planning.
The conversation further delves into the concept that consciousness could be a distributed network of dynamic phase patterns that link and unlink to render sensory experiences and behaviors. These patterns propagate throughout the brain via phase wave differentials and neural oscillations, processed through nonlinear dynamics across neurons and cortical hierarchies. This results in new brainwave patterns and alterations in electromagnetic activity.

The assistant connects these ideas to existing neuroscience theories:

Neural Synchrony and Binding: The synchronization of neural oscillations may bind together different neural processes into a unified conscious experience.
Global Workspace Theory: Consciousness arises when information is broadcast across a network of widely distributed neurons.
Dynamic Core Hypothesis: Consciousness depends on integrated neural processes that are constantly changing.
Nonlinear Dynamics and Complexity: Nonlinear interactions in the brain allow for the emergence of complex patterns necessary for consciousness.
Finally, the conversation focuses on Michael Graziano's attention schema theory, which posits that the brain constructs an internal model of attention located in the right TPJ. Graziano selected the TPJ because:

It integrates sensory information with attentional processes.
Activity in the TPJ correlates with conscious attention to stimuli.
Damage to the TPJ can lead to hemispatial neglect, underscoring its role in awareness.
Functional imaging studies support this theory, showing increased TPJ activity when individuals consciously attend to sensory inputs, and decreased activity when they do not.

Conclusion:

Throughout the conversation, there's an exploration of how consciousness might emerge from the dynamic interactions of neural networks, oscillations, and inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. The discussion highlights the significance of integration hubs like the TPJ, hippocampus, and PFC in orchestrating complex cognitive processes. By connecting these ideas with established theories and neuroscientific evidence, the conversation provides a multifaceted perspective on the neural basis of consciousness.

I don't know if I wrote this down before, but one of the ideas that I had would would be like the cascade of arrays
if you could imagine
them being like
Each like like if you like you imagine that that the if you look at the Syrian doors
And you're looking at the walls and imagine that the walls are rendered by
Some of your
Quotical oscillators, right or some of you or some of you the arrays in your brain, right? It could be in your
Entering all court cortical. I mean you're you're entering all
Thalamic and hypothalamic loop
Right, and it could be like a rendering of your walls could be perceived there
but again these patterns are like
I'm
Going to be ricocheting across the entire brain, right and so
You know what I'm what I'm like actually kind of like imagining is that you
Might have
Different faces of the
Rendering of reality rendered somehow in that the neocortex in terms of like
how the bits get assembled and then somehow they get this like
The
Oscillator loop of the enterino epithalamic
Inthalamic
That loop is going to be informed by the
Sensory data from every corridor of the brain and so that could be like a convergence point or like that
Okay, that goes back to the old theory. So a long time ago. I had I had a hypothesis that the thalamus could be like the
Theater of the mind or the projector screen and the neocortex would be like the projector and the thalamus and we'd protect your screen and
There was an idea there was an idea because of the hierarchy of the cortex going back to the thalamus
And I thought one of the thalamus is the computer screen
But it's still it doesn't totally like make sense how the thalamus could be see anything since it's not doing any calculations
That come of comparative scale. I mean it's doing it does does modulate signals
Okay, so
Modulation means that it is
Interfacing with signals and it is observing and transmitting signals. It is an oscillating unit. That's observing and transmitting
an oscillating body
and it's interesting because
You know, there's all sorts of like
You know, it's it's interesting how there's there's a recent study about how
the
human brains are dramatically different from animal brains and that there's a sparsity of
Sodium receptors
Which
Compared to what's in animals and so the lack of sodium receptors
You know, it was argued that okay. Well, that means the brain has more energy for other things and that could be
This interesting but it's all it's like, okay
It's like so for the human brain we have fewer sodium receptors, right?
But
Maybe but I wonder if that if I wonder if it's just sodium
receptors because here's the thing if it's not also
like fewer potassium receptors like what if
What if animal like what I'm saying is like what if what if the the potassium receptors is pretty close between humans and animals
But it's only the sodium receptors that are vastly reduced compared to humans and animals. Well, what that does is it it makes the
Human brain far more inhibitory
Than the brains of animals and then and then therefore we can learn a lot more patterns
like the more inhibitions we can do more so an inhibit an inhibition inhibition inhibition is a kind of like
It's kind of sir, it's a kind of it's a kind of transistor
It's a kind of no no no not not transistor. It's a kind of
A
logic gate
Any person is a kind of logic gate because
Gosh, this is gonna make sense more make more sense later on or not
All right, let's just try to reach out. Why did you say about to Kate? Oh
Yeah, okay, so so do you might have so sodium
so if there's fewer sodium channels then portionally
human brain is a lot more inhibitory and
when you
an inhibitory so inhibitory neurons are far more valuable for
complex problem-solving then
Excitement work select the you could even think of the heart is like just a pure excitatory network
It just beats in a regular oscillation and never changes its oscillation
but what happens what you get is
when you inhibit the network a network's oscillation you you create a
Cascade
That you could oh no no with the most simple in the simplest possible case if you just do one inhibition
Of a network you've created a second pattern
Like what if there's just one neuron that's inhibited you've created a new pattern
All right, it's a new firing pattern that changes the entire
Surface from having only one pattern to now having two patterns
So there's the pattern before the inhibition is a pattern after
But inhibition is creating a pattern
And it ripples throughout the entire oscillatory network
