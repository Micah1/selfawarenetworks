Receptors Inhibition Pattern

00:00

So Mr. If I wrote this down before, but one idea is that I had would would be like the cascade of a raise if you could imagine them being like each, like like if you like imagine that that the if you okay let's hear indoors. And you're looking at the walls and imagine that the walls are rendered by some of your cortical, oscillators, right?

00:27

Or some of you or some of you the arrays in your brain, right? It could be in your entry and all court, cortical. I mean you're you're entering all that limit and hypothalamic loot, right? And it could be like a the rendering of your walls. Could be perceived there, regain.

00:49

These patterns are like going to be ricocheting across the entire brain, right? And so, you know what, I'm what I'm like. Actually, kind of like imagine is that you might have different faces of the rendering of reality rendered, somehow, and that the neocortex in terms of like how the beds get assembled.

01:27

And then somehow they get this like the oscillator loop of the entering all epitomic and Dominic that loop is going to be informed by the sensory data from every corridor of the brain. And so that could be like a conversionist point or like that. Okay? That goes back to the old theory.

02:05

So, a long time ago, I had, I had a hypothesis that the thalamus could be like the

02:13

The theater of the mind or the projector screen and the new cortex would be like the projector and the thoughts and read protector screening. And there was an idea was an idea because the idea of hierarchy of the cortex going back to the thalamus and I thought, maybe I found this is the computer screen but it's still, it doesn't totally like make sense how the thalamus could be see anything since it's not doing any calculations that come of comparative scale.

02:45

I mean, it's during it does, does modulate signals, okay? So modulation means that it is interfacing with signals and it is observing and transmitting signals. It is an oscillating unit that's observing and translating. And I was thinking about, and it's interesting because, you know, there's all sorts of like, you know, it's it's essentially how under there's a recent study about how the human brains are dramatically different from animal brains and that there's a sparcity of sodium receptors which compared to what's an animals.

03:32

And so the lack of sodium receptors, you know, it was argued that, okay, with? I mean, it's the brain has more energy for other things and that could be.

03:48

That's interesting, but it's not as it's like okay it's actually for the human we've here. So damage that it's right.

04:02

By.

04:12

Maybe, but I wonder if that if I wonder if it's just so important receptors. Because here's the thing, if it's not also like fewer potassium receptors, like what? If what if animal, like what I'm saying is like, what if the potassium receptors is pretty close between humans and animals, but it's only the sodium receptors that are vastly reduced compared to there was an animals with that does.

04:39

Is it makes the human brain far more inhibitory than the branch of animals and then and therefore we can learn a lot more patterns like the more inhibitions we can do the more so in inhibit and inhibit an image and inhibition is a kind of like it's kind of sir, it's a kind of it's a kind of transistor.

05:14

That's a kind of no no, no we're not, not transistor. It's a kind of logic gate and any position is kind of on the gate. Because gosh, this is gonna make sense, more just made more sense. Later on or not. Let's just try to reach out and any mission.

05:40

Why did you say logically?

05:50

Oh yeah. Okay so 30 minus sodium. So if there's fewer sodium channels than portionally, the human is a lot more territory and when you and inhibitory. And so, inhibitory neurons are far more valuable for complex, problem solving, and then excitatory networks. So like the good evening think of the heart is like just a pure exciting story network, it just beats an a regular oscillation and never changes its oscillation.

06:24

But what happens when you get is when you inhibit the networks oscillation, you create a cascade that you could no with the the most simple in the simplest possible case. If you just do one inhibition of a network, you've created a second pattern, right? What if there's just one known as inhibited?

06:50

You've created a new pattern find it. It's a new firing pattern. It changes the entire surface from having only one pattern to not having two patterns. So there's the pattern before it, the inhibition is a pattern after. So, an inhibition is creating a pattern.
