Notes from an old conversation that was saved on September 2012
(dendrite, synap)
distinction/context is the structure of the mind

The mechanism of the electrical charge inside (and outside) the body is the potential difference between the negative ions and the positive ions averaging out.

The chemical movements, including the sodium potassium pump, and the passage of neurotransmitters from synapse to dendrite are changing location, and as they move they effect an increasing change in ratio of negatively charged ions to positively charged ions. Increasing or decreasing the chances of an electrical charge or action potential.

What's the difference between a thought in your mind, and a coordinated sequence of spatially positioned electrical spikes? What's the difference between the electrical activity in a human brain, and a hundred year electrical storm on Jupiter? Is Jupiter thinking?

how can you prove it has no cognition? "Cognition is a faculty for the processing of information, applying knowledge, and changing preferences." the storm changes wind speed, direction, and so many other things those changes could be thought of as prefences, its whole structure is a highly coordinated, and highly responsive thing. Have you read the book Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology?

I'm not making any claims whatsoever, I have no interest in the idea that Jupiter's storm has intelligence.
That's not the point.

If you were the size of a neutron, and still able to see and think, you might think a rock was empty space (that idea is from Richard Dawkins I think)

The point is how do you recognize the differences in the pattern of brain activity, and explain how they are different from the pattern of electrical activity in a very large storm.

Making statements like 
"It ain't thinking until it lets someone know."
is missing the point

"And then thinking and even consciousness becomes uninteresting because you have removed any possibility of distinguishing it from more any other physical process. Does that help anything?"
no it doesn't because I'm not looking to grade how interesting consciousness is, it doesn't matter to me if conscious actually is the same as any other physical process or not. What I want to know is what physical process makes consciousness different from any other physical process.

""It aint thinking until it lets someone know." Wouldn't that be the true sign post of cognitive function and consciousness. The ability to interact with others that are considered conscious and aware."

That's a philosopher's quandary. If you become paralyzed, unable to communicate with other human beings, but you are still fully conscious. Would you then agree with the above statement that since you can't communicate to let someone know that you are conscious that you are not really conscious?

"What is the difference between a thought and a possible implementation of that which thoughts arise in/from? That is the same question as the beginning of yours."

what mechanically defines a thought? if you can't state what that is, then you have no measurement with which you can use to say there isn't thought in a storm on Jupiter or what have you.

I don't think the storm on Jupiter is intelligent, I never said it had to have complexity, or the ability to build spaceships, or really high intelligence.

Maybe Jupiter could have a few thoughts per week compared to a humans 500 petabytes of thought per second.

I'm not trying to compare it to human intelligence

only to work out the core differences between what defines a though physically in a mind, and to define why that could not also be appearing elsewhere in unexpected places.

simply stating the obvious differences between a storm and a human brain evades the question, which is about the mechanical state of a thought, and how that state appears. how much complexity and organization it needs to be considered a thought, if you have enough thoughts (mechanically specified predictions) in a loop, is that sufficient to create self-awareness?

I think real intelligence is different because it has billions of simultaneous parallel processing, multilateral, hierarchical structured memory-prediction-learning-programs to coordinate a more complex path than a hurricane could generate. I can't say that a coordinated pattern of electricity in a storm isn't at least very very vaguely similar to an electrical pattern firing in the brain, but for me the major factor that the aforementioned well structured brain has is well structured association trees which may indicate thoughts that are similar, or may define a metaphor, like a green thought could be in both a human, and a storm, if the thought is "green" but it has no meaning without a context like "red" or "colors" that associated context would be more likely to show up in a densely structured human brain, and very unlikely to show up in a moving storm. So I really think thought in this example is really pointing to the structure of the human mind, particularly it's ability to make contrasting distinctions using it's "billions of simultaneous parallel processing, multilateral, hierarchical structured memory-prediction-learning-programs"

A thought is a thought when it is distinct from a context that is either another parallel thought, or from another part of the hierarchy.

I really think it's irrelevant whether the thought is electric or not. The point is that it's a prediction, if you never associated that prediction with other predictions it might be an aspect of intelligence. It's like lets say your mind is billions of predictions a second. Then you separate your entire brain into individual cells, and all of the cells are still alive, and they are all making predictions, just as before. You are not in once piece, but all your cells are still alive.

So how many cells need to be combined back together to match a thought pattern, and without the context of the rest of the cells, is that thought pattern still the same thought? Or does the context define the meaning of your thoughts?

If a thought is defined by contrast, then your cells are like a game of go. You know the japanese game with black and white pieces? Imagine that a thought is like a three dimensional game of Go. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) as the pieces built up, into learned temporal/spacial patterns, the physical form of the thought itself isn't the electrical firing, it's the pattern that is connected to all the other patterns and yet very distinct from all the other patterns. It's in contrast immediately, and the context is the very structure of the mind. Without a structure, thought has no context to begin with. It might as well not be a thought, it's as if to say thought is a distinction in the the structure, changing memory and movement patterns.
