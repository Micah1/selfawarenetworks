path of signals
Do signals find their own path,

or does the brain define the path of signals?

Is it like the path that the signal takes in the brain is something that contains the information of the signal as a sonic imprint, like a photograph,
or is the brain sorting signals, by their differences algorthmically, using brain space as a sort of digital hard drive space, so representations are in bits like numbers, bits in terms of coincidence patterns representing a long sparse of spatially & sequentially distributed numbers, string during playback of a neural circuit

How smart are Alpaca's? How similar are they to people? Do they have a language?
