Interesting note, but not really for the book, it can be uploaded to the server
(synap, neuron)
I don't usually think of the brain as something that is in a hierarchical relationship with the heart and cells.
I also think of intelligence, in both the brain and heart, as a naturally compassionate, creative, interested and loving. Naturally I see brain, heart, and cells as all sharing the same kinds of compassion, memory, wisdom, empathy, consideration for others, ethical values, and high standards. Yet I see them all acting as one system, because they are working together to do this being.

The brain chooses to be aligned with the heart, because it loves the heart. It's not a master/slave relationship. It's a relationship of win/win, mutual interests, mutual prosperity.
Brain heart and cells I think of as one energy

correct.. but the cells of the body are different from the brain.. So body memory, healing, and action are required to compliment any brain system. in short, you cannot simply change your mind about something in your brain.. You have to work on the body/cellular level as well.. Heart transplant memory, for example stays with the heart inside the new body.

Micah Blumberg
wow that is interesting
so if someone gets a heart transplant, it's like getting a new soul?
will the new heart change the person's personality?

A. Rose
Yes, it has happened time and again.. I'll find an article and link for you if you want. The desires and tastes of the person change! this is why when somebody has experienced trauma as so many have, it's important that we work with them to heal on the cellular/physical level, not just the brain.. The cells have consciousness entirely separate from the brain cells

Micah Blumberg
After you mentioned it I did a search and found several articles. Still if you know of a particulary good article I am still interested in the topic, and I would love to read it!

Micah Blumberg
I have read a lot more. It seems like it's too early of an idea, with not enough scientific backing. 1. having the nerves from the heart to the brain severed is going to cause a real profound effect on a person. 2. the powerful drugs used on transplant patients are going to have a real profound effect on a person. 3. The existence of new personality traits, desires, and behaviors that previously existed in the transplant donor is possible but on very shaky ground evidence wise. One reason is that the transplanted heart is basically being used as a pump, there are no nerve connections with the brain like the patient had with their original heart, so the new heart does not have a direction connection to the brain. So if the new heart is causing the changes in person's preferences, it's probably very different from two lovers who spend a lot of time with one another beginning to adopt some of the other person's preferences over time.

It is thought that a protein has to be made for a long term memory to be stored, this protein then moves to the nucleus of the neuron and directs the pattern of synaptic connections with other neurons forming the memory. This is true of neurons whether they are in the heart or in the brain. So if some of the proteins, representing long term memories, from the transplanted heart move through the blood stream to the brain, they might embed that person's mind with memories of another person's life.

Micah Blumberg
The key realization, is that all this speculation is on shaky ground, it's not confirmed for sure. So that's why I am careful to not phrase stuff about the mind and heart in an authoritative way, it could be that way.

A. Rose
Well it's been proven that cells of the body have consciousness and their own memory, and these stories exist like the one I told you of. I haven't had a free moment to look up the exact cases, but I believe that the heart has consciousness as does every cell of the body.. I believe that the brain is simply a tool to process the consciousness from the body memory, and to process, simulate consciousness. But it is not the actual source of consciousness. It is simply the human way of processing intelligence. That's the tantric philosopher in me talking now, but soon I'll look up some of those articles and send them to you but I don't have time tonight.

If you can accept that thoughts continue to have life even after a person's so-called death, then you must admit that the brain is not the source or originator of all thoughts.

If you write your thoughts down, then they persist in written form after you die. If you tell them to another person, then they exist in that other person's mind after you die. If you never communicated what you were thinking, and your thoughts were not extracted artificially from your body post mortem (no one I know knows how to do this yet) then probably your thoughts are lost. That's just my bet. Some people who have passed beyond this world continue to have influence, but I think that is because they have made a memory impression that has become encoded in our species and in spacetime.

"the brain itself is a hologram created by consciousness which, in turn, mimics this fundamental act by creating holograms of its own... ones we refer to as "the world out there"... we essentially live in a "hologram within a hologram"... unfortunately, reductionists would only scoff at this absurd proposal ;)) ... Amit Goswami

What I think is unfortunate is the labeling "reductionists" I'm going to get labelled if I dare to think for myself and consider another perspective apart from the gospel of Amit Goswami.

The hologram within a hologram theory has skeptics, not because people are against the hologram theory, but because brains are betting machines, they bet for and or against all kinds of theories. If a theory has a short term reputation in cultural memory, and is lacking a lot of science backed evidence, then naturally your going to find many betting machines (human brains) betting against it, and probably the same number betting in favor of it. Lets not label the people who are betting differently.

If reality was a hologram, and your brain was a hologram, that would mean that all the information was stored everywhere simultaneously. Obviously this is not the case, because if it was the case, no one would ever forget anything, we would all be all knowing, there would be nothing to learn ever, because all that there is to know would already be known by every cell everywhere. 

I think that communication from the departed can be understood as a simulation done by minds that are still alive, created by the collective unconscious so to speak.
I think that consciousness is just a simulation anyways, it's an effect, a result of what life does, that includes cells, hearts and brains.

What I keep coming back to is arguing against my own strawman. You think perhaps that Micah wants to say that the brain is god, and that I want to reduce all of intelligence to something that is created by the brain alone. However that is not my view, it's not my arguement, it's not my position. I don't believe that.
What I think instead is that intelligence is memory-prediction, a betting memory, and like you I believe that cells, hearts, and brains are all intelligent. They are all doing memory-bets
all life is intelligent, and all intelligence is memory-prediction
even if you die, your memory is not just a memory, it's a memory-prediction, and your memory-prediction will continue to develop in the minds of other people who knew you, probably very accurately
if they knew you very well
to say that "Consciousness" is much bigger than a gamble I think is normal. it is more than a gamble, it's a gamble that learns, it's a learning gamble., that's memory-prediction,

Micah Blumberg
I am not my brain, I am a memory prediction. When I'm in my brain, I control it, the brain and body become my space suit. When the space suit is lost, part of me will probably be lost, but parts of me will likely stay, in a manner of speaking, as memory-predictions that exist in other minds. You might also say I am not my memory-predictions. The prediction of a self is not me, I am not these words, not these thoughts, these thoughts are just thoughts, they do not define me.

Micah Blumberg
However the second I say that "I am awareness" or I am really spacetime, or I am really all of it, or I am everything and nothing, that becomes another memory-prediction that I'm not. I'm still not that. I'm not not that either. I'm that and not that. So when I die, if part of me is lost, it won't matter, because it was never truly me. Information is lost sometimes, and the only that is lost is information.
