(Note on June 15 2022: Playing back audio note b0327y from my book notes (release on June 17th) & my understanding of how the human brain works is so precise now I can hear the pattern of neurotransmitters dripping when we speak. Like leaves falling from a tree. You will grok what I mean eventually.)

# F Scott:

It's like literally it's like some audacious like moves the way they gets the the the, you know, like the robotic leg anyways it was just a completely complete disaster but uh so so yeah, so obviously I don't think EEG is the way to go? I mean with EEG, I think the best you're gonna get is like a click and and that's I mean, I think that's you can make something now with it like if you have an eye tracker and eye trackers are amazing, you can have the eye tracker be like the cursor on your lens that's like on your glasses for instance and then just have a EEG on like just, A two prob just clicking on or off and maybe even control the contrast to see how like transparent your screen is gonna be or something but like I think the real way to go is I I think it's your cranial BCI's are going to like be like a thing that people are all like all on and I think integrating that with the ARVR world is just gonna be like it's gonna get rid of our iPhones and it's just gonna be the new thing but that's just my perspective and I and I had this perspective before I went back to school and I and so I've been studying neuroscience with the strong intent of like, What finding out how the thalamus communicates to the cortex because the best way to sort of evokes some sort of artificial perception would be the real way that perception happens so I wanted to learn like how what's the real way the thalamus sort of sends the perceptive signals to the cortex, so I could emulate that since like electronically or with biosynthetics which I've been like keeping my feet in the in the world pretty strongly in the same time because I don't think.

01:56
At the end of the day years from now it's not gonna be metal electrodes that are handling this sort of resolution that we need it's gonna be like bioelectronics anyways you have any thoughts on that stuff, 

# Micah:

um, absolutely um, I've taught tons of thoughts and and also questions for you um, so um, so so one of the thoughts is um, okay, so you so you know that um, Gosh.

02:20

I'm still just starting for a full memory recall. I should have written this down while I was thinking about it, but um. So one of the thoughts uh hand was he sorry my memory god damn today is today's one of those days my memory is just it's just not super great okay, so we're talking about let's try to trigger my memory a little bit we were talking about brain computer interfaces and EEG and the limitations you're asking about the limitations of EEG that's one of the things what is it, what is the ultimate that is gonna that you what would.

02:55

# F Scott:

The future of BCI is like, The where you have all the ideals we figured out how the thalamus is community cortex we're able to emulate it we're able to use bioelectrodes to just get full resolver tons of resolution and get your four degrees of freedom or whatever and then on the flip side for right now because if you're going to start a business you got you got to have some have it do something and so what can you make work now and on that side you can do stuff with eye trackers and EEG with like an on/off signal you can say it's a click hold down on the mouse not hold down on the mouse kind of signal and then the mouse movement you could just use an eye tracker and Attract the pupils but like you know so so those were like two areas you have to simplistic like what can we do right now and then I was also on track with the like where's it going to be at 12 years,

# Micah: 

okay, so um so here so I remembered now the interesting points that I wanted to make and I and thankfully while you were talking I wrote them down, all right, so um, okay, so there was this interesting study that just came out where

# *Nvidia they developed a radically different way to compress video for video chats and this just this is a November 19th.

04:11
2020 and the story is that they need about they need a couple seconds of real video. And then they're going to use the neural the neural network to render an artificial video that can make it that's so it's it's so good that it can predict all of your facial expressions after that first few seconds and based upon, you know, just your voice coming through and and also your head rotating it can it can you know sort of generate your head rotation and it can be used you can substitute your face for someone else's face and can keep talking and you know, just like you've seen in the sort of online the *deepfake stuff it does all.

04:56
That and in one simple algorithm and and but importantly that they basically have in effect created a video compression that works with intent in it 10 at 10x improvement so it's like that means that it's that you need 10 times less bandwidth to do a video call and and so that means that older phone technology that wasn't capable of video calls before because it had the bandwidth of the network was too slow is now capable of of a video.

05:31
Calling and and that's that's profound that's that's profound, um just by itself but then you know, so um what I know about EEG is that just just from talking to up a very particular neuroscientist who's you know for a long time who you know, (Morgan Hough) he's been a neuroimager for like 30 years and and he is you know, like he's looking at a world where the university want to find MRI research because you know MRI machines print money.

06:04
And they don't want to fund the EEG. And so you have to argue really hard to do EEG stuff in the research world and and you know or to get funding for later EEG project, but he but he's you know seeing and has pointed out to me that there's a whole bunch of stuff that's never been done before with EEG that if they're you know, for one example was um, That you know, the the.

06:33
The Child Mind Institute data is this massive collection of data that combines basically, you know, eye tracking with EEG with voice tracking with behavior tracking but it does so in a in a way that they've created a sort of standardized data collection and anyone who who can get access to that data who can potentially extend that data by making sure that they adhere to the same data collection standards and so if you had a massive global project where you asked every EEG research laboratory in the world.

07:08
To start following this exact same data collection standard for EEG then you'd have something that doesn't exist today, whereas today you can't combine all the EEG research that's ever been done into a single study because the method that the methods of doing the EEG capture vary wildly, but also in some cases they're poorly documented.

07:32

# F Scott

And absolutely, yeah, I've been in an EEG lab before. Our actually, I've been in a lot of computational neuroscience lab that relied on. Trying to get EEG data from other labs and it was just the disaster.

# Micah

So my my thinking is that um, you know, we were just talking we're just talking about um, there's these um, there's old like, you know, there's there's been these sort of um, I'm sorry I think of them as like added bad attitudes where you you'll have for decades or more the entire neuroscience community or psychiatrist.

08:09
I am neuropsychiatry community or psychology community. Well, we'll have these like ideas that they're all attached to that turn out to be you know wrong.

08:22
And and but then but then like the precursors for what was right was sort of like sort of partially there the whole time and so then they'll be like these massive shifts. Anyway, what I'm what I'm what an in terms of like what is the the ideas or dominant, you know, like with AI is I guess it could be an example of how I don't know if we need an example.

08:41
I mean, I think you know this stuff there's there's been AI winters where there was there was a ton of hype and enthusiasm for certain, you know for certain kind of AI for neural networks and then all of it died and then there was a ton of hype and enthusiasm for symbolic neuron that for symbolic AI.

08:57
And then that died and then you know, we're still in the the deep learning era but there's been like three or four AI winters. I'm not sure um depending on um, but but and then there's a I don't do my rambling okay, let me just pause for a second.

09:19

# F Scott

A person in my program is like that more the expert on AI he does like artificial vision He he's like the old like because I'm a neuro heart like biomer so he's like the only one who's like on the AI side and he was telling me all the differences between symbolic and people were all about that but now deep learning just kind of just massively kills everything else and how good it is but it's not as it's getting further and further from biological like the most biological would have been recursive neural networks, but like for language processing at least transformal neural networks and I watched the three brown blood one blue on that, so I roughly understand it like, It you know what I mean, like it it you don't need recursive neural networks and highly analogous to the biological system for it to be good at what it does.

# Micah
What was the last sentence last time you don't need.

# F Scott
You don't need the AI to be close to the actual brain for it to be good at what it does like the closest would have been like recursive neural networks, but those aren't as great as some of the other stuff around.

10:24
# Micah

Oh okay yeah. I mean, I mean all of this stuff is in in my view is pretty far from the brain. I mean, um, I guess you know, like I like I wrote this article on my website about a new study that came out about multi-vescular release being a lot more common throughout the neocortex with in terms that there's like the people thought it this is something that was like can multiply something that was constrained

# F Scott
Do you mean MVBs with multi with multiple vesicles in them.
Are you talking about MVBs multivisticular bodies?

# Micah
I yes, so yeah, we're talking and we're talking in in the in the axon terminal, right?

# F Scott
Well the. Has vesicles and they get released and you know with us with a spike with an action potential they release, you know, one or two or five or whatever at a time but there's also these things called multivesicular bodies which is kind of a new thing that people know about huh, and okay.

11:27
# Micah
I didn't know okay, maybe I didn't notice one. Go ahead and tell me more oh stop 

# F Scott
multivisticular bodies hold multiple vesicles and they'll also take some of the other internal like from the inside the cell the from the cytoplasm and they'll you know, because there's mRNA floating around there's a bunch of stuff floating around so it'll encapsulate multiple vesicles which have the neurotransmitters in them, but it also encapsulates some other stuff and then those get released and their thought to like transfer stuff from one cell to stuff to another cell so like a cell that never had any of like should never have.

12:06
RNA from like, you know like because this other cell type makes the RNA for it but not this cell but it can somehow transfer across cells that's the one that particular bodies stuff that's came out a few years ago, oh that's cool that looks like that there's um, okay.

12:25

# Micah
Yeah that's cool so I'm so no so I was talking about how so going back to AI so what I was pointing out was that the the core at the core of you know, basically whether you're doing like computational neuroscience or spike modeling or you're talking about, you know, you know deep learning which is which is um, you know, you have you have the the basic let me see if I can find my article and go to my website real quick so SVGN.

12:55
I'm actually gonna go to VRMA.io that's my other page with my featured articles on it and it's the article that says synap is called *synaptic unreliability,


if you've got to be vrma.io and look at look at the the article that's called under so under the featured article section like the third article downstairs *synaptic unreliability.

13:25
# F Scott
Hold on. I'm just gonna leave my mic on while I do this yeah guys okay there a web they are digital fashion synaptic reliability underlay with the parent yeah

# Micah
so um so this this basically like what the widespread idea was that in in machine learning for a long time.

13:45
I'm sorry in neural networks was an idea that. That a neuron would be summed up a by a spike like an on or off signal and then on and then later on they had and that was called um, this this um, this idea was fundamental, um, this isn't it so now

# F Scott 
we're talking about an AI NEURON right

# Micah
yeah we're talking about specifically it's called *(A PERCEPTRON)

14:18
Machine learning the problem yeah, well we're talking about both neuroscience and machine this article is about both neuroscience and machine learning. It's in the beginning it talks about machine learning but the rest of the articles neuroscience. Okay, so it's only machine learning the beginning but but so there's um, there's a concept in.

14:41
Called the. Why does my? In the basically the the model of a neuron I think is called like a positron or something. I'm trying to remember with them what it's called, not positron. *(PERCEPTRON)

14:58
It's like a basic. The computation unit in and an artificial neural network *(Perceptron)

15:11
It is a. Type in the word positron.

# F Scott
But that just gets confusing when we're gonna switch back and forth.

# Micah
So um, Well, I think the artificial I think it is yes. No, keep putting but not positron or something else. There's um. Okay, so let's just call the artificial neuron then for the take of brevity.

15:42
So in any case artificial neuron was like saying that the action potential was summed up and and that created this sort of like, you know, the probability of of they're they're trying to like, you know, basically like simplify they're saying okay, we need to put this into a machine and we just need to simplify it because there's too much complexity here, so we're gonna that the the where we're gonna like, you know, cut off the the complexity is just we're just gonna say okay everything that gets summed up and so you imagine that no matter what the the the dendrite is is thought to.

16:17
Have learned if you have to reduce it to a single you know on or off (1 or 0) then then potentially you're losing a lot of information and later on they made an adaption to where you know, it's it's um like it it can there's like, um, if it crosses if it's it's on but above a certain threshold then you can you can have like a vector that represents the the magnitude above that threshold, so they expanded the the depths of of what a single neuron could do what a single artificial neuron could could transmit.

16:51
# F Scott
So its output is no longer one or Zero it's like it can be like a something over time?.

# Micah
it's a one or zero in terms of whether it's activated but then beyond that artificial neuron has is represented by a vector which is just greater or or less than the it was either closer to to zero or closer to one in in terms of so it's sort of gives some sort of magnitude to the to the neural network.

17:28
# F Scott
But the single artificial neuron. Is output is what I was asking.

# Micah
Yes so the output has to has to stem from from that, you know, whether it's it's basically it's between zero and one it's it so it's either it's it's not just zero or one it's like this vector between zero and one and so so it's a little bit more complex but a multi a multi-vescular release so the rest of it so beyond that is the idea is that a multivascular release could.

18:04
Would make neuron make neurons a lot more. Computationally a lot more capable of passing along information than the then the the idea of neurons that are sort of summing everything up in in the and the action potential and in a simplified way because because you have I mean the idea is that so so I mean the article sort of covers how it works but and I'm not sure a hundred percent if.

18:32
If this article is correct because I sort of it's I'm sort of putting together a lot of different pieces of information but basically I put together that based on other others research that it looks like the the changes in the there's there's research to say the changes in the for example in in k or potassium are going to change the they're going to affect the amount of.

19:01
The presynaptic k potassium modifies the action potential (magnitude) or apsin which determines the strength of the synaptic signal including the (magnitude) of the postsynaptic response and then that leads to how many vesicles can be released per action potential which is between usually between zero and three.

I guess it could go to five as you said but but the average number.

19:40

# F Scott I was just making numbers up
lets say for example a cell will reach minus 40 millivolts which is roughly what they usually are then the spike happens way up and this is happening because there's channels that are just letting sodium in and sodium being positive it's it's going to depolarize the cell shoot the action am I speaking like shit that you already know pretty well, no keep going.

20:04
I'm okay. Okay so like it's letting a bunch of sodium in and all this positive charge is coming on and it's staying near the membrane which is like basically shooting the voltage up then you have the voltage sensitive channels so that's like the positive feedback loop it gets positive so it opens to let these are so more sodium channels, they're voltage sensor decoding channels, so like as it gets through negative 40, it's like okay now we can open and so it's like positive feedback loop now there's tons of sodium coming in and it's just shooting up above so it's going for closer to zero and then ten twenty it goes it's like positive forty.

20:41
Millivolts but what's happens there is you have this these potassium channels these k channels that open and start doing the opposite and the reason why you're thinking wait, this is positive wait wouldn't that be more positive current yes except there's a a gradient and so we're while there's more sodium outside the neuron than there is inside the neuron there's way more potassium inside the neuron than outside the neurons so if you're going to open a potassium channel, the positive charge is going to go the other way and and basically end up with a net negative charge it would be like a negative charges and During the cell yeah, yeah, although it's positive leaving anyways, so so that potassium that K current is hyper polarizing the cell back to where it was.

21:25
I didn't even over overshoots it a little bit and that's called the after hyper polarization but but the the timing that these things come on are so synchronized and so there's there there's so fast it results in a spike that lasts less than a millisecond so these potassium currents start shooting up and before they're even done shooting up the Sorry I said that backwards The sodium currents start shooting the voltage of the cell up and then before it's even done shooting up the potassium currents have turned on and starch shooting it back down to the point where you just get this in super quick spike and then it goes back down.

22:01
# Now the result of the spike despite transmits down the act the axon which at the very tip is where the vesicles are and the at the very tip of the axon you have these calcium channels and calcium is something that needs to come into so calcium is one of the things where there's like a gazillion times more outside the cell than Themselves So if a calcium channel opens the the force that shoving the calcium in the cell is just soup is like the strongest you're gonna get but but these calcium channels on the very tip of the axon, they are voltage gated and they're not gonna open unless unless it's super positive voltage.

22:40
So basically, they only open during a spike. So that's split second that one millisecond of a spike that finally reaches the tip of the axon gets this calcium to come in and when that calcium comes in it binds to something called synaptotagmin,

*synaptotagmin basically shoves the vesicle into the membrane and allows the neurotransmitter to spit out into the synapse and that's that's the formation of neural communication.

23:06
So that split one millisecond split positive milk voltage that reaches the that reaches the end of the axon allows that calcium to come in now *if you fuck with the potassium and you don't let it come on as fast as it would normally what you end up doing is you end up spreading that action potential instead of being just a split one millisecond event.

23:31
*by fucking with the potassium you just made that action potential a two millisecond or three millisecond event I don't know I'm exaggerating
but something super long right compared to what it should be.

# Micah
So I guess it can last as a maximum of like ten milliseconds, right?

# F Scott
No, I think it's way less I think it I think the difference of like half a millisecond to like point seven of a millisecond is like a huge difference in the terms of what we're talking about, but but yeah, let's just say for sake of example, it's like going from one millisecond to two milliseconds or five milliseconds something

*what you're talking about with the ten.
24:06
Milliseconds is the whole process after it went back down and after hyper polarized and stuff 

that's not I'm just talking about the the amount of time that it stays very positive which is the when the calcium will be let in. So if you double that or even make it 1.5 what the normal amount that calcium will come in so much more calcium will come in that's

# so much more calcium will bind to the synaptotagmin which will allow so many more vesicles to be released.

24:33
So, I think that's what you're talking about with the by messing with the k the k currents the k channels. The potassium channels you're you're changing the shape of the spike (magnitude) which you didn't mention but that's basically the result of that and by making the shape of the spike more spread out (duration) it allows enough time for its not just one vesicle to get released but like a bunch of (vesicles) get released over that much time.

25:01
# Micah
Because more calcium can come in more time?

# F Scott
Because there's the calcium channels open for longer yeah.

# Micah
For longer and that's what causes more of the. Of the whatever the vesicles more more vesicles released,

# F Scott
yes, so the there's the. So before the action potential let's zoom in to just the very tip of the axon terminal 

before the action potential it's just sitting there and what's called a docked state and so you have this vesicle inside the membrane and it's like right up against the membrane but you know, like think of two oil droplets, you know, like if the two oil droplets sort of touch, they're gonna they're gonna like come together and make one bigger droplet right so they're sitting there and you have the membrane this and then this one oil droplet kind of right next to it, but you know, it's like not touching and it needs a little bit of force.

26:00
To get them to touch and sort of like bind and then let the because the droplet holds the neurotransmitter right so so that the thing that allows it to sort of get enough force to push into the membrane is the synaptotagmin molecule and that's synaptic. I mean, it's the synaptictagmin like linker don't think it has think of it like a linker and there's other ones there's other names involved there that I'm just skipping but I'm trying to make this like somewhat comprehensible and that synaptotagmin needs doesn't do its job until calcium reaches it and the calcium has to come from outside the cell.

26:36

that's very little calcium inside the cell so that calcium channel has to open so that calcium comes from outside the cell goes inside the cell and reaches that synaptotagmin

but but that usually that duration is usually like a split, you know, like a millisecond or less um, which only allows enough to come in to sort of just release like one vesicle or two, you know what I mean, it just yeah, it's just enough to release one from the docking site,

# *if you let that channel open long enough, it would just keep it would keep doing it and it would release a bunch from the same site.

27:11
# Micah
Okay so so the so so what so there was um, so Peter Tse he suggested that the the amount of the NDMA receptors. I forget exactly was many years ago. I read his book anyway NDMA receptors could be regulated by the neuron or by by neurons regulating on the other neurons, so to change basically to change the okay so so part of this was this idea that the output of the neuron would have would have a be able to change its volume like it could it?

27:46
Um it would become you know neurons can be louder or quieter that's what this one analogy is it 

# F Scott

Can I ask for clarification, so if you release multiple vesicles,

so every vesicle I think

I forget if it's 2 thousand or 3000, but let's say two thousand every vesicle has like two thousand roughly neurotransmitters

so those things float into the synapse and then they bind to things, you know, predominantly the the receptor on the other side on the other cell, 

right but if you release five times that amount so instead of two thousand you're getting ten thousand.

28:21
The. Lateral spread is going to increase to the point where receptors very far lateral which it would have never diffused without far before but because now there's ten thousand of them instead of two thousand now they're diffusing further and further laterally you're activating receptors that probably weren't getting activated in the normal cases that what you're talking about

# Micah
or yeah, yeah maybe so that's not that's part of what I'm talking about is so it's not just it's not so so and now that the the neuron is not just passing along frequency information in in frequency information of slightly larger scales as determined.

28:56
By a vector it's also passing along spatial information because it can reach more neurons right?

# F Scott
yeah 
are we going to be relating this back to machine learning with would it be like because I feel like in machine learning all the neurons are connected every neuron has a connection to every neuron in the other layer already so you don't need this.

29:20
# Micah
Well in the current and the current architecture yeah that's what some but but I mean if you were if you were to add a spatial dimension to to neural networks and you we would yeah you'd have to give them like a sort of they'd have to the neural network the the neuron would have it a sort of like local a local community and then it would only reach out to other other neurons in the upstream and in the so it would

# so a neuron would only talk to some neurons in in the in the layer above it,

# but then if if it, If it could alternate to talking to all of them to or to just to a few of them you could alternate in between

# Fscott 
okay yeah yeah, okay that's where this concept ties in okay yeah so if you made a neural network that like each neuron only talked to this ten closest neurons from the next layer, then you can sort of.

30:18
Make this event where you have this wide action potential and you have this multi-vesicular release to where instead of just talking to the ten closest to it, it actually spreads out to the like thirty closest or the twenty, you know what I mean, 


# Micah
yeah, so so then so then it spreads out and then um, you know, so the the, um, a lot of people have focused on the the AMPA receptors but but um, but but Peter TSE he was saying that the the his focus is on the NDMA receptors because they can respond with they can respond faster they can react faster like with.

30:53
Him and the end the the way they can respond, you know within like they could vary from like, you know somewhere between like one and and four milliseconds or something like that, so they can they can receive a neurotransmitter and then send a signal or something do you know more about that?

31:11
# F Scott
BOTH AMPA & NDMA receptors can be fast
Is. Fast both of them on the scale of the few milliseconds most ampa is just so mostly sodium

So calcium is a kind of a weird molecule in that it's not just making its influence through its charge calcium has this sort of second influence because it can act as a messenger so if calc because this cell is so good at keeping calcium out outside of it away from it that whenever any calcium gets in it, it's it binds to things that causes secondary messaging signals and they like changes like phosphorylation and what DNA gets coded so calcium's like the sort of unique thing and so anyways this the NMD.

32:02
A channels let calcium in whereas the amphi channels everything. I'm saying is like a most of the time thing by the way because there's always these like weird thing anyways that if you're in general the amper channels don't let calcium in and the NMDA channels do let calcium. They're very similar otherwise so yeah so I mean so so one of the questions I put because I did this on podcast called an early podcast was it was how does a neuro circuit repeat itself so I mean, if if you could imagine so some so so one of the early descriptions that I heard of neural circuits and I guess there's a lot of different kinds of neuro circuits are different scales with neuro circuits just neurons talking other neurons, yeah if you have if you have but I was matting if you had a neuro circuit that the consisted of I of several neurons that were not directly connected to each other but you could see somehow with medical imaging that that one neuron over here was firing and then the next neuron over here is firing there's no direct connection but then the next neuron was firing and then each saw maybe maybe six or each firing in a loop and so my question was how are they able to keep how is that, you know, frequency pattern abled how could that continue to happen over time, how could you have basically if a neuron?

33:19
Might be connected to 200 upstream neurons and then you know or maybe 10,000 upstream neurons that I don't know what the you know, what what the number's gonna be right? I like to say stick with two hundred for this one two hundred two hundred or two hundred thousand let's say two hundred so you know on and it's connected to two hundred other neurons it makes synapses on to two hundred other neurons yeah and how does it how would it like so my question was how would it continue to connect to lead to us to a causality sequence of where that, We're signals from from the first person there on it's in the circuit would eventually reach the second neuron on the circuit that's not directly connected and in those signals with some outreach the the next neuron on the circuit which is also not directly connected and so on because there's if it's it's almost it almost implies that the signals are traveling along the same path and and so so I so I asked people said is it possible that you know that there's somehow the neuron in the post synaptic?

34:23
The postsynaptic neuron with some how selecting the signal um, and selecting you know, you know deciding what it was gonna it was the one it was the one that was gonna receive. A certain signal type and other neurons were deciding they were not and in in another idea was was was a selection related to some sort of like electromagnetic property where that would that neuron was had the lowest possible negative and therefore it attracted the the the signals that I wanted because I was thinking about, you know, there's positive and negative charges right and I was talking about this in the nearly as podcast and then someone else was like, well, no, you know in a later conversation.

35:06
I said basically, it's the same distribution every single time. A neuron fires and and all the neurons upstream get exactly the same signal every single time and and then and then I I thought well and and then they said. Yeah, so there's no like there's no selection and but but oh gosh, what was the rest of it?

35:34
Yeah, so maybe so maybe at that point it was like, um. No okay, so maybe so if if there's no like, What I'm saying is if um, like like how does it how does the signal travel from how would a signal travel along a consistent path from you know across you know regions of the brain to it to like a consistently repeating neuro circuit and is is it yeah so I don't know if you if you can answer that let's see what let's see what I followed and then you can kind of tell me if I followed it okay so from what I understand like.

36:12
You have a an area with some neurons and let's say you're looking at one of them and it fires and then in another area where you're looking at some neurons, you're seeing some activation of some neurons there at that that happen like at the exact time difference that it would take for the signal to progress to that area and then maybe a third area so and so you're seeing a pattern you're saying like a neuron from these neurons area one lead to these neurons from area two firing lead to these nouns from area three firing.

36:47
And and so as far as how exact it is over like so let's say in in for some I've seen so like you give a mouse the same stimulus you give them like a picture of a whatever who cares you give them the same stimulus you wiggle the whisker the exact same way, whatever.

37:07
That's kind of the exact same they're asked kind of just doesn't happen but the um, but but you the same areas do happen so you do see like like 50 miles an area one fired and then 59 neurons an area to in this other secondary fire and then 50 in this area fired and so that's what people usually report they're like, so we're at what we're get as we get them a bunch of them fire here then a bunch of them here, so what we're seeing is area a and then area b and a is c are a direct result of wiggling the whisker in this exact way but I I'm sure there's like exceptions but in General.

37:42
You I think it's fair to think most cases I mean you could definitely think in most cases it's not like the same neurons firing every time definitely not so what what's interesting though is okay so another thing maybe that's helpful and especially for a lot of compute the computational people that I talk to even in my program is they always think like things are very strongly connected probably because in machine learning that they are but in in the brand I think they did some models and I think typically for one cell if you'd like counted.

38:17
All 500 of their inputs. I think it would take like 60 of the inputs or 30 of the inputs all firing at the same time to be like enough to get that that's to be depolarizing enough to get that cell to fire and that has to be relatively within a very, you know, within a couple millisecond window so it's very rare almost everything, you know, maybe there's a couple strong also there's a high degree high degree of variability in the strength of connections so with let's say a five hundred.

38:52
Maybe just a couple super strong ones that maybe can almost try to spike on their own but probably not more than like, you know one percent of those ones but for the vast majority they're all gonna be like on the average of 130th or 150th or something of the size, it needs to be to evoke a spike and then in the next neurons so so it's very rare that like one neuron spikes and then the next neurons spikes because that neurons spiked what's more a more helpful way to think about it is all these neurons.

39:27
Like even when you're not receiving any stimulus the brands just sort of firing and it's default mode and there's just so much activity just already going and so the outside world almost doesn't cause activity it just sort of shifts the activity that's already going on into something else so because so the way I think it's helpful on a computational standpoint is think of all these neurons are already sort of just hanging around near threshold, so it doesn't take a ton to get them past their shoulder but they're sort of you know in that caliber, there's like, Saddle points and attractor states and repeller states it's almost like the brain is normally like on that saddle or on in the repeller state like not where it shouldn't be stable just waiting to go to a stable place through any input and then you know, and so the the network is always on the edge yeah, yeah.

40:24
I know the end of those content um, so okay, so the the next question is the is the so the dendrite. So that idea here is that the dendrite is, um, you know in jetpackings and Jeff Hawkins explanation and on intelligence a dendrite the hairs on the dendrite could potentially store temporal temporal temporal memories right so so the members that is a like a proposition currently like a good like what's called like a standing like like there's not like a ton of research on it, but this is kind of what everybody thinks is the spines of the dendrite which has these little like like bubbles on on the dendrites sort of like hold like the Memory.

41:07
Are the input cam so that it knows so that way the neuron knows what to strengthen for next time okay, so then so then so that's how the neuron knows what to strengthen so so that is that leads to the next question is is in and so um, so the dendrite might you know inform the neuron somehow of of what criteria to look for like it like the idea is it's gonna you know, change the information it collects somehow gonna go back to the ending receptors and and it's going to you know, change the interval of what what, Between from three milliseconds to only two milliseconds, it's only one millisecond in and so it it can so in it an idea is that I could change what the what it's willing to listen to whether it's gonna listen to one neuron or thirty neurons before it does anything well, it's always list so the wind that's listening to all the neurons is you know, So all those neurons have connections and receptors, okay, so if you look across all the dendrites and you say there's like five hundred areas where axons from other neurons are like right across the synapse from it all along those dendrites if any of those five hundred acts ons release narrow transmitter, you know, those that transmitter's gonna bind to the receptors and that's gonna open channels and those channels are gonna get depolarized so it's it can't really selectively ignore anything because If it if there's charge coming in the dendrites that charge is gonna go towards the cell body and that charge is gonna going to you know, like add up in it towards this, you know, and perhaps cause a spike it's the way things are can be like ignored is this kind of cup it they can happen but but it's, Like you can sort of like remove receptors but that that type of control isn't coming from the the cellbot like the cell body isn't like there isn't like some center control like saying what to pay attention to what not to so I'm I mean that that is kind of the idea of period TS's book the neural basis of of free well and is that a neuron can change the the sort of like the, Way whether what it's in DMA receptors are receptive to but you're saying that that it's that's not an idea that you do well not from this so so the let's talk about the things that can change the resetivity of an MDH receptors, so.

43:58
They can be phosphorylated phosphorylation occurs from from you know, like there can be signaling that happens through other receptors near its other like GPCR receptors can get activated that change the phosphorylation in a specific area, but that that signal is not. Coming from the center of the cell You can also like express more kindnesses and that would come from the cell, but the the kinases are not going to be directed.

44:32
They're going to be evenly distributed across this. So if you upregulate your kinases that's going to just go everywhere and so that's what the cell itself can control but if there's going to be some sort of local signaling to an enemy receptors to say phosphorylate these to make them weaker or like a rep, you know have a resting vine to get them removed from the membrane that type of signaling.

44:53
I don't know of any way that the, Cell body the the nucleus of the cell can really control it in a space space shields spatial way that kind of controls gonna come probably from signaling happening from other cells. So, I mean the stuff could be right but I just don't think it would be correct to think about it in terms of like the cell is deciding that it would be like the cells in the network are contributing to that results where the enemy is, um, how would the cells in the network can modify the NDMA receptors of another cell?

45:29
Ok say along those are in our example 500 a contacts onto the all the dendrites of this one, so let's say like 10 of those contacts are get are coming from us certain cells like in acetylcholine cell where instead of sending glutamate like most cells do this particular cell is sending acetylcholine and let's say one of the receptors occur in your cell and in your dendrite is acetylcholine receptor, that's a GPCR that is a GI coupled receptor that's gonna decrease the cyclicAMP in that local region and Because it's gonna have that decreases gonna lower the activity of PKA, which is a kinase which phosphorylates and that phosphorylene kinase is now no longer gonna phosphorylate this NMDA channel and so then all that MDA channels in that rough region are now gonna like get turned down or turned off first or we're talking about inhibitory inhibitory action and the into ambulatory cells right now.

46:29
This is a signaling this isn't inhibitory like in that GABA sense where you're getting a negative charge. Okay, this is like a signaling molecule. That sort of sends a signal inside the dendrite and tells the receptors to you know sort of it sort of either blocks them a little bit or guess them a little more activated or even signals to them to like, hey remove from the membrane you don't even need to be there anymore which would decrease the you know, so the net result is you're right and inhibitory result but I just don't want that to be confused with in inhibitory, you know response which is a gaba response which directly just puts negative charge in it, like it's a chloride channel basically where chloride comes in.

47:14
And makes it more negative but that's that's not what I'm talking about in this case. Okay that happens to both of all of those things happen. And so another question is the the how does the so the dendrite? I guess can store. With its spikes it might store like temporal information and is that also is it also storing spatial information like, you know, basically like able to set the cell up so that it responds to not just 30 downstream neurons but a specific set of downstream neurons like, you know, like a neurons over over in in certain regions there.

47:56
I mean, I'm just thinking about like how you know, there are certain, you know cells or cones in in the eye that that might be the only. Respond to information moving from left to right for example, right so yeah, so how does that work yeah, so I'm just I'm just thinking like yes, so if you can so yeah if you could respond to that and I'll remember the rest of it while you're talking.

48:22
Yeah, so I'm trying to rise to those amber can cells that do that that left to right thing and the way they work is like there's this inside to outside kind of thing going on basically it's like. It has to do with temporal summation, so so you only get so okay first I think it's best to clarify that the actual potential.

48:47
You know only it starts at the cell body and it goes down the axon the in the simplest way to think about it it's sort of doesn't actually potential doesn't go up the dendrites at all it's just like you add up all so charges come in from the in these little skinny dendrites and then they sort of travel down and it's you think of these dendrites as a leaky hose right so if you shove a lot of water in it which is voltage, you know, if you shove enough in it, you know enough will get through the other side and not leak out the hose right, you know, if you stabbed a fork with the you know, stabbed a hose with a fork machine but uh, So whatever makes it so now you have all these hoses and they're all sort of plugged into the same thing at the end and what you're trying to do is get enough water in at the end of the same time and if you get enough then it like has a burst right like in that burst is the action potential so the action potential is only happening on the opposite side of all the dendrite leaky hose dendrites, um, Which you know in reality there's some that you've the sake of thinking about it just consider this to be like roughly true so so the sorry I lost my train I thought well so if the danger if the dendrite hairs are storing a temporal memory, then they would have to somehow that memory has to be triggered and sometimes when voltages being received but not every time in voltages is being received otherwise it wouldn't have any meaning.

50:17
What what the difference is every is the if you're only looking at 10 of the inputs and sometimes there it's causing it sometimes it's not the difference 10 usually is the other 390 inputs that you're not looking at you know, so so let me finish I remember I was going you asked about left to right so so the way that that works is imagine so let's say there were 10 dendrites so 10 leaky hoses and you can shove in water at the very tips of all 10 of these leaky hoses.

50:52
And if you get enough water to the center where they all meet at the same time it would cause a spike. Now, this is how you could get left to right sort of firing. If the hoses on on one side were gradually longer than the hotel so imagine the rightmost hose is 50 feet long then the than the second one is 45 feet long and the third one is 40 feet long and the fourth one is 35 and then 30 feet and so so all these dendrites are different sizes all these hoses are different sizes.

51:21
If you start putting water in the longest hose first, And then a split second later you put it in the second longest in the split second later you put in the third longest and so forth Then at the end of the day all of those water will reach the center point at the exact same time which will be enough to get it over the threshold and to communicate hey fire now if you do it in the opposite order and you put water in the shortest toes first and then gradually put water towards the you know, go towards the longest hose what'll happen is water will reach it and leak out reach the center point and then reach out leak out and then the next the water from the other hose the longer hose will reach neck.

52:02
S but it is basically they don't add up all at the same time They don't reach it basically the voltage all has to kind of get there because all of the stuff is super leaky. So so it has to all get there at the same time to cause a sprite.

52:15
So if the organization of of the dendrites are such that, you know, you're going there longer on one side and and tapering to shorter on the other side, it's only gonna work in the left to right direction, but not the right to left direction if you know it if does that make sense to be easier to draw a picture I guess.

52:35
No annoying I got a hundred percent but um, So so then I wanted to ask you how how then dendritic spikes affect this this equation.

So so in the in the neuroscience 101 where you don't learn about dendritic spikes, it's just axons that's spiked the spikes starts at the soma which is the center point and then it propagates down the axon to the axon tip and the investical release.

53:04
But in reality if there's a spike that's gonna start at the soma even though the vast majority of of the energy is going down the axonders, it's so powerful there's still a little bit get pushed the other way too, right? But when you you know and when uh, You went to rock rockets are attached in space and one super heavy and one super light the light one's gonna shoot off super far, but the heavy one's token.

53:33
I like have a little bit, you know what I mean, so like the spike is sort of going in the opposite direction too and that causes what's called a back action potential BAP. It's an end back propagating at that property in action potential and that that is that is one component of a dendritic spike.

53:52
There's this other component of it and then so, Because there's these voltage-gated calcium channels which are very similar to the ones on the tip of the axon that let the calcium and let the vessel release but there's very similar channels also on the dendrite and and they can sort of add up and sort of propagate in a in a.

54:15
You think about an op-amp with a with a forfeit forward, you know what I mean with a positive feedback in kind of thing and so so and actually NMDA channels can contribute to this so there can be but but not every cell has these really it's mostly verified per animal cells that have these but yeah, so there can be dendritic spikes which are very different than normal then the classics bike that we're the classic external spike that we always talk about these dendritic spikes can happen actually both.

54:48
Through calcium channels in the foreword direction in those layer five pyramidal cells, but in every cell you have those back propagating action potentials where it's happening in the cell men going backwards and so I think a lot of what we were talking about is trying to define this thing called spiked timing dependent plasticity and like how it assigns credit because inhibi and learning you have this idea where you know fire the other wire together where if one neuron, Caught like sort of caused the spike of the next neuron then that strength should that synapse should be strengthened whereas if it didn't it should be weakened and so this the idea is like if it goes around one then two then that neuron one probably caused it and thus it should be strengthened, but if if the post synaptic neuron fires first and then the presynaptic neuron fires, then you know, that presynaptic neuron didn't contribute crap to the first one fire because the first one the other side to neuron two to firing because that it didn't you know, it didn't fire before it so it couldn't contribute to it.

55:56
So in that sense it should be weaken and they've even showed moving poons lab has showed like that, you know, the closer one fires before the other the more the synapse gets strengthened and then if it happens in the other direction the market's weekend playing stuff and the way they've explained it is.

56:14
Is through they were just talking about like with assigning sort of the credit to the to the dendritic spine through this sort of calcium signaling and that propagating action potentials and I think Rafael used probably has some good explanations of it in his book called spines. But but yeah, sorry I probably went to far all over the place there no no, you know you didn't um, that was really great that was um, so it was interesting okay so so Jeff Hawkins was in his book on the new book a thousand brains he was saying that he thinks the the dendritic spike could be how the neuron is predicting that it's going to fire and in addition to everything else he said did you agree with that?

57:07
Yeah like a dendrite spike. Well the well first off the back propagating actual potential that's interesting only happens as a result of the neuron already firing but as far as what you're saying if it can be a large factor in causing the axonal spike then you're talking about it forward dendritic spike and those yes in the cells that have those in the layer five pyramidal cells, yeah that those are huge huge contributing factors, usually yeah, usually you need.

57:42
Usually you need that plus like a little bit of something else to get a spike you're you're probably not gonna get it's probably gonna be difficult to evokes bikes without that that dendritic sprite so that was that was that's sort of like Jeff Hawkins bases for how a neuron is predicting that it's gonna fire without actually firing completely and thank you for like and and so I also wanted to ask you so I so when I asked about dendritic spicy you answered a question that I wanted to ask but I I my I was actually asking about dendritic hairs and how they effective voltage hoses.

58:17
The the hoses are like the things that I was calling dendrites hoses yeah and then the hairs are actually called spines the dendritic spine so I said spikes instead of spines and that you answered and a second question from me before the first question and hopefully it doesn't delete the first question from my memory, but I'm just kidding so hot so how would the dendritic hairs affect the the voltage of the hoses would that it would that cause the with that nestled to order of?

58:48
dendritic hairs/spines do you mean like the the length of the dendrite or doing the little tiny points on the dendrite those are spines those are the spark where the connections sort of happen? I'm at the yeah the the points on the dendrite not not the length of it, okay, yeah, so those are dangerous spines and not.

59:10
Okay most cells have them not all of them most neurons have them um and how does how does it affect spines effect the voltage going through the the dendrites themselves yeah because you're asking yeah yeah because you know if voltage if it voltage travels through different materials, it changes how fast voltage could can move through a material and if there's more material that should slow it down, right?

59:37
Yeah, okay, so um. Wait, what's your background yes like physics back all right can I just talk about vi v = IR type stuff with you or like how what what like um, I ve equals ir I I'm not just I can hang with you a little bit you got to be you guys okay use too many acronyms okay, so you're like CS mostly right yeah, okay that's good that's good it's just good for me to know which listing yeah you are.

01:00:09
I have got a lot of a lot of neuroscience and a lot of CS. Okay. So in some physics some some astrophysics some some quantum, but not but not as much as other experts out here. Okay, so, um. So Okay, so let's give some background. I think it was this is the best play in Tim Urban's intro to an early thing that 80,000 were thing.

01:00:37
He you read that right or have your other. Oh, what was it called Tim? It's a Tim Urban wrote this sort of introducing article for an early when they just came out on his website. Wade Popeye and I think he titled it like the brain's magical hat or something.

01:00:55
It's it has like a picture of a wizard hat. And he basically so so the bit the Silicon Valley is just full of like CS people right So so and then Elon Musk like putting up this like neuroscience thing in the center of all these tech people who don't know what the fuck it's even for so so basically Tim Urban wrote this amazing article, it's huge it's like that it's the same size as like reading a chapter in a book.

01:01:19
It's 80,000 words probably like reading 30 pages or something but he basically condenses a neuro 101 class. Basically, like a two semester class like like literally I remember reading it being like damn I didn't have to. Spend a whole year in an intern era. I could just like read this article and got the same rough idea.

01:01:38
You know anyways, I think this is his I might this might be from my intro textbook or it might be from his article. I can't remember but you can sort of think of so yeah the dendrites are leaky they're like if you took the hose and you stabbed it a bunch of times of the fork and you're trying to shove water on one side, it's gonna like lose a bunch of water by the time I get to see other side, but you can also like duct tape.

01:02:03
The holes and then you can keep a little more pressure you know keep the voltage lasting a little longer so that's something called the length the length constant is like how far you can get the charge to travel and then the time constant is like how long it takes for that charge to leak out of the holes and these things are dynamic.

01:02:21
You can actually plug some so there's certain holes in the dendrite called like in regractifying potassium channels or whatever and so these can act you can actually shut them that you can send one of these signaling molecules. I was talking about and sort of just close them all and then by closing.

01:02:38
Them all you're allowing less you're you're plugging the leak you're sort of like duct taping the holes and allowing charge to travel further and leak out slower and thus the same signal that what was weaker, you know that you know was a weak signal because you plugged all the the holes in the hose kind of goes further down the hose, you know, and the and the so this is dendrites right so so basically these dendrites can be dynamic in a way so the dendrites can be very leaky or you send some signal it gets sent some signals to it and then the dendrites.

01:03:13
Be. Come less leaky and now they can transfer charge they'll even further and and so normally let's say it would take. You know in that area it would take like one you know wonder on the spike a bunch of times and a bunch of other neurons spiking a bunch of times and I'm all happening at the same time so you really need like 15 inputs to all happen at the same time and that's barely enough to get pushed enough charge down to the soma but if you plug up all these holes instead of needing 15 inputs all at the same time, maybe it'll make it with like 9 inputs, so that's that that's one component of how these dendrites are dynamic so you can sort of plug the leakiness to them.

01:03:57
The spines is the other thing okay so all these inputs are coming in at spines which are like these little bumps. I honestly there's pictures of all these things and urban article too so like you could actually see pictures of spines and any heat uses like tons of analogies every like in everything so and they're all great, you know, um, I did read his article a long time ago.

01:04:21
I just had to look it up to make sure but um, yeah, it's in front of me right now, yeah I read that thing like I I told my like sister who's like, not even a nerd she's like a physician's assistant to read it. You're like you but I think it's mostly directed for like for like tech people who don't have any neuro background but like you who know tech you know, but so so the spines are where the inputs come in and the so and the inputs are these channels that that let mostly sodium ions in and that those sodium ions depolarize that area and the skinnier the dendrite is that the more resistance it has so like some small amount of current actually causes a really large voltage.

01:05:07
In the skinny dendrites but then once it gets spread out across the dendrite it's sort of like it all ends up the same it all just ends up being discharged that accumulates and maybe increases the voltage a little bit so it usually takes a lot of voltage to cause a spike and then the the signaling of like how do we know what contributed which which inputs which receptor areas contributed most to the spike that's not known but the way it's hypothesized now is is through these spines so like if there's signals coming in and the spines and there's also these calcium.

01:05:42
Calcium buffer proteins, and if there's these calcium channels going in and it holds calcium enough in those spines for just long enough and then a second later the cell spikes and sends a back propagating action potential so now that area that got the input now knows that there was a success on the other side, you know, like oh we got it despite and so maybe it gets that signal from the back propagating action potential and because it still has calcium sitting in the spine together, it's like, It like somehow signals that spine like hey we did it you should strengthen but but there's no sort of control from the cell that's like, hey it was that spinal over there, let's go strength and that's fine it's more like that local area is probably holding some sort of information and probably the idea right now as like maybe it's calcium is being held in the spine and then if a split second later you get this back propagating action potential, that's the success signal so the spine kind of knows hey we did it let's strengthen and then the way it would strengthen would be like, Let's put an extra receptor in there let's put an amp over set let's add another ampere receptor, you know, which will allow which will just be another input in the exact same spot so it'll it'll be like two receptors are now there that can that can open and response to the neurotransmitter across from it, okay, so let me get them and get this right so I so I thought that that spines increase and decrease in number rapidly like all the time.

01:07:17
And I think it like bigger and smaller and. So this this receptors on spines the receptors on dendrites it doesn't have to be spines but yes off many times on spines on they are constantly getting extra implanted in the membrane and getting removed from the membrane. So spines also are dynamic but I don't think you should as far as.

01:07:47
I don't know if the if it's worth talking about the function right now at this level of the spines being at getting at it or not because that's a slower process the spines growing towards a new so it's like if a new axon is coming in and now it's this new cell that it you know, it's this new connection that it hasn't even been made before then maybe a new spine will grow out to meet it but that's like more of a long-term plasticity thing that's not like on the terms of like, Where you know, right now we're talking on the scales of like seconds Mike milliseconds seconds and maybe like a minute or a couple minutes we're asked fine growth is more along those maybe hours or days, you know what I mean, so maybe let's skip the spines growing and and not growing for like just right now okay so um, so we have a receptors changing on the on the order of either millisecond scales or minutes on yeah, let's just say seconds since that's a good middle ground and in the spines might be.

01:08:52
Added or removed but it's on it's on it's in terms of hours or days it's much longer period of time now are this but are the spines when when long-term potentiation happens is does that part of the process of spines getting added or removed?

01:09:10
Yes, yeah, the LTP is it's. First you would see more channels getting put in there so you'd get more amper channels maybe more NMDA channels and then if you're putting in a bunch more than you're probably gonna get some more spines to meet new connections, but that's gonna be slightly slower.

01:09:32
I mean, I say milliseconds and seconds and then seconds and hours. I don't actually remember the precise. Scale of time but like that in relation to each other that's what they are. Okay, and then so when when protein synthesis happens I is that also so that so long-term potentiation protein synthesis is a part of it is can you can you spend how proteins synthesis might be connected to spines being added or removed?

01:10:07
Yeah, so. I don't that's I don't know the proteins involved in spines being added and removed. I know yeah so calcium calmodulin complex can be like a signaling thing that initiates that and I don't know the details you're going outside of my okay, but I know and then I this is I'll just like I'll highlight this as a research area.

01:10:36
Awesome, and then um, thank you. I I have more questions. I don't know how much more time you have but I, I just thought we were gonna end up going back to VCI's at some point. Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah we can. So, um, I mean you can keep asking me stuff for now till till you run until we hit at that point then and then we can I don't know whatever you want to do.

01:11:02
So, okay, let me just look over my the notes that I've typed out here so because somebody was raising their hand that should have called on them. I think the left oh no, whatever. I didn't even notice because I was looking at my notes. I noticed a second ago, but I wanted to finish my thought before I brought up anyways, yeah, they're gone.

01:11:23
Okay, let's go back to your question about the. The BCI so so you wanted to talk about the thalamus, right? Well,

01:11:38
Some perception before. Um, yeah, yeah. I was. So that's something I've been super interested in okay, um, so. You know in that you you can uh in like the AR VR or in VR world you can solve all the visual issues for artificial perception, but then you're missing tactile and you know auditory and I guess auditory cover here but you're missing some stuff, right?

01:12:07
You can like put yourself you can wear these gloves that put pressure on things so it makes it feel like you're touching stuff but what if you could connect in a way where you can just input the perception right into the neural activity. I think we were talking about like broccoli one day with some guy right and somebody didn't believe that you could like imprint properly in your thoughts yeah yeah that's that's my that's my example that I I I came up with that and talked about it in the neurospot podcast the idea that that broccoli you that that it might have a temple of spatial patterns that are characteristic enough that even if your brain was organized completely differently from someone else's brain, they could consistently recognize that temple patented broccoli and you could consistently recognize it.

01:12:58
S temporal spacing of pattern of broccoli and so you can both talk about broccoli and understand what each other was talking about and talk about the properties of broccoli together, even if your brain was formatted differently and let's just break this break this down into something half as complex what if you were just watching what if you just wanted?

01:13:23
To taste broccoli and so you don't you don't need to know what somebody else is taste of broccoli is what if you just wanted to in print but let's like let's do something a little more palpable actually let's say you wanted and actually this is already a problem an issue in in prosthetic devices so let's say you have you're missing an arm but you want to give the sensation that somebody touched your hand and you're missing arm and I think this this sort of this is totally like it's a very similar issue, it's like if you don't if You do have an arm what if you just want to input the sensation of somebody touching your arm directly into the sensory region for arm and your brain, you know, it's let's set a broccoli let's use that and so that way you're not translating what it feels like for somebody else to be touched and what it feels like for you to touch let's just say like I want it to feel like somebody tapped on my wrist without somebody's tapping on my wrist, that's sort of like I think a simple like artificial perception issue.

01:14:32
Um is do you follow like does that is that close enough to the broccoli example for you yeah I mean, so I mean I so so I I lost focus a little bit but are you basically saying that if we are going back to I think we talked about this last time on that if you if you stimulate neurons that correspond or areas of neurons that the correspond to that stimulus that's going to reproduce that that that's sensation is that sort of where we're going here the artificial perception, yeah exactly.

01:15:07
Yeah, so if you. If you look at the area of the brain that transmits that it okay so so that it the area so that information gets transmitted from the neurons in your arm it goes up through your your brain stem it makes one stop there and then it goes to your thalamus where it makes it second stop and then from the thalamus it goes all across cortex, so what I've been interested in is seeing how thou and that so basically everything kind of goes through the thalamus not smell of course, but like everything I'm talking about here, so yeah, what if I could just decode what if I just could decode what's going on in the thalamus?

01:15:44
And then risk and then sort of copy that in so basically like okay whenever you touch the wrist, it's like it's a pattern of like these 700 dynamic neurons and it goes like these 40 and then right after it's these 20 and then these 50 and then these 10 and these you know, it's like this pattern and then when you activate this in this way, you know those dynamic signals get out to cortex in this pattern and so but but you you figure out like what the pattern is and and there can of course be variability and it's still gonna feel similar the same and if you can reciprocate.

01:16:19
That pattern back on to the the the outputs then you can basically evoke that artificial perception. And I mean, they're link talks about this and their stuff they're like yeah and then you can even add in perceptions like we can only see red and purple but what if you could see ultraviolet and so you could do that, you know.

01:16:37
I mean, you can add to this. So yeah so um for I mean we so I I talked about this in the nearly as podcast which was years ago and you know yet it was we were I was doing an early podcast before even early existed and and and talking about this and so the yeah, so the idea was that I I brought this up to David Eagleman a neuroscientist one said at a at a meet up and and I said something like something to the fact that if you know, Since you're since you're you're you know, you're the I the idea was that well what if you know I guess it was it was an idea like what if your thalamus is like is like your your camera and you're like if you're designing like a VR program and you're thousands of your camera and you're in the neocortex is the environment that's right that's rendering the image right and so so the the stuff the stuff comes in and so we it goes it goes to the thalamus and and that's you know, you get you get to observe.

01:17:50
The stuff but. Eyes are the camera. Wire so you can still get the you can still get all the info you need from the thalamus if you can just hack into the wires, you know what I mean?

01:18:10
Yeah like like the like the detect like the light detectors the camera lens, it's like the camera and the lens itself and the photo detectors are like in are on the eye but like if you can take the sit right the camera's an electronic signal out and so if you can cut off the signal halfway in its tracks and then just pump out the signal, you know on the other side then then that's the same scenario right yeah like the thalamus kind of so so I mean, I felt that I felt that the the thalamus was kind of like, You know a point where you said like set up for a second and just like really think about this the thalamus was like a point where you could intercept the signal and you could let me just see.

01:19:06
It would be like, um. Okay, so so. It's it's kind of like in so so instead of needing to study like every single part of the new cortex to decode the brain if you could just stick a microphone to the up to the thalamus itself then you might be able to decode what a person is thinking about it across across their brain and into knowing.

01:19:36
About not at all. I think the thalamus just gets you the sensory inputs, so it's like it's like seeing a hearing right so no okay so it'd be the equivalent to if you have a neural network and. And you feed it like an image right and they all the image all goes to layer one of the network imagine if you could just record all of what happens in layer two of the network and say, you know, it's a 20 layer network if you can just reciprocate later two next time it should give you the same out you shouldn't have to show the network the image again, you should just be able to plug in all the values for layer two and then it.

01:20:25
It should sort of like if it decodes like dog or cat, right so if you basically instead of showing it a darker cat what if you just knew what the layer two weight not weights the layer two values were for doc for a particular dog and then you just put them in then you now now the network will will think dog but you didn't even have to show it dog.

01:21:00
They yeah, I don't know maybe that's not but they basically so you're not knowing what all you don't know all the stuff all the thoughts are happening in the upper layer, you know, they're happening in layers, three four, five, six seven, if we're analogizing to to machine learning. AI all the thoughts are happening in the in the upper layers the thalamus is sort of like trying to just just grab what the inputs were, you know, without having to look at what this you know, like, The screen so I guess one of the questions that I really wanted to ask you had more to do with your exploration of the thalamus and how signals travel so I mean, I obviously I've well that's not enough so obvious but you know, I've taken cop narrow 101 and and they talk about how you know, the the photon might bounce off your your eye and and eventually a signal might travel from your eye along the optic nerve to your thalamus and then backwards to the, To the neocortex to the to the to the what is it called the the cortex in the back of your head yeah b1 in the occipital lobe yeah but um, but but I wonder um, there's a lot more detail than that so did you would you mind maybe like just describing because then you I actually I thought what is conventionally thought of that the the the note the the good story system didn't travel to the thousands but you found out that one of five ways to.

01:22:36
Everything yeah so that yeah, it doesn't so everything has to go through the thalamus before reaches cortex, um, yeah except the olfactory system does the spell the smell has five paths and and none of the so of the five nuclei none of them are the thalamus but one of those five nuclei does go to the thalamus next so basically now in once the whole factory bolt, you know goes to piriform cortex and, Cubicle and all these other places I think which one maybe it's the tuber cooler or something then that one goes to like anterior dorsal thalamus or something so the thalamus does get like a copy of the information but it's not the soul router then you know, it's not the it's not the telephone operator for smell okay, whereas all the other senses, you know, it is like all the other senses but before it goes to cortex it has to go through thalamus.

01:23:39
Okay and then so so what part of the brain does the do the does the goosatory system connect with? Olfactory will yeah, that's so smell. I don't that's not my area but it. The the primary area that's studied is the piriform cortex okay and then I'm okay, so then so so information comes out of the thalamus right and it goes let's so let's ignore smell and so like for all the other modalities yeah so you get tons you get taste vision hearing all that information comes through like the the receptors on the outside of the skin and and the ear, you know, like everything there's it's like these sensory transducers basically and then they make, You know, they go through the spinal cord or wherever they go through and then they go up to the thalamus.

01:24:32
And the thalamus is sort of like the center station and then from the thalamus it just like goes all over the coin doesn't like once it gets to the thalamus it no it no longer follows that sort of we go here and then here and then go here it's sort of like spreads it sort of starts spreading out like in a in a way where it's not it's not that useful to start saying to keep the hierarchy going, you know some degree of hierarchy but it's not it's not as strict as it was before it rock grease the thalamus before we Miss it was very step-wise like all the signals go here and then they and there's not much there's not like a ton of computation decoding it it's sort of like just goes there and then gets passed on there's not like a bunch of algorithmic computation going on, but then once it reaches cortex now you have all these competitions going on, so it's sort of doesn't make sense to try to hack what the cortex is doing because it's so complicated but if you just want artificial perception what makes more sense is just, Find out what the input is before the cortex even got it and then copy that and that way you don't have to figure out the you know, thousands of years of research that it's going to take you to figure out what the health cortex is doing if you can just grab the signal beforehand right but what I'm saying is is um, so yeah, so I remember now with the neural podcast we were saying that um, we decoding the signal at the thalamus but also, um stimulates stimulating the thalamus directly to to reproduce the the signal right there because then it would then it would just be carried to the rest of the Neural network right that was that was the idea and that would be great and then the then comes to the heart issue the thalamus is like in the center of the brain and the furthest possible thing you could reach the most dangerous thing to go for and so it's actually the worst target but what you could do is try to influence the term the philanthropic terminals, yeah, you know that was an idea.

01:26:38
I I was working I'm saying I'm constantly thinking about how to approach it that way one of the ideas that I came up with again, this is an early podcast if you want to check it out, but it was I was yeah definitely well. I I just looked up that guy and he looks like somebody I should look up the the the were you with were you talking with him the Stanford professor which one?

01:26:59
Yeah it says David Eagleman. I I don't have a podcast with him yet but he's promised that he'll do one with me, oh he's not a profess he's stands alumni stand for University he teaches yeah he's impressed okay yeah yeah but uh, but yeah, I'll definitely check it check it out that that podcast so so yeah, we could probably talk more easily if I if I followed that podcast, um, but what I want what I was gonna go for was um, I so I I pitched the idea that we could target the we could stick the, The the neural lace up the up the nostril feel like a nano robot would climb up the nose to the underside of the other brain is closer to that as it's close to the thalamus is we could get it and that's how that's how we would decode the the thalamus and and and and stimulate it.

01:27:55
Basically. Exclusion like they are ready. I'm either stuff with the they're like putting in some type of electro through the vectors. Um, At we got right about that that's a new it's actually it's actual nearly that they basically they they they there's a it goes through the it's you can actually stick it in through someone's arm and then route it up the blood vessel into the brain and then when it gets to where it's supposed to be it expands.

01:28:31
I wrote about this as well on so if you can see my you can see I interviewed the guy who was doing it actually and that's good does do that, by the way. I'm curious let me check my website out. I'll tell you who it was yeah. I covered this new yeah.

01:28:47
The most not. That awesome because it came out like three or four years ago and I haven't ever seen or heard anybody talk about it all right, you know, at least that work. I mean, I see it's talked about all the time and the pop science stuff but like in the neuroscience side, I haven't seen much so maybe it's a slow moving maybe they're maybe it's like in a clinical step or something.

01:29:10
Hang on I mean just. I think I need to hit the surge button for neural place on my it may have been so long ago that I.

01:29:25
Shoot. Hmm.

01:29:36
Okay this okay, so it's called stent road. Yeah that sounds right so the virtual reality for pain relief instantro to bring computer interface is gonna be implanted in the brain without brain surgery. So I interviewed at the game developer conference of 2019. I spoke to David Petrino. He's a PhD at Mount Sinai and I talked about his neuros product called Dent Road and so if you message me later, I'll send you the link to this article since it's a little bit harder to find or you can just search my website for stentrode and you'll find my article and it has the interview with him and also I linked his talks you can see his talk at GDC, which you you weren't able to find before but.

01:30:21
Followed you yesterday or two days ago on a on on Twitter so I can I can message you and stuff on there, okay good, um, I don't know if I'm following you back yet, but I I hope I'm yeah, I don't think you're following me back but you'll I'm hopefully get too many followers in the last two three days no.

01:30:39
I mean, I've gotten in the last like four weeks. I've gotten like a hundred followers and I I want to follow every single person back but I just I sometimes I'm not aware.

01:30:51
Yeah, I'll message you or something yeah, that's that's that's really cool. I mean, so. It looks like this this has been like a you you you seem to have like done a lot of interviews and podcasts about it, maybe over the you know, like three years ago and stuff, um, I'm reading it thing right now.

01:31:12
I when I was reading like you're you're VR stuff too. I was I thought you were. I was getting the device that you were interested in like integrating those two things to I am in the early podcast. I talk about how it opens the door to having VR and AR without direct brain stimulation so some of the software that I'm writing now for VR applications will eventually be nearly software.

01:31:42
It's great yeah. I'm actually because that seems like the best thing that could at least communicate between people but I mean, I don't know but you know, like I only know how to program in Python and Batman stuff. I'm not like a. So I be happy to help you with a frame stuff because I lead a coding meet up and we are it's a really about helping people to to make weather sourcode and I'm in addition to a frame.

01:32:09
I'm really excited about there's just a class on three JS it's really great that I'm that I'm taking and then I'm really excited about react 3 fiber because it has mainly because it has it's it's enormously simplified the process of of creating really awesome 3D applications that run on the web, it also can run natively whereas.

01:32:32
A-frame doesn't run natively at the same speed doesn't run at native speed if you run it if you run it in an app. And unfortunately so um so I'm excited about reactor fiber for that reason and also because of the fact that the the pool of react developers as much as is much more massive than in the pool of of a frame or 3ds developers and so that means potentially, you know, I think that all the Facebook and and and Twitter and Netflix all those big companies will they'll create the AR and VR versions of their websites will be the exact same website they have now but they'll be 3d and you'll see them in an AR on your phone with air with your glasses etc, but then we build with racks react 3 fiber in and I think those companies don't really, Like this yet but I I can I can see this trend happening because the because the masses of react developers at Facebook will will realize that they have really the best tool they have for creating VR is is with r3f or reacts to fiber but so react should be something that I look into more than like it other things.

01:33:36
I think that just the sheer scale of the number of reactive developers means that it's going to become the dominant technology, but but but in the short-term, I'm really like, um, you know, maybe I was I would say recommend maybe. Learns 3js because 3ds is at the core of both a-frame and react and if you are a master of 3js then then then what you can do in both react three fiber and an a-frame is gonna be a massive I can help you a lot more with Avery and stuff there's a there's a whole community of people who are who can help with the reactive fiber stuff as well, so as a complete infantile, like I don't even know what 3gs is what where what would be like a good intro.

01:34:22
I mean, I I know like I mean yeah, so I what would be a good place to start so um, so one is you can join my discord which is the XR web comm and that will give you the link that will give you an invitation link to my discord and then to and that's the developer discord for building web XR apps and and we organize meetups around the topic and and there's lots of resources inside the discord to lots of different links to react to fiber to three day as to a-frame and lots of great code.

01:34:57
Examples that show you some of the amazing things you can do with all of these and then finally you could just go to three JS dot org and there's regularly excellent documentation and three-day acid journey you can find on you can go to three days journey just type it into Google and that's a great class it costs it's usually a hundred bucks, but if you wait if you just follow the guy on Twitter and get his notifications eventually he's gonna say okay, it's forty percent off today for the first 20 people or something and then you just get it you get a good discount if you want to discount it, um, but it's only 99 bucks if you don't get discount.

01:35:31
Okay and that's you know that's like way cheaper than the university class and value you're getting from his class is just I think it exceeds many university classes right they might cost a thousand bucks or it exceeds the value of many conferences that cost more than a thousand bucks.

01:35:45
I think so. I had no trouble paying it. I was just like yeah, this is worth it but um three chance would be something to learn kind of first just because that will allow me to put it anywhere yeah that three days of the core and then um, and of course, um, I so I I helped create a co-created EG application.

01:36:06
That was working in a web VR and we used a frame to do it so so you so my code is open source and so you can immediately use that in the same application we're using because it basically it visualizes time series data, like it takes the the um, we collect the the voltage signals from the sensors on the forehead and send them in they they're collected as hex values by the machine and then they're converted into numbers and then they're we run some program to reduce noise and and, There's this there's a server low pass filter is basically for the noise yeah low pass filters, um, I think then there's this is like 2018 so I'm like is it is a?

01:36:55
I get I get a feeling that like we have a lot of not. Like ours like our skills are like just touching but not almost like not overlapping like at the things you're saying right now like oh god, I'm you're probably like I'm gonna go look and it's gonna be so above my head at all the things you're telling me right now what I'm happy to I'm happy like like again like if you if you connect with me in the discord we can go over the code and and and in one of the online cutting meetups with the with the community and and teach everybody at the same time and if you want we could report it and just share with everybody but um or whatever but um, but I but yeah, so these so sick.

01:37:34
I And I I guess we're kind of winding down but I want to see if I can squeeze in a couple more questions so so the signals passed into so just so just so Jeff Hawkins, he was talking about the the fact that the neuro column is is now going to represent, you know, an object in front of you like you're hoping you're holding a bottle and it's going to attract the rotation of the bottle the appearance at the bottle the the sounds that the bottle makes and all the expectations of the properties at the bottle and it's going to sort of creator it's going to start on hold on one second.

01:38:08
I'm having a glitch, okay?

01:38:17
Yeah okay so these speakers were planted the wrong speakers were playing and there was talking over you sorry, okay. I'm listening now sorry about that so so the idea in a thousand branches that are neuro column will well is it every object in the world around you that you're seeing right now is going to be sort of managed by by a different neuro column and so so and there's lots of there's lots of ideas and that's just one of the ideas and some of the ideas are sort of conflicting and and that's why I sort of like there's some good questions.

01:38:47
And um so that so so one of the ideas is that a neuro column is going to manage all the properties of that one bottle and so that you'll you'll have you the manage all of the the orientation of the bottle it's distance from you it's distance from your hand where your fingers are on the bottle with the bottle looks like with his appearances with the bottle sounds like it has anything in it like all these different all these different center streams come in through different parts of your of your sensor apparatus, and then they get they go to the thalamus and then and then and and then they go to you know, Like if you already miss you have not yet formed the percept of the existence of a bottle the at the point of the thalamus it's still in the mode of like edge detectors and like pixels think of it as like pixels are now like a lot are now like it's like at the layer where it's like talking about lines, maybe instead of pixels, it's not there's no cohesive bottle yet that's probably two or three steps up the ladder, okay?

01:39:53
I'm with you on that like you know, but in terms of like, you know, it's taught us it's it's commonly thought you know, the the hierarchical model of learning, you know, the v1 might have lines and edges and and then curves and then and then and then maybe the v2 will have a higher level of shapes right and then v3 what would have shapes and would would you have complex objects with multiple shapes connected to them or something right and then so once you get.

01:40:22
To court those. Being likes highly debatable but at least in thalamus, you know, it's like still at some low level like that but yeah that's that's the idea so so he was talking about how the mass brain the mouse brain is mostly like a level one cortex and so that means that for the mouse most most of it's it's world is just level one cortex even though there's six players it's just, you know, the amount of tissue and level one.

01:40:46
It just dominates and and that so the idea that he was talking about his book a thousand brains is that that we can have entire objects like whole complete objects in just a level one of the cortex and then um, I started thinking about you know, well, you know people um, sometimes say the eyes really part of the brain because there's so there's so many different layers to when to to um, so that's, Developmentally it's it's a.

01:41:18
So like developmentally there's three types of terms it's like ectoderm mesoderm and. Endodontics like the endoderm becomes like your stomach lining the mason terms like in between your skin and your brain so so basically, um, the eyes actually come out of the ectoderm that's not your skin so it cut your eyes developmentally your eyes literally are your brain and then the part of your brain your eyes actually develop from is is the same is the guy and stuff one which is the part that also has contains the thalamus so the so basically when you start describing things in a developmental sense that Um the eye really is brainder the die is just sort of like a it's like a part of the brain that did its own thing, um, yeah, so yeah, it is it is part of the brain right it grew brains from cells that were set aside to be brain cells and it seems like in in ISO, we have these descriptions of you know part one what like we recovered earlier that there's though the recons and and receptors an eye that only track when object moves from left to right or and when object is a certain color and right and so that means that like at the, Eye itself, maybe I'm thinking I don't know if this is what it means, but I'm thinking maybe edge detection and color detection and like the v1 type of activities really happening in the eye itself.

01:42:46
Instead of in the v1. Well truly are you you're you're working the visual system. I don't know how to get you okay, all right, well the retina, um. It's probably at work. No, she's rich is around here, just like the other room we're. Commit well. I'm like, I mean, we're in the same spot but I just oh kind of get it bitch plus nope Julie.

01:43:20
Oh she's got your house like later yeah yeah, that's funny because it's actually also funny to me that I thought of that like like 20 seconds before it made it to to my language before I said it that's also funny. There's like, The invite to speak there this okay there anyways, so like, um, So I don't think there's too much context that reaches the first off the retina gets like basically no input from the brain.

01:43:56
It doesn't get a lot of input. It doesn't get I don't make I mean, maybe some crazy sparks like non-functional like vestigial like one sort of axon gets in there to control the muscle or something but for it basically if the retina doesn't get any information from the thalamus or from the brain and so there's no context.

01:44:16
It's literally just like did this pixel get light flashed on it or not kind of thing. There's there's a little bit more ink going on because like the ones that get like can sort of inhibit the ones next to it. So there is a little bit of computation there, but you definitely don't want to think of it as at like the level of like it it can formulate what an object is at that point.

01:44:37
It's best just it can basically just detect edges at that point. And then in the thalamus, First well the thalamus sort of doesn't thalamus cells sort of don't connect to each other really much at all. So there's not a lot of like. I mean there's modulation that could happen and sort of like ignore this or maybe pay more attention this but there's not a lot of computation happening in terms of decoding what the object is in terms of the thalamus.

01:45:05
So I don't think any of the actual percept is formed until you get to be one. Once you get to v1 there's all sorts of cells that are connected to each other and and connected outward and inward and we're in a circle and just like all sorts of crazy connections that are clearly doing some sort of computation, but at least at the level the retina and then at the level of thalamus things are sort of like one thing.

01:45:30
Connects to I mean I'm going to I'm exaggerating here but like it's almost like one thing connects to one thing connects to one thing and it's just like passing it on a little bit with with some sort of math think of it as like a gross structure modulation. Yeah, but not the it's not decoding much and then and then there's this huge jump right when it gets to view one now it's like really starting to figure out what it is and then be two and now and since the it's actually since nominus is sending it to both those areas at the same time anyway.

01:45:58
Maybe we wanted V2 aren't even the best names for it because V2 gets gets sent stuff directly from the thalamus too. It's just it also get. S sent stuff from V1 so now that you just start everything starts getting connected to everything. So clearly things are getting decoded there but yeah, I definitely wouldn't start thinking that like the information of bottle is held in the retina or in the thalamus.

01:46:20
It's definitely the idea of of bottle I think sticks in the cortex and if if the cortex is making some prediction because the cortex does send a lot of information back to the thalamus, um, I don't know. I I don't know how much the cortex. Predicts like bottle and then sends it back to the thalamus.

01:46:45
But it's it if it is getting sent that way it's definitely not just that because the thalamus is also getting the the the inputs from the outside world. So if the found maybe the thalamus might be matching the actual inputs from the predicted inputs, but that's that's the most I could think of it doing.

01:47:06
Okay so so so you're saying so this is so the signal is trapped so jet hot the hocking's idea was that you have a neural column and it's two ideas one is that a neural column will be managing all the properties of an object with a reference frame, so you'll have part reference frame as like you have part of the the neural signal will be very stable that would be like at a higher level that might be the the v2 and then the this stuff in the v1 which we lower level will be changing rapidly and and so the reference frame idea works like you have like I guess it's I guess it's He's like a relationship between like grid cells and play cells and some of the some of the cells only change a little bit because they're about where you are in the grid and some of them will change rapidly because they're about that the changing context of of the location where where you're at like, what's changing while you're there and so I read so I did my under.

01:48:08
Gone predictive coding yeah in visual cortex and my advisor had me read on intelligence which I think I read like chapters five or six or whatever the chapters were actually describing the structure of feedback connections and predictive coding some familiar with that what's new to me right now, are you talking about is like I mean, I guess yeah, what what what is new beyond that the on intelligence book?

01:48:34
I know you coffee is and now agizing or make making columns sounds similar to some sort of like place cell structure good cell structure, um and you're saying these are columns probably in like if you want or v2 well, so I mean, so so by neuron so neuro column, of course is you know, the 150 neural columns large neuro columns right and and they and they they represent in an everything from from v1 to v6, it's like it's like the entire.

01:49:04
Stack right and so his hit in one of his papers he described how that entire stack of of columns it might be, um, you know is it like a is like a millimeter or centimeter I forget the the neuro column but um, there you have like these like columns these big columns in some sensor areas like 400 microns yeah, but there's these things called and those are only in some places but there's these things called mini columns and they're predicted to be like everywhere and you can kind of just sort of if you squint your eyes just right you can kind of see them in between the blood vessels, um, And so that that idea of these mini columns or micro columns is that that they're like everywhere in the whole brain is like structured into these sort of mini columns and I think that's where you're talking about these fit and they're like 50 microns wide and like yeah, there's a gazillion of them but yeah yeah, so I that basically the one the one of the hypothesis on that is that they're like sort of the functional unit of the brain like the way that the layer, you know layer four cells go to the layer, two three cells and layer, two three cells go into the layer five a cells and those go to the five b and six.

01:50:12
That sort of motif is sort of consistent throughout the brain and. And so they're one thought is that those many columns are the functional unit of the brain right right and yes, so that was Verna there's a hundred about 150 those 150,000 or under 50, no I don't. Think like that.

01:50:35
I think maybe in me yeah, maybe he gave an example of of like if you if I don't know. I don't know that number no. I like this up so there's about a hundred million cortical cortical mini columns in the neocortex.

01:50:57
If the nail. Microns wide and you divide the total surface area by that. I can imagine you're getting about 150 million okay got it and it's also saying that there's that they each have a hundred and ten neurons each giving one million to two million cortical columns. So I'm one I'm like no, I'm like confused what is he talking about like a hundred and fifty thousand?

01:51:23
I'm sort of confused what he was talking. I need to look I need to compare this data but because definitely is a big difference between like a hundred fifty thousand and and and two million cortical columns, but okay. Those things that you just read to me that sounds right like there did you say like a hundred like a thousand neurons per mini column or a hundred fifty nerves per minute or something like that, so a hundred and ten neurons per mini column, okay, yeah that's that's sounds yeah that sounds great okay, so I get what you're talking about you are talking about many columns and yeah, there's a bunch of them like uh a million million or millions over the whole brain got it so that so so subverted mount castle in the in the forties fifties and seventies what was doing.

01:52:13
John Stockton's yeah he was the first person to describe columns he described them in the somatosensory cortex yeah and it's it's always funny that he will advise all got the Nobel prize for columns and visual cortex when Vernon Mount Castle like discovered it first and and he discovered all this other stuff first and it's almost like everyone knows like that guy like discovered so much stuff but he somehow didn't win the novel guys and all these other people did yeah, that's just like this that's very strange huh?

01:52:46
I didn't know this but um, Yeah totally oh man, um, okay so that so the idea is that um, so so that you'll have a single general column well then you know, well have like activity towards the top that is very stable and the inputs at the bottom of the column will be very will be changing a lot and that's because the the column itself is maintaining the either an object or or a word and and at the top and that's the reference frame and the bottom is is the references or the properties of that.

01:53:24
Reference. Into the reference frame can represent an object or or or the idea of an idea right and all the all the connecting all the multi-modal connections to the idea of the idea superficial layers are holding more contextual information about the thing and the deep layers are by deep.

01:53:43
I mean, like lower our our holding more actual information about the thing is everything yes, so the no so did the deeper layers would be like, um would be would be saying that okay this this thought the, Ocean that this space is gonna hold is gonna be the notion of a bottle and then it's almost like it's almost like the it maybe like an entity component system what I don't know if you're if you're familiar with antique chronic systems, but it's like you have like it's like, So I guess that's no one feel good example, but it's it's it's like, um, It's like a way for the brain to track objects um so you have like a space you have like a a bunch of different spaces each column will be a space where a different object is tracked and but that object has a lot of properties in the properties are multi-sensory and like I said, it's like how is how close is the object to you what is the stand like you've got it it's still like what's it look like what's the sound like yeah and and so well what I feel like those are gonna be a different answer so each area might have you know, however many many.

01:55:01
There's the visual area there's the auditory area and so the visual area is just cares about vision the audit auditory area just cares about auditory, but then you have these higher order so once you go past like v1 v2 v3 v4, then you're getting into all these like higher order areas, they're multimodal so they mix ox sound with touch with with vision and so with so this is like in the parietal cortex or like, you know areas or that are known for multimodal integration and so I feel like the context of this conversation might be more applicable if we're saying like, Maybe in the parietal cortex the many columns there are integrating all this information and maybe hold the our holding a concept of of an object and.

01:55:48
Yeah I it's not known I don't think how how these different modalities like touch vision etc get integrated in those areas that well you would know more Rachel are like how they're integrated in those areas do, you know anything I wish but I don't feel like enough to contribute to this beyond the fact that yes there are areas that are definitely responsive to some combination of sensory features, well like more like area, you know, it's it's it's many right many different because language has a visual and and auditory components and they have to come.

01:56:23
Together somewhere right, so maybe. Um we're gonna kiss area. I only know it from like if there's an issue or somebody is working he's aphasia which is damaged to that area. They talk and talk and talk but they don't make sense. So, they'll be like yeah go to the thing and like none of their sentences actually mean anything.

01:56:45
And and so like so they kind of don't know what they're saying whereas broke his area maybe they do know what they're saying, but they can't actually say anything. They just say the same word over and over or something. So, so, The I wouldn't I mean I don't know enough about it to say for sure but I kind of want to say that I wouldn't call those like language integration areas, but I do think they're they're probably they're do exist pre-motor areas that probably do integrate language and maybe they are like we're in the keys are involved in it and maybe there's areas around it also involved in it.

01:57:23
Yeah that probably represent what you're talking about. We're like you're you have some thought on the edge of your tongue and it involves this vision that you have or a sound that you have, you know, like I can imagine that someone. Wear Yeah I mean yeah I just realized that the warnings area it damaged her warnings area could could be disrupting like the oscillations that allow the the coordination of of of many different patterns that affects language most most visit most visibly but it may not have anything to do with integrating language.

01:57:53
Yeah oscillations is a super contentious topic and that's right in the middle that's where my project is dead on and I'll you know, I can there's not a lot known in a definitive sense about what the hell oscillations are doing which is why like I've had old advisors be like, Don't do it don't go in that field that feels been studied for 30 years and it's still like nobody knows for sure anything but but yeah, there's a lot of theories about oscillations.

01:58:19
That's for sure. Just not a lot of consensus yet. Okay so then so so in terms of how information travel like my whole my whole quite a question journey was like about how information travels with the brain. So then it comes in through the v1 and it comes in through the you know, the the the a1 or the audio cortex one and in this and the this touch stuff comes in through the somatosensory cortex trait.

01:58:48
Yeah, yeah v1 and a1 and s1 the yep that's the primary cortisone and then um, and and then what happens is at some point which you see here in touch come. Together and and not exactly sure what where they come together but but maybe the where they come together is have to look that up and unless you know, but but where they somewhere like the parietal cortex or the posterior parietal cortex.

01:59:17
Yes, but in general just you just refer to it as multimodal areas and just leave it as unknown. Pride and postpril or just multimodal areas. Yeah, and that way you don't have to be specific. Yeah, multiple areas really the keyword. So is it possible that that there's any traffic backwards to to the original the the primary?

01:59:47
Yeah, there's probably recursive like feedback. Yeah, there's tons of it. There's probably even more of it than there's before. It's just like, Yeah there there's almost no place where there isn't. There's also like these dual pathways going through the thalamus so like you think of the traditional kind of hierarchy going through the cortex where you have like, okay the eye to the LGN the first order visual nucleus and then primary visual cortex and then that's going to secondary visual cortex, let's say and then onwards from there.

02:00:22
But then you also have like these complementary loops through the thalamus where it's going from primary visual cortex to like just hire order part of the thalamus called the pulvinar and then that's also going to v2 so it's like for every cortical. Kind of hierarchical jump you also have these mmm, like parallel pathways through the thalamus yeah your friends copies.

02:00:44
Um, okay, so then um, I wanted to talk about okay, so so when you said that there's more um, feedback than feed forward, we talking about horizontal feedback. There's all sorts so like so v1 has all these projections to v2 but then v2 has a bunch of projections back to feed one or back to v1 and sometimes they'll be more in number but like maybe each one will be weaker, you know what it means so you can't so more is a very loose term there because it's like yeah, there's more axons, but they make weaker connections so in a functional sense, you know, maybe they're weaker, maybe they're about the same but yeah, they're basically there's just think of it as loops everything.

02:01:29
It's just like nested loops. I think is the best way to think about. It Okay so so then I would I was reading about you know the proposal for short-term short-term memory recent paper here saying that you know, they were saying that in there, I think I may have you may have heard me explain this but there that they were saying that a neuron could might it's activity might last for for 10 milliseconds, it's total activity.

02:01:54
I guess is what you've be clarified earlier, but then if a neuron could talk to another neuron it could remind they could remind each other and and so a neuroscircuit could carry a memory longer than a single neuron could. If the if the the the loops between you know neurons and in clusters or micro circuits or micro so the questions registered yes, so like basically if there's loops of individual neurons or small sets of neurons, they'll be able to maintain activity between each other and oftentimes that activity will will result in some sort of oscillatory thing that you can read out on like a EEG electrode and you'll see like an oscillation and stuff.

02:02:35
Are you familiar with that study? Do you know if when they when they were talking about like, Um, Micro neuro circuits where they talk about micro columns is that sort of like different or is. Micro circuits. Okay so micro columns is not a term that everyone uses but it it's it's that term you're talking about and micro circuits describes a a type of neuroscience, so it's basically just describing a scale so like if you're talking about EEG, you're getting you're sticking a probe down in there and you're getting a readout of like the net of like a hundred thousand neurons right if you're getting an LFP recording you stick that probe down there and you're getting like a readout of like the nearest maybe three hundred neurons around that LFP recording.

02:03:26
And then you know an image imaging you can zoom it, you know, you can image like the whole on a gross scale or you can zoom in and actually see individual cells and I think micro circuit neuroscience basically just describes getting really in there and looking at the the interactivity of individual cells and cell types whereas, you know, a more gross level neuroscience would be like yeah, we scanned the brain and v1 lit up and v2 lit up and v3 lit up which says nothing about the individual cells in that area.

02:04:01
Okay and do you know so um, I read something that the the micro circus or the clusters or the micro columns were in in the mouse where we're arranged in it, oh we're spaced out in a hexagonal pattern. Does that make the desiring about? All right talking about grid cells which are placed in a triangular pattern, ah.

02:04:27
So so I so I guess I'm not because this is referring to the the amount I believe this was referring to the mouse neocortex and but it really made me think of grid cells because they're describing heck. I have to maybe have to dig up the paper send it to you after after this but there I was wondering if if if the hexagonal pattern of so you've got clumps of cells and I am in there, they're calling them neural circuits, but it sounds to me like you're describing these they they they take the shape of clusters and I thought they're describing micro columns, they're not using mother language with micro columns and Then someone else is saying that these micro columns are arranged in and hexagonal patterns and now I'm thinking about grid cells in the new cortex of the mouse and so this is all like this this is this is actually two different papers and maybe I'll send them to you later but but have you heard anything about this or maybe I'm just,

02:05:25
Looking at a paper. About it but it's not something I'm familiar with it like sounding familiar when you mentioned it but not enough for me to comment on it, it's amazing, please do send those. Well. Sorry, please do send those papers but you're thinking of all right so often those later and then maybe we can have another conversation, um, yeah and then um, I I wanted to ask them so so what about um, so information also travels we've talked about traveling, you know, vertically and and up and down and horizontally from the primary to to the to the other areas of cortex and back and then um, what about going up from from from the bottom to the, Up and then back to the thalamus.
02:06:13
Can you describe that pathway?
02:06:18
I think that's the pathway we studied talking about the philanthropic loops. Yeah, so yeah, so I'm just so have we already covered that so what I'm saying is like, so if I come from thousands to the to V1 and then goes up to V6 and then from V6 back to the thalamus is that right?
02:06:36
No think of it like this, so it goes from thalamus to V1 to V2 to V3 to be forged to be five etcetera, right? Except it's not just that V5 or V6 goes back to thalamus V1 goes back to thalamus V2 goes back to thalamus V3 goes back to thalamus before.
02:06:53
So, they all go back to thalamus and it's a nested loop like that. Oh there okay okay so they're all they're on their own loop Yeah so so it's really interesting to sort of think of the brain in terms of loops because we were talking about the the the neuroscientist who was on clubhouse was was studying the the rhythms of the brain in the brainstem.
02:07:13
He was used he he drew out this picture. I don't know if you were there for that top for his talk, but yeah, yeah Mike David or something. Yeah, that's the same and and so he so he he drew out this he said this is how I imagined this works that there's there's a bunch of arrows and there and the arrows are all arranged in a You know they're all spaced apart from each other and they're all pointing different directions and if they point inwards and that means that that it's if it's able to the it's able to retain it's it's it's shape and if they all start pointing out words and then it falls apart and the organism dies because it's it stops breathing and the the arrows the direction of the arrows is represented by a synaptic activity and in the in a represent, you know, like if you inject the mouse with with an opioid or or I think an an opiates opioid simulator some other drug.
02:08:07
That does the accomplish is the same effect but basically it causes the the synapse to malfunction then they're not able to make the mouse is not able to maintain it's it's equilibrium at the brainstem and then it sort of like loses control and then but then but I you know, I type it in the Google it does like I just typed that exactly what he said and I looked at it at the field of arrows and and and this is it was like this is exactly what it's it's a sort of description of a dipole of an electrical dipole and so it's.
02:08:42
That's so amazing it's like this is a description of a dipole and so here we have like the whole brain and you know is you know has dipole activity and there's that is like a dipole inside the brainstem maybe in terms of like his description and then we've got all these loops and we've got small loops and loops inside other loops and it's like this and this, um, this fractal of loops and and and maybe a fractal dipoles and it's just so so interesting and I don't know if we should leave it there for for tonight, but then, Yeah totally and and I'll also these these are neurons are being held at a specific voltage because they're holding a net negative charge and then the so that means the exercise they're spaces net, you know to the neuron is 60 millivolts more than them and so each of these neurons kind of are like in a way a pole and then whenever there's current well, I guess once there's current traveling through them, then you have these poles and then they and since all these neurons are a little all the at least excitatory neurons which are most.
02:09:51
Of them they're aligned in the same direction so so these poles sort of summate and that's how you get these readouts from the EEG which is on top of the skull you can think of it as like miles away from all the neurons that you have this giant skull separating them, but you're still being able to read out this electrical signal because everything is aligned, you know with each other so these these poles are sort of summating.
02:10:17
Wow. Um, and um,
02:10:27
Is okay so what so this is definitely a lot more to talk about in the future but at some point we've got to we're gonna say that's that's enough for one day, okay, yeah I'd love you about like other stuff anytime yeah follow me back. I don't think I have a picture on my Twitter but yeah, I'm I'm the only Scott prop maybe that followed you yesterday or two days ago classified is it on your profile let me see if I can find oh, so it's not so me that's why I couldn't find you because it wasn't on your your um, yeah yeah, it's not on my stuff, okay, let me look at.
02:11:02
That where and I'll see if I can find so yeah, you're probably just follow Julia first and then I'll I'm on her small group of follows, oh okay, let me make sure I'm following Julia as a few profiles. I haven't looked in in a while so I haven't followed yet but I will oh let me see if I can see followers followers now.
02:11:26
I need to look at following. Um, but I Scott here's followed by Scott's so Scott follows you okay? I am as a Scott S USA, you're actually um, one of the people that I receive a hundred percent of all the notifications from so I like don't ever post anything on there, but yeah, yeah.
02:11:56
I'm guaranteed to see it well awesome.
02:12:03
Because we're talking about narrowing and I was like kind of making the argument that they're a little heavy on the engineering side and not caring as much about the neuroscience as has possible yeah. I know they care about some but like there was an article. I felt like expressed it well that I wanted to share with you but I'm definitely gonna look up the those podcasts that you did, oh yeah and if you if you send me anything yeah, there was a couple things you said that'd be easier to send me.
02:12:30
You should totally send direct message me on on Twitter, whatever that stuff sounds good, um, all right. Cool, all right, all right have a good night yeah, thank you bye, thank you, right?
