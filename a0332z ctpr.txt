Sync Chapter 10 Notes
"inner sight through decoherence patterns with synchronized phase patterns"
At each interval of time, when my head position & orientation is in a certain position for example, there is a temporally active sequence of phase patterns in a phase field distributed spatially that render on frame of internal representations that pattern making sensor arrays see and transform into a new pattern for another pattern making sensor array to see and transform in a virtuos cycle, this cascade of brain activity is the rendering of an internal sense of reality, that is perceived no differently from how the brain detects external reality. The brain is breaking down & reconstructing patterns from reality that other parts of the brain take turns reacting to, and turns detecting. Seeing & reacting.

Each firefly contains an oscillator, sync occurs through mutual cuing, each one is continually sending and receiving signals, shifting the rhythms of others, dissipating the energy of the signal over time until all the fireflies are firing in lockstep. The same process occurs with lifeless oscillators. The rotation of the moon for example is in sync with the movement of the earth. The electromagnetic fields of the earth & moon are knocking on one another, and that is enough, to even without gravitational particles, cause the orbits & the rotations of the planets to synchronize.

Sync: Charlie Peskin in 1975 
on the hearts natural pacemaker cells, 

how do cells come to a decision to coordinate without a central coordinator, or leader or outside instruction come into synchronization?

decentralized coordination
when an oscillator fires it kicks the voltage of all the others up

a single firing synchronizes effects for some oscillating neurons (LTP) and desynchronizes effects for other neurons (LTD).
