(array, layers, cortex)
Nov 7, 2021
am I dreaming all these great break throughts in neuroscience ai reality

is reality a dream

excited macroscopic electromagnetic vibrational, and chemical waves from the hippocampal enthorhinal loop will like the suns corona blast out from the center towards the ends of the brain where parts of the neo cortex esp the 5th and 6th layers are going to collect this in an analogy similar to the retina collecting images, 

I want to joke on social media that this part was a real stretch

but its just a fractal idea for how the center of the brain can be like the light or the lens of the eye and the neocortex as a sensory array that is similar to the retina in function and proportion relative to the lens.

In a sense I am continuing my grandfathers work, GPS time dilation

I thought of Kylo Ren saying that he would finish his grandfather's work

but then Kylo Ren changed
he committed Satori in one sense because of a signal sent by his mother
