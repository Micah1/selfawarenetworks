  43: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

  21: If we triggered enough of just the sodium receptors, without triggering all the receptors, and we triggered them fast enough, we might get enough sodium in to create a phasic or a high phasic action potential burst.

  28: When the soma bursts triggering a phasic or high phasic action potential event, the energy it sends from X to Y balances out the neurons's charge distribution topographically. From a polarized displacement of charges from the rate of change of X exceeding the rate of change in Y, the neuron becomes depolarized.

  151  # The Tonic Mind
  152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

  93: the phasic firing produces the light that shines through the film of the synaptic pattern, magnifying its particular pattern in attention by inhibiting variations of the memory pattern that are similar, but when firing happens faster than the ionic gradient can reset that could result in a phase increase or decrease with each subsequent interval for that pattern

  11: to itself the brain renders it's own phasic burst firing patterns as deviations from its tonic firing as well as this the rendering is also accomplished by the inhibition of parts of the brain, in alignment with attention-schema theory but specifically in the context of a 4 dimensional brain grid & electro-magnetic phase change graph.

  25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

  16  
  17: I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia

  9: I imagine that my inner voice is a moving soliton wave patterns firing phasically inside my corticol column oscillators, like a stream of lights lighting up, or when a jet flies low and release a stream of particles in the air leaving a trail, this pattern travels through my brain and each new neuron that fires is playing a different audible electric tone, each one represents a different part of my inner voice, as I model my thinking to myself in conscious way, modulating my internal dialog with the english language.

  17: With each large phasic charge dissipativing the surrounding area a pattern is selected by the brain, and magnified by the brain to the next area to look at, so its like each area is helping to decode, encode, resolve some part of a pattern, so that each layer is noticing another part of the feature, at another scale.

  17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations

  21: "and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)

  43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

  21: The higher frequency phasic firing neurons then inscribe the contents of the mind, that the mind is aware of, they formulate from everything you see, taste, hear, smell, touch, they are the words in your mind, the songs in your soul, the hallucinations of people touching you when no one is around after a night of drinking Absinthe.
  22  
  23: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

   2: # The Phasic Tonic Relationship
   3  

   7  ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
   8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.
   9  
  10: The high phasic burst could potentially slow down the firing of many of its exit terminal neighbors by inhibiting them with a flood of extra neurotransmitters.
  11  
  12: And the slowing effect would have a higher spatial magnitude than the smaller but faster phasic bursts.
  13  
  14: Phasic burst might be characterized as being higher frequency but also causing a greater magnitude distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters.
  15  
  16: The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.
  17  
  18: Perhaps the phasic & high phasic signals, at least as soliton waves across the electromagnetic spectrium, might have a longer range, they would travel across longer distances of the network before eventually being dissipated by the rest of the oscillating groups of cells.
  19  
  20: The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.
  21  
  22: As if the relationship between the phasic signals and the tonic signals was like an Etch in Sketch toy, the magnetic pin is etching with phasic burstlets, and shaking the toy is dissipating the learned signal back into an equilibrium state or an empty slate. That's kind of a rough analogy.
  23  
  24: It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits. I think there is research to back this up, if I remember correctly, so search for citations to bolster this.
  25  
  26: Recapping the Phasic Tonic Relationship, the high phasic spike, creates a burstlet, that creates an inhibitory wave (a sharp wave ripple across the brain) that starts with it's direct exit terminal array, the phasic spikes are dissipated into the tonic oscillation, so there is a relationship between the tonic brainwave pattern (like the theta brainwave pattern) and the incoming sensory pathways.
  27  
  28: I think this paper below describes one example of how that relationship between phasic spikes from incoming senses, from the eyes, interfaces with an organisms actions, the steps that it takes, to navigate.

  39  "Nigral dopamine neurons are transiently activated by high frequency glutamatergic inputs relaying reward-predicting sensory information. The tonic firing pattern of dopamine cells responds to these inputs with a transient burst of spikes that requires NMDA receptors. Here, we show that NMDA receptor activation further excites the cell by recruiting a calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) capable of generating a plateau potential."
  40: "An animal's behaviour is altered by the temporal pattern of DA release, and it has been proposed that tonic dopamine levels provide a general motivating function while phasic DA permits the corticostriatal plasticity necessary for habit learning (Reynolds & Wickens, 2000; Wise, 2004; Niv et al. 2007)."
  41  "Thus, burst firing may encode a ‘reward’ signal during normal reinforcement learning and also pathological addictions (Mirenowicz & Schultz, 1996; Phillips et al. 2003)."

  48  
  49: My argument is that the rendering output that makes up our internal representations, and our mind, is in the phase variations between the normal tonic oscillating pattern, and the phasic bursts that alter that tonic pattern. The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.

  59  
  60: Perhaps I can think of pace setter potentials as tonic firing, plateau potential as phasic firing, and action potentials as high phasic firing?
  61  

  68  
  69: Now you throw in some patterns like inhibitions, phase plateau potentials, and high phasic spike potentials and well you have more complex patterns being embedded into the biological structure of your brain.

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

   4  Simultaneous Observing / Encoding Oscillators 
   5: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.

Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative. The neuron understands how many little dots were needed from which direction before it became overwhelmed and had to fire, there is a literal three dimensional chemical counting process going on with a dendrite collecting charged ions in various branches, or the soma collecting charges (from soma branches with the pyramidal cell) increasing or decreasing its likelihood to fire or its readiness to fire (turning the volume up or now on its readiness to recognize certain patterns (or recall certain events or people or names, do you ever play tetris for hours and then see tetris shapes when you close your eyes, imagine that your cells that are recognizing shapes have their readiness to recognize those kinds of patterns turned up.)

  12: So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establishes a recurring oscilllation that allows long term memories to form.

  59: Any of the sensor modalities can compete for amplification in a desynchronized brain, but in a synchronized brain what happens when the layers correct their own internal pattern representations overtime, with lower energy pattern representations that preserve the transformation & development and set expansion in time of the phase field phasically firing parts of the grid pattern that includes each interval of time which expands or enlarges the entire pattern of one set in another set. The scale/frequency ranges up scale patterns up, and the brain also scales patterns down thanks to sparse signalling over greater distances, this kind of signalling might be good for balance. But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

  4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.

  10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

   6: I want to say that if each action potential event creates a phasic pattern, and that a sequence of phasic spikes, high phasic spikes, tonic spikes, and inhibited spikes will produce something like a non-linear sequence that could alternatively be considered to be a dynamic linear sequence if we are just considering the sum of the brain's state at something like millisecond intervals of time. It's a dynamic linear sequence temporally in terms of the activations in the brain's 3D graph of neural arrays. The phase change at each synaptic cleft is imagined to have the significance of a temporal tensor in 3D space. We could compare the phase states at each interval or frame of time as components of a Taylor Series, like the phase changes are imagined as Polynomial Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor Series.

  85: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

  21: The reason I can argue this is because a neuron only understands phases, because to the neuron that's what it's receiving from the many synapses on its many dendritic arms connected to many cells, its receiving bursts, mini-vibrations, or phase patterns from other neurons that indicate they burst at a fast but light phasic rate, fired at a slower tonic rate that delivered a stronger pulse, a 3rd setting inbetween, or that they went silent from inhibition instead of the other modes. The neural oscillator rotates its neurons between these three different modes.

   4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

  17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

  78: The article that I linked above on "Universal Approximation Theorem" talks about Taylor Series Polynomial Functions having a sort of granularity limitation on pattern representation. So I thought maybe the action potential high phasic firing sequence, which sets off waves of inhibitory low phasic firing sequences, could be construed as a sort of Taylor Series calculation for modifying the curve of a learned vector pattern, represented by a phase change, and modified by subsequent phases changes in other Action potential events. So that as information travels through the nervous system, at each step, as a signal passes from one neuron to the next, the estimated representation of that pattern grows quantitatively, towards what could be some approximation of an infinite curve at a certain point, if it goes on long enough.

A new synaptic pathway is formed that represents the new learned pattern, these are new connections between dendrites and the synapses of other cells, interneuron gates and synapses for micro vesicle sacks and neurotransmitters to fly through

  232: NAPOT Theory suggests that high phasic spiking inhibits the exit terminal array delaying an oscillating group relative to the larger oscillating group. IN other words Delayed Expression of the exit terminal of the activated neuron sets the new timing of the inhibited group by the decay rate of the fired action potential in the previous array. The tonic oscillation absorbs the burstlet, distributes it, and creates a synchronization pattern that dissipates the impact of the signal that group of neurons has received. Resulting in the temporal binding of your learned internal representations that are displayed to subsequent arrays that also embody learned internal representations.

Simply stimulating neurons with electricity will not create phasic bursts. This means that top down information drives neural activity, so it is not just bottom up physical causation, its top down criteria causation.

  46  Information Theory & DNA
  47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.
  48  Right so each receptor on a cell might be unique, which means a unique information containing structure, or a protein, acts as a 3D shape that performs a detection function, a sodium receptor detects for example sodium ions that are allowed to pass through the sodium receptor.

  125: So, all of the other timing (of the nearby inhibited neurons) is bumped in a way (the phase rate of the group of inhibited neurons is set by the decay rate of the neuron that fired phasically, in otherwords the duration of the action potential leaves the calcium gates open for a novel duration which causes between 0-3 vesicle sacks to release neurotransmitters which changes the timing of the larger group of nearby inhibited neurons which magnifies that memory to the oscillating group, and then to the rest of the oscillations in the brain because eventually that oscillating groups entire phase is slightly altered, which pulls on the rest of the oscillators in the brain eventually.

And in the first layer of cortex in the nearthe thalamus near the bottom of the syllabus, are the incoming services, and you're gonna have a lot of ways down there.

  49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

   21: And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.

   31: Compare that to the link above about how the Hippocampus orchestrates memory consolidation with sharp wave ripples, that I argue represent high phasic bursts, that inhibit local neurons, creating inhibitory waves that magnify the memory that neuron represents via it's connections, and then put that idea into a container and compare it to Jeff Hawkin's description of the neo cortex being self similar everywhere, and the description of the hippocampus as like a special cortical column and you can extrapolate the idea that high speed phasic bursts in the hippocampus between layers CA2 & CA1 are happening also in the neocortex, and everywhere in the brain.
   32  

  140  
  141: An oscillating neuron is going to like repeat it's signal, but if it doesn't. so if there's like a high phasic signal, like I recognize a pattern that's going to fire, right?
  142  

  144  
  145: But then the recognition of that pattern is going to fire again and it's going to loop. So that phase sequence is going to gradually loop in time and gradually fade out. That would be (essentially the same process) for anything that you can think of. Like if you are looking at something, the pattern of what you're looking at, very intensely is going to be like this high phasic (sequence of) bursts of spiking activity, interspersed with inhibitory waves.
  146  

  327  
  328: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

Patterns can be driven by a combination of bottom up, meso scale oscillatory configurations and macroscale multi-region networking configurations of oscillators, with one your focused on being represented from the small scale, to the medial, and macro scales, like a telescope making scale invariant tempo-spatial analogies of frequency data possible between domains. The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.

  72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.

  80: ⟪ 400 characters skipped ⟫ove memory is to increase excited cortical activity in the tonic theta pattern "increase cortical excitability." which is a mistake, my theory is that the theta tonic oscillation absorbs & dissipates phasic spikes, (such as coming from sensory pathways) and synchrony is how the oscillating group acts as a collective knowledge sensor/learner. It's plausible that memory failure might come from a few factors such as flooded neurotransmitters (with oxidative stress, inflammation, antigens) and metabolic issues that may stem from diseased mitochondria, lack of oxygen, lack of ATP (from malnutrition), injury, viral attacks, bacterial attacks, diseases like cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, and so on.

The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative. The neuron understands how many little dots were needed from which direction before it became overwhelmed and had to fire, there is a literal three dimensional chemical counting process going on with a dendrite collecting charged ions in various branches, or the soma collecting charges (from soma branches with the pyramidal cell) increasing or decreasing its likelihood to fire or its readiness to fire (turning the volume up or now on its readiness to recognize certain patterns (or recall certain events or people or names, do you ever play tetris for hours and then see tetris shapes when you close your eyes, imagine that your cells that are recognizing shapes have their readiness to recognize those kinds of patte

    29:   34: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

   132     70: 11. The maximum frequency of space is equal to the maximum oscillation, where they become each other. A single oscillation, that splits into two, then four, then eight, and it doubles for infinitity and then back to maximum, like a finite state oscillator pendulem of spacetime

   198    2: (soliton, oscillat, graph, observer, vector)
   199:   5: I imagine that my inner voice is a moving soliton wave patterns firing phasically inside my corticol column oscillators, like a stream of lights lighting up, or when a jet flies low and release a stream of particles in the air leaving a trail, this pattern travels through my brain and each new neuron that fires is playing a different audible electric tone, each one represents a different part of my inner voice, as I model my thinking to myself in conscious way, modulating my internal dialog with the english language.

   246    13: A dissipative system, like a cell, a brain, a galaxy or an atom is absorbing energy to maintain its oscillation.
   247:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
   248:   21: "and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)
   249    23: A disspating vortex is closer to a resonator, which could be described as a transient or decaying oscillator. (I guess in that sense the clapping of a crowd of people, or the light from a group of fireflies can be imagined as a dissipative oscillator, or resonator that will need to rest eventually.)

   287     2: (oscillat, graph, criteria, causation, cortex) virtual patterns in the brain
   288:    6: what does an object in your mind need to be distinct from? why do we need an oscillation for a temporal, spatial, phasic sequence of deviations to deviate from? 
   289    10: So that is why I argue, that the tonic oscillations of the brain are creating the bedrock of the mind, the canvas of consciousness, the ground of being, the beginning of the detection of inner self space for the sentient self aware being to consider and reflect, the mechanical & computational chamber of ephinomenal consciousness in the robotic like human mind.
   290:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

   318     4: Simultaneous Observing / Encoding Oscillators 
   319:    5: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.
   320     7: This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing

   351    2: (oscillat, array)
   352:   5: The way Richard Feynman pronounces words when he speaks in the Feynman lectures: it's as if each major point in his rhetoric was a powerful particle collision in his mind. What if particle collisions in our brains are infact activated soliton wave collisions in the brain. The waves from phasic firing neural paths intersecting with oscillating edge communities.
   353  

   494     2: (cortex, perception, oscillat, field, array, graph, dendrite, synap)
   495:   10: So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establish
   496    12: One idea is that if neurons end up firing together, they will absorb each other, and from then onwards, unless their pattern is disrupted by other neurons, they will tend to fire together, like a repeating oscillation, so that even if they become disconnected they can maintain the appearance of cooperating as the same pattern at a distance, we see this with patterns in the left and right visual cortex that fire in synch with one another at great distances. Besides interneurons, these distance coupled oscillators are sending and receiving patterns with decoupled oscillators that have different scale and different speed, so patterns can be transferred from one oscillator to another, and a change in one distant oscillator would be felt by the other distant oscillator because the change would result in a change to the oscillators inbetween them. Every oscillator in the brain is an array that can sense the output of other oscillators in addition to tracking neural circuit firing within itself. This makes the whole brain aware of many different patterns each represented in different locations by different oscillators, sort of like a distributed graph of internal representations that make up the representations of everything you can sense and be aware of in your reality.

   500     17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
   501:    46: Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.
   502     58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   503     67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.
   504:    73: The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015
   505     79: Today I have been imaging my conscious rendering of the world as actually riding on top of circle patterns that symbolically represent to me that my inner representations of reality are based on cyclic oscillations, 

   552    2: (oscillat, field, synap) Oscillator level awareness
   553:   4: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.
   554    6: This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing

   563: ⟪ 259 characters skipped ⟫decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
   564     6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

   571     2: (category, theory, LTD, oscillat, dendrite, decoherence, vector)
   572:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.
   573    36: I like to think of the oscillator as an Expert Data Structure (Instead of an advanced data structure) because its creating its own paper for which it can measure incoming signals against as deviations, allowing the system to collaborate as knowledge gaining system, mapping a dimension or a movie frame of consciousness.

   577     2: (LTD, oscillat, field, array, dissipation, tomography, decoherence, emotion, qualia) Sync:
   578:    7: Neural Functional Isomorphic Tomography through Sequences of Oscillating Arrays of tonically synching with Resonating high frequency Phasic Signal Energy Dissipation, triggering large scale inhibitor patterns, that all the tonically firing neurons notice because their growth rate has been slowed in phase relative to other neurons that are firing in that same interval that they were inhibited, this includes decoherene patterns created by neurons that alternately oscillating in a splay state that decoheres the space between these neurons, dendritic spines fall apart, and the energy that was going to them is at the same time shift to a point in the configuration space of the neurons cell membrane that intersects with another neurons simultaneous firing somewhere else in the brain resulting in the growth of dendritic spines from that point in the cells membrane, the transformation efficiency function via scultping spacetime with decoherence patterns and the changes to spacetime are read by other layers of oscillating arrays in the brain which then repeat the cycle.
   579:   10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.
   580    14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.

   592     74: points back to the work of Steven Strogatz, György Buzsáki, and others on oscillations & sync (in physics & neurophysics)
   593:    75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
   594     78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks

   625    28: a pebble in a bond produces concentric waves, earth's oscillation creates a similar spherical concentric waves in space, absorbing electrons and spitting protons, the protons become fermionic condensation creating lanes
   626:   57: the phasic pattern represents the beam of light going through the holographic paper, the routing of the phasic signals through the tonic oscillations activates certain rendered perspectives, which are magnified by the oscillation array to other oscillation arrays, oscillating arrays play back perspectives on data in temporal-sequence patterns
   627  

   733    11: the oscillation between a positive oscillation and a negative oscillation
   734:   13: what I am seeing are the changes between tonic firing neural oscillations, and phasic fast unstable firing patterns
   735    31: The brain selects a mostly guassian distribution pattern of energy to have the most stable brain oscillations most of the time, the brains delicate oscillations have the ability to turn the brains oscillations into renderings that are equal to version of the human experience of reality.

   756     56: The memory that comes around comes around again if you want it. If you forget a cool memory, know that your memories oscillate and you might remember it again if you wait for it, and you might construct it into an even more awesome idea down the road.
   757:    73: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   758     75: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.

   763     98: so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator) 
   764:   100: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike
   765    117: I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.

   808    19: At the neuronal level you don't know anything, a neuron is an oscillator & dissipative system with a threshold for maintaining its electro-magnetic equilibrium, it has to regularly discharge a burst of energy to its surrounding environment, to offset the charged ions its receiving from other neurons that are pushing it towards its action potential event. A neuron is alternately is a resonator or decaying oscillator.
   809:   21: ⟪ 298 characters skipped ⟫at a fast but light phasic rate, fired at a slower tonic rate that delivered a stronger pulse, a 3rd setting inbetween, or that they went silent from inhibition instead of the other modes. The neural oscillator rotates its neurons between these three different modes.
   810  

   851    43: My conjecture is that the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern, embodied for example by Theta Waves (or other power band frequences) represents the short term memory structure that binds with incoming sensory inputs via the principles of oscillatory physics (that could be simulated in a game engine or with webxr)
   852:   49: The sensor detection of patterns is at the location of the dendrite, and inner display of patterns is the exit terminal transmission (perceived by the next dendrite). Patterns in the mind are learned by cell assemblies, cortical columns, stored in synaptic connections long term, exist in the tonic oscillation pattern short term, they are evoked by phase changes (correlated with phasic & high phasic action potentials & inhibited firing). 
   853    64: My brain is essentially comparing memorized numerical operations to predict the right answer, and the right answer is stimulating the oscillatory activity in my brain to produce the right result in terms of motor actions taken and words typed.

   856    2: (oscillat)
   857:   7: the neurons "phasic" mode is indicated by a faster firing rate, so the frequency of its electro-magnetic pulsations, both its physical expansion, creating a tremor like soliton magnetic wave, and an electric frequency variation that differs from the main oscillator, but then is pulled back into tonic pattern alignment with the rest of the oscillator, like two oscillators merging.

   863    11: I think that each one of us is like the creator of his or her own universe, and we are meeting as different people because god was bored of being just a single solo entity, like the first atom that randomly emerged from spacetime oscillations between having a location and having a velocity.

   867     2: (oscillat, field, cortex, vector)

   869    32: the idea that a fast clock and time division would work best but faster oscillators were added to slower oscillators, because of how evolution happened

   876    2: (oscillat) Phases not spikes.
   877:   3: Mark Humphries the author of The Spike insists that most spikes do nothing. In my hypothesis every spike does something, because a neural oscillator ensemble is observing phase changes at multiple scales in individual neurons which is the compiled result of all phasic spikes relative to the oscillators tonic firing pattern.
   878  

   911     2: (oscillat, cortex) When I said I felt like I have had a kundalini awakening through pain (broken arm Sept 2021) I meant that in a literal sense I senses my own mind as a vast infinite lake with pain rippling across the surface of this self-aware lake.
   912:   14: but the slow rate dipole oscillations of EEG would not give you this 240hz Phasic Firing Pattern, nor would it give you the image resolution of a single neuron firing.
   913  

   915    2: (synap, oscillat, dendrite)
   916:   8: The wave pattern is a deviation from the tonic beat pattern of a group of neurons oscillating, and the entire group notices because its a novel event outside their tonic expectations, so the pattern that they are oscillating changes, but then the pattern representing phasic/hi freq/ low amp pattern. A new synaptic pathway is formed that represents the new learned pattern, these are new connections between dendrites and the synapses of other cells, interneuron gates and synapses for micro vesicle sacks and neurotransmitters to fly through
   917  

   944     5: then oscillations
   945:   16: I mean the brain's oscillations are canvas's for phasic neural circuit firing, except the canvas is temporally observing and collectively learning the synapse, dendrite, neuron, and neural circuit firing.
   946    33: they are helping the oscillator to have a pattern that the oscillator can observe, learn, update, combine and integrate with other patterns

   997    2: (oscillat) from a valid perspective self is a memory, and a prediction.
   998:   4: from another perspective its a rendered information pattern, with phasic spikes contrasting against the tonic oscillation, with small differences between the frequencies patterns representing expectations, shaping your chill perception, and high phasic spikes representing startling new information that attracts your attention.
   999  

  1114    17: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter
  1115:   44: the synaptic connection state is represented in the oscillation state which represents the item when it's being predicted tonically to represent the expectation net that receives the incoming phasic.
  1116    45: the attractor state representing the item andor the color red on the item is oscillating in memory with a neural circuit firing pattern, but other signals from other items and colors threat to disrupt and or change that item in memory, perhaps changing its color for example.

  1190  a0617z.md:
  1191:   3: imagine that each new neuron phasic spike is like an intruding signal from another land, distinguished because of its high firing pattern disturbance rate relative to the home field tonic oscillation which might be confused as theta noise.
  1192  

  1197    25: so we can imagine that a small cube and a big cube are both a cube in terms of the shape of the cube being its spatial fractal (repeating) voxel-like (scale invariant) virtual (a location invariant pattern (oscillators learn it so any group of neurons can play it back), and a time invariant pattern (and I tell you brother the same thing happened last month and the month before that)

  1216  

  1316  b0036y.md:
  1317:   11: I think of the unconscious as the tonic brainwave oscillations (inhibitory waves) that results from the conscious which I think of as the high phasic firing (of action potential sequences that trigger inhibitory wave pattern changes to the tonic oscillations).
  1318  

  1463    46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  1465  

  1469  b0067y.md:
  1470:    21: And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.
  1471     34: You can also think of the oscillating group of neurons as sort of like allowing the emergence of higher level receptive (dendrite)/inceptive field (exit terminal), that is like a shared computation. It allows it allows the bugs to basically have collective mind that is not really a mind, so much as it's a collective sensor that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so, each of them can help create this sort of collective sensor.

  1478    139: Whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their energy across other neurons (oscillators).
  1479:   141: An oscillating neuron is going to like repeat it's signal, but if it doesn't. so if there's like a high phasic signal, like I recognize a pattern that's going to fire, right?
  1480    169: They're going to sort of cease to exist. But what happens though is that the short-term oscillations. They're going to change this synaptic connections. They're going to cause synaptic connections to grow towards them, and they're going to grow towards other neurons that fired fast fast.

  1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  1585    101: And so it's possible that they have become linked through the that's even through the literal oscillation or the function or the indirect oscillation. These sort of like absorb each others. Oscillation they're oscillating is one unit. Why are there filaments and spines and synapses growing between them to like even if they're like benefits?
  1586:   117: Yes. Okay so yeah so I didn't. Okay so I'm recording. So they're fine. So they're firing at a phasic break so this is their firing much faster than the rest of the oscillation so they are both the source of where, where energy is going. So in a sense and but the other thing is that, you know, what else is true?
  1587  

  1878     13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  1879:    15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator. A larger group that's firing together and it's the decay rate sets the cadence of the gamma oscillation the decay rate of the action of the higher phasic action potential, which inhibits in thereby neurons.
  1880     21: So that would be yeah but that means well. Okay, no because that's still gonna start still gonna cause excitation overall. So I'm not. Yeah, so I need to kind of like, understand more about how one neuron can trigger LTD in a group of neurons. And the question here, another question character explore is, whether the oscillation of groups of neurons, what the delta oscillations, the data oscillations

  1914    35: But but so, here's the thing, is the, the action potential has particular shape like a tone that the, let's just say that the it creates a face change in the face. Space. That the face space is the combination of the the inside and outside cell electrodes and the oscillator the the face base created by the neural oscillators.
  1915:   41: Because because because the field is, is in part, made up of I made it defined by the by the ionic gradient. In addition to the the tonic oscillations of neuro circuits and cortical columns and the physics, the phasic firing of interrupts. The tonic firing with novel patterns that the whole brain can see because it's because it's, it's it's interlinked and you know, and and graph theory, we know that thanks to graph there.
  1916    45: It's coordinate oscillatory patterns that are very distant from one another in terms of brain space. But the brain can, like, I can, you know, for example, you know, this like very distant patterns are like, just, you know, some obvious examples is are that, you know, you have, what comes into your eyes is sent to both of the hemispheres of your brain at the same time, Each eyes send something to each of the hemispheres of your brain.

  2055     9: Nucleus is 20 million neurons that oscillate towards the center of your brain and this these oscillations, they don't all combine me but they have if force that's applied to one another
  2056:   11: You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.
  2057:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

  2075    342: But and in so those are creating temporary etchings and the oscillations are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away, so that newtons can be played. So the brain isn't continually moving to be in a ready state to receive more notes to play.
  2076:   356: And in basically from synapses to dendrites, to action, potentials to, to oscillations, no matter what size, the hurts signal is coming from, whether it's coming from something really small, like a synapse or something. Really large like a dipole. Then what happens is you've got different scales of phasic ratonic oscillations that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with I'm sorry.
  2077:   358: You've got different scales of physical tonic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out between at different scales of tonic frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing at a difference. Different scales from from synapses to dendrites, to Soma to, you know, the activity of a small neural circuit, to the activity of like a large cortical column to the activity of a brain region and a dipole.
  2078    360: The dipole representing the brain. You know, a magnetic moment or electromagnetic moment or electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for a large oscillator such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. And so, we've got these

  2082    477: And if it enters a big group of neurotic group of of tonic slower, oscillators then then the whole group is going to slow down that faster oscillation and make it come into sync. So it's going to like and I have described that again is it's like the piano note fading away.
  2083:   479: So the next note can be played but it's also at that moment when it's being taken away, is also the moment when those other neurons that are antonic, oscillation are listening and perceiving that pattern, that was played. And so you have a pattern when you have a sequence of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies, that are like different tones, different piano tones, like you imagine each piano key I guess played in the sequence, is a different phasic tone, okay?
  2084    483: It's by the finding a time pattern, but that, but then they're able to notice because the principles of oscillators, when one or more members of their group is not firing and in a regular pattern and because of the, you know, how interns can basically multiply the number of patterns, that each oscillator can represent or that you there, enter interneurons enter and inhibitor networks.

  2091    557: The quantum weirdness of it of your hearting, that everything is defined by everything else. And and so that's when you have this, that's when there is, that's when there is consciousness, that is human level. When all of these lower level representations that are seen by small oscillators and large, oscillators of, you know, individual neurons fire representing aspects of individual patterns.
  2092:   575: I say there are temple and spatial phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns that's actually more accurate on top of tonic awareness Temple and spatial phasic differentials on top of tonic awareness. So what we have is like an oscillatory differential neural network or so for network is an authority differential network

And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  2198    113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

  2415    50: Because the brain primarily communicates with itself via phase changes, tempo-spatially distributed phase changes, producing a phase space with its tonic oscillators, that are tracking phase changes (predictive coding, neurons predicting when they are going to fire), and thus observing phase changes
  2416:   60: The idea for a brain file system is that data is learned in temporally-spatially distributed phase change patterns, created by changes in ion gradients at multiple scales, communicated with phasic electromagnetic spectrum variations to oscillator bodies that exist in four dimensions at tonic power band frequencies. Patterns can be driven by a combination of bottom up, meso scale oscillatory configurations and macroscale multi-region networking configurations of oscillators, with one your focused on being represented from the small scale, to the medial, and macro scales, like a telescope making scale invariant tempo-spatial analogies of frequency data possible between domains. The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.
  2417    68: But in general a slower oscillation over time ought to result in a larger group of neurons being pulled into the same oscillator. So maybe what it means is that the triggering of the group of neurons is more even, because each terminal is getting more transmitters?
  2418    70: So the entire group is more likely to oscillate at the same time because they are all getting a slow but strong nudging from the high amp neuron
  2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales.

  2440:    96:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

  2449    258:   45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.
  2450:   280:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth.

(this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2451    292:   480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts

  2458    332:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2459:   335:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2460    336:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.

  2470:    120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

Quadrupole times Oscillators considering the sum of dendrite to multi vesicle release (M) times the (i/N) iteration of the number of neurons firing in a sequences, times Amplitude over frequency (1/f), by multiplication I mean time sequences, many Cortical Column oscillation patterns are multiplied under the Quadruple for example.

  2665     534:   31: are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)

  2674     644:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  2675:    658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  2676     665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2678     673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

  2706     818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2708     835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.

  2721     891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  2723     898:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

  2741    1100:    47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

    13:   43: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

From a polarized displacement of charges from the rate of change of X exceeding the rate of change in Y, the neuron becomes depolarized.

    29:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.
    30    153  

    33    67  
    34:   68: the phasic firing produces the light that shines through the film of the synaptic pattern, magnifying its particular pattern in attention by inhibiting variations of the memory pattern that are similar, but when firing happens faster than the ionic gradient can reset that could result in a phase increase or decrease with each subsequent interval for that pattern

    44:   11: to itself the brain renders it's own phasic burst firing patterns as deviations from its tonic firing as well as this the rendering is also accomplished by the inhibition of parts of the brain, in alignment with attention-schema theory but specifically in the context of a 4 dimensional brain grid & electro-magnetic phase change graph.

    98    22  
    99:   23: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

   104:    2: # The Phasic Tonic Relationship
   105     3  

   107     7  ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
   108:    8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.
   109     9  
   110:   10: The high phasic burst could potentially slow down the firing of many of its exit terminal neighbors by inhibiting them with a flood of extra neurotransmitters.
   111    11  
   112:   12: And the slowing effect would have a higher spatial magnitude than the smaller but faster phasic bursts.
   113    13  
   114:   14: Phasic burst might be characterized as being higher frequency but also causing a greater magnitude distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters.
   115    15  
   116:   16: The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.
   117    17  
   118:   18: Perhaps the phasic & high phasic signals, at least as soliton waves across the electromagnetic spectrium, might have a longer range, they would travel across longer distances of the network before eventually being dissipated by the rest of the oscillating groups of cells.
   119    19  
   120:   20: The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.
   121    21  
   122:   22: As if the relationship between the phasic signals and the tonic signals was like an Etch in Sketch toy, the magnetic pin is etching with phasic burstlets, and shaking the toy is dissipating the learned signal back into an equilibrium state or an empty slate. That's kind of a rough analogy.
   123    23  
   124:   24: It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits. I think there is research to back this up, if I remember correctly, so search for citations to bolster this.
   125    25  
   126:   26: Recapping the Phasic Tonic Relationship, the high phasic spike, creates a burstlet, that creates an inhibitory wave (a sharp wave ripple across the brain) that starts with it's direct exit terminal array, the phasic spikes are dissipated into the tonic oscillation, so there is a relationship between the tonic brainwave pattern (like the theta brainwave pattern) and the incoming sensory pathways.
   127    27  
   128:   28: I think this paper below describes one example of how that relationship between phasic spikes from incoming senses, from the eyes, interfaces with an organisms actions, the steps that it takes, to navigate.
   129    29  

   131    39  "Nigral dopamine neurons are transiently activated by high frequency glutamatergic inputs relaying reward-predicting sensory information. The tonic firing pattern of dopamine cells responds to these inputs with a transient burst of spikes that requires NMDA receptors. Here, we show that NMDA receptor activation further excites the cell by recruiting a calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) capable of generating a plateau potential."
   132:   40: "An animal's behaviour is altered by the temporal pattern of DA release, and it has been proposed that tonic dopamine levels provide a general motivating function while phasic DA permits the corticostriatal plasticity necessary for habit learning (Reynolds & Wickens, 2000; Wise, 2004; Niv et al. 2007)."
   133    41  "Thus, burst firing may encode a ‘reward’ signal during normal reinforcement learning and also pathological addictions (Mirenowicz & Schultz, 1996; Phillips et al. 2003)."

   135    48  
   136:   49: My argument is that the rendering output that makes up our internal representations, and our mind, is in the phase variations between the normal tonic oscillating pattern, and the phasic bursts that alter that tonic pattern. The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.
   137    50  

   139    59  
   140:   60: Perhaps I can think of pace setter potentials as tonic firing, plateau potential as phasic firing, and action potentials as high phasic firing?
   141    61  

   143    68  
   144:   69: Now you throw in some patterns like inhibitions, phase plateau potentials, and high phasic spike potentials and well you have more complex patterns being embedded into the biological structure of your brain.

That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.

   187    11  
   188:   12: So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establishes a recurring oscilllation that allows long term memories to form.

   207:   59: Any of the sensor modalities can compete for amplification in a desynchronized brain, but in a synchronized brain what happens when the layers correct their own internal pattern representations overtime, with lower energy pattern representations that preserve the transformation & development and set expansion in time of the phase field phasically firing parts of the grid pattern that includes each interval of time which expands or enlarges the entire pattern of one set in another set. The scale/frequency ranges up scale patterns up, and the brain also scales patterns down thanks to sparse signalling over greater distances, this kind of signalling might be good for balance. But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

It's a dynamic linear sequence temporally in terms of the activations in the brain's 3D graph of neural arrays. The phase change at each synaptic cleft is imagined to have the significance of a temporal tensor in 3D space. We could compare the phase states at each interval or frame of time as components of a Taylor Series, like the phase changes are imagined as Polynomial Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor Series.

   266     79  I realized that since AP wave duration is changed by the amount of potassium
   267:    80: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   268     81  

   270    100  
   271:   101: the process of continually changing potassium levels that can release tonic firing also explains how tonic firing neurons can kick up phasic brain patterns now and then that are reflective of something you have been thinking about for a while
   272    102  

   274    106  
   275:   107: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike
   276    108  

   279    20  
   280:   21: The reason I can argue this is because a neuron only understands phases, because to the neuron that's what it's receiving from the many synapses on its many dendritic arms connected to many cells, its receiving bursts, mini-vibrations, or phase patterns from other neurons that indicate they burst at a fast but light phasic rate, fired at a slower tonic rate that delivered a stronger pulse, a 3rd setting inbetween, or that they went silent from inhibition instead of the other modes. The neural oscillator rotates its neurons between these three different modes.

   284:    4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

   288:   17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

   293:   56: The sensor detection of patterns is at the location of the dendrite, and inner display of patterns is the exit terminal transmission (perceived by the next dendrite). Patterns in the mind are learned by cell assemblies, cortical columns, stored in synaptic connections long term, exist in the tonic oscillation pattern short term, they are evoked by phase changes (correlated with phasic & high phasic action potentials & inhibited firing).

   317:    3: Mark Humphries the author of The Spike insists that most spikes do nothing.

   321:   12: The tonic spiking is creating the canvas of consciousness, the phasic spiking is creating the ink of perception. (Phasic spiking is rare, in Information Theory something contains more information if its rare, so in contrast to the common tonic spiking that seems to do nothing they are providing a canvas for rare signals to have context)

   325:   78: The article that I linked above on "Universal Approximation Theorem" talks about Taylor Series Polynomial Functions having a sort of granularity limitation on pattern representation. So I thought maybe the action potential high phasic firing sequence, which sets off waves of inhibitory low phasic firing sequences, could be construed as a sort of Taylor Series calculation for modifying the curve of a learned vector pattern, represented by a phase change, and modified by subsequent phases changes in other Action potential events. So that as information travels through the nervous system, at each step, as a signal passes from one neuron to the next, the estimated representation of that pattern grows quantitatively, towards what could be some approximation of an infinite curve at a certain point, if it goes on long enough.

   339:   8: The wave pattern is a deviation from the tonic beat pattern of a group of neurons oscillating, and the entire group notices because its a novel event outside their tonic expectations, so the pattern that they are oscillating changes, but then the pattern representing phasic/hi freq/ low amp pattern. A new synaptic pathway is formed that represents the new learned pattern, these are new connections between dendrites and the synapses of other cells, interneuron gates and synapses for micro vesicle sacks and neurotransmitters to fly through

   343    245  
   344:   246: NAPOT Theory suggests that high phasic spiking inhibits the exit terminal array delaying an oscillating group relative to the larger oscillating group. IN other words Delayed Expression of the exit terminal of the activated neuron sets the new timing of the inhibited group by the decay rate of the fired action potential in the previous array. The tonic oscillation absorbs the burstlet, distributes it, and creates a synchronization pattern that dissipates the impact of the signal that group of neurons has received. Resulting in the temporal binding of your learned internal representations that are displayed to subsequent arrays that also embody learned internal representations.

   349:   15: The patterns that have higher valence, in terms of phasic spiking, are going to oscillate more, generating greater sharp wave ripples, that the tonic oscillations dissipate but are also changed by, that further encodes new long term patterns with new synaptic changes. The higher valence patterns over time define your behaviors, your responses, but also the evolution of your responses overtime as your responses develop in increasing complexity.

   372    17  
   373:   18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)

   377    273  
   378:   274: Micah Blumberg Neurons fire tonically all the time, randomly, maintaining a baseline between excitation and inhibition, but they need specific information patterns to respond with phasic firing in the upper gamma frequencies, this information is collected as the coincidence of several neurons firing within miliseconds of each other, and it has to have a specific temporal signature that matches a specific neurons firing criteria to trigger a phasic burst. Simply stimulating neurons with electricity will not create phasic bursts. This means that top down information drives neural activity, so it is not just bottom up physical causation, its top down criteria causation.

   411    46  Information Theory & DNA
   412:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.
   413    48  Right so each receptor on a cell might be unique, which means a unique information containing structure, or a protein, acts as a 3D shape that performs a detection function, a sodium receptor detects for example sodium ions that are allowed to pass through the sodium receptor.

   447:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

   452:    21: And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.

   465    142  

   467    144  
   468:   145: But then the recognition of that pattern is going to fire again and it's going to loop. So that phase sequence is going to gradually loop in time and gradually fade out. That would be (essentially the same process) for anything that you can think of. Like if you are looking at something, the pattern of what you're looking at, very intensely is going to be like this high phasic (sequence of) bursts of spiking activity, interspersed with inhibitory waves.
   469    146  

   471    327  
   472:   328: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

Just like your hands basically have are your skin is basically a sensor array and your, your you're nostrils, the hairs and your nostrils and hairs in your ears are basically center arrays.

   490:   117: Yes. Okay so yeah so I didn't. Okay so I'm recording. So they're fine. So they're firing at a phasic break so this is their firing much faster than the rest of the oscillation so they are both the source of where, where energy is going. So in a sense and but the other thing is that, you know, what else is true?

First, I think it does like a longer duration of the action potential, represents a high frequency, phasing first.

Then it's going to transmit. And so if the action potential results in is the, if the action potential is a, so the extra potential by itself is a high phasic like that.

   642:   60: The idea for a brain file system is that data is learned in temporally-spatially distributed phase change patterns, created by changes in ion gradients at multiple scales, communicated with phasic electromagnetic spectrum variations to oscillator bodies that exist in four dimensions at tonic power band frequencies. Patterns can be driven by a combination of bottom up, meso scale oscillatory configurations and macroscale multi-region networking configurations of oscillators, with one your focused on being represented from the small scale, to the medial, and macro scales, like a telescope making scale invariant tempo-spatial analogies of frequency data possible between domains. The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.

   646:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.

   662    163    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
   663:   164:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

   667:   171:    18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
   668    172     28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

(this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

It's plausible that memory failure might come from a few factors such as flooded neurotransmitters (with oxidative stress, inflammation, antigens) and metabolic issues that may stem from diseased mitochondria, lack of oxygen, lack of ATP (from malnutrition), injury, viral attacks, bacterial attacks, diseases like cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, and so on.

   784:    306:    4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.
   785:    307:   17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

   790     321  

   792     359    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
   793:    360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

   798     393     28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

   809:    528:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.

   817:    660:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
   818     661    55: And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?

   821:    668:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

   838     836    328: Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.
   839     837    330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
   840:    838:   350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that Facebook firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
   841     839    352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges.

And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
   845     899    105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.

   906     756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain. Making that memory active for the whole neural network. In a digital brain you could not have a single cell representing an entire memory.

  1025     246    13: A dissipative system, like a cell, a brain, a galaxy or an atom is absorbing energy to maintain its oscillation.
  1026:    247:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  1027:    248:   21: "and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)
  1028     249    23: A disspating vortex is closer to a resonator, which could be described as a transient or decaying oscillator. (I guess in that sense the clapping of a crowd of people, or the light from a group of fireflies can be imagined as a dissipative oscillator, or resonator that will need to rest eventually.)

  1030:    251:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

  1033     287     2: (oscillat, graph, criteria, causation, cortex) virtual patterns in the brain
  1034:    288:    6: what does an object in your mind need to be distinct from? why do we need an oscillation for a temporal, spatial, phasic sequence of deviations to deviate from? 
  1035     289    10: So that is why I argue, that the tonic oscillations of the brain are creating the bedrock of the mind, the canvas of consciousness, the ground of being, the beginning of the detection of inner self space for the sentient self aware being to consider and reflect, the mechanical & computational chamber of ephinomenal consciousness in the robotic like human mind.
  1036:    290:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

  1048     318     4: Simultaneous Observing / Encoding Oscillators 
  1049:    319:    5: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.
  1050     320     7: This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing

  1052     351    2: (oscillat, array)
  1053:    352:   5: The way Richard Feynman pronounces words when he speaks in the Feynman lectures: it's as if each major point in his rhetoric was a powerful particle collision in his mind. What if particle collisions in our brains are infact activated soliton wave collisions in the brain. The waves from phasic firing neural paths intersecting with oscillating edge communities.

  1056     494     2: (cortex, perception, oscillat, field, array, graph, dendrite, synap)
  1057:    495:   10: So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establish
  1058     496    12: One idea is that if neurons end up firing together, they will absorb each other, and from then onwards, unless their pattern is disrupted by other neurons, they will tend to fire together, like a repeating oscillation, so that even if they become disconnected they can maintain the appearance of cooperating as the same pattern at a distance, we see this with patterns in the left and right visual cortex that fire in synch with one another at great distances. Besides interneurons, these distance coupled oscillators are sending and receiving patterns with decoupled oscillators that have different scale and different speed, so patterns can be transferred from one oscillator to another, and a change in one distant oscillator would be felt by the other distant oscillator because the change would result in a change to the oscillators inbetween them. Every oscillator in the brain is an array that can sense the output of other oscillators in addition to tracking neural circuit firing within itself. This makes the whole brain aware of many different patterns each represented in different locations by different oscillators, sort of like a distributed graph of internal representations that make up the representations of everything you can sense and be aware of in your reality.

  1060     500     17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  1061:    501:    46: Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.
  1062     502     58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
  1063     503     67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.
  1064:    504:    73: The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015

  1068:    553:   4: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously.

  1073     564     6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.
  1077     573    36: I like to think of the oscillator as an Expert Data Structure (Instead of an advanced data structure) because its creating its own paper for which it can measure incoming signals against as deviations, allowing the system to collaborate as knowledge gaining system, mapping a dimension or a movie frame of consciousness.

  1081:    579:   10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.
  1082     580    14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.

  1094     735    31: The brain selects a mostly guassian distribution pattern of energy to have the most stable brain oscillations most of the time, the brains delicate oscillations have the ability to turn the brains oscillations into renderings that are equal to version of the human experience of reality.

  1096     756     56: The memory that comes around comes around again if you want it. If you forget a cool memory, know that your memories oscillate and you might remember it again if you wait for it, and you might construct it into an even more awesome idea down the road.

  1098     758     75: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.

  1100     763     98: so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator) 
  1101:    764:   100: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike
  1102     765    117: I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.

  1104     808    19: At the neuronal level you don't know anything, a neuron is an oscillator & dissipative system with a threshold for maintaining its electro-magnetic equilibrium, it has to regularly discharge a burst of energy to its surrounding environment, to offset the charged ions its receiving from other neurons that are pushing it towards its action potential event.

  1108     851    43: My conjecture is that the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern, embodied for example by Theta Waves (or other power band frequences) represents the short term memory structure that binds with incoming sensory inputs via the principles of oscillatory physics (that could be simulated in a game engine or with webxr)
  1109:    852:   49: The sensor detection of patterns is at the location of the dendrite, and inner display of patterns is the exit terminal transmission (perceived by the next dendrite). Patterns in the mind are learned by cell assemblies, cortical columns, stored in synaptic connections long term, exist in the tonic oscillation pattern short term, they are evoked by phase changes (correlated with phasic & high phasic action potentials & inhibited firing). 
  1110     853    64: My brain is essentially comparing memorized numerical operations to predict the right answer, and the right answer is stimulating the oscillatory activity in my brain to produce the right result in terms of motor actions taken and words typed.

  1118     863    11: I think that each one of us is like the creator of his or her own universe, and we are meeting as different people because god was bored of being just a single solo entity, like the first atom that randomly emerged from spacetime oscillations between having a location and having a velocity.

  1124     876    2: (oscillat) Phases not spikes.
  1125:    877:   3: Mark Humphries the author of The Spike insists that most spikes do nothing. In my hypothesis every spike does something, because a neural oscillator ensemble is observing phase changes at multiple scales in individual neurons which is the compiled result of all phasic spikes relative to the oscillators tonic firing pattern.

A new synaptic pathway is formed that represents the new learned pattern, these are new connections between dendrites and the synapses of other cells, interneuron gates and synapses for micro vesicle sacks and neurotransmitters to fly through

  1136     944     5: then oscillations
  1137:    945:   16: I mean the brain's oscillations are canvas's for phasic neural circuit firing, except the canvas is temporally observing and collectively learning the synapse, dendrite, neuron, and neural circuit firing.
  1138     946    33: they are helping the oscillator to have a pattern that the oscillator can observe, learn, update, combine and integrate with other patterns

  1140     997    2: (oscillat) from a valid perspective self is a memory, and a prediction.
  1141:    998:   4: from another perspective its a rendered information pattern, with phasic spikes contrasting against the tonic oscillation, with small differences between the frequencies patterns representing expectations, shaping your chill perception, and high phasic spikes representing startling new information that attracts your attention.
  1142     999  

  1144    1114    17: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter
  1145:   1115:   44: the synaptic connection state is represented in the oscillation state which represents the item when it's being predicted tonically to represent the expectation net that receives the incoming phasic.
  1146    1116    45: the attractor state representing the item andor the color red on the item is oscillating in memory with a neural circuit firing pattern, but other signals from other items and colors threat to disrupt and or change that item in memory, perhaps changing its color for example.

  1164    1463    46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  1165:   1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

  1169:   1470:    21: And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.
  1170    1471     34: You can also think of the oscillating group of neurons as sort of like allowing the emergence of higher level receptive (dendrite)/inceptive field (exit terminal), that is like a shared computation. It allows it allows the bugs to basically have collective mind that is not really a mind, so much as it's a collective sensor that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so, each of them can help create this sort of collective sensor.

  1172    1478    139: Whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their energy across other neurons (oscillators).
  1173:   1479:   141: An oscillating neuron is going to like repeat it's signal, but if it doesn't. so if there's like a high phasic signal, like I recognize a pattern that's going to fire, right?
  1174    1480    169: They're going to sort of cease to exist. But what happens though is that the short-term oscillations. They're going to change this synaptic connections. They're going to cause synaptic connections to grow towards them, and they're going to grow towards other neurons that fired fast fast.

  1176    1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  1177:   1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1178    1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  1180    1585    101: And so it's possible that they have become linked through the that's even through the literal oscillation or the function or the indirect oscillation. These sort of like absorb each others. Oscillation they're oscillating is one unit. Why are there filaments and spines and synapses growing between them to like even if they're like benefits?
  1181:   1586:   117: Yes. Okay so yeah so I didn't. Okay so I'm recording. So they're fine. So they're firing at a phasic break so this is their firing much faster than the rest of the oscillation so they are both the source of where, where energy is going. So in a sense and but the other thing is that, you know, what else is true?
  1182    1587  

  1184    1878     13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  1185:   1879:    15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator. A larger group that's firing together and it's the decay rate sets the cadence of the gamma oscillation the decay rate of the action of the higher phasic action potential, which inhibits in thereby neurons.
  1186    1880     21: So that would be yeah but that means well. Okay, no because that's still gonna start still gonna cause excitation overall. So I'm not. Yeah, so I need to kind of like, understand more about how one neuron can trigger LTD in a group of neurons. And the question here, another question character explore is, whether the oscillation of groups of neurons, what the delta oscillations, the data oscillations

  1188    1914    35: But but so, here's the thing, is the, the action potential has particular shape like a tone that the, let's just say that the it creates a face change in the face. Space. That the face space is the combination of the the inside and outside cell electrodes and the oscillator the the face base created by the neural oscillators.
  1189:   1915:   41: Because because because the field is, is in part, made up of I made it defined by the by the ionic gradient. In addition to the the tonic oscillations of neuro circuits and cortical columns and the physics, the phasic firing of interrupts. The tonic firing with novel patterns that the whole brain can see because it's because it's, it's it's interlinked and you know, and and graph theory, we know that thanks to graph there.
  1190    1916    45: It's coordinate oscillatory patterns that are very distant from one another in terms of brain space. But the brain can, like, I can, you know, for example, you know, this like very distant patterns are like, just, you know, some obvious examples is are that, you know, you have, what comes into your eyes is sent to both of the hemispheres of your brain at the same time, Each eyes send something to each of the hemispheres of your brain.

  1192    2055     9: Nucleus is 20 million neurons that oscillate towards the center of your brain and this these oscillations, they don't all combine me but they have if force that's applied to one another
  1193:   2056:   11: You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.
  1194:   2057:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1195    2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

  1197    2075    342: But and in so those are creating temporary etchings and the oscillations are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away, so that newtons can be played. So the brain isn't continually moving to be in a ready state to receive more notes to play.
  1198:   2076:   356: And in basically from synapses to dendrites, to action, potentials to, to oscillations, no matter what size, the hurts signal is coming from, whether it's coming from something really small, like a synapse or something. Really large like a dipole. Then what happens is you've got different scales of phasic ratonic oscillations that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with I'm sorry.
  1199:   2077:   358: You've got different scales of physical tonic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out between at different scales of tonic frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing at a difference. Different scales from from synapses to dendrites, to Soma to, you know, the activity of a small neural circuit, to the activity of like a large cortical column to the activity of a brain region and a dipole.
  1200    2078    360: The dipole representing the brain. You know, a magnetic moment or electromagnetic moment or electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for a large oscillator such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. And so, we've got these

  1202    2082    477: And if it enters a big group of neurotic group of of tonic slower, oscillators then then the whole group is going to slow down that faster oscillation and make it come into sync. So it's going to like and I have described that again is it's like the piano note fading away.
  1203:   2083:   479: So the next note can be played but it's also at that moment when it's being taken away, is also the moment when those other neurons that are antonic, oscillation are listening and perceiving that pattern, that was played. And so you have a pattern when you have a sequence of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies, that are like different tones, different piano tones, like you imagine each piano key I guess played in the sequence, is a different phasic tone, okay?
  1204    2084    483: It's by the finding a time pattern, but that, but then they're able to notice because the principles of oscillators, when one or more members of their group is not firing and in a regular pattern and because of the, you know, how interns can basically multiply the number of patterns, that each oscillator can represent or that you there, enter interneurons enter and inhibitor networks.

  1206    2091    557: The quantum weirdness of it of your hearting, that everything is defined by everything else. And and so that's when you have this, that's when there is, that's when there is consciousness, that is human level. When all of these lower level representations that are seen by small oscillators and large, oscillators of, you know, individual neurons fire representing aspects of individual patterns.
  1207:   2092:   575: I say there are temple and spatial phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns that's actually more accurate on top of tonic awareness Temple and spatial phasic differentials on top of tonic awareness. So what we have is like an oscillatory differential neural network or so for network is an authority differential network

And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  1212    2198    113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

  1222    2415    50: Because the brain primarily communicates with itself via phase changes, tempo-spatially distributed phase changes, producing a phase space with its tonic oscillators, that are tracking phase changes (predictive coding, neurons predicting when they are going to fire), and thus observing phase changes
  1223:   2416:   60: The idea for a brain file system is that data is learned in temporally-spatially distributed phase change patterns, created by changes in ion gradients at multiple scales, communicated with phasic electromagnetic spectrum variations to oscillator bodies that exist in four dimensions at tonic power band frequencies. Patterns can be driven by a combination of bottom up, meso scale oscillatory configurations and macroscale multi-region networking configurations of oscillators, with one your focused on being represented from the small scale, to the medial, and macro scales, like a telescope making scale invariant tempo-spatial analogies of frequency data possible between domains. The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.
  1224    2417    68: But in general a slower oscillation over time ought to result in a larger group of neurons being pulled into the same oscillator. So maybe what it means is that the triggering of the group of neurons is more even, because each terminal is getting more transmitters?
  1225    2418    70: So the entire group is more likely to oscillate at the same time because they are all getting a slow but strong nudging from the high amp neuron
  1226:   2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  1227    2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales. 
  1230:   2440:    96:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

  1233    2449    258:   45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.
  1234:   2450:   280:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses.

  1235    2451    292:   480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts

  1237    2458    332:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  1238:   2459:   335:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1239    2460    336:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.

I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

  1271    2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  1273    2639     312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.
  1274:   2640:    318:   7: the neurons "phasic" mode is indicated by a faster firing rate, so the frequency of its electro-magnetic pulsations, both its physical expansion, creating a tremor like soliton magnetic wave, and an electric frequency variation that differs from the main oscillator, but then is pulled back into tonic pattern alignment with the rest of the oscillator, like two oscillators merging.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  1281    2674     644:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  1282:   2675:    658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  1283    2676     665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  1284:   2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1285    2678     673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

  1287    2706     818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  1288:   2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1289    2708     835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.

  1291    2721     891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  1292:   2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.

And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related.

They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.

  1695     756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

(this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

  2403     662:   163    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

The scale/frequency ranges up scale patterns up, and the brain also scales patterns down thanks to sparse signalling over greater distances, this kind of signalling might be good for balance. But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

  2489     906     756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   271:   23: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

   285:   49: My argument is that the rendering output that makes up our internal representations, and our mind, is in the phase variations between the normal tonic oscillating pattern, and the phasic bursts that alter that tonic pattern. The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.

I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.

  4807     839     837    330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  4808:    840:    838:   350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that Facebook firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
  4809     841     839    352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.

  4811:    905     755:   1030:   432:   182:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).
  4812     906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  4816     990:   16    21: I skimmed the article a little bit. Confidentially what I am writing about in my book is how the brains molecular structure creates conscious maps of reality with frequencies, the frequencies interact with each other, but the same molecular structure that produced these frequencies is required to experience these frequencies. I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence
  4817:    991    17:   34: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above 
  4818  
  4819    1035     289    10: So that is why I argue, that the tonic oscillations of the brain are creating the bedrock of the mind, the canvas of consciousness, the ground of being, the beginning of the detection of inner self space for the sentient self aware being to consider and reflect, the mechanical & computational chamber of ephinomenal consciousness in the robotic like human mind.
  4820:   1036:    290:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence). I will attempt to explain how reality is computationally rendered from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world th

  1966:   2470     120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

    56:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

   142:   25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

   160:   17: I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia

   197:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations

   201:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

   249    39: "Nigral dopamine neurons are transiently activated by high frequency glutamatergic inputs relaying reward-predicting sensory information. The tonic firing pattern of dopamine cells responds to these inputs with a transient burst of spikes that requires NMDA receptors. Here, we show that NMDA receptor activation further excites the cell by recruiting a calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) capable of generating a plateau potential."
   250:   40  "An animal's behaviour is altered by the temporal pattern of DA release, and it has been proposed that tonic dopamine levels provide a general motivating function while phasic DA permits the corticostriatal plasticity necessary for habit learning (Reynolds & Wickens, 2000; Wise, 2004; Niv et al. 2007)."

   743:    4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

   747:   17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

  1195    46  Information Theory & DNA
  1196:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.
  1197    48  Right so each receptor on a cell might be unique, which means a unique information containing structure, or a protein, acts as a 3D shape that performs a detection function, a sodium receptor detects for example sodium ions that are allowed to pass through the sodium receptor.

But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

There's temporal properties and there's also phasic properties. It's not just spatial and temporal was also the phase in each location of the temple.

If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network.

If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.
  4310:   2440:    785:    307:   17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

  4314    2444:    792:    359    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  4315:   2445:    793:    360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

  4320    2450:    798:    393     28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

It's plausible that memory failure might come from a few factors such as flooded neurotransmitters (with oxidative stress, inflammation, antigens) and metabolic issues that may stem from diseased mitochondria, lack of oxygen, lack of ATP (from malnutrition), injury, viral attacks, bacterial attacks, diseases like cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, and so on.

  7175    1463    46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  7176:   1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

  7183    1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  7184:   1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

  7185    1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  7237    1878:    13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  7238:   1879     15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator.

  7284    2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  7338    2198:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.
  7523:   2640:    318:   7: the neurons "phasic" mode is indicated by a faster firing rate, so the frequency of its electro-magnetic pulsations, both its physical expansion, creating a tremor like soliton magnetic wave, and an electric frequency variation that differs from the main oscillator, but then is pulled back into tonic pattern alignment with the rest of the oscillator, like two oscillators merging.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  7548    2665:    534:   31: are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)

  7557    2674:    644:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  7558:   2675:    658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  7559    2676:    665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  7560:   2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  7561    2678:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  7590:   2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  7591    2708:    835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.

  7604    2721:    891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  7605:   2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.

And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

  7887:     29:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

  7961:    412:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.

  8016     662:   163    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales.

  8075:    784:    306:    4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.
  8076:    785:    307:   17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

  8081     790     321  

  8083     792:    359    15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  8084:    793:    360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

  8088:    797:    392:    18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
  8089     798:    393     28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

  8093:    805:    521:   5: I've considered the possibility also that a low frequency gamma pattern in the range of around 40z could be the tonic firing pattern for super high phasic firing patterns, such as something that is 500hz or 600hz
  8094     806:    522    7: with the idea being that the home tonic frequency pattern servers as a base line of expectations to decode the incoming signals with and then to put them into perspective by passing the signals and their reflections into the mind, letting patterns reflect into the mind's collective awareness of its own phase space through felt transmissions of phase patterns that can travel across the electric field, the charge of ions, and the magnetic field, including the effects of the magnetic field on flavins in the mitochondria, I hypothesize that this could be the mechanism for reward, if the neuron fires, it creates a vector of electrical energy, and that means that magnetic field is changed, and that could mean the mitonchria is stimulated to release ATP so the cell gets more energy, or reward, and the vibrational, acoustic, tactile, mechanical spectrum, that can travel with chemical signals,

  8097:    809:    528:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.

  8104     816:    659    25: And and so this allows to have this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency, right? And, and so sense.
  8105:    817:    660:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  8106     818:    661    55: And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?

  8109:    821:    668:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  8110     822:    669    327: This triggers some ideas for amplifying the human sense of smell, by considering how the shape of a dog's olfactory bulb, and the rates & types of its signal pathways are different from the human nose. I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

So a longer duration or longer duration I so I'm still trying to figure out if the longer duration of the action potential means of phasic. First, I think it does like a longer duration of the action potential, represents a high frequency, phasing first.

  8124     836:    834    264: So even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired it sooner or later than it normally fires, that's just this temporary pattern but this actually what we want. Because like imagine that when you move from the left to the right, not only is it the case that neurons need to fire.
  8125:    837:    835:   326: This is the event baboon, I don't know if that's right. Maybe that's something I sound but but that is a, that is a different. It's not a tonic frequency, that's a phasic frequency, it's a phasic pattern. It's phase of frequency pattern and so you can say it, we can go into.
  8126     838:    836    328: Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.
  8127     839:    837    330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  8128:    840:    838:   350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that Facebook firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
  8129     841:    839    352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.

  8131     843:    897     63: Between like these are these are non-neuron cells that can do this and neurons are more capable than these non neurons cells, so I have this opportunity here to sort of like basically like design a new perceptron a new artificial neuron a new artificial neural network, that is not just frequency information but it's.
  8132:    844:    898:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  8133     845:    899    105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.

  8236:   1165:   1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

  8283    1263:   2609      74:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

  8293    1273:   2639     312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  8301    1281:   2674     644:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  8302:   1282:   2675:    658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  8303    1283:   2676     665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  8304:   1284:   2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  8305    1285:   2678     673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

  8307    1287:   2706     818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  8308:   1288:   2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  8309    1289:   2708     835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.

  8311    1291:   2721     891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  8312:   1292:   2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.

And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons.

  1489    4812:    906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2567     500:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  2710:   2419    72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  2711    2420:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  3427     906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3431     910:    766    1068:    237:   17: Already we can see that the brainwave hz adds meaning to the system. The electron pulse in the neuron has not only a frequency, but also a hz. This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain. Making that memory active for the whole neural network. In a digital brain you could not have a single cell representing an entire memory.

    47:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

    93      7: ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
    94:     8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

    74      7  ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
    75:     8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

  1196:   1101:    764:   100: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike
  1197    1102     765    117: I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.
  1198  
  1199:   1261    2607:     68:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  1200:   1262:   2608:     69:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.
  1201    1263    2609      74:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  1203    1387    52  
  1204:   1388:   53: So when one neuron spikes faster, with a phasic or high phasic spike, it causes many of the neurons in it's exit terminal to become inhibited, creating a synchronized inhibitory pattern whose timing is set by the decay rate of the action potential which is set by the quantity of potassium in the neuron at the time the threshold for the action potential was triggered.

   551:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).

  1015     500:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  1016:    501     46: Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.
  1017     502:    58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding

  1019:    504     73: The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015

  1032:    579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.
  1033  

  1148  
  1149:   2419    72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  1150    2420:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  1166    2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  1168    2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  1183    2747    1110:   162: Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells

These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  1848     906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1876     934:   1194    183:   180: And they might notice when suddenly their truth is contradicted or something is not quite right? You would notice this through sort of what I think of as like a Neuro Array Tomography, Conceptual Tomography.

  1882    1060:    500     17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  1883:   1061     501:    46: Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.
  1884    1062:    502     58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
  1885    1063:    503     67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.
  1886:   1064     504:    73: The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015

  1891:   1081     579:   10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.
  1892  
  1893:   1226    2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  1894    1227:   2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  1897    1269    2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  1899    1271    2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  1901    1299    2747    1110:   162: Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  4339    1489:   4812:    906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain.

  6109    3427:    906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  6113    3431     910:    766    1068:    237:   17: Already we can see that the brainwave hz adds meaning to the system. The electron pulse in the neuron has not only a frequency, but also a hz. This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain. Making that memory active for the whole neural network. In a digital brain you could not have a single cell representing an entire memory.

  6154:   3486    1226    2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  49: So when one neuron spikes faster, with a phasic or high phasic spike, it causes many of the neurons in it's exit terminal to become inhibited, creating a synchronized inhibitory pattern whose timing is set by the decay rate of the action potential which is set by the quantity of potassium in the neuron at the time the threshold for the action potential was triggered.

  57: The physics of oscillation allow your neuron's high phasic spikes to cause inhibitory effects to other neurons that the whole cell assembly will feel, as the energy is dissipating across the oscillating group over time, the energy which is also information in effect is a sharp wave rippling across the oscillator (a cortical column might be a good example of an oscillating group of cells) & between networked oscillators (networked cortical columns) across the whole brain.
