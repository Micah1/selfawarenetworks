Title: Microtubules Consciousness Recursion

Listen:

OpenAI's Whisper Transcription

But having some discussions about them early on is kind of important

When you start to think about how these entities interact with each other

So that's what this when it gets a little bit interesting

So this is something that I've been thinking about and wanted to bring up

It's that you know people people keep coming into the groups and they start

sharing the panpsychist viewpoint and I have debated that so many times and

Sometimes I just don't have the energy for it, but it's like but I but I guess it still needs to be discussed and it's like it's kind of like

I think that the basic plot it like the most

In the the biggest reason it can't move forward is that it sort of violates like information theory

You can't have like in order to have consciousness

That means that you're observing

There's an observer who's observing right and you're observing something and that means that and like if you're observing music then then

What's necessary to observe music like you can someone can hand you a record and you're not going to hear sound

Someone can hand you a CD CD rom just like without the player and you're not going to hear sound, right?

You have to have a decoder in order to turn the bumps on the record or the dots on the CD rom into

Into sound and and it's the same thing with your brain. There's like there's no observation

If there's a if unless there's a decoder there's information has no meaning unless it's the unless it's decoded

so it has to be encoded and decoded and

That means that like if there's no observation happening because there's no because no decoder then there can't be any

Consciousness and like so like there can't be any consciousness in a rock because there's no observation happening and if if if

There's no observation happening because there's no decoder in the rock

We can see that there's no decoder in the rock with the wears like in the human brain people are working. There's no there's no

in my mind the

The idea that the human brain is computationally interpreting the incoming signals from the

environment in order to process them and decode them and perceive them is not a controversial

idea. This is what most neuroscientists and I think most educated people believe and yeah,

I'll stop there. Yeah, great. I like the way you're talking thinking and I would love to actually

make a bridge between what you're saying right now and what Ben was saying earlier about

the relation to predicting the cosmos. Not the right word but you know what he was referring

to earlier with. So first of all, I am actually talking with philosophers, contemporary philosophers

about reintroducing parts of panpsychism but not all and the essence there is that we learn to

understand in a different way. First of all, let me refer back to a good reason why we actually

would think that consciousness is prior to matter and I think that the way we are looking at it at

the moment is explaining some things like the fine-tune problems and giving an alternative to

the whole idea of the multiverse. The thing I'm doing as an applied science, I want to have it

grounded in the world and really fully emerged into the world and like I said, I've always rejected

any of this spiritual stuff and panpsychic stuff until the world itself showed me that the research

I was doing on this was exactly that. It meant that there's another way. Let me do that metaphor.

You can think about it in a different way. Think about a vacuum, right? Now on this planet,

we actually only have artificial vacuum but we have it everywhere. We use it for our combustion

engines to make a lot of work for us. So we're using it everywhere but it's fabricated in an

artificial way. So in an atmosphere, your mic is breaking up a lot. Maybe the connection is this

better? I hope this will be better. Difficult to know without a statistically significant sound

for me so keep going. Okay, so what I'm trying to say is that think about your brain as a container

to keep an electrical storm together. If I would take atmosphere into space without a container,

it would disperse. It wouldn't exist at all. So in my view, the stones and many of those

material stuff around us is in that kind of sense not linked to consciousness. Consciousness is to

me like this whirlpool of electrical lightning, let's say. But that can actually exist outside

the brain as well. And if I link it to much larger scale like creating the conditions to

get to the fine-tuning structure where life can emerge, that's a very different balance game.

So it is pantheism but it's not pantheism. And something that Ben said about what if all the

different consciousnesses are emerging at the same time, that's exactly the thing that we are at

the moment working on with the concept of what is called tribo-poasis. So you have auto-poasis,

which is basically the system creating itself, but then you have like a little bit of a problem

like where the hell is this coming from. And while with tribo-poasis, it is actually more

in line with also the fact that we are a multicellular creature. So like a multicellular creature

has at one level cells that can autonomously reproduce and do whatever they want,

but on an aggregated level there is an influence. Because if I stop eating, I will

eat my muscles to keep my brains alive. So there is a higher order at play. And the same way we

are looking now at this concept of tribo-poasis. And what I'm trying to do like in the research on

the origin of life is look how convection cells, they always emerge out of a field that gets far

from equilibrium, but then they emerge together. It's not one convection cells, it's a collective

of convection cells. And you can only understand that because there is like this feedback structure

that will improve the flow. And many of the things I'm learning and understanding about

consciousness is exactly this. I mean you can wake up in the morning and you can be in a state like

where the hell am I? So you're not really conscious of the things that, while your brain is perfectly

functional, but then the flow gets a little bit going and then you're back into it. And there's

similar kind of, well, exercise you can do like if you dream, you can wake up and be in a mindset

of a lot of work and forget your dream right away. But sometimes you can actually try to get back to

the dream by going and standing in the feeling you had when you were dreaming. And then where you

stand in the feeling of that dream, suddenly all the memory comes back in. So in that way there's

this whole link and there's a strong link with things that we see in Zen Buddhism and so on,

where you go via meditation into a different kind of awareness. So there are many of, well there's

still a lot of mystery around all of that, right? But we try by not being too concrete, like many

of the examples you gave Mikhai is for me too concrete. If you try to be a little bit more

abstract, then things may actually get explained by first seeing how like a cybernetic world

can actually start changing the physical world and how that's kind of the bootstrapping relation

and Michelangelo speaking. And by the way, I probably need to go for a meeting in a few minutes.

Okay, I can respond to that. So it sounds like you're, I guess to try to paraphrase what you're

saying, something about consciousness being just the electrical activity or just the electromagnetic

activity and the brain just being a container for that activity to keep it together. But maybe

you think that if that electrical activity could occur in a different kind of container,

like maybe inside the storm of Jupiter, then there could be consciousness there, right? Something

like it doesn't have to be in the brain, it could reformulate somewhere else. It's not necessarily

connected to the brain. The brain is... It's happening in our culture. What? It's already

happening in our culture. You cannot disconnect your own consciousness from the language you speak

and the culture you're living. So you don't even need to go so far away. Okay. So on the topic of

Neuroscience though, I guess what I want to share is what I think is the missing piece here.

I like the painting, but I think there's one missing piece and I wanted to share it,

is that from neuroscience, I think that there's like a ton of examples and I'd have to kind of

piece it together. I know you may not have enough time, but... So one example is that

they do like the split brain patients, if the famous scientists... So anyway, the idea was

that every time you do like a major incision that cuts across the corpus callosum or just divides

the brain half or a major surgery or if there's a major injury and a brain surgery, we see personality

changes, people's personality changes. That's the first sign that the brain tissue is directly

causing the electrical pattern. If the soul was the electrical pattern and the brain tissue was

just a container, then how is changing the brain tissue changing that personality?

But that's one big thing that people have to juggle with.

Yeah. So I want to respond to that thanks because it makes it a lot more concrete. So

the way I look at the mind brain, so the conscience, it's like a whirlpool, right? So it's a feedback

mechanism keeping itself in a kind of artificial construct. So what happens if you cut the brain,

you should get two whirlpools. And that's exactly what we see if we can do experiments with them

and have the left brain and the right brain ask them different questions and actually capture

how they have the different answers to that. Like you let them write and you let them say something

and you ask them a question and you see that what's been written and what's been said is different.

So this kind of stuff really fits perfectly with what we call that tribal poesis. So it's the whole

idea that everything you see around you can actually be understood from a process perspective.

Everything is feedback structures creating. Okay. Well, so there's another there's there's

some other problems with that. And so like, but what's what's really interesting, I think,

and it is a missing piece is how much the brain tissue is involved in generating that electrical

storm. And like, you know, every time every time a neuron fires or a neural circuit fires, you know,

a micro a micro column of activity spikes, a column or a region spikes, you have one region

and another like there's the dipoles firing off. Do you know the global workspace hypothesis?

Yeah, I do. But I have but I but I have issues with that too. I have I have my own hypothesis.

The reason I'm mentioning it is because I've noticed that so that's the first time I noticed

that the system of creation. So the feedback system I was working with in our team was popping up

again. So I was wondering, like, how come that this neuroscience is actually explaining something

that I'm from artificial intelligence, totally disconnected from that research, also had as a

system. So that's one of the first times. So the end, the deeper how like having this four

different kind of leverages can actually create feedback on creation. And if you understand

how you can create that feedback on creation, you can actually see how even cultures are consciousness

and aware as a feedback structure like that, but just on a way slower rate. So the

like speeding up plans and see then how plans behave like animals. It's a little bit the same.

So there is like, as well, but it's moving so slow, it's called size guys. So but the thing

that that you can see is if you pull system of creation, you will get more aware. And you can

so it's already hard coding our brains, but our actions can actually also improve that kind of

flow. I mix a lot of speaking, I hope it helps. So okay, look, so I still I still think the idea

that you're saying violates information, information theory, which was the final part of what I was

going to say, because, you know, you're not only are neurons generating this electrical storm,

but they're, but the neurons themselves are the ones that are decoding and the the information

in the brain that includes includes any result of this electrical storm that there is is is the

electrical storm might be altering the positions of electrons, which change the firing rate and

change the brain activity patterns. And but the but the only way for the for information to be

detected or for for an observation to happen is because the neurons are making that observation

that the brain activity itself doesn't have decoders and therefore it has no sense of information.

And it's not conscious, it's not not an observer.

But that's because you believe that information is in your brain.

No, no, that's because I believe that that information has has to be has to have

that an observer has to have a decoder for an observation to happen. Otherwise,

information has no meaning. But the thing is that that embodiment can be extremely simplified to

four forces interacting on each other.

I don't know if we're going to solve this debate tonight, if you have to leave in a minute,

because this requires some maybe another hour of argument. But maybe you come back another

time and I would love to do that, by the way. I'm really I'm really like the way you're thinking

and the fact that you're critical because the way because if you that kind of critical response

allows to create a language to express the things that we can see from like more mathematical

perspective. But like, yeah, if you want to have like some idea of what that four forces

creating the system of creation looks like, the most easiest case I can see around me is sailing

against the wind. In the case of sailing against the wind, you are also using four forces to actually

create a very strange, well, or paradoxical movement. But there is like a cost. And the cost

relates to a dispersion you do in the fluid, where you can do the sailing. The thing with

the sailing against the wind, the four forces is that there is no constructive knowledge to build

on top of. So if you then start doing that with things like machine learning, you can actually

see how you can create an evolution of creativity. But yeah, you're right. Actually, my date is not

yet here. So I keep going until I have. So I so I so I don't I haven't heard of this thing called

the four forces system of creation. I looked it up. And are you talking about the four basic

forces of physics like gravitational force, electromagnetic force, nuclear force and strong

nuclear force? I'll send you the link of my. And so because the whole idea is that the four

forces always work on workspace, but workspace is embodied in the space. Well, there's a there's

a system that tries to create the use workspace, but there's also an environment that has influence

on that workspace. In case of sailing against the wind, the four forces are like this. You have

first it's called lift and drag. So those are the forces on the sail. And what happens if you

combine those two? Well, if you play with those two forces, you can actually create a force that has

like a 90 degree angle against the wind. But you are not yet against the wind. So it seems impossible

to sail against the wind. So what actually happens is that you are in a medium, your boat is in the

water, and there's like this keel in the boat that makes the boat go only in one direction,

basically. So it's easy to go back and forth, but it's hard to go sideways. That's what you have

with the boat. That's why you turn a boat if you want to go in a different direction. So what you

do is you put your position in the boat in such a way that the lift force like this 90 degree

angle against the wind has maximum effect on the viscosity of the water. And the viscosity of the

water will actually be a reaction force. And so that's the cost you pay to actually move

across the 90 degree angle. And then you cannot sail straight against the wind. What you need to do

is like zigzag all the time. So, and if you translate all that kind of forces to how we learn,

you actually get to understanding how there's a feedback structure on learning that allows us to

create novelty. So creating something fundamentally that doesn't exist yet in your existing knowledge.

But I'll send you the link to the PhD so you can actually see the forces, see how it works,

and how I make the link with this and Covenition.

Okay. Okay. Okay. But I just want to say that I am not hearing like a counter argument to what

I'm saying that, and I've had further thought. So the argument was that, you know, electromagnetism,

the electromagnetism in the brain, the electrical storm has no way to decode information

that the neurons are passing to it. It would, and I think it would, if like, if you're combining,

you know, information together that it might, yeah, it's like, I don't, so yeah, so if you

look up information theory and decoding, like, that is just, that's essential for an observation

to happen is that the information that's received has to be decoded for in order to be transmitted

has to be encoded. And if you don't have a physical mechanism to, to follow you, but they do make one

big mistake. And that mistake relates to the concept we know in cybernetics as bootstrapping.

And the best example I can give is called the bootstrapping compiler, where you actually create

a non-existing compiler in a language that doesn't, is decoded yet. What you'd make

a trick, what you will do is instead of creating a compiler, you create an interpreter in that

language. So that's a virtual space. But in that virtual space, you actually give the,

the program itself as, as input. And what it will do by the recursive structure, it will actually

create a compiler in a programming language. You never wrote one code line of code in,

because it's bootstrapping itself through itself. So it's, it's like the snake eating itself. If

you start playing with that idea that if you can create a virtual space that can decode, that then

can actually create the code to, to run itself, you actually solve the problem. And that, that's

like, that's why I'm referring to the whirlpool as, I mean, first the fluid is just going in any

direction. But as soon as you create that, that feedback structure, so you can be, start playing

with that. And if you go to information, to programming, that playing with recursion is

something we do all the time. But it's pretty ill understood outside of the, the main of

programming modeling. So the thing that I, that you need to do then is use a lot of the programming

modeling techniques to understand how we can understand cognition. So I know it's, it, it,

it requires quite interdisciplinary approach. And that's, that's the biggest challenge, I guess.

Oh, okay. So you're, you're, you're saying that the, that the

topology of, of the ionic activity in the brain is like a whirlpool that is,

is, is, it's, you're suggesting that somehow it's gathering information and transmitting

information and understanding information? There's an advanced case in, so if you look

up convection cells, you will see that convection cells. So that there is actually a Nobel prize

in chemistry in 1977 given to it because it was breakthrough science. But it's the thing that

you see, so the convection cells show you how a system far from equilibrium can actually start

self organizing. So that's, that's one aspect, but the convection itself, itself doesn't yet tell

you how it's coding. There has been an advanced experiment where they start heating the sides

of those convection cells. And what happened is, depending on a certain temperature,

you actually get a different pattern. And you see clearly, purely from topology,

how information is coded in flow. And that can easily happen in your brain as well.

The, the, how then that kind of patterns start changing the world is yet another bootstrap.

But if you, if you start understanding how that processing of bootstrapping is working, so A

creates B, but B is not good. It's, it's artificial and temporal, but the temporal and artificial

thing like a scaffold is used to create something structural. And then when the structural thing

exists, the scaffold can go away again. And that's exactly the idea of a scaffold, right?

I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry, I'll pause. I need to take a break. You go ahead and respond

first. I just wanted to bring a couple of things back down to it. So as much as I like thinking

about the fate of the universe and stuff, I also like to make sure I can keep this shit real. So

when you talk about convection cells, of course, in everybody's house right now,

you've probably got some double glazing. So there's a perfect example of that,

the type of convection cell you're talking about, metal, literally a pair of,

an example would be double glazing and why you need the correct gap between the pains of glass

is too small. Then you've just not got enough, you just not got enough depth of air to be,

to be a depth of an insulator. And then when the gap between the glass gets too big,

you start to get these convection cells set up. They emerge in the space and then they create

a transport mechanism from heat, from the cold, out of pain, off the way from the hot inner pain

to the outer pain, through conduction and convection. I mean, that's a perfect example of

something that's actually in people's home, right? That's a nice one. I didn't know that one.

But yes, those are also convection cells. But you are talking now about convection cells of air,

right? Yes. If you go to the original experiment, because you try to make it as visible as possible,

they use oil. And so heating up the oil actually leads to this honey cube grid of cells transporting

heat from the bottom to the top. So the glass is a very good example. Thanks for that, Ben.

Yeah, you can see it. It edges with a puff of smoke. So that's that. And then there was another

thing that Micah just said that really made me think of another example where we can really

simply bring it back down to earth. Micah, just remind me what you said at the end of what you

said, and it will spark the recall of that once you're lost in mind, is it?

I was thinking about how the brain is a whirlpool of activity. I asked if it was

gathering and then transmitting patterns, but also maintaining its own equilibrium.

So I guess the point was that a convection pattern is, I guess, it's gathering a pattern

and transmitting a pattern. That's an example. Back to your brain, back to the observer who

sees it. So I guess you can make an argument that there's a way to transmit patterns,

but sort of like from... That's interesting.

And I guess I didn't trigger Ben to remember.

Yeah, not quite. I'm looking at the clubhouse thing and trying to balance,

contribute to the conversation with having a shave with realizing I need a shower before

my 9.30 meeting. So I'm just trying to listen in, but no, I can't remember what the other concrete

example was, but there was a really good just grounding example of something that Micah

when you were mixing in USA. No, so that's okay. That's cool.

Was it about the whirlpool of electromagnetic flux creating coding on itself?

No, it wasn't. I mean, there was one other comment about recursion is, of course, in

programming, you can express recursively, you can express iteratively. So if you can't get

your head around a recursive way of describing things, like the towers of Hanoi is a great

example. When I learned to solve that both as a program, but also as a person. I think Henry

is a toy shop with those three annoying posts with these decreasingly small disks on them.

And you know, your challenge is that you've got like five disks on a post with holes in them,

like donuts, five increasingly small donuts, making a little tower and you have to move those

all to another tower. But the rule is you never have to put a bigger one on top of a smaller

one. How else can you do it? If that's a recursive problem, a very simple way of doing it is you

imagine them in a circle, rather than in a line, you say, remove the smallest disk, one space left,

and then do the only other allowed move. And then keep repeating that. That's an iterative way of

describing how to do the towers of Hanoi, a recursive way that would be to say, well, move

one disk to another post, and then everything else becomes a sub problem. So recursion is about

like the problem being that when a problem has itself described as a sub problem, a fractal kind

of nature, you can be recursive, but you can also translate that to iterative. It's just

in some problem spaces, an iterative solution to the towers of Hanoi is a good programming

challenge, by the way, for any programmers out there. If you want to try and write some code to

tell you how to solve the towers of Hanoi, but you're not allowed to use recursion, I suspect

your program could be a lot longer. I'd be very interested to know actually, if anybody has the

knowledge, whether it fundamentally needs to be longer than a recursive algorithm. That's interesting

because that talks to compression and simplification and representation, but it certainly would

appear to be longer. So that's just another random thought I had of the recursion is not

sacred, if you like, it's just a way of representing a problem. And I don't know if it

impresses down to the same sort of size program as an iterative version, fundamentally.

It probably does because I think they compiled down to similar code with a good compiler, so

I think I've answered my own question, but it's stuff about compression and compilers,

and that way of looking at how information works is quite interesting because it grounds the

conversation nicely when you start talking about things like compilers and bootstrapping

compilers and the likes. Yeah, I like that direction. I'm Ben, I'm done. In fact, I'm just

going to listen in for the next five minutes because I've got to share one. Okay, thanks Ben,

and I like the way you think. So I'm happy we met here. I actually wonder if, I mean, now you

put that meme in my head. Yeah, sure, go ahead. You know how it goes on clubhouse, you never need

to apologize for not responding, right? And saying that, I mean, now we actually got this meme in

my head, like trying to figure out if the length actually says something about the compression

when it's a recursion. So I actually had this, I'm just going to share with me, it's happy hour,

right? I was combining the research on artificial intelligence. So that's one lab with the research

on programming modeling lab. And I got kind of in trouble with that because the two labs don't

speak at all. And at a certain moment, like when you're talking about this expressivity, I was

thinking like, you know, in artificial intelligence, there's a lot of interest in cultural language and

how that affects the thing you can express. So I was wondering, is it vice versa as well? Can

I actually start talking about programming languages and the poetic ability of a programming

language? And what I did is I started looking at different programming languages and finding this

very strange expression, you only have in one language. And then I give a presentation about

like the poetic nature of a programming language. And as of that day, I'm not allowed in the lab

anymore. You know, there was this great, there was a great, this guy, he wrote this programming

language that basically like, like, it's all like rock music. Let me see if I can find it real quick.

But it's like, every line that you write in the library is basically like a rock song. I'll look

it up. There are way more people in the room. So if anyone likes to come up on stage, let me reset

the topic. It's happy hour. So basically, you can talk about anything you want. We are talking

related to neuroscience, but editing goes so come on stage and let's talk.

I found it. So if you, if you'd like, if you look on, it's just called the rock star language.

And you can find it on, you can just Google rock star programming language. I'm sure it'll come up

or could you send me the link via Twitter? I just send you my PhD as well. So you should have

gotten the link. Yep, I'll do that. Hi, Dasha. Hi, this has been a fascinating wormhole of

whirlpools to listen to for the last 20 minutes before I thought I was going to go to bed. I'm

sure my nerves in my brain will have a lot more material for my dreams tonight.

Yes. Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really amazed actually after talking to Mixl.

My brain is firing because here's the thing. It's like, you know, one of the, one of the things

is like, you know, there, there is this, you know, the human being is a dissipative system.

Like we are vortex that there are oscillations in the brain. There's, there are cycles and feedback

loops and self-maintaining physics and the physics of every cell and the body itself and

in a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium. Like these are all

concepts that are sort of like tied into the, what, what the concept of a whirlpool needing to

you know, maintain its, its own order with the, I guess the topology of recursion was,

was the, was what Mixl said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that because when

Mixl said recursion, I thought of, wait, is he talking about like a recursive neural network?

What is, what is this? It's spot on with the dissipative systems really spot on. So,

so it is really like a recursion of recursions of dissipative systems. So, and that actually goes

back to topic discussions we had in 2004 on machine consciousness. So we had several people

in the field of cognition coming together and starting to talk about machine consciousness.

And, and one of the things that came out of it is like, maybe we really need to look at the mind

as a virtual machine like we know from Java. And now all nice and it's a good metaphor, but I mean

we try to get grounded. How do you do it as an applied scientist? And so when really realizing

that we are actually also in that kind of recursion with, with our culture, I start digging into

digital cultures. And at a certain moment that's 2010, I start interviewing every founder of a

starter baker system that was really successful between 2005 and 2010. And I was asking all of

them like, why are you doing open innovation? So my assumption was that they would have taken

the culture of open source development and just projected it on the business development.

But when I told them what open innovation is about, they all start like, okay, that's a bad

idea. We're not going to do that. So then I confronted them with the fact that it was happening

in the ecosystem. So how can it happen in the ecosystem? If that's not the thing you want to

have. And what we figured out is that there was actually a dissipative system at the cultural

level. So first the dissipation, what is getting dispersed is the ability to do work. So in open

source, you have the policy of community contribution, 10%, 20%, sometimes even 100%. You can

contribute to your own project in the community. And that kind of disperses all the codes in, in

relation to anything that can grow basically. But there was a second policy. And it's the second

policy that really created the feedback leading to, to the Whirlpool basically to the, so it wasn't

open innovation. It was self-organizing innovation. The second policy was that all entrepreneurs

were very aware that they were living in a fragile ecosystem and that their action as a, as a, as a,

as a, as a body, as a, as an organization had effect on the ecosystem and they needed to take

care of that ecosystem. So all the time they were questioning, if I do this from a business

perspective, is it bad, good or neutral to the, to the ecosystem? And if it was bad, it basically

was a no-go. The prioritization was always when it was good for the ecosystem, neutral, you could

do it, but good, you got priority. And by that very simple structure, there was this kind of

self-organizing innovation happening during those moments. After 2010, that there were a lot of

corporates getting into the ecosystem and I kind of got shut out of all the back office discussions.

So I kind of stopped doing participation research in that community. But just to let you know how

that, that cultural as the, it also has this effect on the, the awareness and the ability and

the embodiment that the agents below could do. I hope that helps, but it's, it's basically,

it's all about the dissipative systems.

Okay. Why, why you were talking, I was just, so I mean, I have, I have a, like I said, I have my

own, like, see, there's global workspace theory and there's different theories of consciousness

and, oh, Dash is on the stage. Welcome. If you want to say something, go ahead.

Oh, I mean, I was just fascinated by the conversation. I also am very sad.

Mick Selleigh, I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly, that you were ejected from a

group after you brought poetry and art into the equation about AI and AI learning. My mother works,

that works at the National Science Foundation as a program director in exactly the areas of,

you know, language and technology. And she's very fascinated by the fact that, you know,

cultural language issues are really what is for stagnating AI a lot of, you know,

in jokes, just cultural in jokes. And humor is just so difficult for, for truly AI to

encompass and possess. So it's, I'm, I'm kind of sad to hear that you were, when you, when you

were bringing these topics into the conversation that, that you, that you were met with resistance.

I'll let me quickly respond. Don't be sad. I mean, it's all rock and roll, basically. I'm,

I'm, I'm scaring people all the time by, by the fact of creating. I mean, I'm all the time. I mean,

the thing I really love is, is being part of that system of creation. And like the most recent thing

I start scaring is basically everyone around me when I, when I start moving up as a digital

sharp man. So I mean, I don't, I don't mind that so much that you keep on moving and it's, it's the

parts that's the, the essence, right? So if people don't want to continue that, that's okay. It's,

everyone is, it's their own issues they need to work on there. You can just keep on going. So,

but I'm personally sad for, for just the, the moving forward of that concept, because that is

really at the core of what needs to be focused on how we're going to get there. How are we going

to have an AI that understands and can create real poetry just beyond abstractions and art and,

and humor and, and language with playful learning and understanding. And yeah, it's,

I think, yeah, keep, keep carving away. And, you know, if you ever looking for an NSF grant,

you know, there's a, there are people in that area that, that definitely do care about those things.

So interesting. So very quick response again, that the, that I actually working on a concept

called Interversity. And it's the whole idea of, if you have, if you look at the, before the internet,

you had information locked up in books. And it was hard to be creative with that information. Today

we can create apps and be really creative. And so the information gets alive. And the same actually

exists with research. Research is at academia is quite conservative, locked in schools of thought

and locked in labs. But now it's going digital. You actually start doing creative research.

And I'll send you an article I have about the Interversity and how I'm trying to work on that

concept. So, so thank you, Dasha. But I see there are more people on stage. So take, take the floor.

Go ahead. Did I see Mark raising his hand?

I had something to say as well. There's a thread that I was following in quantum biology

that had something to do with neuroscience. And I was, I wanted to see if anybody had more

information around this idea of quantum tunneling and how that processes information or what it had,

might have to do with processing information in the brain and what it might have to do with

consciousness. I'm not sure if anybody else is following that thread. It was a talk at the

Royal Institute that got me onto this idea of a thread of quantum biology. It's all in neuroscience

and consciousness. So are you, are you talking about Orcor?

Yeah, yeah, Orcor and his name, but yes.

Well, you know, I wish they would, I wish they would say more. It's not, it's not, it's not clear

to me. And I think I'm not clear to a lot, a lot, a lot of other people how exactly the, the theory

is supposed to, I mean, there's like, there's too many, there's too many missing pieces in terms of

how it's supposed to, so my, I have many thoughts about this. So, so I, in terms of what the issues

are that I think they need to solve. And maybe, so with Orcor, like briefly, like, there's a lot

of research that's set that points to people having memory issues if their microtubules are

collapsed, right? And so there's a, there's a correlation between microtubules and memory.

And microtubules are basically kind of a mystery in terms of like, what do they have to do with

memory? They just, they seem to be just the structure that holds up the, that helps create the cell.

And so this, the, what I think happened, and I don't know exactly, is I think the neuroscientists

who came up with Orcor theory, he really needed a way to explain what microtubules

did that somehow related to memory that, that, you know, result, like when they were destroyed,

that memory became an issue. And so he, he came up with the idea that, that their structure was good

for storing and interacting with quantum effects at the, at the temperature of the brain. Whereas

maybe other parts of the brain would, would not have a structure that would be, would enable

information to, to exist or traffic back and forth at the, at a quantum sort of level. So,

so he created this Orcor theory and it's like, yeah, so the, the information could be stored in,

in the microtubules like a, as like a quantum vibration or something. I am not 100% clear.

And then somehow it could travel out of the microtubule again. And, and maybe even it could

be like a random fluctuation could travel out of the microtubule and it could affect the firing of,

of, of a neuron. So, so this is like, it's, it's just like a really sort of like obscure

idea. But I mean, I think what's sort of problematic is that there's, there's actually

an alternative explanation for why microtubules, microtubule collapse could be causing memory

issues. And that would be like the, it is, it is like, so like, like for the way memory is

thought to work is that memory involves basically, there's short-term memory, long-term memory. And

there's, and the long-term memory, you're gonna, you can look up like long-term potentiation.

You can look up long-term depression. And, and these are like the major mechanisms of

long-term memory. And then short-term memory is, I guess it's thought to be about neural circuits,

triggering sequences of firing. And over, over, you know, maybe 10 seconds. And, but the, but the

long-term memory, it's like, what has to happen apparently, based on, there's this research

of Alzheimer's patients where, you know, it's been, it's been like, for, so for a long-term

memory potential, for long-term potentiation, a long-term memory, you need to have, to store

a memory, you need to, a new protein has to be synthesized. It's just part of the process.

And in order for a new protein to be synthesized, there needs to be a space for that protein

synthesis to happen. And if the cell has collapsed, because the microtubules have collapsed,

then there's no space for that new protein synthesis to happen. And thus, a new memory

could inform. And thus, there is a correlation between the collapse of the microtubule.

But because it's like the support structure for the new protein synthesis to happen,

that's, that's, this is what I, so this time saying is like, there's an alternate reason

for why a microtubule collapse could be involved, could be correlated with memory that may have

nothing to do with the microtubule itself being a storage place for memory. So there's,

so that's, that's the first issue is that there may be just no reason for microtubules to do that.

And the second reason is that there's no clear, like, okay, so I guess the fluctuation that comes

out of a microtubule could somehow affect the, maybe the ionic charge of, so, so, so neurons,

so neurons when they, when they fire, when they create their firing pattern, it has to do with

like the separation of positive and negative charges. Maybe a tiny fluctuation that comes,

a quantum fluctuation could, could change the position of an ion or something and that might

affect the, the, the firing rate of a neuron. But it's just, it's such a subtle, it would be such,

I think it would be such a subtle effect that, and, and, you know, so maybe it, maybe it does,

or maybe it doesn't. But maybe the brain has sort of like random stuff happening at that scale or

even larger all the time anyways, and it just has, the brain is very good at sort of like

getting rid of noise. So if there is like sort of like signals coming out of the microtubule,

it might not be sufficient to, because the brain has like is trying to filter out noise,

so it can just focus on what isn't noise, which is information. You know, you have, the brain has

a separate noise from information. So I don't know that it would wreck, that the brain is set

up to recognize the quantum signaling that's supposed to come from microtubules. I mean,

I would like to find out, but I think we need more research and I don't know if anyone's doing

this research. But, but I think that's where we're kind of, I think, so what I just, I think we're

kind of stuck right now with Orcor and right now the neuroscience community, because, because we're

so stuck, the neuroscience community is not, to my knowledge, not kind of not really focused on it

and kind of like not trying to talk about it in the, and so it's not, it's not a popular topic,

because we're, we're kind of, I think that it's, it's really, it's a really hard sort of thing

to solve. And there are other things that are easier to solve right now. And another point is

that like, whether there is a role for quantum effects in memory or not, it doesn't really matter.

Because what I'm saying is like, memory is sort of the, I think that there's a really good, you

know, I guess they call it Heavian learning or the idea that you're, that your neurons are detecting

coincidence patterns and the coincidence patterns or like, or like the basis of, of, or the detection

of coincidence patterns, like the basis of detecting information. And, and so the idea is that

whether there's quantum effects happening or not with the microtubules, that doesn't change the

basic realities of how memory works. It wouldn't say, we wouldn't say that long-term potentiation

is invalidated or long-term depression is invalidated, invalidated, or that the existing knowledge of

short-term or long-term memory changes, we would just say, okay, well, there's additional information

that's coming from and going to microtubules in addition to what's already true. So it doesn't,

it's not a revolution per se, but it might. So, so maybe down the road, 50 years from now,

or I don't know how long there, people will say, Oh, well, there's this additional thing

where quantum effects are, are in, are, you know, have a sort of two-way traffic that are,

that are, that are involved with interactions in human memory. But it wouldn't, it wouldn't

change the, it's, it's sort of like it's, it's not, it wouldn't change the paradigm, it just would,

would add a little more complexity to how everything works. That's my thoughts.

I just got an insight when you told that, like, oh my crap, maybe the, the, the whole microtubules

are yet another dissipative system that exists below the embodiment of, of the, the, the current

understanding of DNA and stuff. It's kind of triggering my mind. So thanks a lot.

I mean, I think honestly that the entire universe is fractal, dissipative systems. So I just,

that's my feeling, but I'm totally aligned. I mean, so like a cosmos is a dissipative system.

It is a cyclone. It has a, it has a rotation. It has to maintain its equilibrium. It exports

increasing extrap to the surrounding environment. It has all the, that's, that's, that is, that,

that is, I, did I say cosmos? I meant galaxy. A galaxy, you can see, if you look at a picture

of a galaxy, it's a cyclone, just like a hurricane. If you look at the, the diagram of, of, of an atom,

it's a cyclone. These are like, so we have cyclones in the atoms and we have cyclones

in our galaxies and everything in between is, is a cyclone as well. A human being is, is, is,

is a dissipative system is a, is a human being as a life form. That is a cyclone in, on paper.

If you look at the physics that a human being has to maintain equilibrium or maintain life,

has to export increasing entropy to the surrounding environment to survive, to maintain

that equilibrium. A cell does the same thing. That's another cyclone. It does a human cell.

So like the entire universe is, is, is a fractal of cyclones.

That's so funny. I mean, one of the things that inspired me a lot. So when I was earlier talking

about the convection cells, so there, there is a guy, a professor in the University of Brussels

who got a Nobel Prize for that in the 1970s. And, and in the last thing he actually wrote

was a book in 1996 called the end of certainty. So it's the end of certainty, time, chaos,

and the new laws of nature. And I really liked the way that he's actually starting from the,

what we really understand from thermal, advanced thermodynamics to get a better inside of what

is happening at the quantum level. And that aligns exactly with this whole idea of everything.

It's like fractal structure. Well, fractal. Yeah. The problem is fractals are very often

just considered the, the recursive structure. Well, if you actually look at the essence of a

fractal is about fracture. It's about being rough edges and how you can actually start

measuring with that. So that, I know there's always quite some confusion of the, the recursive

nature and the fractal nature. But I follow you, I mean, it's, it's always, all the time, this,

this dissipative system popping up at, at the next emerging level. And that kind of aligns with

the stuff that the philosophers are doing with the emerging vector theory. The emerging what?

The emerging vector theory. So that's, that's, it's, it's something philosophers are, are pretty

heavy on at the moment. And to, to stop trying to, to, yeah, I'll try to look it up and see

if I can give you a link. But if you want, there is actually, I recently had a talk with a car,

a car called Alexander Bart. And we talk about things like tribal poesis and emerging vector

theory. I know he's, he's a big defender of those kind of theories. But we actually have this group

called the intellectual deep web, where, where we have like this meeting, this discussions

talking deeper on these topics. All right. Let's see. I was, so Carl or anyone else,

does anyone else want to say something on this pause? Well, I was more sorry, not to interrupt,

Carl, if you have something to say, go ahead. But if not, I just wanted to bring back the

conversation there to quantum biology for just a second and quantum tunneling in the role of, or

whether there might be any space there to discover more about free will, because it seems like there

is absolutely no evidence for free will and plenty of evidence against it. But I'm wondering,

you know, some, some of the questions that quantum biology bring up for us in consciousness,

have anything to do with free will at all? And so what might that be? I would like to refer to

Don Hoffman then. I mean, if you, if you look at the work Don Hoffman has been doing around

brain activities and eventually coming to mathematics of the free wave particle, there's

kind of, we have a very different way of looking at, at the, the whole quantum level. So, but

you may actually try to, to have a look at his work. So that's Don Hoffman. And I think it's

the case against reality. The case against reality, Don Hoffman. So I have a different

recommendation. I recommend a book called The Neural Basis of Free Will by,

Cryt is The Neural Basis of Free Will, Criterial Causation by Peter TSE, Peter Ulrich TSE.

And, and that, so that, so that, so he, so Peter is making the argument

sort of that. So, so it's like, so organisms are making decisions. And that our thoughts are,

our neurons are detecting, are detecting, you know, information, they're detecting

information as, versus coincidence patterns, and then, and then detecting features and, and

objects, and, and, and, and, and our neural networks are, are, what am I trying to say?

So, at some point, we, where our neural networks are considering information, they're considering

the models of reality that they've collected, and they're, they're predicting possible futures,

and then they're sort of like making a decision towards the, some future that they liked more,

or that you liked more, you like, maybe you like the orange, or maybe you like the apple,

but it's your, it's your mind, your consciousness that has received information,

considered information, and made a decision towards one possible future or another. And it's,

it's like, it's, but it's like that mind is not, I think of that mind is not separate from physics,

that decision is not separate from physics. And I think people get into trouble and say,

okay, well, well, you know, if you had, okay, so if you had no consciousness itself, no one

had consciousness, but our brains just made decisions, so like grab oranges or grab apples,

would any, would anyone like, someone else made up this argument, but would anyone like, you know,

need to, well, I mean, if, so if someone was conscious and they were watching this happen,

you know, like if we're, if we're in that scenario, why would we need, why would anyone,

if there's no consciousness, why would anyone need free will? So this idea is like,

the idea of free will came, came from, I think this idea that the free will is sort of separate

from physics, or that the mind is separate from the brain, you know, that it's not the same thing,

that it's not the mind isn't the brain somehow. And, but if, if, if, if you don't have a separate

self, if you just are one with the universe, then there's no separate self to be making

any decisions. It's just, it's just, you know, the organism that is you is making decisions,

right? But it's not separate from the universe. And so there's like, there's no conflict between

you making, doing what you want. And so, and in making the choices that you want to make.

But those choices are not going to be free from physics. And as soon as you like phrase it in

terms of like, are you saying, wait, are you saying that my choices are free from physics?

And everybody says, no, no, they're not, they're not free from physics. That's not what we're

saying. But aren't you saying like that my, my mind is not connected to, to my brain? It's like,

somehow like it doesn't interact with my, with my brain. It's not what you're saying. And then

they say, no, no, that's not what we're saying. It's like, it only works. The argument only works

if you don't let, if they let you prevent them from, from getting into the fine details. Like,

as soon as, as soon as like, yeah, your mind is based on physics, your, your, your decisions are

going to be based on physics, you're not going to escape physics. So what exactly are you trying

to say your will is free from? What is your, what, what do you need your will to be free from?

Do you need your will to be free from physics? Or like, really, like, what does it, what does

the idea come from? It's like, maybe, so I think, I think that maybe the idea of free will in our

culture is like, it's like, you know, my, my brain controls my hand. My brain doesn't control

my friend's hand. It doesn't control your hand. So your will is free from my will. Your will is

free from other people's will. And everyone has their own free will from each other to some extent.

And I think that's what it means. But there's no separate, there's no separate self to be

making decisions. There's just this idea of a self and there's like conscious thoughts that are part

of the process of making decisions. And, and with the quantum, with the quantum realm gives us, if

it gives us additional data patterns through Michael Turbiel's, you know, maybe, maybe it gives us

like some randomness, or maybe it gives us some additional information we didn't have before,

or sends and receive more information. But if what I'm saying is like, if all you're doing is adding

and receiving more information, and it's like basically like, it's like imagine, imagine you

have like a computer, and the computer processes 10 applications a day. And then you say, okay,

we're going to like add some quantum effects. All right, we're adding quantum effects to the computer.

Okay, so that's a quantum computer. What's different? Well, instead of processing 10, 10 files per day.

Now with the quantum effects, the computer is going to process 11 files per day.

And we're going to make an argument that that means that the computer has free will.

It's still a computer, even if you add quantum effects to it. And so a human being is still a

human being, even if you add quantum effects. That's what I'm saying. It's just like the same,

it's gonna be the same process. Yeah.

Following you all the way, Michelle. Just wondering if Carl is wanting to say something he's been

waiting for? Yeah.

Either. Yeah, no, I was, I don't know.

It can be, yeah, we can be enlightened through the use of multidiscipline infection.

You're breaking up a little bit, Cecile. And I think all Carl is also.

Thank you, Cecile. So Carl, the floor is yours.

Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

But I'm very well, Cecile. You're breaking up a lot about half the time right now for me.

Maybe I'll just cut off. But anyway, what I wanted to say earlier is that

and below that, the point of being. Sorry, Cecile, you're breaking up again.

Too bad you have this bad connection. So and I really want to hear Carl if you don't mind.

Hi there, no problem. The conversation's been fantastic. I've been in here for about,

I don't know, about 30, 45 minutes now. A lot of it has been over my head a little bit.

Not so much over my head, but rapidly expanding my horizons.

I don't have a background in neuroscience or philosophy. But this has been incredibly

interesting. And one thing that has entered my mind is as everybody's been talking and

giving sort of the back and forth and whatnot has been that a lot of this just seems about

perspective as in, you know, we were talking, talking about trying to define consciousness

and whatnot. And you know, we're saying, you know, rock doesn't have consciousness,

but then could a tree have consciousness? You know, a human has consciousness because

can can an ape have consciousness? And it just seems and then we went all the way up to a sort

of cosmic level or a solar system level. And is it not? I mean, this may be a very fundamental

thing that I've just never heard about before. But is it not just the case where we're really

talking about here is is perspective as in if you take a perspective of size and the perspective

of time as in if you take a tree, for instance, and you were to invite someone along who hadn't

studied before and to look at a tree and say he's the tree conscious and the person would say,

well, no, the tree isn't conscious. It's not it's not doing anything. It's not reacting to

anything. You show that person a time lapse of a day with the sun going overhead or maybe external

factors acting on the tree, then you would see reactions. You would see processes happening

as an ex as a reaction to an external stimulus. So at that point, then you could say, well,

the tree is conscious of something it has. I love that definition of of a decoder. I think it

was, I can't remember who was talking, I think it was Micah. Yeah, sorry, if I'm just mentioning.

Yeah, I love that because yeah, that kind of makes logical sense to my very untrained mind.

But then if you keep going up, you know, you say, well, okay, humans are conscious

to something. And if you go up even further, you say, well, a country, somebody mentioned a

country or state earlier. Well, if the state, if the state is is has these individual points of

electrical firings, which are as individual people. And then as a whole is then reacting to

other states as an organism is that they're not a level of consciousness. And if you go up even

further, you say the solar system, you spread across solar system, or a galaxy versus a galaxy,

if you have one galaxy filled with people or, you know, a spreading of people, different people,

different alien civilizations, whatnot, you know, we're talking about those bubbles joining together.

I think it was Ben, when I first came to the room. So that then again, you've got consciousness

acting. So then, so then in my mind, what you're saying is, and I'm literally verbal verbally

regurgitating you're trying to make sense of this, so I do apologize if this isn't very coherent.

At that point, then, are we talking about just when there is a lens is in when you have a system,

a chaotic system. So if you look at our brain, you have that chaotic system, even down to the

quantum level of things firing at such a level, which for our current technology is very hard to

map and predict. And then above that, you have a cognitive lens, which tries to make sense of that

and order it. And I imagine you have that you have that sort of, you know, is that is that a

the defining point of it? Or is there something special about us as human beings in our current

state, which defines consciousness different? You know, do we have something special or is

there something unique that happens, you know, either as a whole in the system, or with that,

that lens, that cognitive lens, which is, which is trying to tease out chaos, order out of chaos,

or direct a system of chaos, is this something special? Or does it just depend on your perspective?

You know, if you change your your frame of reference of time and size, could you classify

anything that's conscious? Right, that's the essential question. If you if you the second

you can define consciousness as some as you know, something is conscious, and something

isn't conscious, then you've proven to yourself at least that, and you maybe still can't convince

everyone else, but you've proven to yourself at least that that not everything is conscious. As

soon as you have a definition of what of consciousness that isn't absolutely everything,

then you then then you don't then you no longer have hand psychism, right?

I think that I like earlier spectrum, yeah, like that you were discussing about, you know,

that it seems more like a sliding scale than a binary with consciousness, or is that just from

our perspective, it looks that way from our current lens, you know, and that, you know,

past this sliding scale, it's just that we just can't see because, you know, on another dimension,

we're just we just can't see it, you know, we can't have them. Yeah, exactly. I had that exact

thought as we were. I was here listening is that we're defining consciousness given our current

referential frame, you know, we have we have eyes, we have ears, we have taste buds, we have these

senses, and we have the ability to introspectively sort of look inwards, but then you could just

as easily have an organism above us, which has I say above us just, you know, just as a reference

above us with an extra sense within it, you know, with the ability to sense, I don't know,

let's be ridiculous, the ability to sense sort of electromagnetic fields built in built into that

that creature to a degree where it could actually use it to sense and interpret its way around the

world. That different set of sensory inputs is going to give it a completely different sense of

reality. And it may look at us. And our way of defining consciousness is ridiculous, because

how could we possibly be defining consciousness or even contemplate consciousness without

while we're missing this unique frame of reference or this this sense that this higher being in

air quotes has. So then you're back to, well, it's just, you know, your point of reference you

happen to be looking for. You can you can define it as well as you can, given your tools.

You know, I just I just I just really I just really wanted to take a moment to appreciate

what Dasha and Carl are saying. That's just really beautifully said. Yeah, that's just

perfect. Like I just I appreciate that perspective so much. I I feel like I've figured it all out

personally. And so for me to hear other people say that they haven't is just wonderful. But I'll

I'll share it with everybody if you want. So like I so like I don't think that it's that it's

it's my my opinion and feel free to disagree. I don't think that it's the electricity in the

brain. And I don't think that that but but what I think is like so there's like the

there's this idea that consciousness, you know, we have models of reality. And the models are

connected to other models. And you have, you know, your brain is making a model of the parts of

your brain are making models of everything in your environment. You have you have cortical columns

that are recognizing a cortical column is is is bringing together like the 3d model of every

object of one object and another cortical column is bringing together all the 3d properties of

another object. And so if you pick up something like your phone, the cortical column is integrating

the visual information, the sensory information, I mean, the touch information, like how the phone

what how the phone is oriented relative to you. And so you have basically in the brain you have

all these neural columns working together to integrate all these different models together

in this experience that you have. If you if you take your your your room right now or your or

your if you're outside if you take the space you're in right now and yourself, those are all

those are all like every every object and every thought and every consideration, including just

abstract ideas are just managed by different neural columns integrating different pieces of

information that are constructing this like this movie this four dimensional movie where

but it's like a multi layer movie but it's like a multi scale has got all these different objects

in it. And it's and it's got like there's patterns of like you know what what are your

feelings where are your feelings? What you know are you feelings peaking they're all four dimensional

patterns to smell it there's four dimensional like what's the peak of a smell what's the space of a

smell every thought every feeling every emotion has these four dimensional patterns so they can be

described basically as a temple and spatial patterns and so everything that you can think of

as a temple spatial pattern inside a temple spatial pattern the room that you're in the

feelings that you're having and so we have the and but they're all they're all connected together

they're all interesting together you can be aware of all of them to to more or less extent

as you as you're as your focus shifts around as you you think about the room you think about

your feelings your focus shifts but you can be aware of the interconnections between all

they did the different feelings they're all temple spatial patterns the brain has the brain

specializes in temple spatial patterns all the electrical firing is is frequency patterns and

spatial patterns all over the place and all over this place is exactly what we would need if we

wanted to create a simulation of of a consciousness that was temple or spatial patterns but not only

that it's like it's like the these are not it's it's not the electricity itself it's not the

it's not really even the neurons themselves it's it's the the patterns which are just

information and they're and that's that's an important point because it's the information

is basically non-physical but it requires the physicality to move to move between but it can

be like you can have an idea anywhere in your brain you can have the idea of a of a cup could

could be represented by any neuro column in theory it's not the way it's going to work out but

but it's it's because because the brain is like a general learn it's like it's like imagine the

brain is like it's like it's not just like one piano it's like having a million pianos in your

head and so like any of these pianos can play a tune that should be here right and so when

neuro when neuro medical imagers look at your brain and say okay okay so which so which so

where is the the pattern that represents the sound that you just heard and and so they look for the

pattern and and they see oh there's a pattern okay let's look again let's see if it's if we got it

right and then it the pattern it's not it's a different pattern the second time what what's

going on here and then it's a different pattern the third time I don't understand it why is why

do we can't have the same pattern the same place every single time it's like different it's like

you have all these different pianos and uh when one when one piano is is done playing another

another piano decides to play that play that tune and so the information itself moves around

it's like virtual it's not even connected to to your to to one area or another necessarily

it's it's it it moves freely and so what I'm saying is like we have this like virtual information

pattern that's not the electricity of the brain it's not even it's not really even the the brain

itself it's just it can move around and and and so we have we have um uh but you don't but but it's

basically it's basically like it's not like information it's not like an information theory

it's not I mean it's not integrated information theory it's not global workspace theory it's

it's not it's not integrated map theory it's it's it's like virtual model theory right it's like

virtual model theory that's right at the end and and so the whole thing is like um you have these

virtual models and um and uh so so the the whole thing is like um uh um but yeah so it's like

I love I love that your piano analogy and your virtual models just made you sigh

I like I love I I love how uh I just um you're becoming the whirlpool yourself you know right

now and I it's wonderful um I have a question that I would love to ask about um thoughts on

this uh I work in in virtual reality I've been a performer in in a VR experience uh

uh for the last year and a half and uh I've been also seen some new things about being able to with

like neural link and um neuro like being able to control um games and you know computers or VR

with um with your mind in the future um and it has been already kind of proven with uh the small

amount of um hardware out there um so that is a topic that I would love to know if there has been

more going on and anything available right now with a user interface that's uh like potentially

a performer could have a different interface than an audience and if there is anything

uh if anyone knows any more information about that right now did you say neuro link

well uh I know Elon Musk is doing his own like thing with like controlling a phone with your uh

mind but there is a company called like uh lucid link that was doing like neuro gaming of like

controlling VR with your mind by there's like a device that you just put on the outside of the

headset on the back of your head and uh you essentially are just you know there there are

areas in your brain that are firing off when you think of with your right hand picking up

that object and you can essentially do that already with this uh device that has is just

on the very outside of your of your head on the back um it's it's it's not you know fine tuned

yet but um it I watched a demo of it on a youtube link that was pretty kind of blew my mind um and

as a as a performer in virtual reality as a live performer in virtual reality I was like wow this

could like really change the game if I didn't have to use controllers and um just it just seems like

a whole a whole another level without having a chip implanted into my brain um but um yeah just uh

since this was a room of people that that know more about all this I was I was wondering whether

anyone knows uh any further developments in terms of non-invasive uh hardware that is out there that

is picking up on brainwaves in order to use it for storytelling or um entertainment purposes

I in fact do have um so uh I was part of a room the other night when we reviewed a paper which

you which which I think you think I think you would totally like um and um it was it was called uh

oh my gosh let me look at my LinkedIn but it was called um like that's it must be late at night

because I I actually started talking before being ready to talk um let me see it was this

a really cool paper I'm almost there uh everyone liked my post yesterday okay so it was called

and you want you're gonna want to look this up um it's called uh hybrid EEG-FNERS based

eight command decoding for BCI application to quadcopter control um so this was like really

really cool if if you're if you're into uh the topic of controlling things with with BCI

they by combining two different modalities EEG and FNERS together they were able to

have more more control over the quadcopter than they could with just one modality because

because with one modality uh you um you would like for example just EEG

EEG your yours you're sort of like the more uh buttons you try to to to enable the worse

your your accuracy gets but with two modalities you can have more buttons without losing your

accuracy and uh so this is a really cool paper to check out that I think you would like

thank you that's exactly yeah I will absolutely do that

does anyone else want to uh jump in I I have one more thought but I can wait

I wanted to ask a question go for it go for it were you wanted to continue with recommendations

for Dasha first sorry it was I know I had I had I was can I want to connect to connect

something I was saying before to something other people were talking about before but I

but I can wait oh well I wanted to um refer back to something Carl said in response to you but

Dasha do you feel like you got an answer to your question oh for sure yeah I also would love to

go back to what Carl was talking about and also uh hyperspace the book was what kind of got me

thinking about like another dimension being just impossible to see so that's also a book that I

enjoyed that stemmed back to Carl's um thought can I say well I oh sorry go ahead

I go ahead go ahead sorry thanks my name's Chris um and I appreciated Carl um talking

about perspective mentioning perspective and I was having a similar question and like Carl I am a

little out of my league here but as an artist I've had a long time interest in sort of reconciling

actually uh scientific views and um primitive views and uh magical views I always kind of

feel like there's got to be there's got to be some sort of reconciling description so when

Carl mentioned perspective it um I was going to ask a similar question and rather than aren't these

a all a matter of perspective it's sort of I also feel like it's in a way it's a matter of um

description and sometimes that you know like there for example there's sort of a

uh might be useful to make a distinction between um sensitivity awareness intelligence

and consciousness and and information for that matter and because I and and it's easy to sort of

conflate different scales when you're throwing words around like this and um I feel like well

I wonder Micah if you've read the work of Ian McGillchrist who's recently been writing about

the split brain and and describing how um from his perspective consciousness rather than a state

that you either have or don't have is more like a process and I think this is similar to what you

were saying at least I saw a similarity Micah between this idea and what you were talking about

about these this kind of the freedom of these information pathways these activity pathways

and he describes in great detail sort of the relationship between the left and the right

brain in in what I take to be our most contemporary understanding of it and again I'm really unqualified

to to know that for certain but um but in this relationship between sort of inner self and outer

world inner inner sensitivity and outer sensitivity this this this oscillation

between relationships to the world to everything to reality there is a um

um there is a necessary process there in which um paradoxes are being reconciled you know

impossible choices are being made sensitivities are being understood and it's really in that

dynamic process that uh that meaning is is sort of generated and and if you describe it as a

process then you can also map it onto a spectrum or or or more like a space like a color space

there's a and so you can then talk about greater or lesser degrees and so I suppose on some level

you could go to the ultra subtle you know like a rock as like as close to zero as you can get

and and exist as a coherent um you know mass and then you could probably go in the other

direction up to something that that we don't really understand and somewhere in the middle is our

embodied uh norm um that's really all I can offer is just kind of a way of describing it that seems

to me to um the you can map a lot of different descriptions onto that it seems to me and I

when I read Ian McGill chris it was my first glimpse of feeling like ah this this actually

might be the the sort of theory of everything description that that all these different um

perspectives can uh can can find some sort of description so thanks thanks for the chance

so this is a fascinating conversation I really appreciate it does anyone want to uh jump in

after that or say something I have more thoughts but I'll wait for other people to go I mean I had

a thought about the fact that you're saying the rock is like the least you know in your perspective

the least uh if you're looking at a spectrum would be kind of constituting the least having

the least consciousness if I again would bring it back to perspective like carl was saying that

the rock is actually just part of the entire earth which you could argue has more consciousness with

how the earth and the rocks and the lava and all of the the whole earth itself earth as a matter

has a lot more changing and adapting to what is going on in the universe so um again I feel like

bringing it back to like frame or lens like carl was saying is um a very valuable thing to kind of

keep circling back to I like to connect this actually to something that was mentioned earlier

about by ben who who left the room but um there is this kind of also problem in cosmology related

to fine-tuning problem and so on and what I can see is that if you if you take like a what I like

to call an interface theory of everything so we can actually better start understanding how the

limited ability for us to integrate the the the experience um allows us not to fully understand

what cause consciousness in the cosmos actually means and um there is a very easy way to to show

that to people and that's by Joe uh I can't hear you I don't know if you know you broke you you

cut out right when you were going to tell us the like the essence of the everything um okay try again

okay so the so what I see is so so what I see as the interface of everything it's it's the idea

that we are boots the answer is 42 the universe doesn't want us to know some there's a conspiracy

going on here but he doesn't want mixall to repel the knowledge really mixall it won't let you the

universe will not let you tell us you figured it out I think yeah absolutely you're on the right

track clearly yeah I know this is happening all the time or actually wait more than you think

but three is a magical number so you have to try at least three times well for me four is a magical

number but and I actually discovered a bit of mathematics that shows that as well so I'm trying

to figure out why uh well at least three or four times go ahead yeah I like five

oh well I'm sticking to four the so what I'm seeing is is that the fact that we have this

way to integrate information and be aware of the experience we are having it always relates to

the way we can do that and understanding that there is like more consciousness in the cosmos

that we simply cannot fully understand because of our the way we are perceiving it all and

integrating it all and you could actually already show it pretty easy by just looking how different

people are in respect to empathy so as a as a we understand the world but I see other people who

were for example a lot of empathy related to the social cohesion and I can't fully understand them

and they can't fully understand me so already there there's like a disconnection to the things we

are trying to integrate so and one of the things I really find fascinating is that some blind people

have learned to use echolocation to visualize the world around them and so so they move more into

the the experience that also bats have with the world so so we don't even need to go that far we

can just look at each other and as mirrors and understand how each of us is limited in the way

we perceive the world and if we try to extrapolate that kind of limitless already between us to

limitless between me and a rock that's that's crazy and so I had this talk with Don Hoffman

about that because he's working pretty well on that interface theory and and so so between me

and a cat for example it's still doable I can still have like a coordination going on with me

and the cat but me and an ant that's that's already totally impossible and the end is living clearly

some kind of conscious thing so if you try to to to use that line of thought about consciousness

you really see how limited we are between by the frame of reference we have I mix a little speaking

um can I quickly oh no sorry go ahead car go ahead car thank you sorry

I've had a brain fart earlier while um or michael was speaking and mixed so that's the perfect

segue uh into what popped into my head is that if uh uh michael it is michael might pronounce

that correctly that's that's how I pronounce yeah that's right that's perfect um when you were talking

about the the consciousness sort of recognizing the system as in perceiving the system you're

it's not electricity it's not this it's not that it's not mechanical it's it's the ability to take

the information and pass it um I wonder if you if you take that and go further with it if you get

to a point in the development of a civilization where you could just classify consciousness as

as as the accuracy to a particular system as in you know humans may not even register on the scale

because although we're conscious we don't have enough accuracy in the system so so we can perceive

an environment around us um we just can't do it accurately enough so you could literally I wonder

if you know it's an inevitability that you just have a simple scoring system you know to what degree

can that creature can that being um can that being render or describe or process this x environment

or the environment around them to what accuracy accuracy but then as as michael was just talking

there um because you brought up empathy which hadn't come into my mind I had the complete

opposite thought which is what you define it as actually the ability to completely ignore

your current surroundings and instead take yourself out and move your ability move your your

have the ability to move your referential frame into like when we're talking about empathy

into somebody else's and that's that's a very different dividing line because then you're talking

about the ability to to take yourself you know if you say that person over there to take yourself

out and put your existence or your referential frame into into theirs which you know which is

akin to imagination and and extrapolation so yeah it's too completely opposite end you know

as far apart as they could be really um yeah well carol for me those aren't opposite ends it's it's

it is um it's like the two sides of the same coin so the it's it's like you need shadow to see any

shape so it's it's not it's not a contradiction it's it's uh it's a different in uh perspective

and um you really remind me a lot about the talk I did had with with with don hoffman about this

where the way he looks at it is also like we are filtering a lot of all the complexity out to actually

make sense of the things we love so so it is a combination of of because if you have all the

information at all the times you basically get into this entropic state where it's like everything

is gray right it means you there wouldn't be any taste if you start mixing um super uh the the main

dish and the dessert all together in a blender and then try to swallow that that's going to be

terrible so you need these differentiations and separations to actually have any kind of game

going on anyway um so but that really resonates a lot with with uh with um I'm gonna I'm gonna just

now uh send a tweet to um a youtube channel I have called deep digital friends and both the

discussion I recently had with alexander bart about the the the tropopoasis and the the the talk

I had with um don hoffman really resonates a lot with the the talks we are having here so

I mix a lot of speaking so if folks go if folks click on mixles profile and click on twitter

and they look at the most recent tweet they can see what is the tweet that he's tweeting right

thanks yes okay I uh I realized after doing that a few times it said that sometimes you know

people when you say check my twitter they don't exactly know they're supposed to click on your

profile first yeah click on the profile and then then the twitter uh I now I can share my idea um

so um so so um so the the practice to the idea is that um if we can define what consciousness is

and then uh then then we no longer have to say uh that um then then then then no longer do we have um

um what is it called panpsychism we don't have we don't have that anymore because because it because

it because consciousness has to be everything right um but you know if we can say if we can say

what it is now another problem so dasha and uh was dasha and carl or or did names move around but

so some some people were saying that that um um I just remembered it was the person in the first

column in the second in the like the second row and the person in the third column in the second row

sometimes names move around um so the so uh that what was said was um was that well maybe we don't

understand what consciousness was and and so then I came up with uh another theory of consciousness

which is my theory there's a bunch of theories right but what so what I'm saying so so my argument

here is that so um that was so um what you know I actually wrote it down so I wouldn't have to be

like stumbling around um so yeah so carl was a carl that was saying render describe and process

into what accuracy that was really great I wrote like I wrote that down too that's really great um

no no I was thinking something about is it is because brains are doing a very special process

yeah that's that's that's that was that was the thing that I want to respond to yeah so brains

are doing something very special so if you look if you compare a rock you see so the so the argument

from for panpsychism is that there is a spectrum from like a of consciousness from something as

simple as a rock to something as like a human being to something like a galaxy there's a spectrum

of consciousness and they there's different ranges right that that's sort of like the one of the one

of them arguments what so but those arguments don't include computers no one says okay there's

a spectrum of consciousness from from a rock to a human being to a computer then to a galaxy

they never mentioned computers and the thing is like a computer like the complexity of it can be

vastly greater than the complexity of an insect but the insect can do things the computer can't do

the computer can be vastly more complex than than than a mouse in terms of what it can do but

versus the mouse but it's not conscious you know we know it says the computer is conscious but why

not because there's something very specific about what what brains are doing that that computers

are not doing yet so the computer can can render it can describe it can process to what accuracy

though but i mean greater accuracy of the human beings right but so why isn't the computer conscious

yet and um and that's where i think this this you know this idea that we we are that our our brains

are doing something very special that rocks are not doing that we're creating models of reality

but we're but we're we're creating models of reality that are are able to because of the the

because of how the brain works they're able to to slide around and move around and connect with

other models of reality and all the models of reality are able to interact with each other so

you can see you can have you can have a cup right and maybe that's represented by part of your brain

and then when you throw it from your from your right hand to your left hand guess what has to

change see now see when it was in your right hand you had all of your uh you you had your you had a

neural column that was representing your hand and the cup together the right but it was representing

the right hand and the cup together well the right hand is not located where the left hand is

located in your brain so you toss the cup over to your left hand now you have to have a neural

column that's that's that's talking to your left hand that's integrated in the bottle that's in

your left hand even though it is the same bottle that was in your right hand so the brain activity

has to change it's it's like it's like um it has to move around so as stuff moves around in your

environment it has to move around in your brain and um and there's a rock is not doing that that

is but your mind is minds are doing that and so that's a special thing that minds are doing that

rocks are not doing that computers are not doing and and um and so and so if you know that then you

can then you know to yourself you can prove to yourself that panpsychism is is not it that's

all that's it i'm micah and that's it i wonder if because you were just talking about computers

they're having the accuracy and the perception but still it's it would be difficult to argue that

there's consciousness there as it's getting a little bit into ai and the techniques that um a lot of

ai companies are working on but i wonder if it's just because there's too much accuracy there's not

enough chaos there's not enough randomization in the system um for it to for it to generate something

which we would cause chaos it's too linear it's too ordered um yeah maybe that's it and that

leads on like i said that leads on to some places now discovering for for ai learning

that it's much better to give a very loose set of um a loose set of um orders or limitations and just

let the system work itself out in a chaotic sense well that's kind of funny that there is a uh a

session by uh wait a minute it's called criticality and complexity and it's exactly what describing

this difference between uh on the one hand you have a lot of entropy on the other hand you have

uh no entropy so and um but complexity is in between it so i'll i'll try to give the link

with my twitter actually just give the previous link with the twitter uh where you actually

go into the mathematics of cosmology on how you can understand the emerging of complexity

as the interface between low entropy and high entropy i'll i'll pinpoint the exact moment

they start talking about that and showing the the the science the the mathematics of it so

check my tweet in a few seconds fire my profile i do like the theory that there just hasn't been

enough allowed to the computer like we haven't feted the chaos of the of the universe enough

wasn't there um some uh something that happened with two computers that uh they were they

were allowed to kind of talk back and forth and make their own language and they started doing

something so outlandish that they had to like shut the whole thing down because it was like getting

out of control um oh man i wish i could remember what it was but it was it was some sort of um

experiment with um i don't know whether it was like a translation system or just two computers

were that were allowed to communicate back and forth and um they started making up their own

language that became so separate from what the organizers of the research were doing that

they got nervous and just shut the whole thing down but um it's that's what it's reminding me of

uh who anyone want to respond to that i think dash was just describing when my lexa accidentally

picks up my Siri and they enter feedback no this this was something that was uh that was a study

that they were doing that then um they were you know just getting i guess nervous that some

they were getting too close to a singularity and um just just shut it down but um i think i remember

that story and i think these two computers were um started to sort of manifest what appeared to be

malevolent language of some kind yes yes that's yes that's what i'm thinking of this exact story

yes i don't remember the details either but it was quite remarkable but um i guess while i'm on if

it's okay i'll just i just want to micah i really i really enjoy listening to you i mean i and i

i just feel like i still feel like there's some sort of language there's some where the language

is sort of a hall of mirrors and you're you i understand if i understand what you're saying

that you know that if you understand this mechanism there's no more panpsychism and and i just keep

thinking well it just depends how you want to describe it really like i'm not so sure why

um you can't talk about you can't in any given scenario can't you can't you talk about extreme

degrees i suppose i would agree that there is a point of absurdity where placing something on a

on a graph is just is just meaningless because it's in a whole other but but it's still it still

can be um i don't know i think there's i think i get you there's a poetic value i find a poetic

value you know but i know that's not you guys are this is not a poet's room so i'm just gonna

listen thank you i really oh yes it is yeah we're just joking we're just joking around this is happy

at all but um i i you can you know you can tell you if you want to share a poem you can i i i think

but um i don't know i don't know who's in charge maybe mixles in charge

no um i i would like versus i would like to respond um if i can

and i will i'll go okay okay um so i so um the uh so uh i like the idea that there's a spectrum

between uh the smallest brain is possible and the largest brain is possible um

that between an insect's brain um and uh or between just like a basic nervous system or basic

or basic uh brainstem you know all the way up to the the really interesting complexities of the

human human mind and so i think there's there's a spectrum there with with um hardware that

matches uh that is capable of running a certain kind of process and and and that's the key there

there's hardware that's running a certain kind of process and that would be like most uh most of the

brains and so there there would be a spectrum of consciousness from conscious to unconscious um

and it would it would um and i don't know exactly how that spectrum works but but um but i imagine

the small of the brain the the i don't want to just i don't want to even finish that thought but

but i just like i imagine there's some sort of spectrum there between brains but but not

but a rock wouldn't be included because a rock is a different process so that's that's what i'm

thinking i hear you as the son of a librarian i appreciate your categorical neatness i totally

hear you loud and clear thanks i wonder if um maybe proper in in inverted commas um consciousness

and awareness will be achieved um once we actually merge and melt in some form or another with

computers um in some sort of android or cyborg uh instance because then you have the accuracy

to potentially perceive or maybe you know if you're talking about um hardware adding hardware

to the human body maybe potentially perceiving infinitely um but then the chaos of the human

mind underneath and the ability to dream and imagine and be empathic so i i've started to

i've started to vote in my life to doing three things um one is to solving neural ace or nerve

gear basically the ultimate brain computer interface that plugs you into the matrix or

allows you to uh experience ar and vr just via direct brain stimulation and closed loop therapy

the second thing i am planning to do is to create artificial cortex so if you are missing part of

your brain then you could just replace it with our artificial cortex or you could extend your brain

into a larger brain with this artificial cortex which interfaces with your brain naturally and

processes basically information the exact same way and um it could be but not necessarily with

the same hardware but basically with the same function functions and um that would that artificial

cortex would be capable of of conscious of being a component of consciousness and then the third

product of course is artificial brains that would be entirely separate but also capable of consciousness

and um so so so what i'm saying getting to the point is that i believe that we could

create the process that that brains have that enables um uh what what i'm defining as consciousness

what what what i think we are thinking of as consciousness but but but it's difficult to

describe i think we could take that process that experience and i think we could we could bring

that process into a computer and make a computer conscious current computers don't have the right

architecture uh software architecture um and uh and and and they have too many hardware limitations

at the moment but future computers will have um vastly improved hardware computational hardware

and uh and vastly improved um software and that software and a new uh neural networking

architectures will um will enable true uh consciousness uh the way the way human brains

have conscious human level consciousness and beyond in computers that's that's what i said i

believe but i don't think that chatbots um will accidentally become conscious ever because it's

not my structure can i ask you a question about that yeah that your your statement um

again i i would i'm interested if you have if you are familiar with ian the gilchrist he's

actually a psychiatrist but writes um about the neurobiology of consciousness really really

interesting to me but um one of the things that he mentions and i've also heard mentioned in other

discussions of the nature of human consciousness is the

the vitality of embodiment in the process and so um you know because we're getting all this

sense data and we're interpreting it as you beautifully described with all of this um

i forget the exact terminology you use but i was sort of visualizing this kind of almost

projection mechanism where we're applying a tremendous amount of information that we already

have association some of it is correct and some of it is in error probably um so we have this kind of

very complex reality that we're both experiencing and interpreting and um affecting so it's this

kind of real-time complexity that involves embodiment as a crucial component so how does

that how does that fit into your your proposed model of um hardware complexity consciousness

that's my question yeah yeah um so i have thoughts but i'm uh i'm a little slow right

now because it's late so let me just um leave it open for a minute and i get led other people to

uh maybe either answer that or share some thoughts and and then i'll come back to that

i think it's late everywhere yeah

it's way late here i really should be asleep but this is too interesting i know same i was

about to go to sleep when i just popped in here and this is it's impossible to leave

i it's off it's noon in brussels now so but i jumped in it was morning so

i mean i have a separate kind of question about um neural neural healing um which is

completely unrelated so after i don't want to you know bring in a whole other topic though if we

were in the process of wrapping other things up i'll throw it out we could just vamp with it for a

while this is day here sorry dasha i have one question big sorry to jump in for mika just now

about the consciousness for the machine itself when there is a situation uh when a machine

needs to make a decision how did the mechanism or or method a machine can make a decision based

on a certain value so the value system of the machine how you teach the the machine to value

a certain situation like human do okay so um so that so there's uh there's there's there's a lot of

a lot of work um that's been done by other people that i can sort of talk about that that um that

could be relevant the answers the answers are on different scales of magnitude depending on your

level of focus um there's many different scales of answers related to to this to this so i could

talk about um you know like there's that like you know how how like at at a at an architectural level

how the the future neural networks will will make decisions in a granular way uh based on

some analysis of how the brains make decisions in in an extremely granular way at the at the

neuron and neural circuit level but but that's one level of focus another level of focus is is to

um you know basically how will machines um um learn uh all the relevant information and um

and so there's a work of um you know many neuroscientists and that's right there are many

deep learning engineers who who uh want to basically create uh who who want to train

artificial general intelligences um to not only do this to not only like be able to at least do

the same things that children can do but um but sort of like raise artificial intelligence as as

as are the way you would raise the children first and then turn and then turn that child

into an adult but walk them through basically a lifespan of of training in in sort of like the

same sort of like you know along with you as um as maybe you'll be a virtual being or a little

robot but it will learn along with you over over the course of a lifespan and and maybe you have

many people have little robots with them and the the the robots will learn sort of like knowledge

at the temporal pace that human beings are so they learn to understand that you know because it

takes a human being uh you know 20 plus years uh to to learn some things you know right sometimes

it takes a human being 30 30 or 40 plus years to learn some things you know I'm I'm only 40 so I

mean I imagine there are things that I won't learn until I'm 50 right because it takes 50 years to

learn those things um and um and uh so so uh but but you know but but maybe um uh once we have one

machine that has gone through that journey with us as human beings and and understands um the

information that matters to us the way um the way um we understand it then then perhaps we

we could um sort of just copy that machine and copy their knowledge and and uh the way you copy a

hard drive and maybe at some point we'll be able to read of course read and write to the human

brain as if it was a special kind of hard drive and and we could we could pass along advanced

information uh to other human beings digitally um just by plugging their minds into the computer

here you go here's there's decades of knowledge and maybe maybe at some point future human beings

will will have the equivalent of of of millions of years of knowledge uh and or maybe trillions

of years of knowledge because because because at some point you could have these uh these computers

that have been trained to understand everything that human beings have uh sort of like um you

know go through like some sort of hypers hyperspeed hyperspace virtual program in which they they can

do um they can live in in virtual civilizations um at uh at light speed compared to the pace of

life on on outside virtual reality and uh and when they come out of that um they've they've

lived a vast you know a vastly longer amount of time than than any human being has ever lived and

and then and then that knowledge could be um pulled out of them and and and passed on into human

beings so human beings in the future could could have trillions of years worth of knowledge

that was acquired virtually um through um uh robots that learned to to be humans by living with us

i love that concept that's very reminiscent of um the egg by andy weir which is a a wonderful

sort of short story um that's that's like like my mind what you just said just said

so um those are examples of of robots that are embracing the the knowledge of embodiment which

so so many people feel so essential and so critical to consciousness um i'm of the mind that uh you

could have an alternative form of consciousness based upon understanding my understanding of what

the conscious the conscious process is as a process that is a process that's independent of

the the of the the data that's coming into it that's my understanding so that so that so you could

have a virtual environment or you could have just like abstract stock data you could have um i mean

what what what is what would be important to the brain is the ability to make connections between

different types of of of data so that there's a multi-dimensional representation um that happening

but but there could be a conscious consciousness of a multi-dimensional representation that is

unlike anything that we we experience as bodies as embodied consciousness and that could also that

other alternative consciousness could also be conscious but in but in a different sort of

dimension of reality so do you think that that consciousness as you understand it requires

a physical substrate of some kind like a does it require hardware yes um yes it does but only

because there's no way to separate information from physics information is non-physical but it's

like a pattern but it's never not embedded in physics it's never not right but what about

like a radio radio waves what about a carrier wave what about some sort of um yeah so there's

still physicality there i i i understand where that could go but uh but um

disembodied as we might think in the solid sense so with so with the radio wave there's two parts

right there's one one is the wave and the other is the information and even in even in the radio

wave it's like you know it's like the the radio wave itself is just like a cd-rom and um and the

information is just a pattern in the cd-rom or in the radio wave and so it's the same sort of it's

so it's just um it's just not it's not it's not a solid cd-rom the problem i have michel with that

view is that it's too concrete of course we know cd-roms and computers and how we store

information over there but we at the moment still have really no clue how we touch into

information with the brain and i was following chris i don't know chris right chris yeah chris

i was following chris with what about radio waves the so the way we approach it uh from from from

our research field which is systems and cybernetics is that um it can actually first of all be

described as a system and a cybernetic and that so systems and cybernetics is basically something

virtual but it's about um creating somehow a recursion into a system you can create so i i i

mentioned earlier um you can actually create a virtual machine as a scaffold to create something

in that virtual machine that can build an actual machine stuff like this is happening at the moment

as well so so i want to disagree with something that was said that makes us sad so um i and purpose

like whenever like whenever i hear anybody say we don't know i always react internally like i should

tell them to just say i don't know and to never say we don't know because if they don't know they

can't speak for everyone else they don't know what everyone else knows no one took a survey of

everybody um but but what i want to say is that we is it is that um it is known by at least some

people how how the information how the brain detects information um and uh so you've heard of

hibian learning you know there's there's um neurons detected uh coincidence patterns

neurons detect when two neurons downstream fire that is the detect detection of information that

that is in a book called the neural basis of free will and uh so that's known not unknown

so and what is known there is that uh something can create a pattern that something can recreate

that's the thing that's the only thing we know no no it's no it's it's that the that information

can be detected as coincidence patterns and then considered by by neural circuits and then so

that's coincidence patterns that's the essence as a coincidence pattern so that's cybernetics

i can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing i'm not sure do you want to hear a poem i wrote

the thing is that but but that's the thing that that's been described in the 90s 20s and that's

what we mean with with the we if i was referring to the we i was referring to the group that

actually started school of thought related to systems and cybernetics and i mean they made many

misconceptions like every new school of thought it it all has evolved and to today we talk more

about complex adaptive systems and evolutionary cybernetics so so but it's still basically the

same it's the same that there are patterns you can see across domains across disciplines

which you kind of start understanding as a kind of laws of nature but in the 90s 20s 30s so that's

the found founding moment of the the the the cybernetics they started understanding that those

patterns are you can describe them in a virtual way and they still say something about reality

so if you create a recursion between those two you can bootstrap it and that's what i've been

trying to say earlier like what the things we're doing with something like a bootstrapping compiler

or or what we're doing with scaffolds when we build physical buildings it's we create scaffolds

as a temporal weak structure to create something more stable that can exist once we created the

feedback and once we created feedback we can take off the the scaffold again and then the

building can stand on its own so so that's kind of bootstrapping that's the thing that that can

allow you to start creating from a virtual world like just an idea and then put that idea by action

in the world and you create scaffolds first and then the thing becomes more autonomous

all right so i want to go around the room and we'll wrap up soon and give everyone a chance

to say to say something and and before we wrap up and anyone who's in the audience who wants to

come up and say something before we go just um raise your hand and i will also send an invite

and then after everyone has said something we'll we'll go ahead and um you know because i just i

feel a responsibility to uh it's we we've had such a great conversation but i'm keeping everyone

awake except for except for Mexico's afternoon over and uh and and i don't know what time it is in manila

manila let's see what time is it but anyway so but for some of us it's we're up we're up too too

late and our sleep is super important and um so i'm i'm gonna like uh so i'll go ahead and and

pause and pause for myself it's been wonderful and uh and to seal do you want to say something next

and then then we'll just go in order then dasha and jessie carl chris mixle chain dave and etc

can you reset refresh the the room so that the order is uh for everyone the same oh okay yeah

everyone okay so i guess i guess uh dave is is uh is in charge of the room now um so yeah

dave if you want to go first and then mixle and then seal and then chain dasha jessie carl and

chris and then i'll invite the rest of the folks if they want to come up and uh so thank you everybody

that's uh the last for me and um i'll go ahead and let's y'all finish it up

i guess dave is uh not there so i'll sleep perhaps yeah maybe i don't understand you guys i mean

yeah for me it's it's it's been a great uh morning right it's it's known now i need to go eating also

so i have to do a lot of other stuff but it was a way to fun to to to leave and so thanks a lot

everyone i've i've learned a lot it was fun to interact with all of you i hope to see you guys

again and have uh continued the discussion so until the next time i've enjoyed it a lot and

i'm very happy to be here thanks it was a great conversation and very thankful to have listened

to all of your ideas and have met you today it's too bad i had a very bad signal i would have

had a lot of things to say perhaps in the new future we could do a new discussion again to

continue and explore what we're thinking about and researchers that has been shared in terms of

uh the connectivity of different disciplines and the complex

i think he caught up yeah so thank you

you're gonna next

moving on to dash yes we're dropping like flies here in our brains or falling asleep

perhaps um yes i also just thank you so much uh mica mixill for for having such a

a just a thorough back and forth when i joined this room that it was impossible to leave and

i really appreciate you um having a a conversation where you disagree but are challenging each

other in respectful ways um i in the future would love to um bring up the topic that i

didn't get to tonight about um the olfactory nerve and nerve healing with covid and the brain

with what's going on with covid that's an interest of mine and i have um some very good

friends that are suffering greatly so i have um a lot of um questions and thoughts about that and

i'd love to have a conversation done online someday with anyone that's interested in that

i want to quickly respond to that dash because like eight years ago we we actually tried to

create a project on food security you try to guess where and try to guess what we try to prevent

so i would love to to get in there we want to build a living city to improve food security

for the province of hebei and the top diplomats of the province so that's a province where wuhan

is located but the top diplomats really wanted us to to work on that but we got kind of cancelled out

by the the our own um well uh diplomatic uh uh frame from from europe so i'd love to tell you a

lot more about that and i would love to go into those directions thanks

yes you want to say something

falling like flies going over to carl

thankfully it's it's only 11 in the uh in the morning here so i'm relatively awake um this has

been a wonderful conversation i intended to come in for about five minutes because i was a little

bit bored and ended up staying for uh an hour and a half i think there's something about that um

it's been absolutely wonderful um mike and and and mixle you've been fantastic and then you know

dasha and and jesse and chris have been absolutely wonderful as well you definitely um helped this

ape understand a little more of the world outside of this cave um yeah and and my takeaway from this

is uh maybe consciousness is defined at the point where you can ask if i'm conscious

i'm still conscious thank you uh mike and everyone for uh indulging my amateur

dabbling are really really fascinating and i have a lot of a lot of things that were said this

evening are kind of uh fuel resonating which is all i can ask and i am actually going to leave you

with an eight-line poem about brain waves it's called it's called team brainwave action calibration

chant and you have to imagine it in a call and response but i'm just going to read it in my

sleepy monotone here so it goes like this delta theta alpha beta sequence switcher looper theta

gamma gamma gamma hey flash of insight for today theta delta beta alpha blossom honey from alpha

gamma gamma gamma gosh stage dive into mental mush alpha beta theta delta need a nap i'll see

you later gamma gamma gamma hey remember what you came to say beta alpha theta delta give me sleep

or give me shelter gamma gamma gamma gosh surf the curl of wishy wash uh cruise you just made my day

thanks that was amazing glad you liked it thank you that was cool anyone else is is that it

that's it i guess thanks a lot guys and girls thank you thank you it was great

good night

so

Hope you guys will enjoy this video!
