The multilevel concept of mind a self model with no sel

So for me, the multi-level concept of mines is, you know, at the at the root of it there's a sense there's a sensory prediction and a motor prediction coming together that eventually results in a body of causality that's tracked or a map of the general direction of where causes are coming from.

That is the result of basically predictive coding on that develops a model of the cell. And over time, the self acquires a lot of features. And then, it becomes complex enough that that the learned representations of the self can be applied to other humans. And what we learn about other humans can then also be applied back to ourselves.

But, I suggest that ultimately beyond the model of the self that's learned by the mind. There's there's no real self that's driving choices. Rather, the brain activity that multiple levels of selecting with making selections and at the highest level, it's the height of elements, we're not the hypothalamus but the hippocampus The hippocampus coordinating and then your cortex.

So human consciousness has specific identifiable, properties that differ from what your computers doing and that a computer can have can print representations to a screen. But the but in this case, the representations are printed by neurons two neurons. Where each neuron is its own neural network and it is experiencing a multimodal collection of data.

It's nodes, are becoming temporally weighted by incoming phases that are stored as

That are received as mechanical and electric vibrations, and magnetic vibration, and magnetic changes. But so there's a that's the multimodal aspect.
