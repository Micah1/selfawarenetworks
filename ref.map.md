  77: Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.

  81: I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.

  89: You, the rendering, and it, the chemical structure oscillating with the phase field of space are sharing each interval of the moment that is being rendered as the organism's map of reality. You, the virtual entity of information existing as phases (frequencies) are sharing this moment with your saltwater, protein, chemical body, like two halves of one oscillating nexus.

  30: I skimmed the article a little bit. Confidentially what I am writing about in my book is how the brains molecular structure creates conscious maps of reality with frequencies, the frequencies interact with each other, but the same molecular structure that produced these frequencies is required to experience these frequencies. I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence

  43: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

    6: The brain is wired in an interconnected grid. Connections at grid crossings are established by learning and signal flow through the connections are in the form of directed graphs. Matrix mathematics, used for representing equations, can be mapped to directed graph geometry. Therefore, the directed graphs in the brain are set up for complex mathematical formulas that reflect the real world. As such the brain and mind is an ever-evolving information set that mirrors the needs of life in an ever-changing environment (both natural and human-made).

  505: Our application domain is not the game of chess, or the the domain of a self driving car or chatbots. So our models are not of chess boards, or of street maps, or conversation topics.
  506  
  507: For AGI, the problem domain is a reward maximising real time, sensory-motor reaction agent. The internal models we need to build for a machine that operates in this domain is one of sensorimotor value maps. For each sensory-motor mapping we must model the expected long term reward produced by that mapping. It's a very simple, and a very generic type of model, but it's definitely a application SPECIFIC model, that FITS THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION we are working on.
  508  

  520  
  521: This is what we are are doing with AGI as well. We are replacing a thousand complex models for chess playing, and car driving and chatboting , with one simplified solution that does it all. But it's still a system that uses models, even if the model is v where v is a real number that models that expected long term reward of a sensory-motor mapping (aka state action Q value).

  596: I can build a robot designed to wander around a room. I can hard code the map of the room into the software. I can create some really fancy 2D localization sensors that tells the software exactly where the robot is on the map at any instant. I can then write planing software that allow the robot to plot a course from it's current location, to any new location I want it to travel to. I can test the performance of he motors and drive system so that I can now exactly how the robot will respond to commands to move forward at different speeds. I have built the entire model of the environment into the robot, so the software has no need to learn any part of the model on it's own.
  597  

  599  
  600: I can replace the highly accurate 2D location sensors, with far less accurate sonar range finding sensors, and bump sensors and write even fancier learning algorithms so the software can learn to estimate the location of the robot on the map at any point in time, instead of having to be told it's location. That way, more of the state model of the environment is learned, instead of hardwired into the system.
  601  
  602: I can take out the map entirely, and write fancy learning algorithms that allow the robot to build it's own map of the environment as it explores the rooms in the building. So now it's building it's own maps, and it's own location understanding from the sensory data.

  643: My Substrate contains Models of Saliency, Abstraction, Reduction, Success, Failure, Prediction. It has a trivial input mechanism that doesn't do Model based preprocessing although I am not negative to those in cases like computer vision. But none of the things I Model are problem domain specific. My systems would learn from video cameras that provided a map of color pixels that changed over time. No furter preprocessing would be required.

  706: But that's not true because we are still domain limited machines. There are real limits to what a human can understand and what sort of problems they can solve on their own without the help of "thinking machine" doing the work for them. Multiple math proofs have now been created by getting a computer to do the work for us -- because the problem is too large and complex for any single human to solve it. Like the 4 color map theorem.

  810  Blue Brain Project Accurately Predicts Connections between Neurons
  811: One of the greatest challenges in neuroscience is to identify the map of synaptic connections between neurons. Called the “connectome,” it is the holy grail that will explain how information flows in the brain. In a landmark paper, published the week of 17th of September in PNAS, the EPFL’s Blue Bra…

  61: the attention schema both defines which areas of your mental map your are seeing, but it also binds those areas together in sequences that your brain tracks with neurotransmitters and senses with corresponding soliton mechanical sound waves and soliton electrical waves felt by each neuron,
  62: other neurons are able to track the phase changes happening to other neurons whether they are speeding up or slowing down, and long changes of these detects are mapped by many neurons or entire neural circuits simultaneously because exit terminals branch radially in every possible direction they can go.
  63  
  64: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

  17: Category theory could be ideal for mapping the bizzare domains of reality such as communication patterns between cells, atoms, brain activity, and fluid mechanics because without precise knowledge of the contents of each node that we are attempting to graph we need to be able to have useful rules for mapping some level of abstraction to help discover the conditions & boundaries abstract relationships between invisible functions.

  9: I love describing neuro-anatomy in differential calculus for all the ordinary people I meet everyday. I like the sense of other people, especially happiness, love, friendship, kindness, connection. I like the sense of words, concepts, concept maps, mind maps, uniting the flickering of dendrites firing action potentials and neurotransmitters backwards into a synapse, a massive expansion of complexity missed by the early Artifical Neural Network ie Artificial Intelligence oversimplification of what neurons do. I love the sense of discovery, especially discovering something new that changes my world view. I love the sense of gratitude and humility for all the wonderful people I am privileged to be connected to. :) I love the sense of participating, and sharing in a conversation or dialog, to appreciate an important part of what makes us human, our sense of the world from all of our senses :)

    7: I like how in AN model, intuition is the emergent result from points plotted in a vector tree map that you can describe in category theory. I think she describes it in C and or Java, but I think it lacks the fluidity that could happen in a functional language like Haskell. Where node memories can create vector memories and The model free nature means that the concept is the memory of the tree's reaction in a sense. With Haskell and an 80 core processor one could have each node in the tree creating emergent vector maps with the other activated nodes independent of a centralized process.

  896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

  4  
  5: Mapping those roles to large regions of the brain is, I think, an outdated idea in neuroscience. The new thinking is that every part of the brain is doing a little bit of everything, at all scales. The brain is self similar everywhere (Jeff Hawkins talks about the self similarity of the neocortex, and the similarity of the Hippocampus to a cortical column) tiny learned custom variations in each part of the brain will serve to generate a natural VAE Variational Autoencoder effect for comparing learned patterns in one modality to same or similar patterns encoded in a different modality.
  6  
  7: Applying a region based map of brain roles to the brain could be what György Buzsáki calls the Brain from Outside In (matching observation to a concept instead of creating a new concept from observation.) György Buzsáki's book "The Brain from Inside Out" contradicts the typical "Outside-In" process of applying our models to the brain, instead of creating models from the brain.

  5: I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.

  8: A brain is making a map of its own electric ossilations and chemical reactions.

All the maps in the mind, of your hand and face and the cheese you ate, the people you were looking at earlier, they are all connected, and then another Hebbian map connects it all again.

The idea is that each thing in your environment is represented by a cortical column, and you might also have multiple cortical columns across each region of the neo-cortex creating their own representation of whatever you are focused on. So cortical columns in the auditory cortex are going to model the acousitic representations of the object you are focusing on, the visual cortex will render or model visual representations of the object you are focused on, and the somatosensory cortex will model the mechanical vibrations of touch, taste, and what you can sense inside your body.

Yet you could lose a limb, and get an artificial replacement, and your plastic brain, with the right neuro-plastic treatment, can remap itself, to treat the artificial limb as if it were it's real limb. The brain is not completely dependent on the body, you could conceivably create an artificial body, the perfect artificial ecosystem for the brain, and the brain would adapt to, to control it, to become that new body, your new mechanical self. The components of the brain itself, the cells, the proteins, the particulars, the myelinated axons, the glial cell waste removal system, the microtubules, the camkii2, the branches of dendrites and synapses, serve as hardware for memory and concept formation, predictions of causes, derived from sequences of patterns, from chains of data, that comes in from the senses, and the brain itself, in any particular part, is just a system of cells, a cooperation of rivals, working together to feed, it's a hungry glucose and nutrient driven system, the hungriest organ in the body, but the result, is the coordination of a body, including your fingers, and your voice muscles, for communic

  82  If someone stopped making effort because they believed their thoughts did nothing, well that would be a quiet way out of existence for some. Maybe they had no choice because of fate.

The organism must choose, the program is shaped by evolution in some sense is it not? So when we talk about choice, maybe it means something different then we think, maybe it means something neurological. Some people may feel like they have less choice, or less self control, or less ability to do things they want to do because of a situation regarding other people, or a situation regarding an diagnosis learning disability, or because of an illness.

  35: Factory automation is exciting - but how about space debris mapping? This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.
  36  
  37: Digantara is an Indian company focused on space debris mapping (Disclosure: I am an advisor). The company was started in 2018 by a team of engineers/entrepreneurs to create solutions to the space debris mapping problem. They were invited to present their business plan at the prestigious 2019 International Astronautical Federation (IAF) start-up pitch event in Washington D.C. This won them accolades, and more importantly funding. Digantara’s data products will prove invaluable for trajectory planning for future space launches, predicting when collisions are likely to occur, updating the debris maps and providing input to companies as they tackle the problem of space debris removal. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), a leading global space agency, provides grants, advise and technical support to the company.
  38  
  39: Current methods for space debris mapping are ground based, and use a combination of radar and 2d optical telescopes. The mapping is constrained by weather conditions, as well as lighting (cannot map during the day because of solar noise and at night because of lack of illumination). Short range mapping occurs with radar whereas the telescopes can only image at very long range due to the long integration times involved. Orbital mechanics principles and models are used to extract 3D data from from the 2D imagery, although these extrapolations suffer from from fidelity and precision issues. Atmospheric distortion further complicates the problem, with the result that earth based systems are unable to map objects less than 10 cm in diameter reliably and accurately. According to Digantara’s Chief Technical Officer, Tanveer Ahmed; “Digantara solves this problem by using LiDARs mounted on a constellation of CubeSats (small satellites, roughly shoebox size, with a 10 kg load carrying capacity). The use of active 3D imaging to obtain range information in addition to x-y location is a must - since passive imaging of fast moving objects at close ranges would require very large integration times, making the measurement useless. Additionally, LiDAR allows us to control the illumination period and wavelength, enabling significantly higher duty cycles of the mapping system. 3D Imaging in space allows for significantly higher signal-to noise (SNR) performance because of an absence of atmospheric losses and non-linear signal distortions”. The LiDAR is capable of imaging >1 cm size objects moving at speeds of up to 10 km/s at range of 100 km. Data compression occurs in the CubeSat prior to a RF based downlink to earth for further processing. A schematic of the Digantara system is shown in Figure 3.

  4  "What I like about Peter Tse's book at the end is he frames the question in terms of whether thoughts are passive or whether they have an active role in decision making. It's like are your thoughts just a result that the observer is observing? Or is the observer and the thoughts taking place active in the feedback cycle of decision making, playing a role in the activity instead of being a passive observer of the activity. The idea that the observer is a passive observer I think stems from the idea that the mind is seperate from the body, maybe, the idea that the observer, the mind, and thought are some how seperate from physics or causality or above physics and above causation. I think Peter Tse is not trying to prove that we have choice because of random noise, he is trying to say that information has casual power in the brain, because neurons literally read and write information patterns which allows information to drive neural activity and the brain.

Indeed, from an evolutionary stand point, this makes a lot of sense because it facilitates learning. During new experiences like learning to walk or speak a language or making mental maps of the way home, neurons make new connections. The more an activity is repeated, or the more learning involved, the stronger those connections become.

Yet you could lose a limb, and get an artificial replacement, and your plastic brain, with the right neuro-plastic treatment, can remap itself, to treat the artificial limb as if it were it's real limb. The brain is not completely dependent on the body, you could conceivably create an artificial body, the perfect artificial ecosystem for the brain, and the brain would adapt to, to control it, to become that new body, your new mechanical self. The components of the brain itself, the cells, the proteins, the particulars, the myelinated axons, the glial cell waste removal system, the microtubules, the camkii2, the branches of dendrites and synapses, serve as hardware for memory and concept formation, predictions of causes, derived from sequences of patterns, from chains of data, that comes in from the senses, and the brain itself, in any particular part, is just a system of cells, a cooperation of rivals, working together to feed, it's a hungry glucose and nutrient driven system, the hungriest organ in the body, but the result, is the coordination of a body, including your fingers, and your voice muscles, for communic

Individuality as a concept is not a complete illusion, but its also not completely real. Without the mind, there would be no such artificial concept as an individual, or an observer, but these concepts 'do not' have to have an objectively real reality to be useful. knowing that the observer is not really real, and knowing that the individual is not really real means that these concepts are no longer able to serve as the emperor's false clothing.

  196: Everything in your brain is raw reality, your brain is not separate from spacetime, that's dualism. If your point is that the map of reality in your head isn't the actual territory it represents who has argued to the contrary? Still the form in the map may be a potential existence just like the form of a rock, just like the form of an electron, existing in superposition without locality before it exists in a location.

  209  So again how can you be certain that the cosmos is objectively real and not just a probability (a potential difference between real and not real like an electron)?
  210: how do you that the whole cosmos did not exist in super position before it had a location? how do you know that numbers do not exist in superposition before they exist as a map in your mind? how do you know that everything isn't literally defined by everything else? aside from your axiomatic belief, what proof exists?

  228: Finally the point about the brain being like it's own programming language like Lisp was actually a good one. Reality is still a definition, even if the definition is more complex than just a prediction. The definition is whatever it is, and perhaps all the extreme views of today will be the moderate views of tomorrow. Who knows. With Ken Wiber's map of cultural integrations, what he calls integral life, it's clear to me that I don't need to worry about any of this. In time wisdom prevails, or we all die.

That expectation is a the basis of memory-prediction, it's how our mind maps reality, through sequences of expectations, that link cells together based on previous experiences. Memory-prediction is how information is coded in neural activity. That's what thinking is, a prediction, the whole cerebral cortex can be said to be a modeling system, of the world we predict is real, and all the models of the world we perceive with our mind through our senses are really made up of countless predictions, encoded in neural activity.

  10: ⟪ 1244 characters skipped ⟫ound have now fired, and inhibit nearby patterns there is now an association reaching out to another group that is the learned representation of orange-red. Each learned representation is literally a map constructed our of sensory input via space and time, represented in a three dimensional x,y,z axis in the cerebral cortex. If that exact position of the cortex was damaged via stroke, tumor, or other injury, it's possible that that map of spacial/temporal associations will be remade by another portion of the brain, provided your interested and committed to learning the alpha 5 on red or red-orange background association again. Your previous associations, in terms of mapped life experiences, are the basis of your expectations in life, that's the metric by which you judge your experiences. Who is experiencing your life? Well your previous experiences are. That's the narrative of you, the song of soul, the symphony of I am. New experiences can have a tipping point where the internal maps of associations that represent you under go a fundamental shift, the pattern that is you becomes more capable of interpreting life experiences in a useful way. Passing the tipping point, into a new internal narrative, is a threshold experience, many times means your going to be capable of handling bigger problems then you were before, or it means you will be able to handle the same problems with greater ease. It's your brain improving it's own maps, out of necessity, experience, so that your brain is able to represent alpha 5 on a red/orange background with fewer cells. Perhaps alpha 5 gets merged with the coffee shop you are always at when you see alpha 5, so that increasingly large groups of associations can be represented with increasingly fewer neurons at a higher level in the cortex, similar to the subject line of an email, or the headline of a news article, or the title of a paper. By the time we get to conscious thinking, we are at the news headline of news headlines, we are at the grand summary of grand summaries, the conscious thoughts are macro summaries of vast blankets of group associations learned through life experience so that no matter what direction you look, you can spot many complicated objects almost instantly, because they have all been linked via short cuts that use few cells to trigger vast networks of previous associations, that help you predict what is real now. 
  11: Micah Blumberg So information is encoded in neural activity via learned associations in bunches of cells, these associations are mapping our experiences, and providing expectations to other bunches of associated neurons representing maps of other internal representations, corresponding with life experience. In a way we are these previous life experiences, predictions that represent previous associations including association between maps of associated cells from all the other previous life experiences. The out put from these cells, when the neurons fire, is our expectation of what we are experiencing now, our expectations come to meet our new experiences almost like the waves coming to meet the shores of our nations. As the shore of new experience comes in, it's sorted by or into the previous maps of reality, until such a time when it's overwhelmed by the new data so much that a major change in the internal maps takes place, representing a change in a person after a very significant life experience. Pushing this threshold is something I am very interested in, that's why I do neurofeedback with brainwave entrainment with light and sound as my business!

The brain is continually shaped by the important life experiences, and the life experiences that dominant our sensory awareness over time. Cab drivers, after 20 years, for example have a brain that is significantly larger than the average population in the regions that are most related to their work as cab drivers. This might have an effect in terms of changing their MBTI over a long period of time.

  227: So the brain's neural process is in effect seeking, and the self is at the root a direction in the minds conceptual rendering, and above that root level existence of self, the self is the seeker of the way, and the way of the brain is the way of the seeker, and the self is the seeker who is the way. So you are the way, and you are the seeker, and the direction of the seeker, the causal body (or body of causation) is that part of the minds rendered map of reality from which causes emerge (the most consistently, since the self, as a directional concept, is always present.)

So I see neuroscientists being primarily concerned with discovering, their own anatomy such as mapping, they connect them in the major brain regions and then I see computational biology or computational neurobiology is sort of concerned with mapping the functional connectivity.

I'm well I'm actually I'm actually going through all the different sense sensory pathways. So I'm just trying to like understand the general map of each of the sensory pathways and today I'm just sort of like looking at the olfactory.

  101: It's that by the, it's different, it's it different in the face field, right? So color is a different frequency, but the frequency is to your brain, is just a difference, relative to everything else. And so, your brain has this sort of like, mental map of functions that are sort of, sort of rendering color based upon the comparison of contrasts and a phase field, right?

In terms of what you're bringing is focused on or rendering at that moment, especially if you can smell that okay, use every time about right now to actually. And so that's how to think of like, how your spatial map works is that everything you're focused on is taking up some percentage of your, of your brains and brains computations.

It's through the feedback loop of lived experiences of patterns forming connections that map. Basically, it's your map of reality and so, yeah. So I'm arguing that I is the resolution of of the patterns of of consciousness, but that consciousness is the looping of pattern defeat the narrow feet, the strange loop, like a feedback loop of patterns or neurofeedback consciousness comes from basically neurofeedback through the resolution of the pattern matrix that your brain is putting together.

It's like the, you know, there's a description of like, there's a ground of being, which is just awareness. And in this ground of being this, where all forms arise and this is, this is from, like, I think it's from Buddhism, but it's like, if you experience just the like, space of beingness and which all forms arias, that is a map of reality.

  19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.
  20  

  34  
  35: There is a spatial representation that's in physical 3D, that physical phase pattern is learned by the network as a whole and then represented to the brain to a higher level (as a tomographic map of sequences (note I said tomographic map NOT a topological map, might be defined by virtual & imaginary vectors (imaginary functional connections between parts of a learned firing sequence, but virtual because the locations are invariant, any part of the brain can play back a learned pattern.) A Neural Oscillatory Tomographic Map is a map of learned functions which are themselves maps of learned coincidence patterns.) The greater scale oscillators, the dipoles, the quadrupoles etc) of the brain to other neurons so that when the sequence fires. The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

And if you look at jackalance, work, you know, the semantic map that he created through, with MRI of where, you know, he saw, you know, a lot of brain, activity of people looking at pictures of houses.

  15: Okay, so welcome back about Alex. So I had a really colorful idea. I thought, well, what if I create a really colorful template? And the mind map tool, right? Of basically, it's like so going to like so, you know how, like yeah, I've been missing around. Pretty my own templates.

  25: I think I want to combine. I think what I want to do is like create a screenshot and then add it to simple nuts. So I mean added to the notes notes, the notepad. So a screenshot of the mind map. Because I think that's what I need to do is to represent the associated concepts from in a branches aspect and then put it in a sequence, right?
  26  05:34
  27: So it's like using that's like that's using a mind map in an unconventional way because then it's like you're combining the branch. The branching is just designed to show a relationship between two different ideas. A relationship that is in some sense shares, some minimum of isomorphism in terms of a natural hierarchy, with some other concepts.
  28  05:57

  30  06:23
  31: And that's why it needs to be included in this categorization, because this is sort of like a mind. Map tool is about arranging categories in a hierarchy. And that's interesting because category theory doesn't have any hiring but like yeah. If you can sure, if you could have transformations in a hierarchy then you could have like system would be at the top of the hierarchy and then you could have, you can have components underneath system and then you have entities and then you have the menu, you have the document.
  32  07:14
  33: Okay and maybe I should do that. I should make a mind map where I have. Like the highest level is the system code that applies to the whole hierarchy and then the component code which means that you have some code that only applies to some of the project and what it applies to those are the things in this hierarchy that it applies to, but you can assign but you would assign what it applies to not at the component level, but at the entity level, and that's the point of entities, is sort of be like a general target for what the HTML page is supposed to render.

  45: So the mind map is like, okay, so start with that summary to, these are all the low level pieces that connect to this bigger picture. And that's what the book is about, is a book is. Okay, so this is the hypothesis and then these are the pieces that add up to the hypothesis.

So it's like time-wise is like yeah so it's like if you're if you have a heartbeat at the same time that you have an alpha wave peaking and you put them both in a timesheet and you can just track the heartbeats and the halfway waves and correlate them through time that you have a map, you have that is like one example of how you can take one set of I guess unstructured data in compared to another set of unstructured data.

    49  periodic chart or the periodic table with elements that allow you to essentially understand what things are made of and composed of.

    51  07:18
    52: And so our equivalent to that is a semantic periodic chart for. Computing where we have two hundred and fifty six elements that map meaning units to what humans express whether it's words or or gestures or typing text or any any signal data basically such that we can then in real time competitively generate highly parallelized code the benefit being the the ability to see the machine produced results and and have that correlating to what you actually met.

   115: Well this is can and that is definitely fascinating to me from the standpoint of. Being able to map what is an accurate reflection of a signal that you can verify discreetly not simply as you know, some some textual or other representation but a signal that you can map to meaning and represent in a number of ways we render it as as what it would represent in terms of something that is an image like a black an image of a big cat as you you suggest it.

   136: And doesn't it matter then that there's a semantic representation that can be mapped to the individuals way of thinking. Yeah exactly so not every representation will be exactly the same and every brain. Based on different experiences based on different context data, and so on so. Yes that what what really makes that a big part of our focus of my team is that we've observed what what happens in computing with programming languages and how so much is not represented there's there's an a semantic representation sufficiently to to determine what what does this mean and and context of the the code writer or the person who had the the idea or what they were trying to achieve, you know, so being able to.

   393  

   541  01:44:27
   542: So so a very efficient way. To process data but perhaps more importantly it maps to to language both human and machine it can be mapped to signs symbols and and what we call meaning units in I mentioned earlier for those who weren't in the call or in the room initially we've we've mapped this approach to what we call a semantic periodic chart for computing that allows us to use 256 elements that are.

   544  01:45:06
   545: Antique representations of meaning that can map in both directions both to to natural language or or programming language or to signs and symbols but also to code and and thus so you think of it as being able to pick your methodology, whether you you are more in your effort benefit by expressing it a natural language or a programming language or.
   546  
   547  01:45:41
   548: A symbolic representation of what you mean they all map to the same definitive meaning to the machine and the benefit of that is is that you can support different ways of thinking different ways of expressing different languages different cultures and and within that those elements it it has certain specific representations that are not present and programming languages such as emotions fear anger.

So again, our third patent is focused on something we call level of detail. In other words what that essentially allows for is representing even in the case, as you've described where someone's expressed an idea we semantically then map it to what we call a meaning unit.

I'm sorry. I mean, like okay, it's how we form memories. I mean our spatial temporal like our body map it and how we our body relates the world.
  1804  

  1814  05:05:09
  1815: It's not essential for memory formation. Remember formation is is is a happens everywhere in the neocortex and maybe everywhere in the brain but it's like, you know, it's been mapped out. It's been like you memory forms, you know, you know with with this process there's short term as long-term memory.

  1821: Mind to be able to interact with the world and then it forms representations about everything that it is excited it experiences and learns, so I mean it and the the just one component our body map, it's our body map and our environment. So how we relate to things in our environment how we determine spatial relationships, it's linked with differentials.
  1822  
  1823  05:06:36
  1824: So I agree with you. Kyle is. I get I'm not a neuroscientist. I'm not too deep into the literature but I know I've come across several articles we can talk about how we form spatial temple memories and how we form those maps of environments and it goes beyond just the homunculus.

   437: Now that's a strawman strumming that's all I'm literally looking about what is happening when you map your relativity and you store it and you use the machine recognition system to compare what is happening in real time and you're making a guess right but you're is not decoding brain signals and identifying the content of someone's thoughts that's what your statement is true, but it's a straw man because you're talking about what we've done in the past not what we're going to do with this new technology.

   455: I think what you might be. Talking about is associating the activity with an action or with a thought. I'm trying to get clarity around the term decode being brain signals and I'm saying that it's a map into store some interpretation into read into pattern recognize it is not decoding in the sense of putting something as somebody's head in reading their thoughts, so they could love to say like manuals point and this is a bit of the person knowledge but like for anyone who's hearing this discussion and is, Was relatively, you know new to these concepts I think manual raises a decent neurons point, which is this that if you're walking away thinking that it neuralink or this technology currently as it's you know, with the monkey video example, it's not reading the monkeys purest thoughts in terms of what it wants to do it's inferring it by training a neural net that every time these particular brain patterns are occurring in this part of the region the monkey seems to want to move the joystick in a certain.

   500: More than most people can fathom yes you can learn so much more yeah that's what I'm saying is like what does neural so that's what I'm just saying like we have the neural your brain is already mapped to the outside world, you know, that's your body and it's your voice and and what you see is it input and what you hear and it's like this is all available right because you don't need a brain computer in your case to do that the interface is the sense organs in the motor motor control, so that's I think that's the such a key point and it's, It's kind of related also kind of this whole ethical thing is like everyone talks about what's what are the ethics of of like what we can access and all that but like why don't we also talk about the ethics of that's actually currently happening which is breaking ethical and privacy guidelines yeah, so those are just some interesting can I say, can I say something about?

  1587: Point is. So definition of the consciousness that I heard maybe I don't know if it's correctly it's correct me from wrong so the summation of what you say is basically consciousness is your inner 40 representation of your environment in the temporal representation and spatial basically you're mapping your environment and everything that happened with you before as a as a images the patterns inside of you but.
  1588  
  1589  05:07:21
  1590: I would add to that is not only that but also how do you actually react to those representations that makes you conscious because everyone everyone has their own mappings of the reality of the representations among around them to themselves, however they have a very different actions basically patterns of reaction to the events that is happening around them, so that is really reminiscent of reinforcement learning in a way that a different agents.

What are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from, you know, basically taking the existing to genetic code and building a person out of that code. Because all of that has to do with basically unlocking these cellular functions through the communication between cells.

   12: And there could be some like really profound discoveries ahead of us in the near term by using artificial neural networks. To accelerate research in biology. So that the computer can look for basically patterns and in a way that is just sort of tireless compared to, you know, human researchers needing to try to figure out things because they're like automating the process of looking for for patterns that help us to map cellular functions & misfunctions.

We've once this has been figured out and mapped out that there will be some sort of like T cell therapy. That possible one of the problems is, I tend to think that from what I've been reading that is probably a lot of different microbes and so if you try to do the antimicrobial route, it might be difficult because it may not be that all of them would respond.

So a neuron is warping space like an exploding star warps space, the mass of the neuron has increased and therefore its gravitational force has increased.

  2718    686:    15:   103: Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.

  2739    707:   225:   104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

   16:   21: I skimmed the article a little bit. Confidentially what I am writing about in my book is how the brains molecular structure creates conscious maps of reality with frequencies, the frequencies interact with each other, but the same molecular structure that produced these frequencies is required to experience these frequencies. I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence
   17:   34: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

Matrix mathematics, used for representing equations, can be mapped to directed graph geometry. Therefore, the directed graphs in the brain are set up for complex mathematical formulas that reflect the real world. As such the brain and mind is an ever-evolving information set that mirrors the needs of life in an ever-changing environment (both natural and human-made).

   47:   505: Our application domain is not the game of chess, or the the domain of a self driving car or chatbots. So our models are not of chess boards, or of street maps, or conversation topics.
   48:   507: For AGI, the problem domain is a reward maximising real time, sensory-motor reaction agent. The internal models we need to build for a machine that operates in this domain is one of sensorimotor value maps. For each sensory-motor mapping we must model the expected long term reward produced by that mapping. It's a very simple, and a very generic type of model, but it's definitely a application SPECIFIC model, that FITS THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION we are working on.
   49:   521: This is what we are are doing with AGI as well. We are replacing a thousand complex models for chess playing, and car driving and chatboting , with one simplified solution that does it all. But it's still a system that uses models, even if the model is v where v is a real number that models that expected long term reward of a sensory-motor mapping (aka state action Q value).
   50:   596: I can build a robot designed to wander around a room. I can hard code the map of the room into the software. I can create some really fancy 2D localization sensors that tells the software exactly where the robot is on the map at any instant. I can then write planing software that allow the robot to plot a course from it's current location, to any new location I want it to travel to. I can test the performance of he motors and drive system so that I can now exactly how the robot will respond to commands to move forward at different speeds. I have built the entire model of the environment into the robot, so the software has no need to learn any part of the model on it's own.
   51:   600: I can replace the highly accurate 2D location sensors, with far less accurate sonar range finding sensors, and bump sensors and write even fancier learning algorithms so the software can learn to estimate the location of the robot on the map at any point in time, instead of having to be told it's location. That way, more of the state model of the environment is learned, instead of hardwired into the system.
   52:   602: I can take out the map entirely, and write fancy learning algorithms that allow the robot to build it's own map of the environment as it explores the rooms in the building. So now it's building it's own maps, and it's own location understanding from the sensory data.
   53:   643: My Substrate contains Models of Saliency, Abstraction, Reduction, Success, Failure, Prediction. It has a trivial input mechanism that doesn't do Model based preprocessing although I am not negative to those in cases like computer vision. But none of the things I Model are problem domain specific. My systems would learn from video cameras that provided a map of color pixels that changed over time. No furter preprocessing would be required.
   54:   706: But that's not true because we are still domain limited machines. There are real limits to what a human can understand and what sort of problems they can solve on their own without the help of "thinking machine" doing the work for them. Multiple math proofs have now been created by getting a computer to do the work for us -- because the problem is too large and complex for any single human to solve it. Like the 4 color map theorem.

   58:   57: the attention schema both defines which areas of your mental map your are seeing, but it also binds those areas together in sequences that your brain tracks with neurotransmitters and senses with corresponding soliton mechanical sound waves and soliton electrical waves felt by each neuron,
   59:   58: other neurons are able to track the phase changes happening to other neurons whether they are speeding up or slowing down, and long changes of these detects are mapped by many neurons or entire neural circuits simultaneously because exit terminals branch radially in every possible direction they can go.
   60:   60: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

Where node memories can create vector memories and The model free nature means that the concept is the memory of the tree's reaction in a sense. With Haskell and an 80 core processor one could have each node in the tree creating emergent vector maps with the other activated nodes independent of a centralized process.

The new thinking is that every part of the brain is doing a little bit of everything, at all scales. The brain is self similar everywhere (Jeff Hawkins talks about the self similarity of the neocortex, and the similarity of the Hippocampus to a cortical column) tiny learned custom variations in each part of the brain will serve to generate a natural VAE Variational Autoencoder effect for comparing learned patterns in one modality to same or similar patterns encoded in a different modality.

  193:   35: Factory automation is exciting - but how about space debris mapping? This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.
  194:   37: Digantara is an Indian company focused on space debris mapping (Disclosure: I am an advisor). The company was started in 2018 by a team of engineers/entrepreneurs to create solutions to the space debris mapping problem. They were invited to present their business plan at the prestigious 2019 International Astronautical Federation (IAF) start-up pitch event in Washington D.C. This won them accolades, and more importantly funding. Digantara’s data products will prove invaluable for trajectory planning for future space launches, predicting when collisions are likely to occur, updating the debris maps and providing input to companies as they tackle the problem of space debris removal. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), a leading global space agency, provides grants, advise and technical support to the company.
  195:   39: Current methods for space debris mapping are ground based, and use a combination of radar and 2d optical telescopes. The mapping is constrained by weather conditions, as well as lighting (cannot map during the day because of solar noise and at night because of lack of illumination). Short range mapping occurs with radar whereas the telescopes can only image at very long range due to the long integration times involved. Orbital mechanics principles and models are used to extract 3D data from from the 2D imagery, although these extrapolations suffer from from fidelity and precision issues. Atmospheric distortion further complicates the problem, with the result that earth based systems are unable to map objects less than 10 cm in diameter reliably and accurately. According to Digantara’s Chief Technical Officer, Tanveer Ahmed; “Digantara solves this problem by using LiDARs mounted on a constellation of CubeSats (small satellites, roughly shoebox size, with a 10 kg load carrying capacity). The use of active 3D imaging to obtain range information in addition to x-y location is a must - since passive imaging of fast moving objects at close ranges would require very large integration times, making the measurement useless. Additionally, LiDAR allows us to control the illumination period and wavelength, enabling significantly higher duty cycles of the mapping system. 3D Imaging in space allows for significantly higher signal-to noise (SNR) performance because of an absence of atmospheric losses and non-linear signal distortions”. The LiDAR is capable of imaging >1 cm size objects moving at speeds of up to 10 km/s at range of 100 km. Data compression occurs in the CubeSat prior to a RF based downlink to earth for further processing. A schematic of the Digantara system is shown in Figure 3.

Indeed, from an evolutionary stand point, this makes a lot of sense because it facilitates learning. During new experiences like learning to walk or speak a language or making mental maps of the way home, neurons make new connections. The more an activity is repeated, or the more learning involved, the stronger those connections become. Zoom in and you’ll see that these neurons don’t actually physically touch, but instead right at the junction where two neurons meet is a tiny gap called a synapse.

Memory-prediction is how information is coded in neural activity. That's what thinking is, a prediction, the whole cerebral cortex can be said to be a modeling system, of the world we predict is real, and all the models of the world we perceive with our mind through our senses are really made up of countless predictions, encoded in neural activity.

Each learned representation is literally a map constructed our of sensory input via space and time, represented in a three dimensional x,y,z axis in the cerebral cortex. If that exact position of the cortex was damaged via stroke, tumor, or other injury, it's possible that that map of spacial/temporal associations will be remade by another portion of the brain, provided your interested and committed to learning the alpha 5 on red or red-orange background association again. Your previous associations, in terms of mapped life experiences, are the basis of your expectations in life, that's the metric by which you judge your experiences. Who is experiencing your life? Well your previous experiences are. That's the narrative of you, the song of soul, the symphony of I am. New experiences can have a tipping point where the internal maps of associations that represent you under go a fundamental shift, the pattern that is you becomes more capable of interpreting life experiences in a useful way. Passing the tipping point, into a new internal narrative, is a threshold experience, many times means your going to be capable of handling bigger problems then you were before, or it means you will be able to handle the same problems with greater ease. It's your brain improving it's own maps, out of necessity, experience, so that your brain is able to represent alpha 5 on a red/orange background with fewer cells. Perhaps alpha 5 gets merged with the coffee shop you are always at when you see alpha 5, so that increasingly large groups of associations can be represented with increasingly fewer neurons at a higher level in the cortex, similar to the subject line of an email, or the headline of a news article, or the title of a paper. By the time we get to conscious thinking, we are at the news headline of news headlines, we are at the grand summary of grand summaries, the conscious thoughts are macro summaries of vast blankets of group associations learned through life experience so that no matter what direction you look, you can spot many complicated objects almost instantly, because they have all been linked via short cuts that use few cells to trigger vast networks of previous associations, that help you predict what is real now. 
  320:   11: Micah Blumberg So information is encoded in neural activity via learned associations in bunches of cells, these associations are mapping our experiences, and providing expectations to other bunches of associated neurons representing maps of other internal representations, corresponding with life experience. In a way we are these previous life experiences, predictions that represent previous associations including association between maps of associated cells from all the other previous life experiences. The out put from these cells, when the neurons fire, is our expectation of what we are experiencing now, our expectations come to meet our new experiences almost like the waves coming to meet the shores of our nations. As the shore of new experience comes in, it's sorted by or into the previous maps of reality, until such a time when it's overwhelmed by the new data so much that a major change in the internal maps takes place, representing a change in a person after a very significant life experience. Pushing this threshold is something I am very interested in, that's why I do neurofeedback with brainwave entrainment with light and sound as my business!

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern).

Any of the core, any area of the cortex can be remapped to, to take on the duties of any other like in, for example, if someone loses a hand and the parts of the brain that were being used to, for their hand, then to start to become used for by the by the other regions of the brain, right?

And so you're creating a sort of a funk sort of like it. Like a 10 segregated network is like, when, you know, so communications is network, is when thinking invented in 60s or 70s.
  547:   199: And it's this idea that when part of your phone network is destroyer taken offline by, it could be during a war or something. The communications network automatically, sort of remaps it's pathways around that broken node. So that the rest of the nodes can continue to communicate and this is this is considered a neuron like our brain like thing.

Here gravity is just the curvature space and space cars around the maps. And the mass is creating an electric field, an election, magnet field That and in, in the electromagnetic field is curving away at the sun's ejection, but it should be, right?

  556:    3: Hierarchy Oscillations Mind Map
  557:   15: Okay, so welcome back about Alex. So I had a really colorful idea. I thought, well, what if I create a really colorful template? And the mind map tool, right? Of basically, it's like so going to like so, you know how, like yeah, I've been missing around. Pretty my own templates.
  558:   25: I think I want to combine. I think what I want to do is like create a screenshot and then add it to simple nuts. So I mean added to the notes notes, the notepad. So a screenshot of the mind map. Because I think that's what I need to do is to represent the associated concepts from in a branches aspect and then put it in a sequence, right?
  559:   27: So it's like using that's like that's using a mind map in an unconventional way because then it's like you're combining the branch. The branching is just designed to show a relationship between two different ideas. A relationship that is in some sense shares, some minimum of isomorphism in terms of a natural hierarchy, with some other concepts.
  560:   31: And that's why it needs to be included in this categorization, because this is sort of like a mind. Map tool is about arranging categories in a hierarchy. And that's interesting because category theory doesn't have any hiring but like yeah. If you can sure, if you could have transformations in a hierarchy then you could have like system would be at the top of the hierarchy and then you could have, you can have components underneath system and then you have entities and then you have the menu, you have the document.
  561:   33: Okay and maybe I should do that. I should make a mind map where I have. Like the highest level is the system code that applies to the whole hierarchy and then the component code which means that you have some code that only applies to some of the project and what it applies to those are the things in this hierarchy that it applies to, but you can assign but you would assign what it applies to not at the component level, but at the entity level, and that's the point of entities, is sort of be like a general target for what the HTML page is supposed to render.
  562:   45: So the mind map is like, okay, so start with that summary to, these are all the low level pieces that connect to this bigger picture. And that's what the book is about, is a book is. Okay, so this is the hypothesis and then these are the pieces that add up to the hypothesis.

So it's like time-wise is like yeah so it's like if you're if you have a heartbeat at the same time that you have an alpha wave peaking and you put them both in a timesheet and you can just track the heartbeats and the halfway waves and correlate them through time that you have a map, you have that is like one example of how you can take one set of I guess unstructured data in compared to another set of unstructured data.

  600:   175: It's less complex than a human brain, right? So with the human brain, we have a lot more neurons and the this the the vertexes and the nodes and things like that just make it more complex. So it is easier for for for them to map the gum. I think it was like a hundred or fifty two something knives like that, um, and I don't know if you guys ever seen like, The neurons like underneath the microscope like how they firing and the different things like that.
  601:   188: So using like the scans and stuff like that to map what you see from a scan to like, Some behavioral or some like like basically a classification type problem might be about optimal solution but versus like trying to model the brain or not, but I'm not an expert.

  604:     48: Processed large amounts of data and and map that data to semantics such that we can produce code generate code that's also highly efficient. We've also focused on creating what some would agree is equivalent to the 
  605:     52: And so our equivalent to that is a semantic periodic chart for. Computing where we have two hundred and fifty six elements that map meaning units to what humans express whether it's words or or gestures or typing text or any any signal data basically such that we can then in real time competitively generate highly parallelized code the benefit being the the ability to see the machine produced results and and have that correlating to what you actually met.
  606:    115: Well this is can and that is definitely fascinating to me from the standpoint of. Being able to map what is an accurate reflection of a signal that you can verify discreetly not simply as you know, some some textual or other representation but a signal that you can map to meaning and represent in a number of ways we render it as as what it would represent in terms of something that is an image like a black an image of a big cat as you you suggest it.
  607:    136: And doesn't it matter then that there's a semantic representation that can be mapped to the individuals way of thinking. Yeah exactly so not every representation will be exactly the same and every brain. Based on different experiences based on different context data, and so on so. Yes that what what really makes that a big part of our focus of my team is that we've observed what what happens in computing with programming languages and how so much is not represented there's there's an a semantic representation sufficiently to to determine what what does this mean and and context of the the code writer or the person who had the the idea or what they were trying to achieve, you know, so being able to.
  608:    142: That supports the the machine behaviors. The only question I have for everyone because I'm thinking about this let's say we can map every like all kinds of memories out and we can replicate them and make you know people that get Alzheimer's or so remember and perform a regular life will it?
  609:    392: Are ripped are represented by being on more distal areas of of the land right so. I think we have to. Call to know um like to that type of resolution and it's known that these type of subcategories of mapping of the neuron itself, it's supposed to be even more important and human.
  610:    542: So so a very efficient way. To process data but perhaps more importantly it maps to to language both human and machine it can be mapped to signs symbols and and what we call meaning units in I mentioned earlier for those who weren't in the call or in the room initially we've we've mapped this approach to what we call a semantic periodic chart for computing that allows us to use 256 elements that are.
  611:    545: Antique representations of meaning that can map in both directions both to to natural language or or programming language or to signs and symbols but also to code and and thus so you think of it as being able to pick your methodology, whether you you are more in your effort benefit by expressing it a natural language or a programming language or.
  612:    548: A symbolic representation of what you mean they all map to the same definitive meaning to the machine and the benefit of that is is that you can support different ways of thinking different ways of expressing different languages different cultures and and within that those elements it it has certain specific representations that are not present and programming languages such as emotions fear anger.
  613:    560: And that bugs our whole or loop that is not identified where they go into a complex system will that create chaos in in the whole ecosystem itself. That's a great question Dave. So again, our third patent is focused on something we call level of detail. In other words what that essentially allows for is representing even in the case, as you've described where someone's expressed an idea we semantically then map it to what we call a meaning unit.
  614:    620: And right and and to be honest I mean the reason why I sort of like you know we do we're on your own networks the way with random right now in the computer is because they're just the mapped like what we run mapped better to the you know, the GPUs to GPUs that we have right I build alley who's I think chief scientist of an video he puts it, right?
  615:    930: Easily so we you know, we all are more complicated than we realize and you can you know, you can do a lot of work finding out and tracking and mapping these um inhibitory pathways and excited to pathways and because obviously if you stimulate with high frequency and inhibitory pathway, you're actually then inhibiting that part of the brain even though you're using excitatory simulation.
  616:   1008: ⟪ 351 characters skipped ⟫he learning process that has to go on with the implantable devices themselves, so for example, like, You brought up the the example of the cat like if you take a look at a cat and how you can sort of map the associations that occur within the cellular patterns that give you that visual representation of the cat how that is going to occur from one person to the neck does not necessarily gonna be identically you know what I mean, so when you start to when you start to, Let's say you you put the neural ink in and you map with the person's sailor firing patterns that associate with them staring at a cat and you take that exact same firing patterns and you stimulate that in another person.
  617:   1077: I don't know the the paper you mentioned but there are many studies right now, um using what I said up to genetics. To detangle basically the role of specific connection between the cortical striatum and I make the last triadum and ETA in a place that comes prefrontal. I mean, this is being on being mapped out with opportunity and I think the only way to be precise because you can't really control with electric stimulation.
  618:   1366: My name that the point is how people who work in this agencies so often complain about how they don't have access to top talent that's like apparel really really important to me. All right well, I mean, we're kind of I think we're kind of at the we're going way off topic here so the topic maybe I should recap the topic so yeah, we're just talking about neuralink and nementor in the massive overlap between the two mementos given us this sort of map for how our cortical columns are creating reference frames that reference the objects and and they can work together to represent everything we can see in here within our conscious work space right and then amenta so Nementa is going to be.
  619:   1372: Detect create a map of of neurons that are firing within a 1,000 neuron radius or 140 micron radios and if you have like basically the way Ted Troy's work you can if you have multiple electrodes you can triangulate and if you have a lot of electrodes you can get high definition triangulation of of where the the neurons are firing and so allows you to figure out if you get it firing in the same area as a two different neurons or just one neuron or firing in two different areas is it just the same neuron or is it really two different neurons and the this kinds of this is?
  620:   1466: A thousand brains theory and that the same idea applies to concept so just like mapping everything physical with different cortical columns with the thousands of them all over the place, but in the your your cortical columns are also tracking abstract ideas and a similar way and so you may have many different representations of the same idea and the protocols are helping to track the integrations of the different components, so there's like there's like in it and it's the structure of how that works is supposed to be similar to.
  621:   1552: Types of newer and many different connections that they have. So they have like a detailed map of how these are connected but there's still a lot more details to figure out to see how exactly it works. So each of these columns has a similar. Connection to some other critical area, sorry brain areas, like as you said like played cells.
  622:   1567: So an institution is one of the big companies also an institute invests in basic signs in the sense that when they do a research or when they map. The brain of bowels etc. They don't afford each project they don't look for how much business value it brings to them immediately.
  623:   1624: But yeah it's it's great that we're using I think if for example find out how people make decisions and how brain state of people are in learning we can help in learning so already there is I'm a personally know about one application. I haven't used like for example QEG you might actually use key, I don't know but QEG already is useful in that because you can see like, At a very very long rough level but at least that's that rough map of activity of your brain at least tells you what the state of your brain is at least you'll know.
  624:   1771: Decision I think it was decision mapping or decision theory a little bit on circuitry. I know it's an older paper but if you when you get a chance whenever just email me to my emails in the profile, but yeah, I'd love to look at that paper because I think there's a cross-correlation of what you just said what you are alluded to in what so I'll talk about on and I will pronounce in your name so hell correctly because I'm always doing that we're pronunciations but um, so my friend please I beg your forgiveness, but um, it's a matter of um in a multitasking should be.

I'm think I'm gonna have to LPS which is just a lipo polysaccharide which is for anyone that doesn't know it's a reproducible way to induce a known amount of inflammation into the system so basically you you inject that and then because it's big inflammatory response so I'll probably have to use LPS to get at the mechanisms and then do some sort of either on targeted mass back or proteomics or RNA seek to see which transmitters I should say inflammatory molecules are.

  665:    434: I think is a little bit disingenuous because, We're still really at the capacity of really kind of like a super polygraph and that you can map a baseline and you can get a control that's related to some idea and then you can have the computer compare do the pattern recognition and apply control to that that is not decoding brain signals of someone in trying to identify what they're thinking is that is far from that in fact that leap is a near miracle.
  666:    437: Now that's a strawman strumming that's all I'm literally looking about what is happening when you map your relativity and you store it and you use the machine recognition system to compare what is happening in real time and you're making a guess right but you're is not decoding brain signals and identifying the content of someone's thoughts that's what your statement is true, but it's a straw man because you're talking about what we've done in the past not what we're going to do with this new technology.
  667:    455: I think what you might be. Talking about is associating the activity with an action or with a thought. I'm trying to get clarity around the term decode being brain signals and I'm saying that it's a map into store some interpretation into read into pattern recognize it is not decoding in the sense of putting something as somebody's head in reading their thoughts, so they could love to say like manuals point and this is a bit of the person knowledge but like for anyone who's hearing this discussion and is, Was relatively, you know new to these concepts I think manual raises a decent neurons point, which is this that if you're walking away thinking that it neuralink or this technology currently as it's you know, with the monkey video example, it's not reading the monkeys purest thoughts in terms of what it wants to do it's inferring it by training a neural net that every time these particular brain patterns are occurring in this part of the region the monkey seems to want to move the joystick in a certain.
  668:    494: What what is the big difference of actually having an intracortical or an implantable electrode system or decoding actual neural signals and all that, you know, because we have so the neural signals are mapped into physical reality through the body and language and things like that so you we already have the ability to map facial expressions, you know, your habits what you write like Google is like analyzing everything you write in all your in all your emails all your searches.
  669:    500: More than most people can fathom yes you can learn so much more yeah that's what I'm saying is like what does neural so that's what I'm just saying like we have the neural your brain is already mapped to the outside world, you know, that's your body and it's your voice and and what you see is it input and what you hear and it's like this is all available right because you don't need a brain computer in your case to do that the interface is the sense organs in the motor motor control, so that's I think that's the such a key point and it's, It's kind of related also kind of this whole ethical thing is like everyone talks about what's what are the ethics of of like what we can access and all that but like why don't we also talk about the ethics of that's actually currently happening which is breaking ethical and privacy guidelines yeah, so those are just some interesting can I say, can I say something about?
  670:    518: A very good point, oh go ahead man, sorry thank you the resolution between I guess like a regular EEG device and neural link is astronomical nobody is debating that it's insane but it's still in the motor cortex and the mortar protects obviously is extremely favorable to mapping so that works perfectly for people who have I don't know people who.
  671:    542: That signal which is more you know putting it to an action or a personality and then you need to map it into the person themselves for independent individual differences, so I think the ability for scale and which is why it is very cool with neural length being, you know very much with a lot of musking in the Tesla group.
  672:    676: And if I wanted to say map all of say r2 or to r, you know r1 I can essentially using a modular system map all of r2 on r1 because i can split it into parts based on congruences there is essentially a linear tradeoff between harmony different term states i have and how accurate you know, i have to be if i have a single finite double as a variable type.
  673:    736: And for each frame to get a frame of the movie at a rate that makes sense for that person to see that movie right and so if you can simulate many many neurons simultaneously, then that basically like each additional neuron or it. I mean at some point this like the amount of information you're transferring is multiplying per per per per each new unit of computation it's so you're speeding things up by doing things on but by map by sort of what's the term?
  674:    742: Even like gives you an insight on how to use mathematical approximation just just for others in the room could you kind of help us I guess map out so based on what you just you guys discussed what what are there any upper limits to the way things are currently being designed and with that mean that there's certain applications that in order for us to unlock other technological breakthroughs need to occur could you guys maybe just translate that?
  675:    750: Like like a network and and and so the neuroscientists Olaf sports he tries to use graft theory to to map those connections and to sort of figure out how they work and and and some of the things that some of the ideas of how the brain is network you yield that some of the research yielded something called the the discovery of the default brain network and which is another thing called the rich clubs and in these are like basically like the macroscopic structure.
  676:    992: I mean the electrics that are put in for epilepsy surgery mapping. I'm always amazed when I see these and they go, you know, go going all the way across the brain and then they're taking out and don't leave scarring so I can't imagine today can I talk to the reason why there's no scarring is because they're there only for a limited time right so the when you do.
  677:   1146: My understanding of how LSD is actually affects the brain is the similar to synesthesia rate where I believe that's the right term where it's essentially remapping the neural connection between the different senses and that's why people see they'll taste color or they will feel sound or something like that, they're neural pathways are basically not interchangeable but can be remapped.

But what the neuralink does is that you're able to map out where the brain at least what the vessels are so they can implant their electrodes in a more careful manner and if you look at their electro design, they're actually designed to certain situate that they can minimize impedance so that's one of the bigger issues one of your design electrodes so if you minimize those I don't know if if there is anybody that has worked on neuroscience that you use these very fine fibers called tetrahodes and they have excellent resolution when it comes to decoding the single neuron input.

  728:   1485: But what will be the result the effect like dopamine is restless legs, it's an idol since it's yeah. Um, yeah, so, um, I. Think the this raises good question on whether AI could ever possibly reach the point of being technically quote-unquote human consciousness, if that makes sense it least like a mapping out like a neural network to match human consciousness would not necessarily be quite it.
  729:   1587: Point is. So definition of the consciousness that I heard maybe I don't know if it's correctly it's correct me from wrong so the summation of what you say is basically consciousness is your inner 40 representation of your environment in the temporal representation and spatial basically you're mapping your environment and everything that happened with you before as a as a images the patterns inside of you but.
  730:   1590: I would add to that is not only that but also how do you actually react to those representations that makes you conscious because everyone everyone has their own mappings of the reality of the representations among around them to themselves, however they have a very different actions basically patterns of reaction to the events that is happening around them, so that is really reminiscent of reinforcement learning in a way that a different agents.
  731:   1599: Agree to. I'm interested in what you're talking about regarding this 4d idea. Of mapping the brain temperate temporally and and as spatially so I imagine almost having the neurons and somehow if possible because we don't know if it seems very impossible having the neurotransmitters and hormones and getting those mapped temporally as well as spatially in terms of like just like basically getting mathematical analyses of.
  732:   1611: Okay I'll just go really crackle in terms of mapping there's a lot of like maps already within our brain like for retinal topic right so meadow topic for all the somatosensory visual and auditory and so forth there are like maps that like predicts such and there's also like a lot of studies within neuroscience to show that like they can they can predict like when an action potential fire within a neuron just from like long-term potential potentiation a long-term depression studies to like reinforce certain behaviors or like to predict like how a person will react on a subconscious like, There's like a Wisconsin card sorting task to predict like how like people can be able to like predict like certain like if the task let's say was like we want you to group these cards by color versus by shapes and they're like what is going on at this task like what is the experimenter doing like people are able to subconsciously pick up like like cues or like the pattern way before they can explicitly say what's going on and they sound like yeah, so they've done this with poker games and like a lot of different types of subconscious tests, like we we pick up.

So I do I'm not too sure of what your question is, but I think it's like already been done and like the 40 mapping part. Oh, no. I mean, they're like the full. Like, oh consciousness, um, once we're able to get to that point of mapping.
  734:   1617: Consciousness if possible. It is still question, whether it is possible. I I do think. It is possible to figure out that the correlate like the neural correlates of consciousness, although I do wonder on whether is possible to map out. The.

This is this is massive future work that has to be, we're going to need even bigger computer systems than we have today to sort of like get to the point where we can you know, have have a neural network basically discover a point by point. What are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from, you know, basically taking the existing to genetic code and building a person out of that code. Because all of that has to do with basically unlocking these cellular functions through the communication between cells.
  739:    12: And there could be some like really profound discoveries ahead of us in the near term by using artificial neural networks. To accelerate research in biology. So that the computer can look for basically patterns and in a way that is just sort of tireless compared to, you know, human researchers needing to try to figure out things because they're like automating the process of looking for for patterns that help us to map cellular functions & misfunctions.

This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.

This is this is massive future work that has to be, we're going to need even bigger computer systems than we have today to sort of like get to the point where we can you know, have have a neural network basically discover a point by point. What are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from, you know, basically taking the existing to genetic code and building a person out of that code.

  890:    54: It's in its concepts are how all the wines and edges connect at a higher level in the hierarchy of the network and so that. So basically you can see the basis of a concept for an artificial neural network is all of the is the map of associations between all the lower level bits that come in through the base of the network or the sensors.
  891:   102: This activity has been mapped. It kind of suggests that our brains neurons are lighting up, and it is a kind of suggests the electromagnetism that are in our neurons are activated by electromagnetic system. And the point that I like bringing up is that, you know, maybe because we have these, we have our dendrite.
  892:   118: And what travels between is, is our chemical activations. That can trick ourselves further down the line. But what you don't see in all these textbooks neuroscience is the really complex mappings between all the neurons. So, this is like this, right here, represents this right here and this is the dendress, the generic could activate something.
  893:   154: And you can the sensor. It's like a light field sensor before electromagnetism and you can configure it for. So, you can notice the orange point of a brain that you can predict camera for electric, for, for brains. And then, if you can map the signals coming from the analyst, then you have the signals before they get more broadly distributed, across new cortex would be where.
  894:   156: And so, which interesting is about the dominance is that nonemergency go into your, you know, cortex. It goes through the thousand. Neo cortex and just, you know, all the semantic map is all over the place but that's stuff is a big feedback. Looks back into town.

  903:    22: And so the lower levels of the hierarchy would just focus on the lines and edges, and a little bit and at a higher level, you turn the blinds edges into the computer recognize as a content because it's it's just something wrong, it's bad. And then at a higher level of the network you have the computer begins put together the concept of eyes or, or words or, you know, it's just it's just it's basically a map of the associations of the minds and edges that, but at a higher level it you computer.
  904:   114: I mean you could calculate the the oh whatever you could calculate, you can do some something like tensor confidence on it, you know, just got the map all the ions within a specific field that you decide to focus on with your sensors, which you could also do something like this with EEG or energy.
  905  
  906  nlp5:
  907:   136: So we talk about this on the podcast like how my work and what are the one, the big ideas, okay? So I'm thinking it is, if you can apply, if you can get like live data of like let's say, you're your imaging. You're using some sort of imaging where you're creating like a tensor field, map of the ionic tropic rain, you know, all the electromagnetic waves going through space and you, you have AI watching it and it's looking for patterns, let's just unsupervised because you can't really label that.
  908:   138: But then you have another AI like the self-harming car that's as it's doing like, you know, light are and all these different cameras and it's mapping. It's identifying all the objects in the room, and then you, you need to correlate. Like you know this is this plate has, you know, you have all these, the AI access, all these different lines and edges add up to this concept of the plate and at the same time until you have an the other AI is looking at the neural ports because beyond an temp special brainwave patterns and is saying this pattern matches that pattern.

  707    225:   104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

   489     3: (hebb, oscillat, graph, vector) I'm saying the nature of sensory experience is cycling synchronicity. Complex sensory experience is a synchronicity with several trillion oscillating parts per millisecond or something like that.
   490:    5: I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.
   491    18: So my more updated view of attractors is that our memories are attractors, our long term (unconscious) memories as synaptic connections and our active (conscious) memories as the tonic brainwave oscillation, both types of memories are attractors that drive brainwave oscillations, drive changes to brainwave activity patterns, and drive decision making (brainwave oscillations, representing the state of our memory system, physically drive our actions, and our choices, through the principles of oscillation inside the brains 3D neural network architecture.

   572    19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

   574    38: problem with pan-psychism resonator theory is that resonators which are decaying oscillators, like vortexes while being ubiquitous at all scales of the cosmos, do not encode memories over time, they dissipate into nothing, so resonation by itself is non-informing, it does not store information in a way that allows for transaction of information patterns

So the organism has the experience of reality, but it's just a sequence of graphically rendered concepts based on a tomographically constructed map of reality which is the assembling of coincidence detections by neurons, that are transmitting phase changes that create the components for coincidence detections by other neurons.
  1633    129: However like all the small oscillators (neurons & neural circuits) interact with the big groups of oscillators in the brain, because the vibrations, the electric & chemical signals, all of the physics between cells cause all the oscillators to interact, so they can really maintain long distance synchronization patterns without direct connections because the oscillators grind on each other like the gears of a clock, when one gear moves, it moves the other gears, when one oscillators, it moves the other oscillators. That is the key reason the brain is sensitive to itself, or sensing itself, it's because of oscillatory physics.

The output is an external res, rendering mapping. It's done internally. But it's a an external map that's being produced by other by the physical. Computations of oscillators, it's an external map.
  1888    127: Become a tractors in the context of oscillators. And and, and usually you think of an attractor in the context of a harmonic oscillator, that is going to has a source of energy that's going to repeat over and over again. But in the case of the brain, you have, you know, the harmonic oscillators.

  1974    17: What I am suggesting, a hypothesis, is that the dendritic vector path is essentially deduced or represented by the exit terminal group that fired, and exit terminal group that becomes inhibited resets or modifies it's tonic oscillation firing rate in response the neuron that fired.
  1975:   19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern).

  3281:   115:   5: I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.

The output is an external res, rendering mapping. It's done internally. But it's a an external map that's being produced by other by the physical. Computations of oscillators, it's an external map.
  3285:   496:   19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

You know, you're a concept of a cat and a dog has more neural correlates over in this region of the brain. Which I'm doing another hand gastro, so it's like, I'm pointing to one part of my head and then you have another concept of a house and a motorcycle, which is gonna be in a different region of the head.

And then at a higher level of the network you have the computer begins put together the concept of eyes or, or words or, you know, it's just it's just it's basically a map of the associations of the minds and edges that, but at a higher level it you computer.

  136: So we talk about this on the podcast like how my work and what are the one, the big ideas, okay? So I'm thinking it is, if you can apply, if you can get like live data of like let's say, you're your imaging. You're using some sort of imaging where you're creating like a tensor field, map of the ionic tropic rain, you know, all the electromagnetic waves going through space and you, you have AI watching it and it's looking for patterns, let's just unsupervised because you can't really label that.
  137  19:21
  138: But then you have another AI like the self-harming car that's as it's doing like, you know, light are and all these different cameras and it's mapping. It's identifying all the objects in the room, and then you, you need to correlate. Like you know this is this plate has, you know, you have all these, the AI access, all these different lines and edges add up to this concept of the plate and at the same time until you have an the other AI is looking at the neural ports because beyond an temp special brainwave patterns and is saying this pattern matches that pattern.

  1290    212    2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence

The idea is that each thing in your environment is represented by a cortical column, and you might also have multiple cortical columns across each region of the neo-cortex creating their own representation of whatever you are focused on. So cortical columns in the auditory cortex are going to model the acousitic representations of the object you are focusing on, the visual cortex will render or model visual representations of the object you are focused on, and the somatosensory cortex will model the mechanical vibrations of touch, taste, and what you can sense inside your body. All of these areas are fed information from thalamic nuclei that are co

  1129:   3  Map: Peter Tse, (criterial causation, observer) 
  1130    4: "What I like about Peter Tse's book at the end is he frames the question in terms of whether thoughts are passive or whether they have an active role in decision making. It's like are your thoughts just a result that the observer is observing? Or is the observer and the thoughts taking place active in the feedback cycle of decision making, playing a role in the activity instead of being a passive observer of the activity. The idea that the observer is a passive observer I think stems from the idea that the mind is seperate from the body, maybe, the idea that the observer, the mind, and thought are some how seperate from physics or causality or above physics and above causation. I think Peter Tse is not trying to prove that we have choice because of random noise, he is trying to say that information has casual power in the brain, because neurons literally read and write information patterns which allows information to drive neural activity and the brain.

  3714    1290:   212    2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

The brain is self similar everywhere (Jeff Hawkins talks about the self similarity of the neocortex, and the similarity of the Hippocampus to a cortical column) tiny learned custom variations in each part of the brain will serve to generate a natural VAE Variational Autoencoder effect for comparing learned patterns in one modality to same or similar patterns encoded in a different modality.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

In the decade since, LiDAR has occupied a “must have” status by a majority of automotive OEMs for ADAS, and AV driving stack companies for localization, mapping and Level 4 autonomous driving. Tesla TSLA +3.4% and some others believe that LiDAR is not required for ADAS and AVs - their approach is to use monovision cameras to extract 3D information through artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. While intriguing, such approaches are in the minority and are yet to be validated in real life environments.

This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.
  1177:   194    37: Digantara is an Indian company focused on space debris mapping (Disclosure: I am an advisor). The company was started in 2018 by a team of engineers/entrepreneurs to create solutions to the space debris mapping problem. They were invited to present their business plan at the prestigious 2019 International Astronautical Federation (IAF) start-up pitch event in Washington D.C. This won them accolades, and more importantly funding. Digantara’s data products will prove invaluable for trajectory planning for future space launches, predicting when collisions are likely to occur, updating the debris maps and providing input to companies as they tackle the problem of space debris removal. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), a leading global space agency, provides grants, advise and technical support to the company.

This is this is massive future work that has to be, we're going to need even bigger computer systems than we have today to sort of like get to the point where we can you know, have have a neural network basically discover a point by point. What are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from, you know, basically taking the existing to genetic code and building a person out of that code. Because all of that has to do with basically unlocking these cellular functions through the communication between cells.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2358:    59    58: other neurons are able to track the phase changes happening to other neurons whether they are speeding up or slowing down, and long changes of these detects are mapped by many neurons or entire neural circuits simultaneously because exit terminals branch radially in every possible direction they can go.
  2359:    60:   60: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

  2363:    91:   896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

  2374:   195    39: Current methods for space debris mapping are ground based, and use a combination of radar and 2d optical telescopes. The mapping is constrained by weather conditions, as well as lighting (cannot map during the day because of solar noise and at night because of lack of illumination). Short range mapping occurs with radar whereas the telescopes can only image at very long range due to the long integration times involved. Orbital mechanics principles and models are used to extract 3D data from from the 2D imagery, although these extrapolations suffer from from fidelity and precision issues. Atmospheric distortion further complicates the problem, with the result that earth based systems are unable to map objects less than 10 cm in diameter reliably and accurately. According to Digantara’s Chief Technical Officer, Tanveer Ahmed; “Digantara solves this problem by using LiDARs mounted on a constellation of CubeSats (small satellites, roughly shoebox size, with a 10 kg load carrying capacity). The use of active 3D imaging to obtain range information in addition to x-y location is a must - since passive imaging of fast moving objects at close ranges would require very large integration times, making the measurement useless. Additionally, LiDAR allows us to control the illumination period and wavelength, enabling significantly higher duty cycles of the mapping system. 3D Imaging in space allows for significantly higher signal-to noise (SNR) performance because of an absence of atmospheric losses and non-linear signal distortions”. The LiDAR is capable of imaging >1 cm size objects moving at speeds of up to 10 km/s at range of 100 km. Data compression occurs in the CubeSat prior to a RF based downlink to earth for further processing. A schematic of the Digantara system is shown in Figure 3.

You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

  2678:   1975    19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

What is being projected from a neuron & a neuron array is a phase change, that phase change could also be described as a change in relative electrical valence. On top of that interesting connection, your behavior in effect is absolutely mapped to the phase changes or valences moving between your neural arrays (which including any neuron and any oscillating group of cells such as a cortical column or an anatomical structure like the amygdala)

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

  6297:   3631:    62:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  6298    3632:    63:   128: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
