    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   63: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.

   16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   71: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

  123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  128: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

  142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

a0127z.md:
   17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
   58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

   18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

The mind is a tomodeck.
  53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.

    7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).

  46: You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

   9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.
  45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.

  13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.

Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.
  62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

  109: I have to talk about nursery. So there was this whole. Okay, so there was this whole got to talk about electrical impedance tomography near a link and I've got to talk about there. Is this whole thing that I recorded from clubhouse which I was breaking down how short-term memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.

  310: And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.
  361: Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?

  225: It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.

  80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  301: I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.
  304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
  494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.

  1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  1620: It's just amazing and they're all they're all those like they're they're all have there's all like commonalities they're all basically like, you know coming down to vape in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way I think of of, you know, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.

b0311y.md:
  1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?

b0313y.md:
  368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.

b0314y.md:
  122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.

b0318y.md:
  123: ⟪ 486 characters skipped ⟫ough, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.

  80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
