says you, because that is your convention, but many people think reality is an all inclusive term, why should your thoughts which some people believe actually are physical things be outside reality? we know words are real because words impact a person, words trigger chain reactions in neurons, and stimulate brainwave patterns, so words must be real. How could something non-real change a persons neurophysiology? Different regions of your mind will light up in Brainscans corresponding to the kinds of words you are using and the types of thoughts you are engaged in. If you think words and thoughts are not real try EEG. A live brain scan with EEG or another technology will end the dualism idea that words and thoughts are not part of reality.

Yes, the term "reality" is now accepted by many as all inclusive term. And it is this very practice of using the term which I doubt to be fruitful for a strict thinking.

I do not believe that words as such can have a real impact. If I, for instance, do not speak some language the words of that language will not have any immediate real impact on me, they just will not exist for me. What have an impact are those meanings which I can add to something which I accept in my thought as something real.

Okay well have you read about neuroplasticity, studied neurophysics, taken classes in neuropsychology??? Have you tried EEG or experienced other such brainscans. Have you read the book "The brain that changes itself" In my research I have. Have you ever read any story that triggered "a chain reaction, the chemical precursors that trigger the onset of an emotion" if you have never felt emotion from something someone said then perhaps you can actually believe that words do not impact you. Wait hold on a second, you say meaning in words can impact your neurophysiology but not words themselves? You say words in a language you don't understand will not impact you aha. Well that would mean you think noise does not impact you right? Have you ever listened to binarual beats, or isochronic beats? Used a mind machine, an Audio Visual System for brainwave entrainment? Does music effect you even if the words are in a foreign language? Because what I mean is that words have an actual impact in your biologicial tissue regardless of whether you know you have been impacted. Just like a loud jarring sound or a soft harmonic voice will have different impacts on your neurology. Words effect braincells.

I think that, for now at least, there is no all inclusive term that could not be questioned. And this is a problem for philosophy. Concerning strict thinking, I belive that it is not possible before vague terms will be removed from language of thinking.

Words and sounds are not the same. I said of words, not of sounds. Words can be not only spoken aloud but also written and so on. Sound can have an impact on me, as well as an apple that falls down onto my head. But word without meaning cannot.

What is strict thinking? Do you mean in Aristotle's idea that everything is either true or it is false? Is strict thinking like seeing the world in black and white? Does strict thinking exclude the existence of that which is neither true nor not true, and does it exclude that which is both true and not true?

Did I miss the memo on some new imperial imperative by the thought police knights of the old republic of chin-a-merican and the federation of monkeys of the junglebook who all agree so it must be so, and the universal church of established science by fiat rather than experimentation, that we are all supposed to be thinking a certain way now? Are the thought police coming to iron all our thoughts into rational reductionist logic, and linear syntax, shall I always think with perfect punctuation grammar and spelling in my head? Is that strict thinking?

True and false are terms of logic, not of being. For Aristotle, logos is in the basis of being as well as of logic. And this is disputable for me. In order to divorce thought and reality, one must remove logos from the basis of being.

Well, I wouldn't make an idol from the method of experimentation as well, as I wouldn't make an idol from Sir Francis Bacon who was its renown father. To put one idol instead of another is not yet a sign of free thinking.

First you say strict thinking, now you say free thinking, what happened to strict thinking? Why even let the thought police into your head? Just tell them "stay out of my head thought police I don't consent to your laws, or your judgments!" then you can be free of the laws of free thinking. Then no one can scold you for not doing proper free thinking!

Well, when one moves from Aristotle to Plato she or he suddenly finds out that there is no strict thinking without a police (the very word comes from a famous Plato's masterpiece).

And she or he comes back to Aristotle, she or he could be probably very surprised by relising that the role played in Plato's Republic by the police is played in Aristotle's philosophy by the laws of logic. And what he says is that one cannot just say to the laws: "Stand out of my mind".

Rostyslav Dymerets As far as I know Browne's point is how to become free from political institutions not from the frames of logic. He talks about freedom of an individual without disputing Aristotle's identity law which is in the basis of the concept of individual.

Well, quantum physics seems to be free from Aristotle's laws. But it is not free from Frege's meanings! So, some another logic rule over it! And that's the problem: quantum physics is also not about reality: things actually disappear in it, they are just concepts there.

Aristotles law of identity is "a thing is itself" but he does not say "a thing is a thing" in Haskel when you write an identity you don't say A : A, because that's redundant.

Micah Blumberg
A = A is a bastardization of the law of identity, it takes something with the profoundity of the first law of thermodynamics and it reduces it to ham fisted redundancy. You've taken the identity out of identity.

Rostyslav Dymerets
And since the meanings are created by humans, with their judgements and conclusions, they are still ironically subjected to Aristotle's laws, though in an even more complicated way.

Micah Blumberg
a man is himself, is identity. a man is a man, is redundancy without identity

Rostyslav Dymerets
You've taken the identity
out of identity.

Exactly! This was ridiculed already in a famous story on Baron Munchausen who pulled themself out from the bog.

Micah Blumberg
Aristotle's three laws break down in three places, in Buddhist reasoning, in mathematics, and in quantum physics.

Micah Blumberg
Buddha's concept of identity has no conflict with modern math and modern physics, unlike Aristotle.

Rostyslav Dymerets
How do you understand: "thing is itself"? This formula would be meaningles for Aristotle.

Micah Blumberg
You are what you are from a point of view, but not from all points of view. From space you might be less than a dot.

Rostyslav Dymerets
This formula was derived rather from Kant with his famous "ding an sich".

Micah Blumberg
"Now "why a thing is itself" is a meaningless inquiry (for—to give meaning to the question 'why'—the fact or the existence of the thing must already be evident—e.g., that the moon is eclipsed—but the fact that a thing is itself is the single reason and the single cause to be given in answer to all such questions as why the man is man, or the musician musical, unless one were to answer, 'because each thing is inseparable from itself, and its being one just meant this.' This, however, is common to all things and is a short and easy way with the question.)"

Rostyslav Dymerets 
I wouldn't agree about Buddha's role in contemporary physics and mathemathics, and, I believe, he also wouldn't.

Rostyslav Dymerets 
What is really great Indian contribution to the math is their number 'zero'. But it was accepted by matematicians long time ago.

Micah Blumberg 
I'm not suggesting Buddha has a role in math and physics, only that his reasoning seems cleaner, more compatible, and perhaps even better than Aristotles three laws. Aristotle's laws seem to have regional application instead of universal application. They are not federal laws, their state laws.

Rostyslav Dymerets
 In your quatation you touched the concept of evidence, and this is a very difficult question. Because it is connected with concepts of perception, proofs, deduction and so on. All this must be explaned, not just be taken for granted.

Micah Blumberg 
Its like the laws of thermodynamics applied to dieting, you've seen the equation yes? change in delta energy is energy in minus energy out? but that doesn't say anything about causality. consuming one thousand calories of sugar vs consuming one thousand calories of fat will have a different effect, because the body is partitioned to store energy when insulin is triggered, and fat won't trigger insulin, sugar will. So thermodynamics isn't complex enough to explain biology at large scales. Simple laws like Aristotle's three laws, or Godel's incompleteness theorum just do not apply to all contexts, in reality and or in thought.

I would like to reply on some of your previous remarks. To consider something from different points of view was presented already by Zenon of Elea as a paradox, or aporia. It puts a limit to applicability of Aristotelian logic, that is why it is actually ignored by it.

Rostyslav Dymerets 
Well, but there is no reality in quantum theory, because there are no perceptible things. If you are ready to sacrifice reality then you can accept quantum physics and maybe even Buddha. But without reality, without things there is no Universe. And nothing universal can be without a Universe.

Micah Blumberg
So the new idea is to apply topoi, or category theory to Artificial Intelligence, meaning to thinking, to thought, thus began the facebook group called Categories & Geometry of the mind. Somehow your mind has partitioned reality and thinking into two different disconnected non-intersecting spaces, without any explanation, and I almost feel like your drawing a conclusion that is equivalent to me asking what created G-d? and you answering back that G-d created G-d. What is frustrating is that you can express a conjecture with zero reasoning behind it. Like it is some axiom that thought and reality are on two different planes, you don't have to explain why, you don't have to prove it, you don't have to argue it with reason, you just declare it by fiat, and its frustrating https://www.facebook.com/groups/categories.and.geometry.of.mind/

"Well, but there is no reality in quantum theory, because there are no perceptible things. If you are ready to sacrifice reality then you can accept quantum physics and maybe even Buddha. But without reality, without things there is no Universe. And nothing universal can be without a Universe." 
Quantum physics is perceivable because it is predictable, we perceive it by accurately predicting the odds of the next state. If you watch that Ted Talks video I linked earlier in this thread you will hear and see that quantum physics actually applies at all scales of reality, your looking at quantum physics right now. You won't sacrifice reality by accepting this, you will be sacrificing illusion, or the illusion of an imagined reality that was never real, except on average. Reality is real on average, the rest of the time it's not even here.

Micah Blumberg
However please respond to anything I wrote earlier. Please explain why reality and thought have to be disconnected, non-intersecting, I mean I guess if you believe Aristotle's three laws define reality itself you might have to think that reality and thought are disconnected, but why would you do that?

Rostyslav Dymerets
I don't think that quantum physics is actually applied to reality. In my opinion, the argument that quantum physics is perceivable because it is predictable is based on the wrong assumption that reality must be predictable. Reality is not predictable. After all, what is predictability?

Rostyslav Dymerets
A concept of predictability is based on the assumption that every number of items can be put in a more or strict sequence which could be depicted as a line or trajectory. That means that in a sense all reality can be reduced to a line. However, the question then is: what is behind this line? Emptiness? Could you imagine that all the reality is just a thin line? OK, maybe. But then it has to have a very complicated geometrical structure. And what is then reality, the line or the structure, or maybe something else?

Rostyslav Dymerets
Anyway, if we accept that reality is the line, then the structure is something else, because the structure is not the line. What is then the structure? And what is the connection between the line and the structure? Actually, there are much more questions.
Quantum physics can predict in which place of the structure and in which time we can meet the line. But this is a kind of agreement like that made between two humans concerning their meeting at a special place and at a special time. But this is not the reality, because there could be made some another agreement as well.

Micah Blumberg
"Reality is not predictable. After all, what is predictability?" If reality was not somewhat predictable your brain wouldn't work, because your brain is in large part a memory-becomes-prediction machine.


Micah Blumberg
In another dimension of awareness, the sun does not appear to be a ball of fire in the sky, it appears to be a line. A streak across the sky. The sphere in the fourth dimension is a line.

Micah Blumberg
Seeing reality as a line is just another perspective, it does not mean you have to then find structure elsewhere. Its still there, in the line.

Rostyslav Dymerets 
It doesn't prove anything. All this can be just imagined by us. One can depict some fantastic images and put them into a computer's memory, and every time after activating the memory they will predictably appear on the screen of the computer, but all this still doesn't mean that the pictures reflect reality.

Micah Blumberg
All a man has is his best bet, and his best bet is all he needs to move. There are a lot of possibilities, and what the brain does is synthesize a best bet about what is real in order to coordinate movement, movement that is essentially pathfinding, connecting cells to sources of nutrients in the world. Life is a hungry dissipative system, life is a vortex, consuming, and exporting entropy to maintain and increase its equalibrium. Life is like a hurricane, or galaxy, in some respects, order increases in one area to further increase entropy elsewhere. This dissipative process preserves alignment with the second law of thermodynamics. A man doesn't need to prove anything in his life, all he has is already all he needs to move. His best bet, belief, and memory-prediction chain reaction to coordinate dynamic movement.

Rostyslav Dymerets
Is it your point that brain is a kind of computer?

Micah Blumberg
No, the point is that its a vortex, whatever it consumes effects it's equilibrium. Whether it consumes words it doesn't understand, or words that contain more meaning.

Micah Blumberg
I don't think reality and thought are two different disconnected realms hovering near each other. I wasn't persuaded by your argument which adds needless complexity. Thought is physical, its just very small you do not usually see it. The quantum realm is also physical and real. Sorry I was not persuaded by your arguments about the quantum realm not being part of reality either. You lack rationalized justification for such needless additional complexity.


Rostyslav Dymerets 
Well, nevertheless for me it was useful discussion. Thanks.
