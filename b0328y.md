Parkinson's chat

Micah Blumberg: I started a group on Facebook. It's called Neurophysics & Medical Research and I'm starting to share some stories there and basically news stories about in in general research that in some cases is many years old about Parkinson's disease.

I think that the protein folding situation with Alpha Go with using a neural network to discover to, basically create a map between gene sequences and the 3D shapes that can be produced by proteins is a big step forward, obviously that has to continue to where we can understand what cellular communication sequences at the genetic level can lead to the formation of specific receptor shapes, specific cell types. This is this is massive future work that has to be, we're going to need even bigger computer systems than we have today to sort of like get to the point where we can you know, have have a neural network basically discover a point by point. What are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from, you know, basically taking the existing to genetic code and building a person out of that code. Because all of that has to do with basically unlocking these cellular functions through the communication between cells.

and and when that goes wrong, we have all these diseases. What I sort of like if recently been focused on is is all these links between these different major diseases that we have that, you know, there are proteins that are being identified that link together cancer and neurodegenerative diseases and vascular diseases.

And there could be some like really profound discoveries ahead of us in the near term by using artificial neural networks. To accelerate research in biology. So that the computer can look for basically patterns and in a way that is just sort of tireless compared to, you know, human researchers needing to try to figure out things because they're like automating the process of looking for for patterns that help us to map cellular functions & misfunctions.

We see papers like there's this protein called FMNL2.

05:40
And  that as recently been linked to both Alzheimer's and vascular, disease and cancer, including color, rectal, and breast cancer.

Yes a researchers identified this but this took a long time and and when we are using neural networks to help us identify proteins, that are that are sort of broadly involved in a lot of different illnesses.

06:17
That's like the search for new treatments. And new targets for therapy is being accelerated by computers and by advances in technology. And so that is a reason to be optimistic. I'll just yield the floor. If anyone wants to comment on that.

06:47

JOYCE WATERHOUSE SPEAKING
I think that that's very interesting. I have a question because I tend to favor the some kind of new research that's been building that it's that maybe the microbiome or and/or, low grade infection underlies, a lot of conditions, and I'm thinking it's not necessarily mutually exclusive with what you're talking about.

07:15
But if you have stressors from this sort of low grade infection, or call it microbiome dysbiosis if you want, 

Microbiome Dysbiosis
https://www.microbiomedysbiosis.com/

whichever, I don't know that it could cause stress on the cells and cause different malfunctions and I don't know what she think of the growing literature on on L form bacteria,

L-form bacteria
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-form_bacteria

for one thing, or there's some research on both bacteria and fungi in the brain of some of these conditions.

07:54
Anyway, just some thoughts.

08:08

L-form bacteria, chronic diseases and the origins of life
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27672147/

Micah Blumberg speaking: 
Hmm. Let me think, well, I think that, I guess, I guess, I guess that the

08:24
And in terms of causes, I think that that's what, that's, that's right on target, that that basically anything that can get in in there and into the the brain to stress out our cells might cause malfunctions, right? So, so we could be talking about bacteria or fungi or we could be talking about, just inflammation resulting from a virus resulting, or from physical injury resulting from (some other pathogen or force)

08:53
So, I mean, I generally agree that, you know, if we're if you're if you're putting a lot of, if you're putting a lot of mechanical stress on a cell from from, you know, it's being attacked by bacteria or fungi or viruses, specifically, including COVID-19 that, that might cause a malfunction.
09:14

Cell Wall Deficient Foms: Stealth Pathogens https://www.lymebook.com/cell-wall-deficient-forms-mattman

So, I, yeah, I agree. That is, it definitely a, cause even, I think some some, when people can, you know, if someone consumes some sort of food or drug that's not good for their body, that might also be a contributing factor to diseases. I'll run and mute myself to yield the floor.

JOYCE WATERHOUSE

09:44
As a you're probably familiar with the work of Rudy Tanzi.

Rudolph E. Tanzi, PhD
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_E._Tanzi
https://brain.harvard.edu/?people=rudolph-e-tanzi

 And then there's also somebody who put out a contest for called germ. Quest for Alzheimer's disease. He, he was thinking that he was like a former CDC researcher and and then they, they had a business, they made a lot of money.

10:07
So he put out a million dollar reward for someone who could find an Alzheimer's microbe, it was a cause, but he ended up, I found out. He ended up dividing it among six different people because no one really proved that. It was any one thing. But they submitted proposals that were fairly convincing on the role of several different micros.

10:33
And so then he compared is, maybe it's like pneumonia, you know, it has a lot of different causes sort of anyway. I'm dead as addictive, thoughts and that one.

10:52
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Oh, I was I wanted to see if if unfortunately this didn't tell that of that is not my expertise. So, my brother is doing the biomedical engineering and my sister's doing the technology pasture. So they could more talk about the cellular scientific level of that.

11:15
But for myself I am I'm more of a know more of the care management holistic approach. So not too much input on that. Sorry. All right, I think I'm gonna agree with Joyce that there's there's a potentially multiple things that can that can cause disease. And so, yeah, I'm gonna look up so germ quest and you said Rudy Tansy.

11:43
How do you spell that on? Yeah, tansy. T a n z. I he's at Harvard and I actually was lucky. I actually threw that germ. Quest thing I heard about an NIH workshop, notice national institute of aging workshop online and really tense, you spoke and a number of other people and it was all focused on and set the role of infections in Alzheimer's, or maybe it was just more general dimension in general, and I actually was, especially excited about just researcher, Dr.

12:22
David Corey from Baylor and that research. I don't think has been published yet, but I keep looking for it because he, he found using kind of novel methods, bacteria and fungi in the brain in a very unusual sort of arrangement. He said it, I don't know what he called it something like like a noses is if the bacteria and fungi were living in, you know, a mutualistic relationship like, like, in the lichen that he also referred to the work of Louis Carasco.

13:04
Who's a, who was established microbiologists? Who's now? Retired that he's written a lot of articles about his research, finding fungi and bacteria. That were quite different in the brains of various conditions of the brain mostly, and he's, so, he referred to Dr. Carrasco's work. And then I've heard of another researcher in Scotland who who's working along those lines and then there's a researcher at Oxford that I was kind of excited about hearing.

13:39
His research is progressing his name is Carl Morton m o r t e n and he's having a collaboration. Now, with this laboratory in Utah, that is developed a, an improved method of culturing ell form bacteria and you know, ill form bacteria are, you know there's sort of latent form, you know, if you give you give antibiotics that go after the cell wall or there's other stressors that can do it too.

14:18
It caused bacteria to turn into elf forms a lot of the time and then they can come back and cause problems. But anyway this laboratory and Utah he's collaborating with them and doing research in chronic fatigue syndrome and also some other conditions. And anyway, I I thought video that he that he put out recently and I guess it was in September where he was talking about their plans for their studies and and it should be going by now.

14:50
So I'm excited about that because I've been interested in L form bacteria for a long time. There's a there's a researcher who who's no longer alive now. She did it. Her work over decades and she wrote a book called stealth. Pathogens her name's. Her name's Lida Mattman and there's been a lot of work on it, but just not enough work, though, you know, been a lot of work, but, you know, just not enough focus on it because they're hard to culture.

15:27
Okay, so yes. So, so that's I think that's where I'm sort of optimistic, is that we can accelerate the work of studying the functions and misfunctions of cells with with neural networks in. And that would include studying how pathogens affect how fungi effects cells and, and so on. Yeah, you know, Rudy Townsy is doing work on Alzheimer's, at all, kind of several different levels.

16:04
This kind of interesting, he talks about select three different stages and the early stage where things are going bad is when the diet, he thinks altars the microbiome. And then the middle stage is where that plaque is developing, and he's working on drugs against that too. But then the final stage is where the inflammation kind of takes over.

16:34
And there's another drug that the heat. He's also interested in the using those. I guess they call them organoids or something. Where you make a like a little brain. Yeah, I know about that. Yeah, I think he uses that he and he originally made some important genetic discoveries, which I think sort of launched his is career and that kind of research, but he's kind of branched out to and he's also very interested in the role of infections that I think I think he's focusing a lot on the virus at the moment.

17:10
Whereas, I think, you know, I think there's like you say, you know, I think there's multiple pathogens but but I tend to think the the bacteria in the fungi may be more, maybe more a role in the fung and the viruses come along when you when the systems really weakened but they're actually also as a situation.

17:33
Well, so our so is, is the the thought that of how the fungi is is sort of causing a disruption of the cell? Is that is it, you think that's is that linked directly with with the, the misfolded proteins, like, like the office and nucleon? Do you think or yeah I don't know the details of the molecular aspects of it.

18:05
But Louise Crosco he may have done something in Parkinson's more and that level but but I know what you know the well you know that amyloid data is thought to be a antimicrobial peptide. So I don't know, I don't know, enough of the molecular level to know how that ties into this folded proteins.

18:31
But is the amyloid beta? Misfolded. All right, I can't remember, it's cleaved to differently as I recall the

18:49
Analyze it. Okay, let me pull this up in my computer. So okay.

18:56
I've also read a book by Dale Bredison. I don't know if you've heard of him I mean pull up his Dale. How do you spell his last last name? Bradison breadison b, r e, d e, s e n. Okay, he was a long time, researcher and Alzheimer's in the laboratory.

19:18

19:43
A lot of different things that go wrong in Alzheimer's, and he even talks about something like, there's 36 different problems and if you just try it, you know, to come up with a drug and attack, one of them, you're not going to get anywhere. And so he is, he came up with his comprehensive approach and he's published on it and he's doing another trial because he had a trouble with the IRB because they didn't want to do a study that had multiple interventions.

20:15
And he says, you know that if you need that multiple interventions, then you have to do that. And but finally he got an IRB that he's he's published a lot of case, reports of reversing all timers and you can you can find them if you if you look that he they finally he got them to allow to do, you know, to get an IRB.

20:38
So he could do a regular study. Yeah, I mean I so I mean, I just started really digging into. I was looking at I was, I was looking at the brain in terms of trying to understand how how LTP and LTD, you know, long-term memory and, and forgetting like work in a very precise way.

21:05
And, and that sort of like led me to like, looking at dementia and Alzheimer's, and then, and now Parkinson's, and, and a lot of. And now generally speaking neurodegenerative disorders in their causes and like the whole chain and in the link. And so like you know that that what what you're saying about?

21:26
Like I didn't I didn't in terms of there being 31 different things going wrong, I haven't gotten that far, my research, but I have been like, yes it it's there's issues going going on with with misfolded proteins and with the, the receptors on the cells malfunctioning. And with the the you know, with neurons dying date like the aneurons dopamine neurons dying and in certain in very specific places and the brain and then and then, you know, there's like new research that that says that speculates, that the reason the EBS works is because it's it's there's there's like a brain wave and treatment effect happening from the DPS machine, a certain frequencies.

22:15
That's it's really causing the. It, it seems to be like in training. The the the neurons that weren't that weren't firing to sort of like fire again in in. So like I I think of, I think of, I'm thinking of the disruption's that are, that are happening to the biology at the, on the, on the, you know, to the tissue it's leading to.

22:46
It's, it's like a, it's like an, it's like a receptor disease. It's that's you know it's also killing neurons and there's like all these different points of like you know it started with the misfold of protein and now the cells not firing correctly and now that is that is like why there's this you know these these problems that show up on the synth on the symptomatic side because you know the patients, not able to function the way that used to function and they're not able to move their hands and arms the way they used to move them or you know, in the case of dementia, they're they're not all, they're not all there, they're memories.

23:21
Not all there. And so, you know, if it's like the difference is between these different neurodegenerative diseases are sort of like, which proteins are are misfolding and in collecting and in becoming lewy bodies or or, you know, becoming basically protein deposits like like amyloid beta protein deposits, right? And like, and where it's happening.

23:54
It's like a, it's like, which, which proteins are and where the, which part of the brain is being affected and like, why is this part of the brain being affected? But then that's now like, contributing to cellular miscommunication or or specifically like timing issues in the firing of neurons, that is treated with things like DBS.

24:17
And and also there are some there's been some experiments for their. They can play music to people who have Alzheimer's and they can see that the patient can temporarily sort of come back a little bit from listening to the music and that would be similar to to the concept of brainwave and treatment where you're getting those neurons.

24:38
Sort of like fire in the right sequence. Timing sequence again, and that restore some functionality to the patient that they that they lost at least temporarily in. And so I'm sort of like really interested in and and gently work, you know, he wrote the book, the secret language of cells because he sort of like says, well let's move the focus on biology to basically the communication between neurons and and not answer the communication between cells not neurons.

25:12
But any cells because there is sort of let that's where like maybe the point of study to where we can we can we can bring in the copy to the the people from from, from the the artificial neural network side of things that the computer engineers to sort of like, do this biology work, to take accelerate it by having the computer, look for the things that we used to have neuroscientists and biologists looking for.

25:45
And but there's I think that that, you know, that's sort of like the conversation is beginning between, you know, between the folks who do, you know, artificial neural networks and the folks who study, you know, biology and anise to keep continuing and that's sort of like what I wanted to sort of like maybe start a conversation around.

26:09
So thanks for thanks for coming Joyce and to everybody else. Yeah, you know, I I think that very interesting. I think you know interesting stuff will come out of that especially for my perspective about the basic biology and understanding how it works. My own perspective though, is that, you know, that that I think will get more will get farther in really getting to the root cause in other ways, you know, we might come up with drugs that do some things and maybe a some benefit.

26:50
But I don't personally don't think they'll be the root cause they might help some, you know, like he said the deep brain stimulation, you know, it helps some that, you know, wasn't anything like it cure or something, you know. It's interesting about Dr. Cory. He comes from came from a kind of respiratory illness background and he discovered that at least in where he lives in Houston, Texas, that fungi, kind of basically a fungal infection, probably under lies.

27:26
A lot of asthma and it's interesting that asthma is a big predispatch predisposition for Alzheimer's and having worse Alzheimer's. But anyway, it turns out that the fungi are not being detected because, you know, he was able to detect them by altering, the technique that he said, he found out the mucus is very good at killing the fungi and so when you sampled the normal way, you're taking the fungi out with the mucus and you get, you don't get anything alive and so he figured out how to do it without killing them.

28:02
And so, then he could culture on, but anyway, that's my own perspective. But, and I'm sure the that, you know, this, these two lines of research will come together and it will all make so much sense. Someday. Yeah 100% that's the how how far? How fungi you even like so.

28:33
So so was one interesting thought that I have is that, you know, we could we could sort of like, okay, let's say that I was reading this. There was looking at this paper that was about how I think it was all. I think it may have been ultrasound or mechanos how mechanical vibrations could could basically cause nuclear deformations or basically, they can impact the nucleus of a cell, and that will trigger the cell to unlock a certain response.

29:16
Like the cell will respond based upon how you on the signal, you've given it's it's nucleus. And so it would be interesting to say, okay well if there's a fungi that basically can produce a certain response from a cell because at some point a signal goes from the fungi to the nucleus of the cell and that produces a cell to have a certain response where it does a certain thing.

29:46
Maybe it creates a new protein and a new cell receptor. I'm, you know, or maybe it mistles a protein that so we'll find out what that is. But if we could say, all right, well this fungi affects the the cell nucleus and it produces this result and this ultrasound vibration affects the nuclei and produces the same result.

30:10
And basically we can say that, you know, we can start to because start to describe, okay? Well, now there's an there's a similar pattern between the emerging from the cell if you stimulate it with you with with signals from from the fungus or signals from ultrasound or signals from some chemical and that causes the cell to exhibit the same behavior because in some way at this on the tissue level, there's an isomorphism between these different signals.

30:45
They're causing the cell to respond in a specific in this specific way, that's the same way. And so at that point, the treatment could be a chemical or. It could be ultrasound or like a mechanical vibration or it could be, you know, I mean, maybe it's it's a, it's a, it's a message that's basically a piece of RNA, or, or a, and it or it could be just a T cell that has been configured, like, the way that configuring, you know, T cells with immunotherapy, the, basically the T cell identifies, the cells that are problematic and then it transmits.

31:29

An exciting new immunotherapy approach to brain inflammation.
https://twitter.com/worksalt/status/1530305736089038848?s=20&t=hVsgzcwCZTFXPzwvCK2gVA

The particular message that the deep learning known networks. Have identified that we'll trigger the cell to behave in the way we want the self to behave in order to clear the cure the illness. And so that's sort of like what I'm looking for is, you know, to bring in the fungal research with with all this other research, it might be of a way to sort of, like look for isomorphisms between different ways of communicating with the cell.

31:59
But also comparing contrast to find out which way of interacting with the cell is going to be the most fruitful for the outcome that we want for outcome. In terms of like either telling this either instruction, this out to exhibit the behavior that we want or to identify and destroy cells, that are disease beyond beyond the point of of fixing them, if that's the approach that, that, that the the doctor wants to go through for treatment.

32:38
Yeah, you know, and, and for one thing, it at this stage of things that I'm not sure whether one could reverse, the kind of infection, you know, assuming that doctor Cory and Dr. Crossbow is cracked that and very elderly person. Might not be able to withstand treatment to kill the microbes, so they might be able to just use some method to kind of ameliorate the effects, you know, using something like you're talking about, but I would really might really be interested in like reading doctors book because it's fairly easy to understand.

33:17
Or if you don't want to read his book, he's actually on a lot of interviews and podcasts and stuff. You can hear a kind of summary view of it, because he talks about, you know, blood sugar. Insulin is a big factor, he talks about several different types. He calls them types of Alzheimer's, based on their data.

33:41
They collect on people and and their responses to treatment. That's really interesting types of Alzheimer's. I'm looking at I wanted to ask you joyous what? Let me have this type of Alzheimer's real quick. What how do I spell a doctor? Chris Crisco's, Dr. Chriskins name cor. Let's see. A r r.

34:06
A s c o and okay Lewis Carrasco. Okay, we see. Yeah, you IS. I've actually corresponded with him and and he he's got actually a couple of books that he wrote after even retired that are available on that are fairly easy breeds because they're meant more for non-specialists. Oh, do you have maybe one of the names of the books or so I can make sure I got the right guy and, you know, I might still have it in my bio.

34:42
I had his oh in. Let me see what. I've been my bio out now. And yeah I've got really turns in about yeah. Nerd of diseases at the human microbiota. So I see that in your bio. I'm looking at it right now with whisk or rasca. Great. I just I just did a screenshot so I can look this up.

35:12
Great. So these are people you're very familiar with and so this is a topic that you like a lot. That's great. Okay. Now, well, I'm and interested in all sorts of diseases that I think I have a feeling that these hard to detect, my probes could underly. A lot of diseases.

35:34
Yeah, so I think they underlie chronic fatigue syndrome. You know, this research. I was mentioning Carl called Morton. Call Morton m o r t e n? Okay. The car with a pay. Yeah KARL. Okay. I just watched this YouTube video that he, you know, in a few minutes I could get you the link to the YouTube video if you're interested but then you put might be able to find it if you Google it better.

36:08
I love the I think I Googled the L form that area Oxford Chrome Morton, and I think this YouTube video came up, okay. Separate video. I'm really excited that it's research. I was so excited that it that I wrote to, I don't know if you know that open medicine foundation are it's it's devoted to solving chronic fatigue syndrome and related conditions, and they've raised a lot of money.

36:41
And and I think kind of contact with the the person who's in charge and some and so so I sent information to her and I said, you know, would you be interested in helping fund them because they were talking in the video about how they were struggling to get money and they even talked about the open medicine foundation saying, yeah, they raise much money, right?

37:05
They have a full-time staff to help things. So I'm hoping that both aside to help them and she replied to me, was she seemed interested. Nice. Yeah, I I'm interested. You said you said the name of a research group just now and I was gonna write it down but I was.

37:26
Yeah, Carl Morton. Yeah, I found his name and I found his crowdfunding campaign, understanding the causes of, of chronic fatigue syndrome. And and my allergic and self-lightus and I'm sorry. Open medicine. Foundation open medicine. Yeah, open medicine foundation. It's it's headed. Well, I don't know exactly who heads it, but the research effort is headed by wrong Davis.

37:52
Who's a actually a famous scientist. He heads, the human genome institute at Stanford. Whoa, and his son has a very severe case of any CFS.

38:10
Okay, so they're doing a lot and Linda Tannenbaum is the one. I was mentioning she, she teamed up with him. She was trying to raise money and it was not having much success but then when she got him involved and they you know it was able to bring in more money.

38:27
I think because he liked knows all these Nobel Prize winners and he was able to help bring in a lot of money along with her help. So I have Linda Tannenbaum on my, on my screen and I'm just, she's the CEO and president of the open medicine foundation, great, right?

38:48
She had her own laboratory and her daughter. I think that's why she got involved. Have you heard so? So I I've been using on the topic of CFG chronic fatigue syndrome or is waiting CFS. I I've been using ID Rivers supplements for years and that's it's been helpful for me.

39:21
You taking the rivers for used to take a lot of supplements but at a certain point I realized I was just too sensitive to tolerate then they just made me worse because I reacted to them and so that that's what led me eventually to have to go. This totally different route to try to figure out the source of the sensitivities, which turned out to be good.

39:49
Because I discovered a lot of things, and I think I may be able to help a lot of people. Do you want to talk about some of the things that you you've discovered because I'm I'm totally curious. Okay. Well, there is this book. I learned about a long time ago called the Pulse test by Dr.

0:12
Arthur Koka, who was a prominent immunologist? He was like the head of the major medical laboratory for 17 years that later was part of Pfizer. He founded the journal immunology and so on. But at a certain point, he actually had various health difficulties and he and his wife discovered the fact that the heart rate was affected by reactions to foods.

40:44
And so he ended up doing research, he wrote, he wrote books, he wrote articles, but I learned about a book that he wrote in the 1950s late in his career when he found out that the scientific establishment wasn't going for it, you know, even though other people verified what he found.

41:07
But anyway, he wrote a book called the Pulse test that my mom brought home from a library. She worked to the library. Anyway, later on, I mean I found that his test didn't work that well for me because I just reacted to everything. And and so it didn't get very far but eventually I found out about another version of it that you can do that was a shortcut test so he had you test your heart rate 14 times a day and that really wasn't very helpful when you reacted to everything.

41:46
And then there's delayed reactions and so on. And so, so the shortcut test, I improved upon it learned a lot about cross-reactions between different foods and different foods and inhalants and everything. And so eventually I learned ways of reducing the reactions. And and then the last year, I realized actually is like a year and a half ago.

42:21
I got an app and watch because I had heard that it was pretty accurate. And so I thought well maybe I should know, I could learn something using the Apple watch and so I started making observations with that and it was very helpful and I realized that that a better way of figuring out the food reactions was to actually just have it like on the activity tracker.

42:50
Why you were eating and that there was a fairly abrupt increase in the heart rate, just about 20 seconds after you ate the food but it varied a lot and if I didn't react, it would only go up a couple beads a minute but if I reacted more it go up like 10 or 15 beats a minute.

43:10
And so I looked into it and I realized that that I could actually patent this method and I could have an app that would help people identify food reactions and I think it could make what Dr. Koka realized, much more accessible and maybe even mainstream. I hope, because can you really argue with that data.

43:44
I mean, some people probably will, they'll say, oh, it's psychological or something that I know it isn't. So anyway, I'm hoping that, you know, I'm doing this for humanitarian reasons, I have to do it because I got better and I feel like it can help a lot of people.

44:02
So I have to figure out a way to do it, even though I'm not really, I'm not a business person, it's not really in my DNA, but I'm, I'll do whatever. I I need to do to try to get this out to people and then hopefully kind of leverage the app which is of course, easier to get out there to develop my other acid into a device.

44:28
I can, you can do it manually but that I figured that having an automated way would be better especially for people who are just well, and so anyway. Yeah, I'm not a business. I'm not really like a business focused, a person either. I guess I'm more on the research side and interested in and and discovering new concepts.

44:57
It's sort of like more on the research or side of things but that's that's sounds like a promising idea. I hope you perceive that. Well yeah, well I have to pursue it. I don't I don't have any choice in the matter. Yeah. That's the way I look upon it.

45:11
You know. Very cool. You know I'll tell you the other thing that that between you know, if you look at Dr, Coco's book. How many different symptoms were helped? You'll be astonished. And I'm sure his reliable, because I've confirmed it plus, you know, he was confirmed by other people, too.

45:34
But in addition to that, there are numerous, many, many studies, and several meta analysis showing that resting heart rate elevation is associated with all cause mortality including cancer Alzheimer's. You know, I'm various other conditions and cocoa was able to lower people's resting heart rate and I have lowered my own resting heart rate so and in the research studies with the meta-analysis and all at least some of them controlled for exercise.

46:09
So it wasn't just fitness lowering the heart rate. That was the issue. Yeah. Yeah. So that, that that's the fact finding a match between heart rates and, and the different foods that people eat and that that's, that's, that's really a great study. And you. And if I could share some other ideas, it's any kind of sensor that you can put into a watch.

46:39
You could, you know, you could, you can use to combine with the heart rate data, and to look for correlations that or, you know, basically have the computer do obvious, create a log of observations, that, that might have medical values. So, so just to sort of blank friends. Like, yeah, I tried to, in my provisional patent.

47:10
I tried to think of all the different possible times, kind of measurements, you could use. And and actually I'm making measurements on myself, you know, and you actually said something very interesting one day that see I am using an EEG headband, also often times during my meals, but kind of on purpose, I decided not to really study much about them.

47:37
Because, you know, I and I know people are always going to say, oh it's psychological like I've affected my EEG, which I would have no idea how to effect it. But I thought if I didn't know much about what it meant and then I couldn't really be accused of somehow affecting it, but I have noticed changes with the EEG as my sensitivities have gone down.

48:05
I remember I heard overheard you saying something like the delta and theta waves were indication of like lower energy in your brain or something. So, something like that. So you always, we always have Delta in the way it's happening, but if you have an, if you have a predominance of Delta in theta, they that's that's seen more often when people are depressed or a low energy or chronic fatigue or sleeping.

48:35
So that's probably close to what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah and then I remember, I heard years ago that chronic fatigue center of was characterized by intrusions of delta waves during the daytime and then intrusion of waves associated with wakefulness in the night. But the thing that I've observed, one of the things with the EEG is that it used to be almost always when I was eating things especially when I reacted more to them.

49:13
The Delta waves would go up pretty high and now they don't typically or if they do, maybe it's just a little bit or they go up and down or something like that. So anyway, I, it's an interesting journey. I continue to watch my it EUG and it's been changing over time and it'll be interesting to see how it ends up when I completely get over the reactions, which I hope to do, I'm still not completely over them.

49:41
Yeah, I really found. So, I did a lot of back in between 2012 and 2014. I, I did a lot of work with EEG and a lot of different experiments actually. And I think of it as if you do narrow feedback, if you just sort of like find a way to either visualize or listen to your own brain signals or other, you know, biofeedback signals then that it is a little bit like studying yourself, studying your facial expressions in the mirror or just like, you know, really listening to your voice as a singer as or you know, in in terms of like what it?

50:29
What it, what a person can do from studying themselves in the mirror, like an actor, studying them studying their fate, their own face in the mirror is sort of become more aware of how what they're doing on the inside. And their brain is, is causing different. Facial expressions to emerge or different sounds to emerge from, you know, from their voice if they're practicing singing or practicing acting and and with EEG it's it's what I found was that the more I sort of focused on how my brainwave has were changing the light and sound effects.

51:07
The more I started to understand how I was changing my brain waves because then I could I could actually sort of like with my thoughts and feelings sort of exert some significant influence over the light and sound that I was saying. And so that that's what I was doing for a couple years was just a lot of experimentation with with EEG.

51:33
So if you that that could be something look forward to if you'd decide to go deeper into each and the future. Yeah, well you know, I hope that and I feel pretty confident that someday, you know, that all of this will be figured out and I think it will tie into the research on the microbes.

51:59
As I think that I think there's a in a relationship between the food reactions and the microbes, You know that microbes do up regulate the immune system for one thing and and I think what I'm doing helps normalize the microbiota in your gut and and maybe even in your tissues, you know because if you're functioning better you're going to be able to control infections better and actually that's another thing that Dr.

52:31
Coka reported on is that he he looked at it, a whole bunch of people that worked at the laboratory that he he was the medical director of and he was able to correlate the tendency to get colds with the level of reactions to foods. And I know I used to get a lot more infections than I have as I've gotten better I gotten hardly I think I've had two colds in the last 12 years as I've been proved.

53:02
So I think the immune functioning is effective a lot. Try this sort of nice. Yeah, no. I'm I'm I'm optimistic. That shouldn't maybe. Maybe optimistic is the wrong word. I am. I'm, I'm curious that's the right word. I'm curious about whether immunos that like the research on on, on path, it on fungal pathogens and back in bacteria and viruses will will end up leading us to some, some sort of like amino therapy that some sort of complex immune therapy treatment that might address can't a multitude of cancers and and narrow degenerative disorders.

53:54
And and, and heart disease and aging all at once, like it, I like maybe it's it's gonna come down to once. We've once this has been figured out and mapped out that there will be some sort of like T cell therapy. That possible one of the problems is, I tend to think that from what I've been reading that is probably a lot of different microbes and so if you try to do the antimicrobial route, it might be difficult because it may not be that all of them would respond.

54:33
And and and then there's also the problem I actually was on an anti-bacterial protocol and it did help. But the problem was that every time you were killing bacteria, you felt lousy and and it seemed like it was going to take forever. And at a certain point, I had this downturn and I just couldn't tolerate trying to to do that anymore.

54:57
I just didn't tolerate the medications anymore. So killing the microbes may be difficult, but maybe, you know, you think Ideally, you might be able to combine antimicrobials with some kind of immune modulation to to maybe to maybe do it, but it's going to be difficult. But anyway, whatever happens I I think that you know, it could be that my approach will be helpful, you know, it may not be the best.

55:31
I've had to do it, you know on my own without any help of any kind without any medication, just feeling my way through it. But you know, I'm thinking that sometime I'm gonna probably contact this Dr. Morton on what I've been doing. And he, I don't know if he knows about this other protocol, that I did over the years, that a number of people done, it was published, but I don't know if he would have heard it.

56:01
Heard about it. What? What was the name of it? It was called the Marshall protocol and and actually I, I have a publication and pubmed because I was volunteering for this organization that was using this protocol and it used five different antibiotics but they were all that low doses and you pulse them you didn't take them every day and you didn't take them all at once.

56:30
You had a process you went through. The thing is that if you started out with too high dose, you got such a bad die of reaction. And so, yes. So I have a publication in public that I did. That came out of that volunteering because several of us we went to a conference and I was a conference.

56:56
We went to a conference in Portugal and it's called can't remember, but he has a conference focuses on autoimmunity in general. And so, anyway, I there's some things about that protocol. I have critique of but I just I just found something in PubMed reversing bacteria induced vitamin D receptor.

57:30
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think I think that Dr. Marshall had some things wrong about vitamin D, but that may be something for the right. I don't know. But anyway, I yeah, that's that's an article I wrote about the protocol. And yeah, so he was against using vitamin D because he thought they're acceptors were blocked by the bacteria and that the vitamin D really didn't do any good but but I don't think he was completely right about that.

58:07
Okay. So your pro vitamin D supplements? Well, I'm kind of in between, I actually don't really take, I have a multivitamin, so I get some vitamin D. I try to give a little bit of sun, but I'm not really big on taking a whole bunch of vitamin D. I guess it's partly because of, I don't know, I'm kind of torn between his viewpoint that it's.

58:34
It could be even immunosuppressive at times. Well, I mean, they know that it can be, you know, suppressive and it's really high. It's but so, I mean, I so I've heard that some supplements at they might like, you know. So there's this this I guess it's sort of a new research area of studying gradients themselves, or gradients can help cells to have sort of like, an awareness of the environment.

59:07
And, you know, it's like, I don't know, that's the right, really? The right way to frame it, but you know, with gradient cells can, you know, if you have this like the positive, some and my understanding of this is a little bit limited, but if you have a deposit of some of some chemical gradient, for example, that that the that was built up because the cell consumed, a lot of vitamin A, or a lot of vitamin B, this chemical gradient when might then cause the cell to grow its membrane or, or it it might cause the membrane of a fat sack to increase in size or decrease in size based upon how much of this gradient has accumulated from from supplements that people are taking and and so there's different.

01:00:05
There's different. Sort of like emerging research and emerging mysteries around how self behavior is affected by a chemical gradient. And how chemical gradients are sort of like important for cells to be able to communicate with other cells, in a spatial way to solve certain certain certain problems and or just to conduct certain sort of certain functions like that, I don't want to answer.

01:00:41
Like, sometimes I read researchers and they sounds like they're sort of, anthropomorphizing the cells and the behaviors that are observed to some degree. Like the cells aware of it's environment, what does that mean exactly? But there's also just like, like little bacteria. I think about when the immune systems fighting the microbes is like we have our two little armies of.

01:01:03
It's almost like they're little microbes fighting each other. You know you mean cells fighting the bacteria? Yeah, and cancer is the, the parallels between cancer and, and, and little armies, like they're like the very sophisticated behaviors coming from kit from cancer where they, these are like, they that, like, they colonize other cells and they, and they have strategies like war strategies and they they take out they'll take cells over and make the cell act against the rest of the organism.

01:01:43
And it's, it is sort of like tempting to sort of like think of cancer as a very intelligent enemy. It's very sophisticated. Yeah, the power of evolution. Yeah. Or I think that my brain is very appreciative and very thankful and very full is that. If we've had it, we've made, we've been able to talk about a lot of stuff tonight so I.

01:02:16
Yeah. Interesting. Interesting conversation. So I guess I should I should try to schedule another one of these soon. Maybe maybe next week or something and maybe we'll come back and have more to say, yeah. Okay, all right. Well, thank you. Thank you, Joyce, and Elise. And we had a comment from Ivy that was that I said there's one paper from the Australian group using ultrasound to restore memory from from Alzheimer's disease.

01:02:51
And I think it was an animal study in 2016 or 2017 that was in the room chat. But okay caught. All right. Well, I think a second night. Good night. Yes. See you later. Okay, by
