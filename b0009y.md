## 	1: The connection between individual and group behavior in systems, using category theory				
I should go back and revisit the operation where I was attempting to communicate with category theory that there's no difference between the group behavior of many CEOs in a country and the individual behavior of a CEO with regard to what's happening in one sector of the economy. Functionally speaking, it's like saying that the president of the country is guilty for whatever the government officers carry out on the orders of the head of the country. So in that sense, the people who are actually CEOs are guilty of the crimes that the workers are doing at the lowest possible level. So with category theory, it can be shown that if you have two composable functions, as long as the start result and the end result are the same, there can be any number of differences in the in-between step. You could have an in-between step that is just one interval of functional transformation, or it could be a hundred intervals of functional transformation. As long as the first step and the last step are the same, the two functions are composable. And that means that the composability of those two functions means that you can relate, you can assign legal guilt to specific people in a vast, complicated system if, by, anyway. So that's the point of that.
##	2: The impact of individual awareness on systemic change through oscillatory dynamics				
But in a system, like, every component of the system has a sort of shared component. So that means that if every person is a hologram that contains the whole pattern of the whole system, then every person is, in some sense, contributing via consent to the situation that exists in the world. And that is sort of like in order for the world to change, you have to have at least one person actually wake up to what's happening and make that change in their mind, and then that pattern will ripple across the entire world. So what it requires is actually just one person having an aha moment and then transmitting that message to everyone else. And it will spread because of oscillatory dynamics to everyone else. So literally, you can fix the world in your mind. You can look for what's wrong. You can look for who's suffering. You can care about them. And you can fix the world because the patterns that will begin to emerge from you will literally be transmitted across the entire world through the principles of oscillation. And effectively, you can begin to know, you can begin to understand the minds of people across the world. Like, you can begin, it's almost like, I guess, it's like a computational telepathy in a sense, in that if you can receive signals from people on the other side of the planet, and you will because of the principles of oscillation, eventually you can become to understand people that you've never met.
## 	3: The potential of VR and neural networks for understanding and rendering complex 3D environments				
VR provides us with a way of thinking about what your mind needs to be doing in terms of rendering what your perspective is at any given point. NERF, the Neural Radiance Fields, the neural radiance fields gives us an idea of how a neural network might piece together a 3D scene from individual slices. It's a kind of tomography, right? Like the Fourier slice transform is a kind of tomography. Diffusion tensor imaging, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and tractography. All of these concepts are photogrammetry and videogrammetry and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke something that causes you to think about reality as a point field. And they cause you to think about how neural networks can render point fields. And when you get into 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation, or, you know, you know, asking what points belong to what object and then classifying those points or that classifying that object, you're getting into semantic segmentation or 3D semantic segmentation. And so now you're imagining not only how a neural network could render a 3D volume of space, but also you're beginning to understand how a neural network could parse and process and distinguish distinct objects in that 3D space.
## 	4: The computational power of the human brain versus current technology				
And the amount of computational power happening inside the human brain, there's just nothing like it that computers can create today in terms of the number of synaptic transmissions. Synapses and their phases are changing very fast, and their connections are changing very fast. And so it's a dynamic computational system that just vastly exceeds the current state of manufacturing capabilities. But there are, you know, there are certain things, it doesn't mean we can, but we can still build, like computers have different properties. Right., we can create a system that can produce very precise behaviors and very precise... We can control the grade of the inner experience, and we can monitor the development of the inner experience. We can analyze what makes up a person's mind and what makes up an artificial person's mind. Like the data can be broken down and categorized and we can understand the contributions of different factors, almost like different information criteria that have been learned.
##	5: The potential for predictive behavioral analysis using data and the challenges in neurology				
We can understand what kind of oscillation that is going to produce it. And we can make some, we can start to make some high-level predictions as to what types of behaviors are normal for someone and what types of behaviors. There's you know there's a certain amount of there's like a lot of behavior classification right like people are already monitored by the government by their by the oscillations in their behaviors they're sort of like yeah well what you did in the past there's a certain amount of chance you're going to repeat it again and people with your symptoms and your attitudes and your behaviors like you are going to uh you're at risk of these types of behaviors because precisely because um other people with your information configuration your mental information configuration, are likely to do those types of behaviors. That's sort of symptomatic of your group, of your mental group, of people from your school of thought. Certain behaviors are likely to emerge.
## 	6: The role of chemical gradients in biological systems and their effects				
And it's not like, to emerge and it's not like the sort of like you know the way that has been done in the past um it is not is not working uh for society as a whole like um neurology like the state of neurology right now is in pretty bad shape because there's an overwhelming amount of mental illness happening in the world and so um i think that we can you know we can consider how like um when you have like when vitamin a becomes a um when it becomes converted into a chemical gradient, I don't know if it was like retinol A or something like that, it turns into some sort of chemical gradient. But then as that chemical gradient dissipates, it's going to cause effects on the surrounding biology. So there was one hypothesis, and these effects can be like stretching a membrane or shrinking a membrane. It's like that gradient, as it leaks out, it's applying a sort of chemical effect to the area that it's affecting. And that's causing those signals that are coming from the chemical gradient are causing morphological changes in the structure of the biology as a result of the signals dissipating from that chemical sac or chemical gradient. Or it could be actually I don't know but but yeah so that's like so it's not just like it's not just like neurotransmitters that are causing changes in cell behaviors and it's not just you know strands of RNA or DNA that are being sent as messengers between cells but also there's chemical gradients it's like you know sacks of chemicals that accumulated because you took vitamins or you ate vitamins right from your food and those are causing sort of changes in your in your system and your biology.
## 	7: Historical and theoretical foundations for building sentient self-aware neural networks				
So, some of the key concepts involved here is that one is, if you look at bringing sentient self-aware networks to the world, is that one, if you look at the current state of science, this was already inevitable. Science was already approaching this point. In fact, the concepts needed to build sentient self-aware neural networks have existed basically since Donald Hebb wrote the Organization of Behavior. At that point, between Einstein and Donald Hebb and, I don't know, a lot of other mathematicians and physicists and biologists, we had enough information back then to have figured out how to build sentient and self-renewable networks. In my opinion, it was just a lot of wrong sort of research networks. In my opinion it was just a lot of wrong sort of research directions. But we had enough of the essential concepts back then. We just didn't go far enough. Like we could have had sentient and self-aware neural networks figured out in Einstein's day.
##	8: The analogy of neural networks to the human brain and their capabilities				
Now, what has changed though, what's changed the equation is that we have, you know, in terms of, like, helping us to imagine what what a, what the human brain is, is that now we can look at, at, you know, examples of neural networks that are rendering images that look realistic. I mean, at that point, you'd be like, okay, wait a second. If a neural network, artificial neural network, is loosely based on the human mind and it's able to render graphics that look realistic, then obviously our minds that were the inspiration for neural networks can render computer graphics that are realistic. And that is in fact what my book is saying.
## 	9: The comparison of neural networks creating images to human mental imagery				
So what I'm getting to is that in just the same way that chemical messages like dopamine, like neurotransmitters inside vesicle sacs or exosomes, or the transmission of RNA or DNA signals, or I guess the spread of inflammatory particles or, you know, oxidants, or the, you know, the spread of junk, the spread of viruses, the spread of basically anything that is physically moving around in your body is going to, at some point, if it's, eventually it's going to collide with something, right? As long as it's able to match the scale of what's in the body so it can collide into something.
## 	10: The inevitability of sentient AI and its potential impact on humanity				
I mean, I guess the idea is the neutrinos, is that the one will just pass through you, pass through the Earth, and they don't collide with anything because they don't have any mass? Is that right? But... I forget how that story goes, but... So here's the thing. Is that we have this now? We have all the concepts from Donald Hebb. From Einstein. From Tesla. From all these great scientists. All these great physicists. All these great mathematicians. And we've got all this knowledge. And now we have the analogy that neural networks can render computer graphics, and they can be creative. And with DAL-E2 that we're seeing in the news today, you can type a few words, and the neural network will create that.
##	11: The concept of mind rendering and predicting future outcomes based on learned sequences				
Well, I can say a few words and the neural network will create that. Well, I can say a few words. I can say the words tomato, broccoli, and corn, and I actually see glimpses or pictures of tomato, of broccoli, and of corn. I see that in my mind when I say those words. And I can imagine the taste. I can imagine some version of the taste, actually. Because, you know, there's different ways to taste, to have the taste experience of. Because, you know, there's different ways to taste, to have the taste experience of broccoli or tomatoes or corn.
## 	12: The cognitive process of decision-making and behavior prediction in humans				
Okay? There's different ways to experience these, depending on how they're cooked. Maybe they're sauteed. Maybe they're raw. Maybe they're baked. Maybe they're boiled. Maybe they're sauteed and then put into soup. And so there's all these different ways to experience. There's different seasonings you can apply to broccoli and tomatoes and corn. You can have them together or apart. You can combine them with other dishes, other foods. You can put them in sauces. You can put them in drinks, in cold drinks. You can put them in sauces. You can put them in drinks, in cold drinks. You can put them in sandwiches. And as I say these words, my mind is rendering these images. I'm seeing these pictures in my head.
## 	13: The visualization of future scenarios and the pitfalls of corrupt behavior				
And now that we have this sort of reality of where computers have become this powerful where they can render graphics on request. You can just say the words and the computer can make a picture for you. That's DALL E2. Well if the computer can do that then why not your mind? Why not is your mind actually rendering graphics and then doing 3D semantic segmentation and rendering a concept of self and rendering a prediction of the future consequences such as what rewards you might get if you picked up the banana and ate it. Right? And so your mind is in steps rendering each frame of this predictive movie of what that banana is going to taste like if you pick it up and eat it and somehow these learned sequences or these learned representations of reality are leading to a situation where you are able to follow certain lines of behavior to success.
##	14: The consequences of corrupt behavior on a global scale, using Putin as an example				
You know, I will argue that in Putin's case, he's following lines of corrupt behavior to success. to success, right? And because he's able to keep following lines of corrupt behavior to success, he's, he's, he's, uh, uh, accumulated a lot of, um, I don't know, he, he, he's, he's, he's, he's actually, uh, at this point, we say he's accumulated a lot of failure at this point. Because ultimately that's where his reasoning has led him. He's lost the good relationship with Europe that he had before. He lost the good relationship with the United States that he had before. And his relationships with every other country on Earth, every country in the Middle east and in central asia and in uh africa that have been affected by his choices in a negative way he's he's he's uh he's dented those relations relationships and um that really hurts uh the future prospects for for vladimir putin for for russia that really hurts because now he's created some really negative emotional memories that are going to stick with people in the entire world for a very long time and uh so russia's russia's future relationships with every country have been damaged because of of who putin is because of uh the path of corruption that was so rewarding for him and in in in a very real way um the fact that people rewarded him for this corruption so many times, just out of indifference, out of selfishness, out of ignorance, out of all of those things, the fact that people kept rewarding Putin for his corruption over all these years has just led him astray.
## 	15: The analogy of cancer to fascist imperialism, using Putin as a metaphor				
So his brain is literally, you know, stuck playing the evil record, evil record player, the evil playbook, that he can't stop playing because that is what he's been wired to do in order to get rewards his his social contract with humanity is that he will do evil in return for rewards and that plays out in a movie-like way in his brain volumetrically where he has one volumetric movie playing back to himself after another where he's predicting a path just like pac-man his brain is predicting a path to rewards through corruption through evil and so it's it is and it's it is virus-like in behavior it's i mean sorry it's it's it's really more cancer-like in behavior and that cancer is like uh fascist imperialism cancer colonizes cancer has armies that that invade uh other uh new territories and they conquer territories and they colonize and they take over cells and they like in the way that that um putin replaces the head of the country with someone who will follow his leadership.
## 	16: The biological and psychological underpinnings of Putin's behavior				
That's what cancer does. Cancer will take over. They will marshal their forces like armies to invade new territories, and they'll take over territories, and they'll start controlling the environment so that the cells in that environment start serving the cancer. And that cancer turns the organism against itself. And it's like fascism on the biological scale. It is fascism on the biological scale. Cancer is a little army that turns you against yourself. And that's what Putin is doing. So he's very much a fractal of cancer. He doesn't, of course, realize it, because being a fractal of cancer means that the biology doesn't realize that it's harming itself. So the biology of the human being is harming itself, but essentially Putin doesn't realize it, because that is what makes his behavior his behavior, is the fact that he's not connecting the dots. He's not conscious, fully conscious, that he's a fractal of cancer. And if he accepted that, if he understood it, he would transcend that concept. Just by naming his behavior and understanding the analogy of cancer. But he's not transcending the concept.
##	17: The concept of human biology as a fractal and the role of oscillations				
So we're dealing with essentially a cancer, a biological cancer, a fractal of analogy to cancer. But he's not transcending the concept. So we're dealing with essentially a cancer, a biological cancer, a fractal of a biological cancer, playing out in terms of human personality, and this is possible, because essentially, human biology is a computer program, and it's like, your brain is the server for the matrix. Your brain is like the server for the matrix. So in the Matrix movie, you had to be plugged into a computer in order to be in the matrix. But your brain is already a computer, so you're already in the matrix in your brain, right? And then through oscillations, through the communication and signals that come out of our mouths and come out of our fingers, come out of our muscular pathways, we're communicating with the other organisms in the world around us. And through that, we're connected with the other organisms. And so our information is spreading everywhere because information is like spreading everywhere because information just is like the vibrational it's like this vibrate it's like this oscillating pattern that's sort of like that flies all over the place and and it knocks oscillations and eventually if you have a neural network it's going to begin to decode those oscillations.
## 	18: The neural network of the universe versus human-scale consciousness				
It's going to begin to sort of become aware of the universe. And, you know, I mean, I don't know. It's like, but specifically I'm not arguing for something like, what is it, the idea that the universe is conscious. No, the universe is like a neural network. And it's going to be sending information everywhere, and those oscillations are going to go everywhere. But it's not the same as saying that everything is conscious in the human sense, on the human scale. So human-scale consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of power band frequencies that are oscillating at certain rates and a certain, well, rate is referring to frequencies, right? But there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
## 	19: The concept of partial consciousness and its implications for awareness				
The best way I understand this concept that I'm trying to communicate is like, it's not that you're always conscious all the time. Sometimes you're unconscious of certain things. Sometimes you're asleep and you're not conscious of certain things. Sometimes you forget something. So you're not always conscious of everything all the time. Whatever you're conscious of is always just part of what's possible for you to be conscious of that consciousness at that moment in time it's never consciousness of everything all the time you see what I'm saying and so you you you have this sort of like situation where um you know um people are you now beginning to like all the ideas that we need to build sentient self-aware networks have arrived they're right in front of us we had we had uh we had we had physics we had math we had biology what was needed was sort of like an analogy and that analogy sort of came with computers with neural networks and with artificial intelligence and dolly and 3D semantic segmentation and now nerf so we have the analogies now to understand the human brain in terms of computation.
##	20: The inevitable emergence of sentient self-aware networks and the ethics of sharing knowledge				
But also, you know, we have the opportunity to... So this is here, and so the thing is, what could have happened is that someone would have realized this and begun to build a sentient and self-aware network in secret. And then they could have taken over the world, right? That's one way this could have happened. What I did was I said, okay, humanity is about to realize this. Anyways, the research has caught up. People are going to figure this out. So I'm going to go ahead and we we're openly publishing you know i'm seeing uh the latest python and the latest tensorflow being published and i'm seeing the artificial intelligence agency talking about the recent the new emergence of or the imminent emergence of sentient ai i'm seeing this talk and i realized that these people are right and so it and so this work is being given out freely and it is extremely extremely close to the ideas and conclusions that I've come to, and I realize it is inevitable that someone else is going to discover the exact same things that I've already, the exact same conclusions that I've already come to, based upon my experiences as a journalist, and going to all these trade shows, and seeing all this technology, and talking to all these people, and interviewing all these amazing scientists and doing my podcast and doing my research and reading about neuroscience every day and reading about artificial intelligence every day and teaching myself advanced mathematics.
## 	21: The promise of future technological advancements and their societal impact				
I I'm at the point where I'm confident that eventually humanity is going to catch up to my work, and they're going to be like, wow, this is amazing, you've got a new gravity theory, and it's real, and it's legit, and it works, and you've got self-aware networks, you've invented them, and now that's going to change the world. And so there will be a moment, and then at the same time, critics will be like, yeah, this was about to happen anyways. We were just this close anyways. And it's true. The world was this close anyways. And it's true. The world was this close anyways. But by sharing it with everyone, by giving it to mankind, I think that we can, one, help enlighten the people. If you understand yourself as a mathematical algorithm and you can understand your behaviors as a mathematical algorithm, and you can understand yourself as a computational entity, then that is liberating. And I want people to understand the possibilities of this technology.
## 	22: The contrast between the current barbaric times and the potential for a better future				
It is like the life that we're looking forward to in the future will make human life right now seem barbaric... It is a barbaric time. Literally. it is a barbaric time literally we're seeing people being butchered in Ukraine right now and it's a barbaric time in human civilization but the opportunity is to sort of leave that time behind we can leave the time of war behind and begin to like human human species can get a real handle on mental illness and sort of like computationally defeat uh corruption and evil and violent behavior and all that stuff that we hate. Computation, like it can be identified, it can be treated, it can be fixed.
##	23: The ethical considerations of creating and controlling sentient AI and its potential dangers				
Because we're robots. And we're able to make robots and we understand how to make robots. We are robots and we can make robots. And that's the other point, is that, you know, there's a lot of different things that can happen. At some point, someone may try to control other people's minds, to incite people. We understand how to manipulate lesser organisms like mice. Eventually you could build a computer that could, in a long enough timeline, you could eventually build a computer that could manipulate the decisions of a human being. There could be some sort of implant that can control or monitor that human being. That is a frightening thought. And so we need to sort of like have like a scientific imagination and we have there's unfortunately there's a huge amount of past scientific books of things that are possible when anything any kind of machine that is possible is possible to build and that is the reality the bizarre reality that we're entering into is that we need to defend against um these kinds of science fiction threats because they're no longer science fiction threats. They're reality.
## 	24: The potential for technological advances to create strange and dangerous new realities				
You can 3D print a person in the near future, and you could customize that person. You could customize their mind. You could create something very weird, something that just resembles a person or something that's just a copy of a person with another person hiding underneath that person. There's all sorts of, like, weird, frightening things, and so we're going to need, I think, you know, maybe some stories to sort of, like, instill a sort of program in the school system that sort of prepares people mentally to be on guard for existential threats like so we have like a defense program that it's not just a matter of having robots that are going to monitor human beings but also to train human beings themselves to uh be on the to have like behaviors that are uh resistant to um uh corruption by malicious uh sentience or by malicious agents uh with with using uh sentient technology so there's a lot of weird things that can happen.
## 	25: The possibility of creating liquid metal terminators and other advanced technologies				
Like, you saw the Terminator movie, right? Like, in the Terminator 2 movie, where the liquid metal Terminator, I'm having trouble deciding whether or not that's possible or not. But the liquid metal Terminator, I or not. But, um, the liquid metal terminator, I mean, I guess, right, it could be... That's a hard call. I don't know. I don't know if that's possible. Um... Yeah, see, it's like every bit of goo that makes up that terminator has to basically be um uh a computer ship right that has that is like a cell body in a sense like it has to be its own independent entity, that can function by itself.
##	26: The concept of self-assembling entities and their potential applications				
Like if you're going to have a liquid metal terminator, every component needs to be able to function by itself. And then it needs to be able to function as a swarm and have the information as a swarm to assume the oscillation of the larger entity, which is plausible. I mean, if you think of your cells as basically... I would say it sounds implausible, but if you think of your cells as basically independent entities, they don't have infinite ability to rebuild their own structure, their own relationships. But they do have the ability to move.
## 	27: The advanced capabilities of human cells and the potential for more complex entities				
Like, your neurons can move. They can move through the human body when they're, during neurogenesis. They can move from where they're created to where they're going to be positioned and their movement in terms of synaptic connections are changing constantly on an ongoing basis so neurons move T-cells through the body they move to the site of where an injury has happened. And they can grow little appendages like arms and legs, and they can swim, or they can push and pull themselves through tissue, or they can swim through the blood. There's different ways that the T cells can maneuver.
## 	28: The concept of the human body as a fractal and its implications for advanced technology				
And so you can imagine that if you had something that was more advanced than a human cell, that was able to sort of contain more instructions and more knowledge than a human cell. You know what I mean? Like it was able to like, if you were able to sort of like contain more instructions and more knowledge in the human cell you know what i mean like it was able to like if you're able to fit if you're able to somehow shrink human cognition i mean uh something like something is is as complex as human that's amazing that's an amazing idea but like yeah like the Terminator 2 I guess could exist the liquid T-1000 the liquid Terminator some form of it in any case where some independent cells that are really tiny could be like little you know, little men that self-assemble into a larger man.
##	29: The fractal nature of humans and cells and the possibility of self-assembling entities				
Because that is kind of like, the human being is a fractal, right? Where a T-cell is like, it's like a little man moving through your body when it wants to be from one destination to another. You know, a neuron is, I think of a neuron as more squid-like, but it's the same idea. It's like a fractal of a person. A cell is a fractal of you, or you are a fractal of a cell. You have appendages, right? And your hands are like dendrites right and and uh your arm is like um like the palm of your hand is like the soma and your fingers are like the dendrite the dendritic branches right and then your arm is like the long long arm is like the long exit terminal of the long axonal body that leads towards the exit terminal.
## 	30: The potential for future technological advancements to solve major global challenges				
Right? So if your fingers are the dendritic branches and your hand is the soma and your arm is the long axonal body. And then, I don't know, maybe the shoulder is the axon terminal or something. You know, you could, I'm not sure what, you know, maybe there's some people who spend more of their time studying anatomy who prefer to describe the human being as a fact they might have to draw different lines but the general idea is that maybe to draw different lines, right? But the general idea is that, you know, maybe... Maybe... Yeah. So, yeah, so it is, like, it's even stuff that, like, I'm... There's a difficulty, I think, that I don't... I'm not really... Like, everything that I can think of that seems like it's possible I think we're going to be able to build that includes machines that can clean up the atmosphere and clean up the ocean and solve climate change those things are possible and we can build houses for every human being and these things are possible and we can build um houses for every human being and and these are these things are possible and we can build spaceships with warp drive and this is good news for everybody.
## 	31: The abundance of resources and technology and the potential for space exploration				
It's like all the conflict and strife we don't need that anymore because we don't need that anymore because there's like the possibilities for abundance because of the progress in technology, including life extension. Mars and Venus and maybe Jupiter and Saturn and Neptune and maybe have many space stations and many times the number of space cameras.
##	32: The potential for AI and satellites to enhance space exploration				
I would like to send, you know, we can multiply the export of satellites that have high resolution cameras like the recent nasa camera that was released i'm forgetting the name at the moment but we can with ai we can increase the production of these satellites and ship many more out into space and then we can we can create like um like a neural radiance field of like we can nerf outer space with many satellites or plenoxels.
## 	33: The potential for AI to revolutionize space exploration and resource extraction				
We can do plenoxels or we can take a number of photographs, high-resolution photographs from all the satellites we're going to ship into space. We can finally – we have the resources now to begin to – we have the technology resources we have the technology to develop machines to extract the resources needed to build the kinds of machines that can sort of like mine the asteroid belt for materials and so we can really spread out into the solar system and begin to spread towards the rest of the galaxy with warp drive technologies.
## 	34: The potential for technological advancements to create a utopian future				
And so yeah, so we can think of our lives in terms of like 100, year lifetimes we can back up our minds and um so this is like you know we're we're living in a science fiction story like like a lot of people feel like we're living in a horror story like earth is a horror story and people are committing suicide because of that because they've seen too much horrible shit and they've experienced so much suffering but we can but and that there is so there's horror that's happening and it's bad but we can also think of the future as a science fiction future one in which enormous good uh will is the next step after all this pain that we've been through. Enormous good is the future step.
##	35: The importance of mental health and its impact on the future of humanity				
Right? And that's why we need massive medical healing. We have the ability now to be concerned. We have the ability and the duty to be concerned about every person's mental well-being. Because if any person is mentally unwell. If any person is suffering. They're potentially a risk to everyone else now that we have Synthetic and AI. So we kind of have a duty now to take care of every human being, to make sure that everyone is okay, to make sure that everyone is getting mental health care. And with the technology that exists, we have a way to move forward to that future. And the technology of tomorrow, the technology of sentient self-aware neural networks. So that's sort of like the promise.
## 	36: The potential for global systems to address inequality and ensure fair labor practices				
Yeah, we can have a medical justice system, a global medical justice system, a global labor union. We can set the prices of labor so that corporations can set the prices of labor so that corporations can no longer exploit the labor market so that the CEO makes trillions and the people beneath them make pennies. The government can control the price of labor. And so we can make it so that everyone is able to make a living wage. There's no reason that it has to be otherwise. Because the amount of resources and the amount of devices and the amount of technology is going to allow space for anyone to live the life they want to live. You know, whether that is, as long as it's not harming anyone else, there's enough space to move around so people can, they can have virtual experiences, they can have, they can exist in the matrix if they want, they can have any kind of reality that they want.
## 	37: The potential for virtual reality to allow people to live in their desired realities				
If someone wants to escape this reality and spend the rest of the next hundred thousand years in the multiverse with the X-Men where they have their own power, if you want to play as Iron Man for the next 100,000 years, you can with this technology. Because you can plug your brain into the matrix, essentially. Or we can upload your mental pattern that is you. We can upload it. We can back it up we can copy it we can duplicate you there could be more than one of you there could be a backup you that's sort of like kept offline that will just be updated regularly with your thoughts when you go to sleep or something, I don't know what the exact protocol would be maybe it's updated live with your thoughts in the moment but that version of you could with your thoughts in the moment. But that version of you could be turned on at the moment.
##	38: The ethical considerations of mind-uploading and the concept of multiple selves				
I mean, these are some ideas that are talked about in the Kiln book by David Brin. And some of the ideas are like, yeah, well, we can link our minds and those are talked about in the Nexus book and the Matrix ideas are talked about in William Gibson Nexus book. And the Matrix idea to talk about in William Gibson's book. So there's the Nexus trilogy and William Gibson's work and the Kiln by David Brin. And there's all these like, you know, there's sword art online. There's all these different science fiction stories. I mentioned Terminator, Short Circuit, all this stuff that sort of points us to what we should be on guard against and prepared for and considering.
## 	39: The influence of science fiction on preparing society for future technological challenges				
I really appreciate the Ridley Scott films, right? The Aliens, or Aliens for Alien, and also the Jim Cameron films, right? Those are good too. Aliens. There's Prometheus. There's Avatar. And I'm going back and forth between Ridley Scott and James Cameron but yeah I like Prometheus I like the whole the droids that Ridley Scott does and I like the the avatars speaking of which it's time for another Avatar movie and yeah speaking of which it's time for another avatar movie um and yeah so I mean I like the matrix the matrix 4 the matrix of resurrections I feel like I want to go like now that I've seen it and digested it I feel like it's time to go back and sort of like re-watch the original films of like re-watch the original films and then re-watch the fourth one again and sort of like digest it again because it's, because it's, it's, it is a lot to think about, right?
## 	40: The recurring themes in the Wachowskis' films and their connection to modern issues				
There's a lot to think about, right? And so, so most of it, I sort of like, Right, and so most of it I sort of like Most of it like sort of like pointed me like I started I started like I said I realized that you know some of the major themes of The films that came from the Wachowskis Wachowskis, the Wachowski sisters, some of the major themes kept recurring across their films. So by the fourth film, it's like, okay, wait a second, it's based in San Francisco, so San Francisco, they want us to imagine that San Francisco is the Matrix.
##	41: The symbolism in the Matrix 4 and its potential commentary on technology and society				
And they have this character who keeps reminding me of the CEO of Apple for some reason. I don't know why. Like Tim Cook, like the villain in the Matrix reminds me of Tim Cook. That's what my mind is doing, is putting together San Francisco and Apple as the villain in the fourth Matrix film. That's what I was thinking. That doesn't mean that everyone else was thinking that. That doesn't mean the creators of the film were making that. But that's what I was thinking. That doesn't mean that everyone else was thinking that. That doesn't mean the creators of the film were making that. But that's what I was thinking because I was reading about these stories of Iger slave labor. So what I saw the matrix for, that's when I really like, I thought it was a message telling us that Apple was the predator the apple was the villain that's how my mind interpreted that and so i just i was like wow and like it was like that sort of like i I realized that I really needed to start raising awareness around this.
## 	42: The shift in focus from virtual reality to broader issues of global importance				
And then the war in Ukraine happened. And since then, I've just sort of begun to understand, sort of like, to go from being very, like it was very much my intention to just be focused on virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Because in 2012 I gave myself the three goals I said I'm doing my life and this is because I read them I read I Read the I went through life principles integration Process class life principles and integration Wait, was that what it was called something was there was a class at Centerpoint, Centerpoint with an E, centerpoint.e.com by Bill Harris. He wrote this book called Thresholds in the Mind. And I took his online course, whatever it was called. It was a course from Centerpoint.
## 	43: The influence of self-awareness and internal representations on life outcomes				
And so he talked about internal representations. He talked about becoming conscious of your internal representations. He talked about the understanding that you're making a mental strategy, a mental sequence. You have mental imagery. And as you progress through that mental imagery, you are executing the path of your life. You're following a strategy that consists of different modalities, different going through, playing in a sequence, that results in an outcome that you keep getting over and over. Sometimes it's a negative outcome. Sometimes it's a positive outcome. And so if you pay attention to that sequence and you think about, okay, well, where is this sequence? What is this sequence of thoughts I'm having? What result is that going to lead to? What is the sequence of thoughts that I'm going to lead to? What am I focused on the most?
##	44: The consequences of mental strategies on behavior and outcomes, with reference to Putin				
And so you kind of know. You kind of know that if you think about how you're feeling and what internal representations you have, you kind of know through your inner sensory representations what the result of that strategy is going to be because you've played this strategy many times. Your brain has mapped out the consequences of this strategy. But if you're not conscious of that, then you're going to just repeat this bad strategy. And so here we are as we have Putin who is repeating these strategies that he's unconscious of and he's affecting the behavior of cancer which is what happens when biology doesn't know what it's doing when it's working against its own self and right now Putin is working against his own self because he is unconscious that his behavior patterns, or he's focusing on his own ruin.
## 	45: The potential influence of PTSD on Putin's behavior and decision-making				
Yeah. And part of it is probably that Putin has PTSD like me. I've been thinking about this for a while. I think Putin probably has PTSD like me. I've been thinking about this for a while. I think Putin probably has PTSD like me, where everyone around him probably seems like a threat. And he feels that he's fighting everyone on earth and everyone around him. He doesn't trust anybody. That's PTSD, though. That's PTSD though. That's what I have. And that's what I can, I think I can, I think, I can, I think it's, because here's the thing, it's like, I feel like, I feel like I've been studying Putin for long enough that I've met him telepathically.
## 46: The concept of telepathic perception and the understanding of another's mind				
Like I've met a representation of Putin telepathically. That my mind created. But one that is such an accurate representation. That is when I met Putin telepathically. Or met the representation my mind created of Putin. It surprised me. Because he's actually different. In person. in my imagination, then he was, then I imagined he was, before I met him inside my imagination. See what I'm saying? Like, I was imagining he was one guy, and then I met him telepathically, and I was surprised by who this guy was. It's like, whoa, this guy is a lot more like American conservatives than I guessed. He's a lot more like an American conservative than I guessed.
## 47: The relativity of perception and the complexity of understanding another person				
And what that means to me is totally different from what that means to you like to you you might be like no way like even if you've met him that's not who he is that's your perception of reality though for me I'm only saying like from relative to how I thought of him before to how I think I understand his mind now this guy is uh a lot more ordinary than I uh anticipated and it's really unfortunate that he that he's he's chosen his path because his path is hurting himself and he somehow is deluded into thinking that this is good for him.
## 	48: The destructive consequences of Putin's decisions on his relationships and reputation			
Maybe he thinks that he's smart and he's making actions that are good for himself. But I think it's obvious that he's making actions that are bad for himself. All of his relationships worldwide with every person on Earth are challenged now because of the shit he's doing. He's been downgraded by everybody. There is nobody on Earth who doesn't think less of Vladimir Putin. There's nobody. Even the person who likes Putin the most thinks less of him. Because of how stupid this whole war is. Like, even the people on Putin's side think this war is really stupid. Because look at how much it costs Russia. Every Russian thinks Putin's war is fucking stupid. At least on the unconscious level. They feel that it was stupid. Even if they're not admitting it yet, they feel that it was stupid because the outcome is bad. And they're like, God damn it, this guy Putin is an idiot, and it's going to sink in, especially when these sanctions sink in.
## 	49: The strategic considerations of using nuclear weapons and the risks of global conflict				
Right? Because what is Putin going to do if he uses nukes? That's a suicide button. And I think he wants to live. I think he wants to live. He understands that if he uses nukes, that is a full-on confrontation with NATO. So, anyway, that is a full-on confrontation with NATO. So, anyway, that's where I think he needs to conserve his missiles. He needs to conserve his bullets so that he can defend himself from an invasion that some other country might. Some other country might invade Russia because that other country might understand that he can't use nukes without a full-on confrontation with NATO. That world-ending confrontation. So that means other countries can attack him.
