00:01

I should I should go back and revisit the operation where I was attempting to communicate with category theory that there's no difference between the group behavior of many CEOs in a country (or in the world) and the individual behavior of one CEO with regard to what's happening in one sector of the economy.

00:27

Functionally speaking it's like saying that the President of the country is guilty for whatever the government officers carry out on the orders of the head of the country. So in that sense, the people who are actually CEOs are guilty of the crimes that the workers are doing at the lowest possible level.

01:01

So with category theory, it can be shown that if you have two composable functions as long as the start in the start result, in the end result are the same. There can be any number of differences in the inbetween steps. You could have an inbetween step that is just one interval of functional transformation or it could be a hundred intervals of functional transformation.

01:32

As long as the first step in the last step are the same, the two functions are composable. And that means that the composibility of those two functions means that you can relate, You can assign legal guilt to specific people in a vast, complicated system if (the result is that Apple is profiting from the genocide of the Uyghur people at the end of the day) but anyway.

01:58

So that's a point of that. But in a system like every component of this system has this sort of shared complicity. So that means that if every person was like a hologram that contains the whole pattern of the whole system, then every person is in some sense contributing via consent to the situation that exists in the world.

02:21

And that is that a sort of like in order for the world to change, you have to have at least one person actually wake up to what's happening and make that change in their mind and then that pattern will ripple across the entire world.

So what it requires is actually just one person, having an aha moment and then transmitting that message to everyone else and it will spread because of oscillatory dynamics to everyone else.

02:50

So literally, you can fix the world in your mind. You can look for what's wrong. You can look for who's suffering. You can care about them and you can fix the world because the patterns that will begin to emerge from, you will literally be treatment transmitted across the entire world through the principles of oscillation.

03:11

And in effectively, you can begin to know, you can be able to understand the minds of people across the world. Like you can begin. It's almost like, I guess it's, it's like a computational telepathy in a sense.

And that if you can receive signals from people on the other side of the planet and you will because of the principles of oscillation eventually, you can begin to understand people that you've never met.

03:42

VR provides us with a way of thinking about what your mind needs to be doing in terms of rendering what your perspective is at any given point.

NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields gives us an idea of how a neural network might piece together a 3D scene from individual slices (photos).

04:15

It's a kind of Tomography, right? Like the Fourier Slice Transform is a kind of Tomography. Diffision Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, Holography, and Tractography.

These, all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and videogrammetry, light fields, and point clouds, these concepts all evoke something that causes you to think about reality as a point field, point cloud, or light field, and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you are asking like what points belong to what object, and classifying those points or that classifying that object you are getting into 3D Semantics Segmentation.

05:27

And so now, you're imagining not only how neural network could render a 3D volume of space, but also your beginning to understand how a neural network could parse, process, and distinguish distinct objects in that 3d space and what the amount of computational power happening inside the human brain.

06:00

There's just nothing just nothing like it that computers can create today in terms of like the number of synaptic transmissions, right? It's vast because you have trains of synapses and their phases are changing very fast, and their connections are changing very fast, and so (the brain) is a dynamic (massively parallel) computational system.

06:36

That vastly exceeds the current state of (human level) manufacturing capabilities. okay?

It doesn't mean we can't produce consciousness in todays computers. Computers have different properties. We can with design engineering create intelligent systems that can produce very precise behaviors and very precise (artificial internal experiences.)

07:14

We can we can control the grade of the inner experience (that a conscious computer program is having) and we can monitor the the development of the inner experience.

We can analyze, what makes up a person's mind, and what makes up an artificial person's mind. Like the data can be broken down and categorized and we can understand the contributions of different factors almost like different information criteria that has been learned.

07:44

We can understand what kind of what kind of oscillation is going to produce (the degree of artificial consciousness that we want).

We can start to make some high level predictions as to what types of behaviors are normal for someone and what types of behaviors are not what we want.

People are already monitored by the government, by the oscillations in their behaviors. They're sort of like, yeah. Well, what you did in the past, there's certain amount of chance you're gonna repeat it again and people with your symptoms, and your attitudes, and your behaviors, like you are going to, you're at risk of repeating these types of behaviors because precisely because other people with your information configuration, your mental information configuration, are likely to do those types of behaviors.

That's sort of like symptomatic of your group, your mental group, the people from your school of thought. Certain behaviors are likely to emerge and it's not like the sort of like, you know, the way that has been done in the past is not working for society as a whole.

The state of neurology right now is in pretty bad shape because there's an overwhelming amount of mental illness happening in the world.

And so I think that we can, you know, we can consider how like when you have like when you eat you in vitamin A becomes a when it becomes converted into a chemical gradient. And I don't know if it was like

# (in biology chemical gradients could consist of a chemical such as retinoic acid, the signals from which might cause cells to grow, or perform some other function, until the gradient runs out.)

it turns into some sort of like chemical gradient that then as that chemical gradient dissipates, it's going to cause effects on the surrounding biology.

10:09

These effects can be like stretching a membrane or shrinking membrane, that chemical gradient, as it leaks out it's applying a chemical effect (for some duration to some area in the body)and those signals that are coming from the chemical gradient are causing more morphological or functional cellular changes in the structure of the biology.

10:38

As a result of signals dissipating from that chemical sack or chemical gradient.

It is not the situation that only neurotransmitters are causing changes in cell behaviors.

11:00

And it's not just, you know, strands of RNA or DNA that are being sent this messengers between cells.

But also there's chemical gradients, there are sacks of chemicals that accumulated because you took vitamins, or you consumed vitamins with your food, and those are causing changes in your system in your biology.

11:26

So some of the key concepts involved here is that one is if you look at bringing sentient self-aware networks to the world. Is that one if you look at the current state of science, this was already inevitability, science was already approaching this point.

11:46

In fact, the concepts needed to build sentient and self-aware, where neural networks have existed basically since Donald Hebb wrote The Organization of Behavior. Like at that point between Einstein & Donald Hebb. And I don't know a lot of other mathematicians, physicists, and biologists, we had enough information back then to have figured out how to build sentient and self aware neural networks.

12:21

And in my opinion humanity went down a lot of wrong paths in terms of possible research directions. But we had enough of the essential concepts back then. We just didn't go far enough like we could have had sentience self aware neural networks figured out in Einstein's day.

Now what has changed the equation is that we have in terms of like helping us to imagine what a with the human brain is, is that now we can look examples of neural networks that are rendering images, that look realistic.

13:05

I mean at that point you like okay, wait a second, if an artificial neural network is loosely based on human mind and it's able to render graphics that look realistic. Then obviously our minds, that were the inspiration for neural networks, can render computer graphics that are realistic, and that is in fact what my book is saying.

13:29

So what I'm getting to is in just the same way that the chemical messages like dopamine, neurotransmitters inside vesicle sacks or exosomes or the transmission of RNA or DNA signals, or you know, I guess the spread of inflammatory particles, or oxidants, or the spread of junk, the spread of viruses, the spread of basically anything that is physically moving around in your body is eventually going to collide with something at some point. As long as it's able to match the scale of what's in the body so it can collide into something. I mean, I guess that idea is a neutrinos, is that the one that just passes through you? They pass through the earth and they don't collide with anything because they don't have any mass is that right? I forget how that story goes.

So here's the thing: we have all the concepts from Donald Hebb, from Einstein, from Tesla, from in all these great scientists, all these great physicists, all these great mathematicians and we've got all this knowledge.

And now we have the analogy that known networks can render computer graphics and they can be created and you know with Dall-E 2 that we're seeing in the in the news today you can type a few words and the neural network will create (an image from your words). Well I can say a few words (to myself) I can say the words, tomato, broccoli, and corn.

15:48

And I actually see glimpses or pictures of tomato, of broccoli, and a corn. I see that in my mind, when I say those words, and I can imagine the taste. I can imagine some version of the taste actually, because there's different ways to taste, to have the taste experience of broccoli or tomatoes or corn, okay?

16:10

There's different ways to experience these depending on how they're cooked. Maybe they're sauteed, maybe they're raw. Maybe, maybe they're baked. Maybe their boiled. Maybe they are sauteed and then put in the soup? There's (many) different ways to experience (these plants) You can apply seasoning to broccoli and tomatoes and corn, you can have them together, or apart.

16:36

You can combine them with other dishes, other foods, you can put them in sauces, you can you put them in drinks and cold drinks? You can you put them in sandwiches? And as I say these words, my mind is, is rendering these images. I've seen these pictures in my head and now that we have this sort of like reality of where computers have become this powerful where they can rent a graphics on request, you can just say the words in the computer can make a picture for you.

17:11

That's Dall-E 2. Well, if the computer can do that then why not your mind? Why not is your mind actually a rendering graphics and then doing 3D semantic segmentation and rendering 3D content to the self and rendering our prediction of the future consequences, such as what rewards you might get, if you picked up the banana and ate it, right?

17:40

And so your mind is in steps rendering each frame of this predictive movie of what that banana is going to taste like if you pick it up and eat it.

Somehow these learned sequences or these learned representations of reality are leading to situation where you are able to follow certain lines of behavior to success.

18:11

You know, I will argue that in Putin's case, he's following lines of corrupt behavior to success, right? And because he's able to keep following lines of corrupt behavior to success. He's accumulated, a lot of

18:34

I don't know. He's at this point accumulated a lot of failure at this point, because ultimately that's where his reasoning has led him. He's lost the good relationship with Europe that he had before he lost a good relationship with the United States that had before, and his relationships with every other country on earth, every country in the Middle East, and in central Asia, and in Africa, that have been affected by his choices in a negative way he's dented those relationships and that really hurts the future prospects for Vladimir Putin, for for Russia.

That really hurts because now he's created some really negative emotional memories that are gonna stick with people in the entire world for a very long time. 

Russia's future relationships with every country have been damaged because of who Putin is because of the path of corruption that was so rewarding for him, and in a very real way the fact that people rewarded him for this corruption so many times, just out of indifference, out of selfishness, out of ignorance, of all of those things, the fact that people kept rewarding Putin for his corruption, over all these years has just led him astray.

So his brain is literally, you know, stuck playing the evil record, evil record player, the evil playbook, that he can't stop playing because that is what he's been wired to do in order to get rewards.

His social contract with humanity is that he will do evil in return for rewards, and that plays out in a movie like way in his brain volumetrically.

Where he has one volumetric movie playing back to himself after another where he's predicting a path, just like Pacman, his brain is predicting a path, to rewards through corruption (through evil). It is virus like in behavior. I mean it's really more cancer like in behavior.

Cancer is like fascist imperialism. Cancer colonizes, cancer has armies that invade other new territories, and they conquer territories, and they colonize, and they take over cells.

In the way that that Putin replaces the head of the country with with someone who will follow his leadership. That's what cancer does. Cancer will take over.

They will marshal their forces like armies to invade new territories and they'll take over territories and they'll start controlling the environment so that the cells in that environment start serving the cancer. The cancer turns the organism against itself, and it's like fascism on the biological scale, it is fascism on the biological scale, cancers a little army and that turned turns you against yourself, and that's Putin is doing.

22:21

So he is very much a fractal of cancer. He doesn't of course, realize it because being a fractal of cancer means that the biology doesn't realize that it's harming itself. So the biology of the human being is harming itself but essentially, Putin doesn't realize it, because that is what makes his behavior the fact that he's not connecting the dots.

He's not conscious, fully conscious, that he's a fractal of cancer. If he accepted that, if he understood it, he would transcend that concept, just like naming his behavior and understanding the analogy to cancer, but he's not transcending the concept.

23:04

So we're dealing with essentially a cancer, a biological cancer, a fractal of a biological cancer playing out in terms of human personality. And this is possible because essentially, the human biology is a computer program. And it's like your brain is the server for the matrix. Your brain is like the server for the matrix.

23:26

So in the matrix movie, you had to be plugged into a computer and in order to be in the matrix but your brain is already a computer. So you're already in the matrix in your brain, right?

Then through oscillations, through the communication and signals that come out of our mouths and come out of our fingers, you know, come out of our muscular pathways, we're communicating with the other organisms and the world around us and through that we're connected with the other organisms and so our information is spreading everywhere, because information just is like the vibrational or like this oscillating pattern that sort of like that flies all over the place & knocks oscillations, and eventually if you have a neural network it's going to begin to decode those oscillations. It's going to be into sort of like become aware of the universe.

24:32

Specifically I am not arguing for the idea that the universe is conscious? No.

No the universe is like a neural network, it's going to be sending information everywhere, and those oscillations are going to go everywhere, but that's not the same thing that everything is conscious in the human sense on the human scale.

24:54

So humans scale, consciousness, is definitely like a very specific pattern of power band frequencies that are oscillating at certain rates and rates is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range, that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the oscillating entity that is the brain, and the person, and the other people.

25:38

Okay? But the best way to understand the concept that I'm trying to communicate is like, it's not that you're always conscious all the time. Sometimes you're unconscious of certain things, sometimes you're asleep, and you're not conscious of certain things.

25:54

Sometimes you forget something, so you're not always conscious of everything all the time, you're whatever you're conscious of is always just part of what's possible for you to be conscious of that conscious of at that moment in time. It's never consciousness of everything all the time. You see what I'm saying.

26:10

The situation is that all of the ideas that we need to build sentient self aware neural networks have arrived. Their right in front of us. We had physics, we had math, we had biology.

26:43

What was need was like an analogy and that analogy came with computers, with neural networks, and with artificial intelligence and Dall E, and 3d semantic segmentation, and now NeRF. So, we have the analogies now to understand the human brain in terms of terms of computation, but also we have the opportunity to.

27:12

What could have happened is that someone would have realized this, and begun to build a sentient and self-aware neural networking in secret. Then they could have taken over the world, right? That's one way this could have happened.

27:32

What I did was I said, okay, humanity is about to realize this. Anyways, the research is caught up, people are gonna figure this out. So I'm gonna go ahead and were openly publishing, you know, I'm seeing the latest python and the latest tensor flow being published.

27:49

And I'm seeing the artificial intelligence agency talking about the recent the imminent emergence of sentient AI. I'm seeing this talk and I realized that these people are right and so it and so their work is being given off freely, and it is extremely close to the ideas and conclusions that I've come to, and I realize it is inevitable that someone else is gonna discover the exact same conclusions that I've already come to based upon my experiences as a journalist and going to all these trade shows and seeing all this technology and talking to all these people and interviewing all these amazing scientists and doing my podcast (the Neural Lace Podcast), and doing my research and reading about neuro science every day, and reading about artificial intelligence every day, teaching myself advanced mathematics.

28:39

I'm at the point where I'm confident that eventually humanity is going to catch up to my work, and they're gonna be like, wow, this is like amazing. You've got a new gravity theory and it's real. You've got self aware networks, you invented them, and that's going to change the world.

29:09

S there will be a moment, and at the same time critics will be like yeah this was about to happen anyways. We were just this close anyways, and it's true. The world was this close anyways, but by sharing it with everyone by giving the knowledge to mankind, I think that we can 1. help enlighten the people. If you understand yourself as a mathematical algorithm and you want to understand your behaviors them as a mathematical algorithm, and can understand yourself as a computational entity, then that that is liberating.

29:48

And I want people to understand the possibilities of this technology. It is like the life that we are looking forward to in the future will make human life right now seem like a barbaric...uh, it is a barbaric time literally, we're seeing people being butchered in Ukraine right now, and it's a barbaric time in humans civilization.

30:14

But the opportunity is to sort of like leave that time behind, we can leave the time of war behind, and begin to like human the human species can get, a real handle on mental illness and sort of like computationally defeat corruption, and evil and violent behavior, and all that stuff that we hate computationally.

30:45

(With sentient self aware computer systems) it can be identified, it can be treated, it can be fixed, because we're robots, and we're able to make robots, and we understand how to make robots. We are robots and we can make robots and that's other point. 

31:06

There's a lot of different things that can happen, right? At some point someone may try to to to control other people's minds to enslave people.

We understand how to manipulate lessor organisms like mice. Eventually, you could build a computer that could that in a long enough timeline you could build a computer that could that could manipulate the decisions of a human being, there could be some sort of implant that can control or monitor that human being. That is a frightening thought.

31:43

We need to sort of like have like a scientific imagination. Fortunately there's a huge amount of past scientific books of things that are possible when any kind of machine that is possible, is now possible to build, and that is our reality that we're entering into. It's that we need to defend against these kinds of science fiction threats because their no longer science fiction threats they're reality.

32:08

You can 3d print person, in the near future, and you can customize that person. You could customize their mind, you could, you could create something very weird, you know, something that just resembles a person or something that's just a copy of a person with another person hiding underneath that person.

32:27

There's all sorts of weird frightening things and so we're going to need, I think, you know, maybe some some stories to sort of like instill a sort of program in the school system. That's sort of prepared people mentally to be on guard for existential threats, so we have like a defense program, it's not just a matter of having robots that are going to monitor human beings.

33:01

But also to train human beings themselves to behaviors that are resistant to corruption by malicious sentience, or by malicious agents, with using sentient technology. So, there's a lot of weird things that could happen. You saw the terminator movie, right?

33:27

Like the Terminator 2 movie, remember the liquid metal terminator?

I'm having trouble deciding whether or not that's possible or not, but the liquid metal terminator. I mean, I guess right? Is, it could be that's a hard call. I don't know. I don't know if that's possible.

34:00

Yeah it's like every bit of goo that makes up that terminator has to basically be a computer ship, right. That is a cell body in a sense like it has to be its own independent entity that can function by itself.

34:24

Like, if have a liquid metal terminator, like every component needs to be able to function by itself, and then it needs to be able to function as a swarm, and have the information as a swarm to assume the oscillation of larger entity, which is plausible.

34:52

I mean, if you think of your cells as basically, I would say. It sounds implausble, but if you think of yourselves as basically independent entities, they don't have an infinite ability to rebuild their own structure or their own relationships, but they do the ability to move like your neurons can move.

35:14

They can move through the human body during neurogenesis. They can move from where they're created to where they're going to be positioned.

There's movement in terms of like synaptic connections are changing constantly, on an ongoing basis, and so neurons move and, you know, T cells move through the body. They they go, they move to the site of where injuries happened and they can grow like little appendages like arms and legs and sort of like hold, they can swim or they can push and pull themselves through the tissue or they can swim through the blood. There are different ways that a T-Cell can maneuver.

*Besides the fact that neurons move, migrating during neurogenesis, what is interesting to research is how signals from different cells integrate to guide the neuron or the t-cell its destination, read:*

# *"Oligodendrocyte precursors guide interneuron migration by unidirectional contact repulsion"*
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn6204

36:02

You can imagine that if you had something that was more advanced than a human cell that was able to sort of like contain more instructions and more knowledge than a human cell.

36:27

If you're able to somehow shrink human cognition. Isn't that an amazing idea? But like yeah Terminator 2, I guess, could exist, the Liquid Metal T-1,000 Terminator from the movie could exist in theory, at least some variation of it.

36:54

Some form of it, where some independent cells that are really tiny, could be like little men that self-assemble into a larger man, because that is kind of like the human being is a fractal. Right? Where like a T cell is like a little man moving through your body. When it wants to be.

37:22

From one destination to another. I think of a neuron as more squid like, but it's the same idea, it's like a fractal of a person, a cell is a fractal of you or you are a fractal of a cell.

37:42

You've appended right? And your hands are like dendrites, right? The palm of your hand is like a soma and your fingers are like the dendritic branches, then the long arm is like the long axonal body that leads towards exit terminal.

38:15

So if your fingers are the dendritic branches, and your hand is the soma, and your arm is the long axonal body and maybe the shoulder is the exit terminal.

Or something. Maybe there's some people who spend more of time studying fractals in the anatomy who would prefer to (if you described the human being as a fractal) draw different lines of description to make different points.

39:01

(deleted section)

39:12

Everything that I can think of that seems like it's possible. I think we're gonna be able to build like that includes machines that can clean up the atmosphere and clean it to ocean and solve climate change.

39:39

Those things are possible and we can build houses for every human being, and these are, these things are possible and we can build spaceships with warp drive. And this is good news for everybody. It's like all the conflicts and strife, we don't need that anymore, because we don't need that anymore.

39:59

Because the possibilities for abundance, because of the progress and technology (including life extension: people can can realistically think about colonizing Mars and Venus and maybe Jupiter and Saturn and Neptune and maybe have many space stations and many times the number of space cameras.

40:33

I would like to send: We can we can multiply the export of satellites that have high resolution cameras like the recent images released from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. With Self Aware Neural Networks we can increase the production of these satellites and ship many more out into space and then we can we can create something like a NeRF Neural Radiance Field. We can NeRF outer space.

41:01

With many satellites. Or we can do Plexnoxels. We can take a number of high resolution photographs, from all the satellites we are going to ship into space. 

We have the technology resources now to begin develop machines to extract the resources needed to build the kinds of machines that can sort of like mine the asteroid belt for materials.

41:40

So we can really spread out to the solar system and begin to spread towards the rest of galaxy with warp drive technologies. 

We can think of our lives in terms of like hundred thousand year lifetimes. We can back up our minds. 

42:11

We're living in a science fiction story. A lot of people feel like we're living in a horror story. Like earth is a horror story and the people are committing suicide because of that because they've just seen too much horrible shit, and they have experienced so much suffering.

42:29

So there is horror that's happening and it's bad. But we can also think of the future as a science fiction.

One in which enormous good is the next step after all this pain that we've been through. Enormous good is the future step, right? That's why we need massive medical healing, we have the ability and the duty to be concerned about every person's mental well, being because if any person is mentally unwell, if any person is suffering their potentially a risk to everyone else now that now that we (all) have Sentient AI, so we have kind of have a duty now, to take care of every human being, to make sure that everyone is okay, to make sure that everyone is getting mental health care.

43:21

And with the technology that exists, we have a way to move forward to that future, and the technology of tomorrow, the technology of sentient Self Aware Neural Networks. So that's the promised land. We can have a medical justice system, a global medical justice system, a global labor union.

43:41

We can set the prices of labor so that corporations can no longer exploit the labor market, so that the CEO makes trillions, and the people beneath them make pennies, like we can, the government can control the price of labor, and so we can make it so that everyone is able to make a living wage.

44:07

There's no reason that it has to be otherwise because the amount of resources, the amount of devices, and the amount of technology going out, it's going to allow 
space for anyone to live the life they want to live.

You know, whether that is that, as long as it's not, as long as it's not harming anyone else, there's enough space to move around, so people can, they can have virtual experiences, they can have, they can exist in the matrix if they want.

44:40

They can have any kind of reality that they want. If someone wants to escape this reality and spend the rest of the next hundred thousand years and in the multiverse with the X-Men, where they have their own power, if you want to play as Iron Man for the next hundred thousand years you can.

45:08

With this technology, you can, because you can plug your brain into the matrix essentially. Or we can upload your mental pattern that is you. We can upload it, we can back it up. We can copy it. We could duplicate you. There could be more than one of you.

45:30

There could be a backup. You that's sort of like kept offline. That will just be updated regularly with your thoughts when you go to sleep or something. I don't know with the exactly protocol would be, maybe it's updated live with your thoughts in the moment, but that version of you could be turned on at the moment.

45:49

It just means these are some ideas that are talked about in The Kiln book by David Brin, right? And some of the ideas are like, yeah, well we can link our minds and those are talked about in in the Nexus book (trilogy) Ramez Naam and the matrix idea is written about in William Gibson's book.

46:09

So there's the Nexus trilogy and William Gibson's work, and the Kiln by David Brin, there's Sword Art Online. It's all these are like science fiction stories. I mentioned Terminator, Short Circuit, all this stuff that sort of like pointed us to what we should be on guard against and prepared for.

46:36

And considering, you know, I really like appreciate though, the, the Ridley Scott films, right? That Alien, Prometheus, Blade Runner, and also the James Cameron films, Aliens, Terminator 2, Avatar. I'm going back and forth between Ridley Scott and James Cameron. I liked the droids that Ridley Scott writes about. Raised by Wolves. and I like the Avatar technology, and the struggle to defend the blue alien's homeworld from the mining company in James Cameron's avatar.

On the Matrix 4: The Matrix Ressurections.

I feel like, I want to go, like now that I've seen it, and digested it, I feel like it's time to go back and sort of like rewatch. The original films, and then rewatch the fourth one again, and sort of like digest it again because it's because it is a lot to think about, right.

47:58

There's a lot to think about.

48:08

Some of the major themes of the the films that came from the Wachowski sisters, some of the major themes kept reoccurring across their films.

So by the fourth film, it's like okay, wait a second, it's based in San Francisco, so San Francisco...

48:38

They want us to imagine in the San Francisco is the Matrix and they have this character who's who like keeps reminding me of the CEO of Apple, for some reason I don't know why. I just like, Tim Cook, like the main the villain, the Analyst in the matrix reminds me of Tim Cook.

48:54

That is what my mind is doing is putting together San Francisco, and Tim Cook the CEO of Apple as the villain in the 4th Matrix film.

That's what I was thinking. It doesn't mean that everyone else was thinking that. This doesn't mean the creators of the film were making that. But that's what I was thinking because I was reading about these stories of Uyghur slave labor.

49:14

So when I saw the Matrix 4, that's when I really like, I thought it was a message telling us that Apple was the predator. The Apple was the villian.

That's how my mind interpreted that and I was like, wow!

At that point I realized that I really needed to start raising awareness around this, and then the war Ukraine happened

50:01

And since then like I just sort of like began to expand from the situation being where it was very much my attention but just be focused on virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience because in 2012, I gave myself three goals.

50:28

I said I am dedicating my life, because I read them. I took the class called the Life Principles Integration Process at Centerpointe by Bill Harris.

50:51

Bill Harris wrote this book called Thresholds in the Mind, and I took his online course, the Life Principles Integration Process.

Where he talked about internal representations & strategies, he talked about becoming conscious of your internal representations. He talked about the understanding that you're making a mental strategy out of sequences of internal representations.

51:16

A mental sequence, you have mental imagery, and as you progress through that mental imagery, you are executing the path of your life.

You are following us a strategy that consists of different modalities, different feelings, different thoughts, different sensations, different smells, and there's a sequence of these (volumentic virtual inner representations) that your mind is going through, played out in a sequence, that results in an outcome that you keep getting over and over.

51:51

Sometimes it's a negative outcome. Sometimes it's a positive outcome, and so if you pay attention to that sequence and you think about, okay, well, where is this sequence? What is this sequence of thoughts that I'm having? What result is that going to lead to?

52:10

What is the sequence of thought that I'm having right now going to lead to? What's the goal, what am I focused on the most? 

So you kind of know from the beginning of that sequence what the of that sequence is likely to be.

You kinda know what outcome you are focused on by how your feeling and what internal representations you have, you kind of know, through your inner sensory representations, what the result of that strategy is going to be because you've played the strategy many times, your brain has mapped out the consequences of the strategy, but if you're not conscious of that then you're gonna just repeat a bad strategy.

52:44

And so here we are is we have Putin who is repeating these bad strategies that he's unconscious of and he's effecting behavior that is analogous to cancer.

Which is what happens when biology doesn't know what it's doing when it's working against its own self. Right now Putin is working against his own self because he is unconscious that his behavior patterns are self destructive, he's focusing on a strategy that leads to his own ruin.

53:15
Yeah, and part of it is, it's probably that Putin has PTSD like me. I've been I've been thinking about this for a while. I think Putin probably has PTSD like me, where everyone around him probably seems like a threat, and he feels he's fighting everyone on earth, and everyone around him.

53:38

He doesn't trust anybody, that's PTSD though. That's what I have. And that's what I can. I think I can.

I feel like feel like I've been studying Putin for long enough that I have met him telepathically. Like I've met a representation help of Putin telepathically that my mind created, but one that is, is such an accurate representation that when I met Putin telepathically or met the representation, my mind created of Putin.

54:19

It surprised me, because he's actually different in person in my imagination, then he was, that I imagine he was, before I met him inside my imagination. Like I was imaging he was one guy and then I met him telepathically and I was surprised by who this guy was.

54:41

It's like whoa this guy is he's a lot more like American conservatives. Then I guessed. He's a lot more like an American conservative than I guessed. What that means to me, is totally different from what that means to you.

55:06

You might disagree, you might say no way. Even if you have met him and can say that is not what he seems like to you. Okay, that's your perception of reality though. I'm only saying this from like a relative contrast from how I thought of him before to how I understood him after meeting his mind telepathically in my imagination. There was this huge difference.

I think this is interesting because what is most likely is that my mind created both representations, of this person I've never met, and the second representation was so much more detailed than the first that I wonder if two different parts of my brain were each working on a representation of this person.

55:26

My more updated perception is that this guy is a lot more ordinary than I anticipated and it's really unfortunate that he that he's chosen his path, because his path is hurting himself (in addition to everyone else) and he somehow like is deluded into thinking that this is good for him. Maybe he thinks that he's smart and he's making actions that are good for himself but it's I think it's obvious.

55:59

He's making actions that are bad for himself. Like all of his relationships worldwide with every person on earth are challenged now because of the shit he's doing, like he's been he's been downgraded by everybody, there is nobody on earth. Who doesn't think less of Vladimir Putin. There's nobody. Even like the person who like likes Putin the most thinks less of him because of because of how stupid this whole war is. Even the people on Putin's side think this war is really stupid.

56:35

Because look at how much it has cost Russia. Every Russian thinks Putin's war is fucking stupid, at least on the unconscious level. They feel that it was stupid, even if they're not admitting it yet, they feel that it was stupid because the outcome is bad, then like God damn it this guy Putin is an idiot and it's gonna sink in. Especially when these sanctions sink in.

What is Putin going to do if he uses nukes? That's a suicide button. I think he wants to live, I think he wants to live. He understands that if he is nukes that will trigger a full on confrontation with NATO.

57:23

I think he needs to conserve his missiles. He needs to conserve his bullets so that he can defend himself from invasion that some other country. Some other country might invade Russia because that other country might understand that he can't use nukes without a full-on confrontation with NATO.

57:47

That world ending confrontation. So that means other countries can attack him.
