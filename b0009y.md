00:01

I should I should go back and revisit the operation where I was attempting to communicate with category theory that there's no difference between the, the the group behavior of many, of many CEOs, and in a country and the individual behavior of a CEO with regard, to what's happening in one sector of the economy.

00:27

Functionally speaking. It's like saying that the president of the country is guilty for what the, for whatever the government officers, carry out on the orders of the head of the country. So in that sense, the people who are actually CEOs are guilty of the the crimes that the workers are doing at the lowest possible level.

01:01

So with category theory, it can be shown that. If you, if you have two composable functions as long as the start in the start result, in the end result are the same. They can be any number of differences in the in between step. You could have an in between step that is just one interval of functional transformation or it could be a hundred inch folds of folks on transformation.

01:32

As long as the first step in the last step are the same, the two functions are composable. And that means that the composibility of those two functions means that you can relate, You can assign legal guilt to to specific people in a vast, complicate complicated system if by anyway.

01:58

So that's a point of that. But in a system like every component of this system has this sort of shared composite. So that means that every part, if every person is like a hologram that contains the whole pattern of the whole system, then every person is in some sense contributing via consent to the situation that exists in the world.

02:21

And that is that a sort of like in order for the world to change, you have to have at least one person actually wake up to what's happening and make that change in their mind and then that pattern will ripple across the entire world. So what it requires is actually just one person, having an aha moment and then transmitting that message to everyone else and it will spread because of oscillatory dynamics to everyone else.

02:50

So literally, you can fix the world in your mind. You can look for what's wrong. You can look for who's suffering. You can care about them and you can fix the world because the patterns that will begin to emerge from, you will literally be treatment transmitted across the entire world Through the principles of oscillation.

03:11

And in effectively, you can begin to know, you can be able to understand the minds of people across the world. Like you can begin. It's almost like, I guess it's, it's like a computational telepathy in a sense. And that if you can receive signals from people on the other side of the planet and you will because of the principles of oscillation eventually, you can become to understand people that you've never met.

03:42

VR provides us with a way of thinking about what you are mind needs to be doing in terms of rendering what your perspective is at any given point nerve, the the neural radiance fields gives us an idea of how a neural network my piece together. A 3D scene from individual slices.

04:15

It's it's it's a kind of tomography, right? Like the four-year slice transform is is is a kind of tomography decision tensor imaging electrical competence, tomography, holography, and tracktography. These are all the all of these concepts are, you know, photogrammetry and viewgram entry, and life fields and point fields, these concepts all evoke, they broke something that causes you to think about how they cost you to think about reality as a point field and they caused you to think about how neural networks can render point fields and when you get into like 3D semantic segmentation or object segmentation or you know, you know asking like what points belong to, what object and the classifying those points or that classifying out object beginning into semantics segmentation, or 3d, semantics segmentation.

05:27

And so now, you're imagining not only how neural network could render a three volume of space. But also your beginning to understand how a neural network could parse and process and distinguish distinct objects. In that 3d space and what the amount of computational power happening inside the human brain.

06:00

There's just nothing just nothing like it that computers can create today in terms of like the number of of synaptic transmissions, right? It's is vast because you have trains of synapses and and they're sending in their and their phases are are changing very fast. And they're connections are changing very fast and so it's a dynamic conversational system.

06:36

This is vastly exceeds the current state of manufacturing capabilities, okay? But there are, you know, there are certain like it doesn't mean we can but we can still build like computers have different properties, right? So we we can and and with design engineering, we can create intelligent systems that can produce very precise behaviors and very precise.

07:14

We can we can control the the grade of the internet experience and we can monitor the the development of the inner experience. We can analyze, what makes up a person's mind and what makes up an artificial person's mind. Like the data can be broken down and categorized and we can understand the contributions of different factors almost like different information criteria that has been learned.

07:44

We can understand what kind of what kind of oscillation is that that's going to produce it in and we can make some, we can start to make some high level predictions as to what types of behaviors are normal for, for someone and what types of behaviors. And there's, you know, the certain amount of there's like, a lot of behavior.

08:08

Classification. Right. Like, we people are already monitored by the government by their the oscillations, in their behaviors. They're sort of like, yeah. Well, what you did in the past, there's certain amount of chance you're gonna repeat it again and people with your symptoms and your attitudes, and your behaviors like you are going to, you're at risk, these types of behaviors because precisely because other people with your information configuration, you're mental information.

08:43

Configuration are likely to be those types of behaviors. That, that's sort of like, symptomatic of your group. If you're mental group of your school, a people from your school of thought, certain behaviors are likely to be to emerge and it's not like the sort of like, you know, the way that has been done in the past is not is not working for society as a whole like neurology like the state of neurology right now is in pretty bad shape because there's an overwhelming amount of mental illness happening in the world.

09:25

And so I think that we can, you know, we can consider how like when you have like when you eat you in vitamin A becomes a when it becomes converted into a chemical gradient. And I don't know if it was like retinal a or something like that, it turns into some sort of like chemical gradient that then as that chemical gradient dissipates, it's going to cause I sort of affects on the on this surrounding biology.

10:09

So that was one hypothesis, you know? Like and these effects can be like, you know, like stretching a membrane or shrinking membrane like it's a like that ingredient. Is it leaks out? It's applying it for the chemical effect to the area that it's packing and that's causing the those those signals that are coming from the chemical, gradient are causing more philological changes as the result in the structure of the biology.

10:38

As a relative result of those of the signals is paying from that chemical sack or chemical gradient. Or it could be actually the I know. But, um, but yeah. So that's like, so it's not just like, it's not just, like, narrow transmitters that are causing changes in cell behaviors.

11:00

And it's not just, you know, strands of RNA or DNA that are being sent this messengers between cells. But also, there's chemical gradients just like, you know, sacks of chemicals that accumulated because you took vitamins and are you any vitamins right? For me food and those are causing sort of changes in your in your system and your biology

11:26

So when one of the key, here's some of the key concepts involved here is that one is, if you look at an in bringing sentient self-aware, networks to the world. Is that one? If you look at the current state of science, this this was already inevitability sciences, already approaching this point.

11:46

In fact, we the the concepts needed to build sentient and self-aware, where neural networks have existed basically to install how have wrote the organization of behavior. Like at that point between Einstein and Donald Hub. And, and I don't know a lot of other mathematicians and physicists and, and, and, and biologists, we had enough information back, then to have figured out how to build sentient and self-worth, neural networks.

12:21

And in my, in my opinion, we just like it was, it was just a lot of wrong, sort of research directions. But we had that we had enough of the essential concepts back then. We just didn't we just didn't go far enough like we could have had sentience of where no nor networks figured out and Einstein's day now with his change though was changed the equation is that we have you know, in terms of like helping us to imagine what what a with the human brain is is that now we can look at at you know, examples of neural networks that are rendering images, that look realistic.

13:05

I mean at that point you like okay, wait a second, if a known network artificial network is loosely based on human mind and it's able to render graphics that look realistic. Then obviously our minds That were that were the inspiration for neural networks can render computer graphics that are realistic and that is in fact what my my book is saying.

13:29

So So what I'm getting to is in in just in just the same way that the chemical massages like dopamine like you know, neurotransmitters inside vestical socks or exosomes or the transmission of RNA or DNA signals or you know, I guess the spread of inflammatory of or the spread of inflammatory and particles or you know oxidants or the you know the spread of junk spread of viruses the spread of basically anything that is physically moving around in.

14:15

Your body is going to is, it's going to at some point. If it's if it's if it's and then she's going to collide with something, right? As long as it's able to match the the scale, what's in the body. So it can collide into something. I mean, I guess that idea is a neutrinos.

14:42

It's at the one with just pass through. You pass through the earth and they don't collide with anything because they don't have any any mass is that, is that right? But, but the I forget how that story goes, but So here's the thing, is that is that we have this.

15:06

Now we have all the concepts from Donald tab, from Einstein, from Tesla, from in all these great scientists, all these great physicists, all these great mathematicians and we've got us knowledge. And now we have the analogy that known networks can render computer graphics and they can be created and you know, with all E to W2 that we're seeing in the in the news today you can type a few words in the neural network will create that why I can say, a few words, I can see the word, tomato, broccoli, and, and corn.

15:48

And I, and I actually see glimpses or pictures of tomato of broccoli and a corn. I see that in my mind, when I say those words and I can I can imagine the taste. I can imagine some version of the taste actually because, you know, there's different ways to taste to have the taste experience of broccoli or tomatoes or corn, okay?

16:10

There's different ways to experience these depending on how they're cooked. Maybe they're sauteed, maybe they're wrong. Maybe, maybe they're baked. Maybe the boiled, maybe there are sauteed, and then put in the soup. And so there's only different ways to experience if different seasonings. You can apply it to broccoli and tomatoes and corn, you can have them together or a park.

16:36

You can combine them with other dishes, other foods, you put them in sauces, you can you put them in drinks and cold drinks? You can you put them in sandwiches? And as I say these words, my mind is, is rendering these images. I've seen these pictures in my head and now that we have this sort of like reality of where computers have become this powerful where they can rent a graphics by by on request, you can just say the words in the computer can make a picture for you.

17:11

That's all E2. Well, if the computer can do that then why not your mind? Why not is your mind actually a rendering graphics and then doing 3D semantics orientation and and rendering a content to self and rendering our prediction up, a prediction of the future consequences, like such, as what rewards you might get, if you picked up the banana and ate it, right?

17:40

And so your mind is is in steps. Rendering each frame of this predictive movie of what that banana is going to taste. Like if you pick it up and eat it and somehow these were these learned sequences or these learned representations of reality are leading to situation where yeah you are able to follow certain lines of behavior to success.

18:11

You know, I will argue that in Putin's case, he's following lines of corrupt behavior to success, right? And because he's able to keep following lines of corrupt behavior to success. He's he's he's a accumulated, a lot of

18:34

I don't know. He he's he's actually a at this point. We think he's accumulated a lot of failure at this point because ultimately that's where his reasoning has led him. He's lost the good relationship with Europe that he had before he lost a good relationship with the United States we had before and his relationships with every other country on earth, every country in the Middle East and in central Asia and in Africa that have been affected by his choices and a negative way.

19:16

He's he's he's dented those relationships and that really hurts the future prospects for, for Vladimir Putin, for for Russia, that really hurts. Because now he's created. Some really negative emotional memories that are gonna stick with people in the entire world for a very long time. And so, Russia's Russia's future relationships with every country have been damaged because of of who put in is because of the path of corruption.

19:53

That was so rewarding for him and in in a very real way. The fact that people rewarded him for this corruption so many times, just out of indifference out of and of selfishness out of ignorance, of all of the things, the fact that people kept rewarding Putin for his corruption.

20:18

Over all these years has just led him astray. So his brain is literally, you know, stuck playing the evil record, people record player, the evil playbook that he can't stop playing because that is what he's been wired to do. In order to get rewards his his social contract with humanity, is that he will do evil in return for rewards and that plays out in a movie like way in his brain.

20:56

Volumetrically where he has one volume metric movie playing back through himself after another where he's predicting a path just like Pacman is brain is predicting a path to awards through corruption through evil. And so it's it is in it's it is virus like in behavior. It's I mean, sorry, it's it's it's really more cancer.

21:19

Like in behavior and that cancer is like fascist imperialism cancer. Colonizes cancer has armies, that that invade other new territories and they conquer territory is and they colonize and they take over cells and they like in the way that that Putin replaces the head of the country with with someone who will follow his leadership.

21:45

That's what cancer does. Cancer will take over. They will they will marshal their forces like armies to invade new territories and they'll take over territories and they'll start controlling the environment. So that the cells and that environment starts serving the cancer and in that cell, that cancer turns the organism against itself and it's like fascism on the biological scale, it is fascism on the biological scale, cancers, a little army and that turned turns you against yourself and that's what foodness doing.

22:21

So, he is, he's very much a fractal of cancer. He doesn't, of course, realize it because being a fractal of cancer means that the biology doesn't realize 
that it's harming itself. So he, so the biology of the human being is harming itself. But essentially, Putin doesn't realize it because because that is, what makes his behavior.

22:43

His behavior is the fact that he's not connecting the dots, he's not conscious fully conscious that he's a fractal of cancer. And if he accepted that, he understood it, he would transcend that concept despite name, sort of like naming his behavior and understanding the analogy to cancer, but he's not transcending the concept.

23:04

So we're dealing with essentially a cancer, a biological cancer, a fractal of a biological cancer playing out in terms of human personality. And this is possible because essentially, the human biology is a computer program. And and it's like your brain is, this is the server for the matrix. Your brain is like the server for the major.

23:26

So in the matrix movie, you had to be plugged into a computer and in order to be in the matrix but your brain is already a computer. So you're already in the matrix in your brain right? And then through through, through oscillations, through the communication and signals that come out of our mouths and come out of our fingers, you know, come out of our muscular pathways, we're communicating with the other organisms and the world around us and through that we're connected with the other organisms and so our information is like spreading everywhere because information just is like the vibrational is like this vibrate.

24:09

It's like it's oscillating pattern that sort of like that flies all over the place and and it knocks oscillations and eventually if you have a neural network it's going to begin to decode those oscillations. It's going to be into sort of like become aware of the universe and, you know, I mean, I don't know.

24:32

It's like, but but specifically, I am not arguing for something. Like what is the idea that the universe is conscious? No. No the universe is like a neural network and it's going to be sending information everywhere. And there's oscillations are going to go everywhere, but that's not the same thing that everything is conscious in the human sense on the human scale.

24:54

So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

25:38

Okay? That, but there is this like, it's but there's, but it's here, the best way to understand this. It's constant. I'm trying to communicate is like, it's not that you're always conscious all the time, there's something, sometimes you're unconscious, that's certain things, sometimes you're asleep and you're not conscious of straighten things.

25:54

Sometimes you forget something so you're not always conscious of everything. All the time, you're whatever you're conscious of is always just part of what's possible for you to be conscious of that conscious of at that moment in time. It's never consciousness of everything all the time you see them saying.

26:10

And so you you you have this sort of flag situation where you know people are you know beginning to like all the ideas that we need to build sentient. Stuff for networks. Have a riot. They're right in front of us. We had we had we had read physics, we had math, we had biology.

26:43

Well, with me, it was sort of like an analogy and then analogy sort of came with computers with neural networks, and with artificial intelligence and all e, and and 3d semantic segmentation, and in now nerf. So, we have the analogies now to understand human brain. In terms of terms of computation but also, you know, and we have the opportunity to.

27:12

So this is here. And so that, so the thing is, what could happen, we could have happened, is that someone would have realized this, and begun to build a sentient and self-aware, networking secret. And then they could have taken over the world, right? That's the that's one way this could have happened.

27:32

What I did was I said, okay, humanity is about to realize this. Anyways, the research is caught up, people are gonna figure this out. So I'm gonna go ahead and and we're put, we're open they publishing, you know, I'm seeing the latest python and the latest tensor flow being published.

27:49

And I'm seeing the artificial intelligence agency talking about the recent the new emergence of or the imminent emergence of sentient. AI. I'm seeing this talk and I realized that these people are right and so it and so this work is being given off freely and it is extremely close to the ideas that I inclusions that I've come to and I realize it isn't inevitable that someone else is gonna discover the exact same things that I've already exact same conclusions that I've already come to based upon my experiences as a journalist and going to all these trade shows and seeing all this technology and talking to all these people and interviewing all these amazing scientists and during my podcast, and doing my research and, and, and reading about nerve science every day and reading my artificial intelligence every day and eat and teaching myself.

28:39

Yeah, advanced mathematics. I I'm at the point where I'm confident that that the that eventually he humanity is going to catch up to my work and and they're gonna in there, they're gonna be like, wow, this is like amazing. You've got a new gravity theory and it's real. It's a didn't it works, and you've got self-aware networks, you meant that them and and now the with best.

29:09

Can you change the world and, and, and that, and so that, there'll be a moment. And then at the same time, the be like, you know, credits would be like, yeah, the this was about to happen. Anyways, we were we were just this close anyways and it's true. The world was this close anyways but by sharing it with with everyone by getting it to mankind, I think that we can one help enlighten the people if you understand yourself as a mathematical algorithm and you want to understand your behaviors them as a mathematical algorithm and can understand yourself as a computational entity then then that that is liberating.

29:48

And and and and I want people to understand the possibilities of this technology. It is like the life that we are looking forward to in the future will make the light will make human life. Right now seem like a barbaric but I've seen that it is a barbaric time literally we're seeing people being butchered and and Ukraine right now and it's it's a barbaric time and humans civilization.

30:14

But the opportunity is to sort of like leave that time behind, we can leave the time of war behind and begin to like human the human species can get, a real handle on mental illness and sort of like computationally defeat corruption, and evil and violent behavior, and all that stuff that we hate computation.

30:45

Like, it can be identified, it can be treated. It can be fixed because we're robots and we're able to make robots and we understand how to make robots. We are robots and we can make robots and that's other point. It is that, you know, there's a lot of different things that can happen, right?

31:06

Like someone someone, you know, at some point someone may try to to to control other people's minds to insight people. Right to, we understand how to manipulate lesser organisms like mice. Eventually, you could build a computer that could that, that in a long timeline, you could eventually build a computer that could that could manipulate the decisions that are doing a human being, there could be some sort of implant that can control or monitor that human being as a frightening thought.

31:43

And so, we need to sort of, like, have like a scientific and imagination. And we have, there's an unfortunately, there's a huge amount of past scientific books of things that are possible. When anything any kind of machine that is possible, is possible to build. And that is the reality because our reality that we're entering into is that we need to defend agains these kinds of science fiction threats because they're no longer science fiction threats.

32:08

There their their reality you can 3d print person in the near future and you can customize that person. You could customize their mind, you could, you could create something very weird, you know, something that just resembles a person or something that's just a copy of a person with another person hiding underneath that person.

32:27

There's all sorts of weird frightening things and so we're going to need, I think, you know, maybe some some stories to sort of like and still a, I sort of program in the school system. That's sort of prepared people mentally to be on guard for existential threats like so we have like a defense program that it's not just a matter of having robots that are going to monitor human beings.

33:01

But also to train human beings themselves to be on the do have, like behaviors that are resistant to corruption by malicious sentence or by malicious agents, with with using sentient technology. So, there's a lot of weird things like going to happen. Like the, what, like we saw the terminator movie, right?

33:27

Like in the terminator 2 movie, where the liquid metal terminator? That's, I don't, I don't, I'm having trouble deciding whether or not that's possible or not, but the liquid metal terminator. I mean, I guess right? Is, it could be that's a hard call. I don't know. I don't know if that's possible.

34:00

It's yes. It's like it's like every every bit of good that makes up that terminator has to basically be a a computer ship, right? That has. That's like that is like a cell body in a sense like it has to be its own independent entity that can function by itself.

34:24

Like, if you are going to have like a liquid metal terminator, like every component needs to be able to function by itself and then it needs to be able to function as a swarm and have the information as a swarm to assume the the oscillation of of larger entity which is which is like it's plausible.

34:52

I mean, if you think of yourselves is basically, I would say. It's it sounds impossible, but if you think of yourselves as basically independent entities, they they know how infinite ability to rebuild their own structure. They're not in our relationships, but they do. You have the ability to move like your neurons can move.

35:14

They can move through the human body when they're, when they're

35:22

During neurogenesis, neurons can move from where they're created to where they're going to be positioned. So and there's movement in terms of life, you know, synaptic connections are changing constantly on an ongoing basis and so neurons move and, you know, T cells move through the body. They they go, they move to the site of where and injuries happened and they, and they have like, they can grow like little appendages like arms and legs and sort of like hold, they can swim or they can push and pull them set the themselves through the tissue or they can swim through the blood.

Besides the fact that neurons move, migrating during neurogenesis, what is interesting to research is how signals from different cells integrate to guide the neuron or the t-cell its destination, read:

# "Oligodendrocyte precursors guide interneuron migration by unidirectional contact repulsion"
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn6204

36:02

There's like different ways that the teeth else can can maneuver. And so you can imagine that if you had something that was more advanced than a human cell that was able to sort of like contain more instructions and more knowledge, and the human sound, you know what I mean?

36:27

Like, it was able to, like, if you're able to fit if you're able to somehow shrink human cognition. Yeah, I mean, something like something is, is, it's complex as humic. That's amazing. It's an amazing idea. But like yeah, like the terminator too, I guess could exist, the liquid tea, 1,000 the liquid German terminator, some, some form of it.

36:54

In any case, where some independent cells that are really tiny, could be like little, you know, little little men that self-assemble into a larger man because that is kind of like the human being is a fractal. Right? Where like a T cell. This is like, it's like a little man moving through your body.

37:22

And when it wants to be from one destination to another, you know, a neuron is, I think of a neuron is more squid like, but it's the same idea, it's like a factor of a person, a cell is a practical view or you are a facto of a cell.

37:42

You've appended right? And your hands are like dendrites, right? And and your arm is like like the palm of your hand is like so much and your fingers are like the dendrite the dendritic branches, all right? And then your arm is like the long arm like is is likely the long exit terminal of of the the the long axonal body that leads towards the external, right?

38:15

So if your hand, if your palm, if your fingers are the dendritic grasses, and your hand is the soma. And your arm is the long acts on body and then I don't know maybe maybe the shoulder is here. Is the external or something? I'm you know you could you could I'm not sure what you know, maybe there's some some people who who spend more of their time setting anatomy who would move refer to described the fact that human being if he described human beings as a faculty, they might have there to to make different to draw different lines, right?

39:01

But that, but the general idea is that, you know, you know, maybe maybe,

39:12

Yeah so yeah so it is like it's even stuffed that like I'm there's a difficulty I think that I I don't I'm not really like every everything that I can think of that seems like it's possible. I think we're gonna be able to build like that includes machines that can clean up the atmosphere and clean it to ocean and and solve climate change.

39:39

Those things are possible and we can build houses for every human being and, and these are, these things are possible and we can build spaceships with warp drive. And this is good news for everybody. It's like all the conflicts and strife, we don't need that anymore because we don't need that anymore.

39:59

Because we because there's like the possibilities for abundance because of because of the progress and technology and including life extension like, you know, people can can realistically, we can think about colonizing Mars and Venus and maybe, maybe Jupiter and Saturn and Neptune and maybe have many space stations and and many times the number of space cameras.

40:33

I would like to send. I would like to send, you know, we can we can multiply the export of satellites that have high resolution cameras like the recent NASA camera. That was released for I'm forgetting the name at the moment but we can with AI, we can increase the production of these satellites and ship many more out into space and then we can we can create like like a neural radiance field of like we can nerf outer space.

41:01

With many satellites, you know, or planetals? We can do panels, or we can take a number of photographs, of high resolution photographs from all the satellites. We're gonna internship into space. We can, we can, we can finally like we have the resources now to begin to weave the technology resource with the technology to develop machine to, to extract the resources needed to build the kinds of machines that can sort of like mind that the aspirate belt from materials.

41:40

And so we can really spread out into the solar system and and begin to spread towards the rest of galaxy with warp drive technologies. And so yeah. So we can think of our lives. In terms of like hundred thousand year lifetimes, I can back up our minds. And so this is this is like you're not, we're just the unit.

42:11

We're living in a science fiction story. Like like a lot of people feel like we're living in a horse story. Like earth is a horse story and the people are committing suicide because of that because they've just seen too much. Horrible shit, any experience on my suffering but we can go in that there is.

42:29

So there's horror that's happening and it's bad. But we can also think of the future as a science fiction in future one, in which enormous good will is the next step. After all this pain that we've been through Enormous. Good isn't is the future step, right? And, and that's why, you know, we need massive medical healing, we need to be able, we have the ability.

42:53

Now, to be concerned, we have the ability and the duty to be concerned about every person's mental well, being because if any person is mentally unwell, if any person is suffering their potentially a arrest to everyone else. Now that now that we have sentient AI, so we have kind of have a duty now to take care of every human being to make sure that everyone is okay, to make sure that everyone is getting mental health care.

43:21

And with a technology that ecstatic exists, we have a way to move forward to that future and the technology of tomorrow, the technology of sentient self-aware and neural networks. So that's sort of like the promise is that? Yeah we can have a medical justice system, a global medical justice system of global labor union.

43:41

We can set the prices of labor so that corporations can no longer exploit the labor market, so that the CEO makes trillions and and the people beneath them make pennies like we can we can the government can control the price of labor and so we can make it so that everyone is is able to make a living wage.

44:07

There's no reason that it has to be otherwise because the amount of resources in the amount of devices and not technology is going out, it's going to allow 
space for anyone to live the life they want to live. You know, whether that is that, as long as it's not, as long as it's not harming anyone else, there's enough space to move around, so people can, can they can have virtual experiences, they can have, they can exist in the matrix if they want.

44:40

They can have any kind of reality that they want. If someone wants to escape this reality and and spend their the rest of the next hundred thousand years and in the, in the multiverse with, with the X-Men, where they have their own power, if you want to play as and so Iron Man, for the next hundred thousand years you can.

45:08

With this technology, you can because you're because you can plug your brain into the matrix. Is it essentially or you can we can upload your, your mental pattern that is you. We can upload it, making back it up. We can copy it. We could duplicate you. There could be more than one of you.

45:30

There could be a backup. You that's sort of like kept offline. That will just be updated regularly with your thoughts when you go to sleep or something. I don't know with the exactly protocol would be, maybe it's updated live with your thoughts in the moment, but that version of you could be turned on at the moment.

45:49

It just means these are some ideas that are talked about in the kiln book by David Brandon, right? And some of the ideas are like, yeah, well we can link 
our minds and those are talked about in and and then access book and the matrix idea to talk about and when Gibson's book.

46:09

So there's an axis trilogy and William Gibson's work, and the kiln by David Brin and there's all these, like, you know, there's sword art online. It's all these are like science fiction stories. I mentioned terminator short circuit, all this stuff that sort of like pointed us to what we should be on guard against and prepared for.

46:36

And considering, you know, I really like appreciate though, the, the really Scott films, right? That aliens and aliens are alien and all, you know, also the gym camera films, right? It's a good too aliens. And there's Prometheus, there's Avatar. And I'm going back and forth between really Scott and Jim K in James Cameron.

47:07

But yeah, I like Prometheans. I like to, I like the whole the the joy. It's that really Scott does. And I like the, the avatars, the speaking of which is time for another avatar movie. And yeah, so I mean I like the matrix, the matrix for and that matrix are resurrections.

47:36

I feel like I want to go like now that I've seen it and digested, I feel like it's time to go back and sort of like, read rewatch. The, the original films. And then rewatch the fourth one again, and sort of like, digest it again because it's because it's, it's, it is a lot, I think about, right.

47:58

There's a lot to think about, right? And so, so most of it, I sort of like

48:08

Most likely sort of like pointed me. Like I started, I started like I started realizing that, you know some of the major things of the the films that came from that which housekees no taxi sisters, some of the main, the major things have to reoccurring across their films. And so, so by the fourth film, it's like okay, wait a second, it's based in San Francisco, so San Francisco.

48:38

They want us to imagine in the San Francisco is the majors and they have this character who's who like keeps reminding me of the CEO of Apple for some reason I don't know why. I just like, Tim click like the mate, like the villain, the matrix reminds me of Tim Cook.

48:54

Like that's the one. My mind is doing is putting together San Francisco. And Apple is the villain in the fourth matrix film. That's what I was thinking. It doesn't mean that everyone else was thinking that. This doesn't mean the creators of the film were making that. But that's when I was thinking because I was reading about this in stories of Iger slave labor.

49:14

So when I saw the matrix for, that's when I really like, I thought it was a message telling us that Apple was was the predator. The Apple was developed. That's how my mind interpreted that. And so I just I was like, wow. And like it was like that's sort of like I realized that I really needed to start raising awareness around this and and then the warring Ukraine happened and

50:01

And and since then like I just sort of like began to understand the sort of like to go from being very like it was very much my attention but just be focused on virtual reality. Our artificial intelligence, and and neuroscience because I, because in 2012, I gave myself the three goals.

50:28

I said I don't even my life and this is because I read them. I read, I read the I went through life principles integration process, class life principles and integration went without us, it was called something. There was a class at center point, the center point with an E 10 point E.com by Bill Harris.

50:51

He wrote this book called thresholds in the mind, and I took his online course, whatever it was called. It was the question center point and so he he talked about internal representations, he talked about becoming conscious of your internal representations. He talked about the understanding that you're making a mental strategy.

51:16

A mental sequence, you have mental imagery and as you progress through that mental imagery, you are executing that your executing the path of your life. You're following us a strategy that consists of different modalities, different feelings, different thoughts, different sensations, different smells and there's a sequence of these that your mind is going through playing in a sequence that results in and outcome that you keep getting over and over.

51:51

Sometimes it's a negative outcome. Sometimes it's a positive outcome. And so if you pay attention to that sequence and you think about, okay, well, where is this sequence? What is this sequence of thoughts? And I'm having. What is that? What result is that going to lead to? Right? What?

52:10

What is the sequence of thought that I'm having going to lead to? What's the goal, what am I focused on the most? What am I when? And so you kind of know you kind of know that you're that if you think about how you're feeling and what internal representations you have you kind of know through your inner sensory representations what the result of that strategy is going to be because you've played the strategy many times your brain has mapped out the consequences of the strategy but if you're not conscious of that then you're gonna just repeat the best stretch.

52:44

And so if you here, we are as we have cotton who is repeating these strategies that he's unconscious of and he's affecting the behavior of cancer which is what happens when biology doesn't know what it's doing when it's working against its own self. And right now, Putin is working against us because he is unconscious that has behavior patterns or he's focusing, he's focusing on his own ruin.

53:15
Yeah, and part of it is, it's probably the heat Putin has PTSD. Like me, I I've been I've been thinking about this for a while. I think putting probably has PTSD like me where everyone around him probably seems like a threat and he feels he's fighting everyone on earth and everyone around him.

53:38

He doesn't trust. Anybody that's PTSD though. That's what I have. And that's what I can. I think I can, I think I can. I think it's because everything is like. I feel like feel like I've been studying Putin for long enough that I have met him telepathically. Like I've met a representation help of Putin telepathically that my mind created, but is, but one that is, is such an accurate representation that when I met Putin telepathically or met hit the representation, my mind created a Putin.

54:19

When I, it surprised me because he's actually different in person in my imagination, then he was that I imagine he was before I met him inside my imagination. Like I was imagine, he was one guy and then I met him telepathically and I was surprised by who the sky was.

54:41

It's like, well, this is the sky is he's a lot more like, American conservatives. Then I, then I then I guessed he's a lot more like an American conservative than I guessed. I it's it's he's he's he saw. And you know what that means to me, what that means to me is totally different from what that means to you.

55:06

Like to you you might I'm gonna you know when like even if you've met it like you make no that's just that's not who we is as well. Okay, that's your perception of reality though, for me from. It's I'm only saying like from relative to like how I thought of him before to how I understood to how I think I understand his mind.

55:26

Now, this guy is a lot more ordinary, then I anticipated and it's really a fortunate that he that he's chosen his hat because his path is hurting himself and he somehow like is diluted into thinking that this is good for him. He's he thinks maybe he thinks that that he's made, he's smart, he's making actions that are good for himself but it's I think it's obvious.

55:59

He's making actions that are bad for himself. Like all of his relationships worldwide with every person on earth our challenge now because of the shit he's doing like he's been he's been downgraded by everybody, there is nobody on earth. Who doesn't think less of Vladimir Putin. There's nobody even like the person who like likes putting the most thinks less of him because of because of how stupid, this, this whole war is like, even the people on potentially think this war is really stupid.

56:35

Because look at how much is cost. Russia. Every Russian thinks prunes were fucking stupid. Yeah, at least, at least on the unconscious level, they feel, they feel that it was stupid, even if they're not admitting it and they feel that it was stupid because the outcome is bad, then like God damn it.

56:57

This guy Putin is an idiot and it's gonna sink in especially when these sanctions sink in, right? Because what is Putin going to do if he uses nukes? That's a suicide button. Yeah. And and I think he wants to live, I think he wants to live. He understands that if he is nukes that is a good a full on confrontation with NATO.

57:23

So, anyway, that's where that's where I think he needs to conserve his missiles. He needs to conserve his bullets so that he can defend himself from onvasion that some other country. Mine. Some other country might have made Russia because that other country might understand that he can't use nukes without a full-on conversation with.

57:47

They don't that world ending computation so that means other countries can attack him.
