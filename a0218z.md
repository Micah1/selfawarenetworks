It's like the brainwave itself, the oscillation, can contain a musical note, or a visual note, or the taste of a note, do you note the taste of this wine compared to another wine? This other wine has a cheddar note in the beginning, with a fruity finish.

Notes can be multi modal blocks within a sequence, as if all blocks in a sequence are etched into a universal block (in each step of each sequence) for storing internal representation patterns in a compressed manner.

It's a situation where you have many simultaneous blocks happening at the same time in the brain.

So imagine if you have been working hard for a long time, and you are seeing the fruits of your effort, you are succeeding somehow through your own hardwork to pay rent in life. Maybe you are an artist and you are good at art and good at social networking and selling your art.

It's a copy of the person that is equal to the original person. For people to be okay with that Star Trek's society would have had to have concluded that people are not really alive in the first place, that we are just animated materials, and that there is true continuity of a person hood between 1 moment of time and the next moment in time, so identity is an illusion anyways, and what is being transported was never you, because there is no you, but the pattern that the concept of you is associated with does continue when it's re-materialized, but every moment of existence is like de-materialization & re-materialization anyways.
