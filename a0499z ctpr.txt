(cerebral, cortex, neuron)
Maybe you should read every book written by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett Maybe you should read every book written by, and every video talk by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Steven Hawking, Steven Pinker , Michael Shermer, Peter Singer, Steven Wineberg, Paul Kertz, Lawrence Krause, Ray Kurtzwell for starters, Ray Kurtzwell for starters, there are thousands more scholars, historians, academic, scientists, physicists, astrophysics, neuroscientists, evolutionary biologists, most of the most brilliant people alive today, most of the exceptional people in history.

Human beings are different from other species because of a larger cerebral cortex, this neo cortex is a modeling system, it maps every aspect of our sensory experiences, and these maps become our expectations and beliefs about what is going to happen next, the basis of intelligence is memory-prediction, that means awareness equals expectation, its a mechanical thing, its different from a computer because the hardware and software are one, it is constantly reprogramming itself to learn (map, model, predict) so as to coordinate reactions, every thought involves neurons firing in a sequence activing sensory modalities in your very own simulation of reality, the matrix, its yours mind.

"Basically, how can you KNOW anything in a definitive sense?" the human mind makes predictions, bets about what is real, all you ever have is your best bet, all a man ever has is that, a bet about what is real. Even if you declare "I know, beyond any doubt, with certainty, the truth" you still only have your best, if you say that you really still don't have any certainty, you don't need certaintiy. A very small amount of faith is enough, an amount of confidence that no bigger than a chia seed or a mustard seed is all you need, to act on your best bet, to carry through, and to accomplish gigantic tasks.
