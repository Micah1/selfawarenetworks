Catarina says combined different inputs, sensory motor cortex input to striatum prediction cell, combined with 
not all inputs are equal, sensory motor inputs in the amygdala, I just had to excite 5 boutons with a tiny laser could generate a way bigger upstate from current upstate, there are differences in brain regions and cell types from the intensity that it creates.

ON INTELLIGENCE spines might store temporal information
or temporal and spatial information to detect predict
a micro column within a cortical column might represent a vector
how might a dendrite pass on the detection of temporal information to the AP

how does a column affect the brains oscillations
do columns have their own neural oscillations

is there a mathematical structure of knowledge at the level of cortical column

does that involve wavelets, 
20 years of research of 
functional level

if you have a dendrite segment
8 or 9 synapses within 5 milliseconds can imitation an ndma spike
extremely sparse patterns detected by dendrite segment predisposes an neuron to fire stronger or more often

two answers

the synapses have to be co-active within a very short period of time
a population code, instantaneous activation
the same group of neurons, recurrently connected
a layer of cells which is feeding onto itself
the context is what the layer was representing a previous time step a few milliseconds ago

the layer has activity that predicts activity, that represents previous activity

in the 2016 you can learn non-markovian sequences
different musical pieces will share notes in common

the same mechanism can store knowledge in a reference frame
a coordinate by a collection of neurons is a prediction for what happens next
