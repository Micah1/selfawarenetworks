How do telescopes work, two lense for focusing light

the dome of the skull might focus em radition back towards the center of the brain

the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.

to itself the brain renders it's own phasic burst firing patterns as deviations from its tonic firing as well as this the rendering is also accomplished by the inhibition of parts of the brain, in alignment with attention-schema theory but specifically in the context of a 4 dimensional brain grid & electro-magnetic phase change graph.

So the idea of the brain rendering the same thing at multiple scales coupled with attention I think could point to focus being the amplification of a small scale neuronal pattern to the meso and macro scales, so that when all three scales are represented a sort of 3D hologram is erected for the organism to reference conceptual models of places, people, things, concepts, and properties like velocity, weight, orientation, in both a scale invariant way, and in a tempo-spatial location & rotation way. So that you can imagine any object, concept, or property of an object in any location with any orientation at any time at any scale. It allows the human brain to have invariant representations inside invariant representations.

So you can imagine yourself rendering your own thoughts in your head, then you can imagine yourself thinking about yourself imagining yourself rendering your own thoughts in your head.

Eventually infinities are imagined.

It is interesting however how the lense of the eye is similar to a telescope lense, reversing the light, which is sensed by our retina.

It would be interesting if the sensory representations of that lightfield were really four dimensional in nature, or became four dimensional in nature after being passed between different rows & columns in nature repeatedly

I would like to imagine that the brain develops signals as it passes them, so each area continually revises clarifies and improves the signals it receives.

but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

I'm going to propose an idea for what I think could be the brain's filing system. Like a file system, in your brain,
