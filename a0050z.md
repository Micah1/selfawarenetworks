(oscillat, graph, criteria, causation, cortex) virtual patterns in the brain
thought as distinction
what does the mind need to be distinct from?

what does an object in your mind need to be distinct from? why do we need an oscillation for a temporal, spatial, phasic sequence of deviations to deviate from? 

In order for your mind to detect a difference it has to detect two things, that which something isn't, and that which something is, to make the initial distinction of reality, between on or off, between light or dark, the whole of light and dark combined, of all things combined, the thing associated with the word holism, it has no distinctions, no thought can be formed about it, as long as everythough exists as a distinction that is at least distinct from something that is not that exact same thought.

So that is why I argue, that the tonic oscillations of the brain are creating the bedrock of the mind, the canvas of consciousness, the ground of being, the beginning of the detection of inner self space for the sentient self aware being to consider and reflect, the mechanical & computational chamber of ephinomenal consciousness in the robotic like human mind.

The higher frequency phasic firing neurons then inscribe the contents of the mind, that the mind is aware of, they formulate from everything you see, taste, hear, smell, touch, they are the words in your mind, the songs in your soul, the hallucinations of people touching you when no one is around after a night of drinking Absinthe.

I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

Neurons also have to take breaks after firing, so if the same pattern appeared to you, to your brain many times really fast, faster than a millisecond, it would have to be represented by different sets of neurons, in different places, because the neuron that represented it the first time might be on a break, well a neuron fires and that takes about a millisecond.

This means that patterns in your brain are virtual, that is your brain can in theory render any pattern anywhere, but to explain what that is like imagine seeing your name burned into wood, now imagine your name etched into steel, now imagine your name written with red letters on a yellow sign that is the shape of a diamond.
Now imagine hearing your name spoken by an old lady, now imagine your name  spoken by a robot voice like Siri. So the way I imagine this working is that parts of your visual cortex are going to be activated for wood, different parts for steel, other parts for yellow, red, steel, and different parts of your audio cortex might become activited if you can hear the old lady speaking your name, or hear Siri the robot voice in your imagination. The idea that I prefer or subscribe to is that some areas of your brain, because of their unique geographical proximity to certain incoming sensory signals have their representations created by the structural changes over time tuned to process specific types of patterns and specific types of distinctions within certain modalities, all though cross modality distinctions are a key part of how the brain works it makes sense for a brain as an orchestra containing many independent instruments to have instruments that become very specialized in processes certain kinds of data.

So this would mean light light patterns would have different temporal-spatial patterns as well as different phases or frequencies expressed in those aforementioned temporal spatial patterns as compared to light patterns but especially also as compared to other modalities such as sounds which might offer a lower dimensionality
