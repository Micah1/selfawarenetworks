Journal Entry January 10th Interaction with Dr. Novo on Twitter, he shared information about his physics theory and I shared information about my physics theory. We are both targeting time in our equations for spacetime quantisation, both of our theories are more detailed & specific than Loop Quantum Gravity.

I can’t wait to use this! Been exploring AI-assisted computational tools for analysing gravitational wave data from event GW150914 that includes  observations of binary black hole mergers and a binary neutron star inspiral.

This is where I try to use existing gravitational wave data at extremely high energy levels to test a new model for spacetime quantisation 

∆x ∆t > h/4π

where ∆x represents the uncertainty in position, ∆t represents the uncertainty in time, and h is Planck's constant. This equation suggests that the smallest possible distances in spacetime are limited by the quantization of spacetime which isn’t a new claim but the new model is formalised mathematically in new and (dare I say) more elegant way compared to existing theories such as Loop Quantum Gravity and String Theory. Also with some unconventional predictions that I’m dying to test but was stuck cause I’m not familiar with astrophysics statistical analysis tools. I hope Wolfram GPT can help with some of this.

What a time to be alive and curious! So excited to use all the new amazing tools released today at GPTs store 🙏🤓🫡

I invented a new model for spacetime quantization it's called Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation you can learn about it from Self Aware Networks GPT and from github https://chat.openai.com/g/g-FA3lrTWTq https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/QGTCD.md
