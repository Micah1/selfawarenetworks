"But cells aren't just targets. They also send out messages to other cells both near and far."
"How Do Cells Respond to Signals?
Once a receptor protein receives a signal, it undergoes a conformational change, which in turn launches a series of biochemical reactions within the cell. These intracellular signaling pathways, also called signal transduction cascades, typically amplify the message, producing multiple intracellular signals for every one receptor that is bound."

on cell integration of signals
"only cells that have the correct receptors on their surfaces will respond to the signal." 
"Cells Integrate Multiple Signals
"Each cell receives a complex combination of signals which simultaneously trigger many different signaling pathways. Each step in a signaling pathway provides an opportunity for cross-talk between different signals. Through cross-talk, the cell integrates information from many different signaling pathways to initiate an appropriate response.
"Two pathways

I wish to reread the following article 100 times. It contains a lot of information that leads to expanding the granular resolution of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography

"Integration of signals"
https://basicmedicalkey.com/integration-of-signals/

Donald Hebb's theory called Hebbian learning applies not just to neuronal cell assemblies but also to individual cells, non-neuronal cells, even bacteria. Essentially we go from "when neurons fire together they wire together" to "when receptors receive coincident activations they compute unique functions" bringing a multi-neuron process backwards down to a single cells function, it means the physical configuration of the receptors represent memories, learn memory patterns, and only the right activations will activate those learned memory patterns encoded as receptor configurations

"Individual cells often receive many signals simultaneously, and they then integrate the information they receive into a unified action plan"
https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-signaling-14047077/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20respond%20to,into%20a%20unified%20action%20plan.

Cutting to the question of what a single neuron can do, can it self regulate? Well this says that a single protein is capable of integrating multiple signals, so the concept of Cellular Oscillating Tomography applies to individual proteins. Protein Oscillation Tomography. Proteins detect coincident or temporarily cascading activation patterns, because of their distinct structure & react or activate behaviors based on those incoming signals. The behaviors or functions or reactions that individual proteins make to novel or new incoming sensed patterns effect a computation of future protein structures, or computed biological structures, that go beyond random mutation, but are still subject to natural selection.

"Integrating Multiple Signals into Cell Decisions by Networks of Protein Modification Cycles"
"We present a general model of reversible protein modification networks and demonstrate that a single protein modified by several enzymes is capable of integrating multiple signals into robust digital decisions by switching between multiple forms that can activate distinct cellular processes"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183812/

This is an example of coincidence detection aka the mechanism referred to as when cells fire together they wire together, allowing a cell assembly to detect coincidences, but in this case the cell is detecting coincidences when it integrates multiple signals that result in a specific behavior activation from the cell, that is pattern recognition with a computed reaction (with Information Theory to explain how it is detected information incepting a function/behavior. Or what I call Cellular Oscillating Tomography

"Information processing and signal integration in bacterial quorum sensing" 2009
"Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal integration on the basis of information theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in V. harveyi.

"two distinct mechanisms that limit information transmission when bacteria integrate multiple signals, biochemical noise and interference between different signals."
This connects with the idea that neurotransmitter flooding inhibits neurons and nucleotide flooding inhibits cell growth. What kind of flooding might inhibit the gravitational warping of spacetime in Quantum Gradient Time Dilation?

Cellulary Oscillating Tomography
is not just about novel receptor growth that forms responses to novel new patterns, its about how cells inside an organism compute/generate new functions, or novel responses, to signals they have never seen before, such as how cell might respond to new types of inflammation, or new environments. The principle of natural selection should work in any multi-cellular body, allowing cells to adapt, mutate, computer future structures, and evolve inside a single animal. It would be like growing a third eye while you are alive, and then passing it down to your offspring if that meant surviving where two eyed organisms did not.

"The Vibrio harveyi quorum-sensing system uses shared regulatory components to discriminate between multiple autoinducers" 2006
"this sensory information converges to control the expression of bioluminescence, biofilm formation, type III secretion (TTS), and protease production."
"We propose that the V. harveyi quorum-sensing transition is not switch-like but rather operates in a graded manner, and that this signaling arrangement, which uses shared regulatory proteins, nonetheless provides V. harveyi a mechanism to respond uniquely to different AI input states."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17015436/

My argument is that cell specificity, or the unique morphological architecture, receptor configuration, and combinatorial logical from protein interactions & signal cascades allows and is essential for each cell to represent a different memory, a different learned memory configuration. Every cell is managing, through it's physical structure, a learned memory state, that allows complex pattern recognition & function recall & the novel function computation from novel sensory inputs.

Every cell in the human body is an unconscious "oscillating tomographical memory pattern prediction" machine with "generative behavior or function outputs" and in a multi-cellular system it is analogous to an Entity-Component-System in the context of a game-engine, where the body is the game engine, and the cells are individual entities that have their own set of components for reacting with system level oscillatory binding of learned reactions, learned & novel pattern sensing, and novel behavior/function/response generation.

"Cross signaling, cell specificity, and physiology"
"Cell specificity results from the existence in any cell type of a unique set of proteins and their isoforms at each level of signal transduction cascades, from the space structure of their components, from their combinatorial logic at each level, from the presence of modulators of signal transduction proteins and of modulators of modulators, from the time structure of extracellular signals and of their transduction, and from quantitative differences of expression of similar sets of factors."
"The signal transduction machinery of a cell integrates all the signals it recognizes and translates them in a coordinated behavior. A signal for a cell is whatever is recognized as such by a receptor that itself initiates a response to this signal. A receptor is the structure that recognizes and reacts to the signal and interprets the specificity of the signal. "
https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpcell.00581.2001

To over simplify, signals compound on top of prior signals to create feedback loops or oscillations of signal activity that integrate & amplify sensory integration & functional output (signalling output)

"By using a “non-binding” reporter of ligand shedding, we found that transactivation triggers a positive feedback loop from ERK back to the EGFR such that ligand shedding drives EGFR-stimulated ERK that in turn drives further ligand shedding. Importantly, activated Ras and ERK levels were nearly linear functions of ligand shedding and the effect of multiple, sub-saturating inputs was additive. Simulations showed that ERK-mediated feedback through ligand shedding resulted in a stable steady-state level of activated ERK, but also showed that the extracellular environment can modulate the level of feedback. Our results suggest that the transactivation circuit acts as a context-dependent integrator and amplifier of multiple extracellular signals and that signal integration can effectively occur at multiple points in the EGFR pathway."
https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/MB/c003921g

Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.

Cellular Oscillating Tomography re-phrased:
So the new theory of evolution, that I am proposing, has 3 steps, 1 random mutation, 2 cell based novel pattern learning + novel computed cell & multi-cellular structures like organs & bodies via Cellular Oscillating Tomography (which can be considered a framework for all computational biology research), and natural selection at all scales, not just at the scale or organisms but also at the scale of proteins, virus's, individual cells, and multi-cellular systems. The oscillations or emergent behaviors from signal feedback loops and coincident & temporally cascading signal activations is part of how signals unify or entify tomographically to generate or program new biological structures & new behaviors or computed functions.

The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.

"Single Neurons Detect a Sequence of Events
() Even more recent research shows for the first time that single neurons can detect and respond to a sequence of events.
()Individual dendrites also can distinguish these sequences.
()Each neuron can have tens of thousands of dendrites and each makes decisions that are then somehow merged into decisions for the entire neuron about whether to fire or not and what type of firing will occur."
https://jonlieffmd.com/blog/what-do-single-neurons-know

Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.

NAPOT Theory suggests that high phasic spiking inhibits the exit terminal array delaying an oscillating group relative to the larger oscillating group. IN other words Delayed Expression of the exit terminal of the activated neuron sets the new timing of the inhibited group by the decay rate of the fired action potential in the previous array. The tonic oscillation absorbs the burstlet, distributes it, and creates a synchronization pattern that dissipates the impact of the signal that group of neurons has received. Resulting in the temporal binding of your learned internal representations that are displayed to subsequent arrays that also embody learned internal representations.

Read:
"Delayed expression, How the brain segregates events that are temporally distinct is unclear. Here we show that a delayed (12–24 h) increase in the expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)—an immune receptor that is well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection—after the formation of a contextual memory determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories."

"Memory Link"
"This delayed expression of CCR5 in mouse dorsal CA1 neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dorsal CA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, and therefore closes the temporal window for memory linking."
https://neurosciencenews.com/memory-link-ccr5-20657/

Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.

This concept is covered very well in Dario Nardi's EEG Research with his students and his 2016 book "The Neuroscience of Personality" really good book.

^ ha I just invented a new term Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography but it is encompassed in the definition of NAPOT.
