# "Integration of signals"
https://basicmedicalkey.com/integration-of-signals/

# When receptors fire together, a learned pattern has been detected.
Donald Hebb's theory called Hebbian learning applies not just to neuronal cell assemblies but also to individual cells, non-neuronal cells, even bacteria. Essentially we go from "when neurons fire together they wire together" to "when receptors receive coincident activations they compute unique functions" bringing a multi-neuron process backwards down to a single cells function, it means the physical configuration of the receptors represent memories, learn memory patterns, and only the right activations will activate those learned memory patterns encoded as receptor configurations

Cutting to the question of what a single neuron can do, can it self regulate? Well this says that a single protein is capable of integrating multiple signals, so the concept of Cellular Oscillating Tomography applies to individual proteins. Protein Oscillation Tomography. Proteins detect coincident or temporarily cascading activation patterns, because of their distinct structure & react or activate behaviors based on those incoming signals. The behaviors or functions or reactions that individual proteins make to novel or new incoming sensed patterns effect a computation of future protein structures, or computed biological structures, that go beyond random mutation, but are still subject to natural selection.

# Cellulary Oscillating Tomography: Procedurally Generation New Biological Functions inside multi-cellular organisms.
is not just about novel receptor growth that forms responses to novel new patterns, its about how cells inside an organism compute/generate new functions, or novel responses, to signals they have never seen before, such as how cell might respond to new types of inflammation, or new environments. The principle of natural selection should work in any multi-cellular body, allowing cells to adapt, mutate, computer future structures, and evolve inside a single animal. It would be like growing a third eye while you are alive, and then passing it down to your offspring if that meant surviving where two eyed organisms did not.

My argument is that cell specificity, or the unique morphological architecture, receptor configuration, and combinatorial logical from protein interactions & signal cascades allows and is essential for each cell to represent a different memory, a different learned memory configuration. Every cell is managing, through it's physical structure, a learned memory state, that allows complex pattern recognition & function recall & the novel function computation from novel sensory inputs.

Every cell in the human body is an unconscious "oscillating tomographical memory pattern prediction" machine with "generative behavior or function outputs" and in a multi-cellular system it is analogous to an Entity-Component-System in the context of a game-engine, where the body is the game engine, and the cells are individual entities that have their own set of components for reacting with system level oscillatory binding of learned reactions, learned & novel pattern sensing, and novel behavior/function/response generation.

# "Cross signaling, cell specificity, and physiology"
"Cell specificity results from the existence in any cell type of a unique set of proteins and their isoforms at each level of signal transduction cascades, from the space structure of their components, from their combinatorial logic at each level, from the presence of modulators of signal transduction proteins and of modulators of modulators, from the time structure of extracellular signals and of their transduction, and from quantitative differences of expression of similar sets of factors."
"The signal transduction machinery of a cell integrates all the signals it recognizes and translates them in a coordinated behavior. A signal for a cell is whatever is recognized as such by a receptor that itself initiates a response to this signal. A receptor is the structure that recognizes and reacts to the signal and interprets the specificity of the signal. "
https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpcell.00581.2001

To over simplify, signals compound on top of prior signals to create feedback loops or oscillations of signal activity that integrate & amplify sensory integration & functional output (signalling output)

"By using a “non-binding” reporter of ligand shedding, we found that transactivation triggers a positive feedback loop from ERK back to the EGFR such that ligand shedding drives EGFR-stimulated ERK that in turn drives further ligand shedding. Importantly, activated Ras and ERK levels were nearly linear functions of ligand shedding and the effect of multiple, sub-saturating inputs was additive. Simulations showed that ERK-mediated feedback through ligand shedding resulted in a stable steady-state level of activated ERK, but also showed that the extracellular environment can modulate the level of feedback. Our results suggest that the transactivation circuit acts as a context-dependent integrator and amplifier of multiple extracellular signals and that signal integration can effectively occur at multiple points in the EGFR pathway."

Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.

# Cellular Oscillating Tomography re-phrased:
So the new theory of evolution, that I am proposing, has 3 steps,

1. Random Mutation

2. Cellular Oscillating (Pattern) Tomography
Cell based novel pattern learning plus novel computed cell & multi-cellular structures (like organs & bodies)

3. natural selection at all scales,
Not just at the scale or organisms but also at the scale of proteins, virus's, bacteria, single celled organism, and multi-cellular organisms.

The oscillations or emergent behaviors from signal feedback loops and coincident & temporally cascading signal activations (at all scales) is part of how signals unify or entify tomographically to generate or program new biological structures & new behaviors or computed functions.

The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.

# "Single Neurons Detect a Sequence of Events"
() Even more recent research shows for the first time that single neurons can detect and respond to a sequence of events.
()Individual dendrites also can distinguish these sequences.
()Each neuron can have tens of thousands of dendrites and each makes decisions that are then somehow merged into decisions for the entire neuron about whether to fire or not and what type of firing will occur."
https://jonlieffmd.com/blog/what-do-single-neurons-know

Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.

NAPOT Theory suggests that high phasic spiking inhibits the exit terminal array delaying an oscillating group relative to the larger oscillating group. IN other words Delayed Expression of the exit terminal of the activated neuron sets the new timing of the inhibited group by the decay rate of the fired action potential in the previous array. The tonic oscillation absorbs the burstlet, distributes it, and creates a synchronization pattern that dissipates the impact of the signal that group of neurons has received. Resulting in the temporal binding of your learned internal representations that are displayed to subsequent arrays that also embody learned internal representations.

# The Oscillatory "Memory Link"
"Delayed expression, How the brain segregates events that are temporally distinct is unclear. Here we show that a delayed (12–24 h) increase in the expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)—an immune receptor that is well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection—after the formation of a contextual memory determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories."

"This delayed expression of CCR5 in mouse dorsal CA1 neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dorsal CA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, and therefore closes the temporal window for memory linking."
https://neurosciencenews.com/memory-link-ccr5-20657/

Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.

This concept is covered very well in Dario Nardi's EEG Research with his students and his 2016 book "The Neuroscience of Personality" really good book.

^ ha I just invented a new term Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography CCOT but it is encompassed in the definition of NAPOT.

# NAPOT Motor Control: Why you are conscious of your muscle movement.
Notice that NAPOT, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, fits with the existing concepts of Hierarchical Tempo-Spatial Activation Sequences for incoming sensory inputs and outgoing motor sequences.

Concepts correlated with medical imaging data from systems like FMRI while subjects move their fingers.

What NAPOT is adding the picture of tempo-spatial activations is a framework that removes the predominant idea that what is being transmitted between neurons is electrical signals and replaces that with what is being transmitted between neurons & glial cells are phase changes in the oscillating group of cells read by neural arrays & shared & bound by the oscillating group, resulting in long lasting synaptic & dendritic morphological changes.

Whether the neuron is transmitting chemicals such as in a chemical synapse, or electricity in the case of electric synapses, what is really being transmitted is a phase change in the brainwave oscillation pattern for that group of cells.

These phase changes are detected by neural arrays and via neural arrays are observed by oscillating groups of cells, as physical changes to their baseline tonic oscillation activity.

So Hierarchical Motor Sequence Representations are Tempo-Spatial Phase changes. Think about that when you read the following.

# "Neural Organization of Hierarchical Motor Sequence Representations in the Human Neocortex"
"The findings challenge the common hypothesis of an orderly anatomical separation of different levels of an action hierarchy and argue for a special status of the distinction between individual movements and sequential context."
"Production of an entire sequence could then be achieved by sequential activation of the corresponding chunks, and new sequences could be generated by recombination of learned chunks (Sakai et al., 2003)"
"the core idea of a multi-level action hierarchy is that each level combines elements in the hierarchically lower level, facilitating the transition between lower-level elements."
"Each hierarchically higher level would lose some of the fine temporal details encoded at the lower level and, hence, represent the action at a more abstract level (Cooper and Shallice, 2000, Fuster, 2008, Humphreys and Forde, 1998, Miller et al., 1960)."
