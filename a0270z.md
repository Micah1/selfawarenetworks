the ground of being as the tonic oscillation of unconscious expectation based awareness is like

like the contrastive paper

and its like the mnemonic paper
"The mnemonic basis of subjective experience"
"we argue that these subjective qualities can be understood in terms of their similarity to other experiences"
https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00068-6
 
but its also like the description of how human beings see colors, as relative contrasts, or differences
meaning that in human perception patterns are distinct from some baseline pattern
new sensory inputs are contrasted with the tonic oscillations set by past sensory inputs

On a larger scale we can make an argument that the differential firing rates of different large scale clustors of cells provides macro scale contrasts between microscale learned representations so that the organism can differentiate between concepts in its internal representations, or mental imagery, or qualia, or mind.

Cell Signalling
"Individual cells often receive many signals simultaneously, and they then integrate the information they receive into a unified action plan"
https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-signaling-14047077/

on cell integration of signals
"only cells that have the correct receptors on their surfaces will respond to the signal." 
"Cells Integrate Multiple Signals
Each cell receives a complex combination of signals which simultaneously trigger many different signaling pathways. Each step in a signaling pathway provides an opportunity for cross-talk between different signals. Through cross-talk, the cell integrates information from many different signaling pathways to initiate an appropriate response.
Two pathways
Combinations of signals are important. Here, a cell responds only when both the yellow and the purple signals are present."

Donald Hebb's theory called Hebbian learning applies not just to neuronal cell assemblies but also to individual cells, non-neuronal cells, even bacteria. Essentially we go from "when neurons fire together they wire together" to "when receptors receive coincident activations they compute unique functions" bringing a multi-neuron process backwards down to a single cells function, it means the physical configuration of the receptors represent memories, learn memory patterns, and only the right activations will activate those learned memory patterns encoded as receptor configurations
"Individual cells often receive many signals simultaneously, and they then integrate the information they receive into a unified action plan"

"Integrating Multiple Signals into Cell Decisions by Networks of Protein Modification Cycles"
"We present a general model of reversible protein modification networks and demonstrate that a single protein modified by several enzymes is capable of integrating multiple signals into robust digital decisions by switching between multiple forms that can activate distinct cellular processes"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183812/

This is an example of coincidence detection aka the mechanism referred to as when cells fire together they wire together, allowing a cell assembly to detect coincidences, but in this case the cell is detecting coincidences when it integrates multiple signals that result in a specific behavior activation from the cell, that is pattern recognition with a computed reaction (with Information Theory to explain how it is detected information incepting a function/behavior. Or what I call Cellular Oscillating Tomography
