# ChatGPT 4 Summary: 

Memory training using mnemonic techniques can help people of all ages improve their memory, barring any physiological impediments like Alzheimer's.

# ChatGPT 4 Key Points:

Memory training with mnemonic techniques can benefit people in their 60s and 70s.

The method of loci is a useful memory-enhancing technique.

Physiological impediments like Alzheimer's disease can limit memory improvement.

Attention deficit disorder and Alzheimer's both involve the prefrontal cortex, but they are not directly related.

Nootropics might help people with attention deficits but may not benefit high-performing individuals.

Protein synthesis is one model of memory formation, but no known chemicals can directly improve it.

There are different types of memory: sensory, short-term, long-term, episodic, and procedural.

# Whisper Transcription:

And memory training can help a big deal, and many people in their 60s and 70s can be better

than they ever were, literally, if they just used their brain correctly, using, for example,

mnemonic techniques.

Does that answer your question, mate?

Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mesa.

If I could sum that up.

What you're saying, Boris, is that it doesn't matter how old you are, if you use the method

of loci, it can confer some benefits, as long as there's not a physiological impediment

such as amyloid plaques that you see from Alzheimer's.

Is that correct?

That's correct.

I see I used way too many words.

Oh, no, sorry.

I love it.

I love it.

I love your sense of humor.

I'm all for that.

Hey, I just want to say, I love the people in this room, so many incredibly great questions

I've benefited from everyone's question.

Thank you so much.

We are now going to go to Fahad.

Micah, enjoy.

Go ahead if you have a question or a comment.

I totally have some quick questions.

I could send to Dr. Conrad.

It's Micah.

This is Micah here.

Yes, I can hear you.

Go ahead.

Thanks.

All right.

So I have a few rapid-fire questions.

One is, what about the possibility of, because I've heard that attention deficit disorder,

sometimes there's less blood activity in the frontal cortex or the prefrontal cortex,

or part of the brain, and frontal lobes.

What I meant is, I've also heard that it's been compared to Alzheimer's in terms of Alzheimer's

and ADD or ADHD, are both memory disorders.

I've also heard that creatine, there's some studies that say creatine can improve memory

and blood flow, and then some people are saying if you get like a 40 hertz vibration plate,

that can improve your blood flow and perhaps your memory.

So I wanted your feedback on that.

I don't know if you need to write this down because it's a lot to remember, but what about

also new tropics?

And there was a study that came out about Alzheimer's that said that new protein synthesis,

animals treated with the chemical to induce more new protein synthesis, were able to recover

some of their memory.

So I'm curious about, are there chemicals that we can use that can improve our protein synthesis

to improve our long-term memories?

And probably the last question is, are there really like lots of different types of memory

because I think it's like episodic memory and all these other types of memory.

I think you have long-term potentiation, long-term potentiation, and you have long-term depression

and you have short-term memory, which is the activity of neural circuits.

And I think that's about it.

And the rest is like, I don't know, maybe it's just ideas.

Anyway, those are my questions.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

This is a question I started using memory technique to remember your question, but that's fair.

Since we're so many, I'll try to answer all of them briefly.

So you started, and I'm writing this ADHD at Alzheimer's.

So just because they have a big role, the prefront cortex has a big role in both of these,

doesn't necessarily mean they are related.

So yeah, as you mentioned, prefrontal cortex is where we think memory, strategic planning happens,

memory has a seed in a way, it's always networked across the whole brain, but therefore different diseases

that affect your attention as well as your memory have effects in there or the other way around.

If you see damages or issues with prefrontal cortex, it's not surprising that different memory

or focused functions might be effective, but there's no link so far between these two diseases.

So I mean, two studies didn't found, for example, people with ADHD developing Alzheimer's more often than others.

So I hope that answers this part.

In terms of creatine and neurodutch show, this is something I'm not too confident with to really give a good answer on that.

So it certainly interacts with each other, but I'm not aware of any studies looking into creatine supplementation

or any memory processes.

At least you asked about other new tropics as well.

I did a study which I found really interesting, together with C. Chavitay in Berlin,

one of the biggest clinics we have in Germany, where they looked into various forms,

we together looked into various forms of cognitive enhancement, and they looked into the pharmacological side.

You see, actually, that any new tropic or any pharmacological memory treatment could take would be purely training-based strategy.

Often, in new tropics, we found that they help only those begin with deficit.

So high performance typically do not tend to benefit even from things like insulin.

If you start from some form of attention deficit, which might be ADHD,

or might not be diagnosed with ADHD, but might be there,

effects do show up, but in high performance, they are irrelevant at best, if not even harmful.

Therefore, I'm not also aware of anything that might directly help protein synthesis.

To my knowledge, I think protein synthesis theory is just like one model of memory formation.

This is multi-molecular science, I'm also more following as an interested reader, I'm doing myself,

so I will need to keep it short here, but I'm not aware of anything we could do, sorry.

Yes, I'm really sure there are different memories, at least a few more, as you mentioned.

So long-term potentiations will be more termed, coming from consolidation,

from how memory is changing, persistent, or not persistent over time,

but it doesn't mean there are not different forms of memory.

So on the time scale, there are just three.

I would say there is sensory memory, there are short-term memory, and there is long-term memory.

But it's just the time scale, and if you look more closely into long-term memory,

for example, you'll see by people who have hippocampal lesions,

that they have full loss of the lesions, really strong, in forming episodic memories,

but they can still form procedural memories.

There's this extremely famous case of patient HM, where a surgeon decided to remove his hippocampi

due to an epilepsy, and they couldn't form any new long-term memories

in terms of autobiographical memory anymore.

But they could still learn movements, such as hitting a golf ball,

which shows that different forms of memory are actually different memory systems.

Fantastic, I like it.

That was more questions than one, and we are going to end on the hour,

and we still have yet to get to our memory challenge,

where we are actually, I am going to give Dr. Conrad a list of 30 mostly single-digit numbers

to memorize and see and put his method of loci to the test.

So for that, we are going to try to, I'm going to ask that if we can just limit our questions

to one question quickly so we can get through everyone's question and then to the exciting demo.

So, Joy Hussain, Ramsey are next, and Bruce Alex...
