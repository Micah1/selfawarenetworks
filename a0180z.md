Action to Perception
is an arguement for
emboddied cognition
could be essential for creating self-aware perception

arguing that conscious awareness depends on action, introspection, the journey of the ego to consider different scenarios

but the point is that self-awareness might build itself by exploring itself in a literal series of action steps.

then for waking self consciousness a further step is a perceptual cycle or a four dimensional summary of all perspectives. (temporal oscillations  uniting the data from cortical columns into a movie)
