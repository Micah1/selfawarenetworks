(conjecture, semantic) my conjecture, that I will argue later on in the year, is that a self-aware neural network can be built on a raspberry pi pico, capable of running a Terminator from the movie terminator 2, although on the Pi with fewer parameters than what the human brain has

but no there is still the case of 4D Semantic Segmentation which requires more power

one would need at least two neurons, or two neural networks.
