Scale

I think I can write this software. Because the representation of neurons are of what signal and neuron represents at a given point in time and that the signal that it represents and get important in time is was going to be passing on to to its array. And that array is going to be passing that on to the next array.

00:41

And so patterns that fire in the next array represent a sort of chunk up pat chunk up pattern because the the pattern was sort of like

01:11

And allies to, to a great, a certain granularity of detail, and then magnified sort of our. You could also think of that as like brought into into larger scale focus. So you want to padding moves for to the second layer everything magnifies it goes into a larger scale and we get to magic scale patterns, okay.

01:47

And then so there's three scales of patterns. There's microscope patterns as a scale patterns, and macroscale patterns, okay?

02:06

That that technically everything in between as well. Technically everything in between. But I just wanted to paint the sort of scope of the ranch you can sort of understand the range and so it's like there's micro there's mega scale, there's macroscale patterns and then there's everything in between and so you have

02:42

The large scale features would be like, different places that you can go to different locations, different cities, different buildings inside different cities, because there are large scale, information, configurations, and macroscale and mesos. Gas stuff where you are relative to some particular facility. That's micro scale information, right here. So that the activity is, is your, your life in the moment perspective.

03:15

It's based on your senses. That change is really fast. So that's microscale activity because has to change really fast and the stuff that is rendered by it. Like so, imagine that you're your brain is sort of like

03:37

Also divided into microscale, microscale, and measure the scale graph. And so, you can

03:54

So you can, you can basically say that you have

04:25

You can almost you can say like if you match your you can say like the adder, the adder part of your neocortex, six later like that, maybe like where you would represent that macro scale, it's in the slower up but the higher syllable of the highest layer, the six layer.

04:45

So you have more that you can go to the from the parameter cells to the intern neurons, to the thalamus and get to the thalamatic radios. Things through about like the delta frequency, right? It's a much slower frequency. The top of the court six layer and it moves more slowly.

05:12

It's lower frequency, higher amplitude. And I think of it, as more of the observer of macroscale patterns time, and then I think a

05:32

I think you're gonna have this like gradient towards the center of the brain where you're gonna have like theta is going to be a little bit lower than delta. And we're gonna have alpha and then paid out. And then so we have the game on and high amount cetera.

05:56

So but it's interesting that there are gamma whereas there's so there's like a low 40 hertz camera and the Delta frequency rates it shows up. It's very interesting that it doesn't. So, but I would say that I would suspect that the the high frequency

06:28

Camera happens, the most often in the alpha. And in the first layer of cortex in the nearthe thalamus near the bottom of the syllabus, are the incoming services, and you're gonna have a lot of ways down there. And then maybe the high phasic highest tragic gamma burst. So I don't know if I don't know for sure if that's right.

07:04

But just a hypothesis it's gonna be like this rate is like the frequency gets reduced over time, but the amplitude grows up and that means that the the sixth layer is like the observer. And are they like the? It's like the that's where the it's like it's like when you look around the world imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull a little bit.

07:48

All right. It's stuff in the bat like in the background and the distance that the macro scale like the horizon and yeah, it's like the bridge is in the distance. That's that's like the in the sky. That's the macro scale the sky and the land. That's the macroscare, the scene, the background right and then the stuff in the middle is like there's a building, there's the city.

08:16

There's the people, this is the mezzo scale, right? And then down, of course, the microscale is down where the bugs are or even more micro than that, right? The man up. There's the nails. Yeah, so you can add the quantum scale and get our anterior. But it's it's it's just really kind of like interesting you think that I have a specific sense of scale, right?

08:55

All right, like this planet looks like it's huge but that's just my sense of scale, right? So like this sense of stylist just a perspective.
