(oscillat, graph) The human mind is like order that arises out of chaos. It's structure is encoded in coincidence patterns, that represent the holographic property of a representation of reality that your brain is making. As your thoughts cycle throughout the brain, with different parts of the brain playing back different parts of the pattern of you.

Pointclouds of disintegrating trinity.

So this idea is to create a video montage of trinity melting with pictures of the VR Industry, Otoy, Meta,

I realized that I do have choice. A choice that is caused by natural selection happening because of the physics of my brain chemistry interacting with spacetime.

The Computer Graphics Industry is changing film, videogames, vr, ar, with AI in amazing ways.

Everyone's brain is capable of having a medical emergency that results in extreme behavior dysfunction. Imagine that with new insights into brain function, new brain computer interface technologies, and new software we could merge the medical and justice systems into one system.

What if Electricity Magnetism had an arrow, a forward or backward pointing direction

it does when using a powerline

but what if the direction embodies how a particle spin is defined as a forward or backward (up down) direction

it also makes you ask of the electrons in a wire are all facing the same direction, all top or all down?

I guess alternately both right? like the up electron waves are facing a different direction in terms of  every other wave oscillation.

so the up are perhaps segrating with ups and downs with downs?

Can we have a thought experiment where we think of Gravity as a reverse pressure gradient? Why or why not, only instead of pressure we are talking about the effects of spactime warping at the Quantum & Molecular scales, with aggregate effects from dense matter convergence such as with Fermionic Condensates. Lets create a computer simulation to model the shape of space time with a dynamic time gradient at the quantum scale, as mass converges and space expands as a unified process.

Lets consider, as a thought experiment only, how gravity as a Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation is akin to reverse pressurizing the spacetime field, and imagine how depressuring time cause the movement of particles towards the deflationary point, like gas escaping a balloon.

Imagine that additional time frames, or a greater surface area of time near a mass is like poking holes in balloon that is an interval of time, the holes in the interval of time are more intervals of time, or time frames.

Think about the words entropy, and equilibrium.

Imagine, as a thought experiment, that higher frequency spacetime (further away from heavy Mass) corresponds with the narrowing of time area magnitude, while lower frequency spacetime (closer to heavy Mass) corresponse with broadening time area magnitude. 

Lets consider how gravity as an expansion of time frames at the quantum scale (Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory) may change the trajectories of movement in spacetime. This idea proposes that while two spaces may look the same in one moment, in the 4th dimension an area closer to mass has an additional surface area that only exists in time, and this changes the trajectory of a particle
