"GERALD EDELMANâ€™S STEPS TOWARD A CONSCIOUS ARTIFACT"

"In a series of books, Edelman described his theory of consciousness, which was based on the TNGS [4, 5]. A key to
this theory, as enumerated in some of his later publications, was the concept of a Dynamic Core [6]. The Dynamic Core
was essentially reentrant signalling between the thalamus and the neocortex. The dynamics of the Dynamic Core were
necessary to produce conscious thought or higher order consciousness."

"At the time of the meeting, researchers at the NSI were developing extremely detailed computational models of the
thalamus and neocortex. These models showed sleep wake cycles, as well as other other brain rhythms observed during
conscious thought [7, 8]. In one such model, Eugene Izhikevich and Gerald Edelman were able to show the formation
of neuronal groups due to plasticity and dynamic neuronal activity [9]."
