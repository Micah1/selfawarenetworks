I wrote this (for Neo Mind Cycle originally)
An information pattern is non-physical because its a configuration of something physical, the configuration itself has no essential mass, energy, or velocity, the information pattern is like a function in a computer program, and the substrate that contains it is like the argument in a computer program. The physical argument is variable, the information pattern is invariable. Cells can detect patterns by firing at a high Gamma frequency ONLY when a specific pattern is recognized via a multiple possible path of near simultaneous presynaptic neuron firings within about 3 milliseconds of one another resulting in the recognition of a pattern via a phasic soliton wave that will cycle through a neural circuit being recognized by other parts of the brain doing pattern recognition.
