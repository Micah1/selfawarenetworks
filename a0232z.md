depression, ATP, Brainwave, slow brainwaves will generate less ATP, and diseased mitochondria will generate less ATP, so feeling bad could be an early warning sign for depression, and inflammation could be a sign of mitochondrial damage
slow learning also from depression because
this is because the rate of firing, and resetting after firing is intimately connected with mitochondrial production of ATP
