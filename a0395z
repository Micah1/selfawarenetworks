Consider this statement:
"Lanza says that we carry space and time around with us “like turtles with shells.” meaning that when the shell comes off (space and time), we still exist."

If space and time is a shell that a consciousness carries around, then why do people have gaps in their memories, why do people have black outs, why do people fall asleep and lose consciousness? If consciousness was independent of spacetime wouldn't it be conscious all the time even when the body was sleeping?

If you like the idea of a biological soul, I read this compelling book earlier this year or last year, its interesting http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Dust-The-Magic.../dp/0691156379

Soul Dust: The Magic of Consciousness

How is consciousness possible? What biological purpose does it serve? And why do...

I have also read "The man who mistook his wife for a coat rack" by Oliver Sacks, and "Incognito" by David Eagleman, and I have read numerous papers on split brain patients. The problem is that when a scalpel or a drug, or disease, or prolonged malnutrition, or extreme trauma can change your personality, change who you are, split you into two souls, one in the left hemisphere, one in the right hemisphere, well then it starts to look like the soul is not independent of spacetime.

In ancient times the atomists argued that everything was made out of atoms, not spirits, and the people who believed in spirits murdered the atomists to shut them up. but the collective cognitive trends that are trying to unite the atomic idea with the spiritual idea are forever trying to suppress and not think about certain contrary evidence, that can't be refuted, only ignored, buried, murdered, banished.

I said before I don't believe people exist, rather there are cognitive trends doing this. Trying to capture new mindshare, like memes, like bugs taking over human brains.

thanks for your input, im going to check those out. i mean our bodies and even our brains are tools of our consciousness. without conscious perspective would the objects we associate with the physical reality still appear as they do, with consideration of the effects of an observer in quantum physics, or more so as just a network (considering all energy in the universe and varying densities across space time) of indistinct states of (overlapping?) superpositions of infinite possibilities? which really is what the universe/multiverse really is composed, and assuming such a quantum network existed and our spirits and awareness are resultant of quantum interactions occurring within microtubules in neural cells of the pituitary gland and temporal pituitary junction, with conscious information interpreted as vibrations and quantum interaction between the system of subatomic particles existing inside our neurons and those of the outside physical world as well as the bioelectrical, biochemical etc interactions, encoded as information

i do not believe that it is completely independent of spacetime, more like symbiotic, maybe in those periods the consciousness/subconscious is simply not deriving experience from any outside physical stimuli, and any perspective that bases their reality on physical events will be less likely to take information from metaphysical experience, perhaps causing lack of awareness. or perhaps black outs etc are caused by the existing connection between brain body mind and soul, and so any trauma to the body causes trauma to the collective system possibly resulting in temporary loss of consciousness

1. On the observer effect. I don't think it means what some people think it means. It means that measuring quantum events interferes with quantum events. It does not mean people have souls. It does not mean consciousness has primacy over existence. It does mean the observer is creating spacetime.

2. Pineal glands are glands, they do what glands do, nothing else. The evidence that that the pineal gland has magical properties that imbue the brain with consciousness does not exist, even the idea that the pineal secretes dmt does not exist. The evidence that people claim exists for the Pineal Gland's magical properties also does not really exist. I tried to trace it down, to the hard research papers, it's not credible science. It's so awful when people I respect with brilliant minds fall for the whole story that the pineal gland is your third eye crap. If you just study more of the criticism of it, you can find on the web, you can rid yourself of this cognitive waste.

3. the realm of quantum physics can induce random electrical changes at the level of microtubules and synapses, but that's it, it's just random noise. It adds an element of chance, meaning more noise, that your synaptic activity must overcome to adapt and perceive. If the soul is communicating through random quantum fluctuations it's just interfering and being defeated by the brains systems on a regular basis.

Micah Blumberg I see the brain like a movie that is watching itself. It's a ten thousand frame per second movie, it picks up new frames from the outside world, and adds them to the frames it already has, it does this to plan movements, reactions, patterns that result in nutrient rewards, or neurotransmitter rewards, serving the mechanism of replication via natural selection.

Micah Blumberg I don't think there is such a thing as quantum soul because I think the quantum realm is just random noise. It's not orderly sounds, it's not messages, it's not doing anything interesting, it's just what it is. So what we think is the soul is just this strange loop (Reference Douglas Hofstadler) of cognitive songs with many layers tempo-spatial expressions. The brain is more like a piano, the neurons more like piano keys.
