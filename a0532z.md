(LTP, neuron)

I think that if LTP memories are electro-chemical tempo-spatial rhythms based on protein calibrated axon potential discharges, then adult neurogenesis would either have to replace old memories OR the new neurons would have to be genetic replica's of expired neurons. Is it possible, does it happen? Is LTP transferred from old neurons to new neurons via dna?
