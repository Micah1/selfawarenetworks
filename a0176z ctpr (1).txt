I've written the books conclusion, intro, scope, three major sections, 20+ parts to each major sections & now a closing chapter. Lot of work to do. The book is coming together YES! I am so proud of this work. I can't wait to share it with you! #share #work #proud #milestone

I am not finding myself in need of inventing new math. Existing math with some new concepts.

What I am keeping from everyone right now is the name of a particular book and the name of a mathmatician. However there are many important equations in different areas of math that will be brought up.

Thank you actually now would be a good time for me to write something outlining all the math that I intend to reference, where, and why.

I am going to be fusing a lot of different areas of math & science together actually, and the book will just be the start of a big global conversation I think. There is a lot to figure out after the book comes out, but for brand new goal posts.

My book illustrates a novel & new hypothesis that aims to solve the hard problem of consciousness in exacting detail without hand waving away essential parts of the description like all other books on brain. Math has to be involved. That's only 1/3 of the book.

Yeah I talk about Hameroff's work not to dismiss it, but with what I consider to be a hot take on his ideas, to spin them in a different way.

It's interesting because solving the hard problem is just the beginning, what do you do next after you solve it, that's where part 2, and part 3 come in.
