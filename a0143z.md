Neural Functional Isomorphic Tomography through Sequences of Oscillating Arrays of tonically synching with Resonating high frequency Phasic Signal Energy Dissipation, triggering large scale inhibitor patterns, that all the tonically firing neurons notice because their growth rate has been slowed in phase relative to other neurons that are firing in that same interval that they were inhibited, this includes decoherene patterns created by neurons that alternately oscillating in a splay state that decoheres the space between these neurons, dendritic spines fall apart, and the energy that was going to them is at the same time shift to a point in the configuration space of the neurons cell membrane that intersects with another neurons simultaneous firing somewhere else in the brain resulting in the growth of dendritic spines from that point in the cells membrane, the transformation efficiency function via scultping spacetime with decoherence patterns and the changes to spacetime are read by other layers of oscillating arrays in the brain which then repeat the cycle.

Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

The brain is finding the most efficient way to accurately represent the information that it needs to itself for the navigation of goals overtime

I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.

So the machine I am proposing has three parts that can work independently or together, it the first part of the machine is a mechanical brain, an intelligent sentient phenomenally conscious brain, with human equivalent or better internal representations aka qualia, that is human level, that can optionally be connected to the human mind to facilitate lucid dream states with virtual reality programming, so it can program your dreams to be virtual reality games essentially, and this maximizes the graphical rendering performance of your brain, you will have the most amazing experiences that you will remember when you awake. Independent developers can create and sell experiences that you can download into your dreams. You can optionally use it to have Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality experiences via direct brain stimulation when your brain is networked to the artificial brain. You can extend your mind into it, merge with its mind, you can use it to link your mind to other humans such as is described in the book trilogy Nexus, you can use it to play VR or AR games.

This machine can also operate any type of vehicle, with any number of parts such as wheels or blades for air land sea and space travel

The book covers the optional warp drive component of the  machine which requires the machines intelligence in order to operate its functions

It covers self driving personal electric vehicles, some of them with AI arms and exoskeletons and super human movement capabilities that can protect human riders in almost all situations, and so everyone will ride self driving electric unicycles that are maximally energy efficient, and the robot will hold you, protect you from all angles, and it will drive the vehicle by shifting its weight and your weight as you navigate, it can also be a co-rider for when you want to drive, so that its learning to predict how you drive the machine, and its only going to take over when it predicts that you are about to have a collision and aren't aware of it and are not reacting fast enough, at that point it will utilizes super human gymnastics to get you to safety avoiding all collisions with mindbogglingly awesome highspeed maneuvers.

so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23

so the quantum dynamics of delta waves is its phase space is encoding multi dimensional topological patterns over time encoded in phase changes across the grid of the brains 3D neural network

its representing patterns that ricohet across the entire brain at multiple scales with multiple modalities, but it allows any of the modalities to become in focus at any scale because the higher scale of patterns in higher level sensory arrays magnify patterns with incraesing temporal area at each jump in scale, so the pyramidal cells represent a larger surface area for noticing larger scale patterns and rendering larger scale patterns that recordinate activity at lower scales

okay so the receptive fields of the boids should be that the first row of boids onlyu sees incomingh

incoming sensory data, the one I saw had it moving toards the source, each boid mov3ed toward

but as a network they did not dissipate firing patterns or inhibit each other
a neural net network in webxr
a neural network in webxr

it could be visual, in which each row of boids plots a path and a color that reacts to the incoming sensor pattern or input pattern

this input could be the first row
another set aof boids does not see the incoming signals, but instead it only sees signals from the first aray

so the first array becomes the screen which isa representation of the sensory activty to another sensory array which is 2n layer of neurons


it iis interesting to note that each modality leaves a detectable short term pattern in its scale of the phase field, and each modality affects LTD and LTP long term memory and long term forgetting

so essence the brain is rendered in these five modalities

but the sixth modality might be quantum signal transmission and quantum signal detection, and this is interesting

at the quantum scale the frequency is higher, but the amplitude is less, and perhaps this allows the brain to infer patterns from smell, and patterns from sparse quantum clouds that could represent emotion

but in essence the quantum phase field needs a way of sending, receiving, transmitting, detecting, observing and watching quantum scale patterns.

One vehicle of that could be that the topology of neurons is causing patterns to scale down to coherence and decoherence patterns in the lattice of the microtubule (remember the paper Orchestrated Orch Or)  and the scaling is like how the ear canal scales large audio patterns down to small audio patterns because of its topology

microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.
