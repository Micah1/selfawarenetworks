(audio notes transcription needs fixing)

The most important note, in my set of hundreds of notes, might be audio note b0004, ironically the text transcription is broken & the entire thing needs re-writing but it is just barely clear enough at the moment to revolutionize neuroscience & machine learning. Coming June 17th

# The biggest failure in the entire history of neuroscience is that we have been using the term amplitude instead of the term magnitude to model the action potential.
reference note a0221z.md on synaptic unreliability and search all the notes in this repo for magnitude specially in the context of magnitude in note a0089z.md which explains that a neuron passes its magnitude not through amplitude, but through duration, which scales up or down the number of vesicle sacks released between 0-4 with each firing of the APsyn

So add this to my to my book. And I know how artificial neural networks and how real 3D human neural Networks work. And I know the difference is between the two. Human beings are essentially organic robots.

The activity of retrieving the memory strengthens it. 

in the retrieval of a memory new proteins synthesis happens,

not just in the creation of a memory and most of you will remember because the process of retrieving, the memory, strengthens the memory,
# (((CITE new protein synthesis for memory retrieval study)))

Long Term Potentiation has long been associated with new protein synthesis, and usually when I have read about that concept I thought that perhaps protein synthesis makes sense in the creation of new memories, but how weird is the idea the protein synthesis is also required for the retrieval of old memories? it seems that in case of Alzheimer's Disease it has been established that protein synthesis is impaired, and that by restoring protein synthesis some memory function is restored.

My conjecture about why LTP Long term memory can form immediately without seeing new protein synthesis is because essentially the same memory oscillates repeatedly in neural firing activity until a new neural pattern replaces it. Also that the oscillating activity helps drive & direct the growth of new synaptic changes (growth and or atrophy of spines).
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12436-7/

all of the memory consists of the tempo spatial sequence that the entire oscillating group has learned and then any of the neurons in that oscillation can detect some variant of that memory & play it back.

01:33
Because they are.

01:39
Any of the neurons in that oscillation that have learned a variation of that pattern can be play it back that pattern.

But there's going to be, I think, because the pattern was learned by all of them, but it scaled, it started scaling up from the first neuron that fired in that group of oscillating neurons before. eventually interfacing with the rest of the neurons in that oscillation, and then with the rest of the oscillating groups in the brain, but in a progressively scaled up away with distance, like the ripple from a stone tossed into a pond growing with scale as it dissipates away from the origin point of the action potential that originally fired representing the original memory at the synaptic/neuron level scaled up to the rest of the brain.

This explains how a visual signal could ripple from the eyes to the thalamus to V1, V2, V3, V4 and then to the Thalamus and back in a loop, signals can ripple all over, but the concept of off-manifold coding (or oscillating sparse distributed representation) provides a viewpoint on how the whole brain could handle so many different types of sensory data flashing all over it like I am proposing (that memories ripple across the brain)

So that we would so that you have the recognition of patterns of different scales

At the point that a pattern occurs. It's at the level of a single neuron firing and then as it scales to the local circuit, it's scales Again, it's basically repeated again and the cortical column and then repeat it again on a larger scale, and then repeat it again, you know, by the, by the whole brain, but it's sort of like because its a signal

02:57
It's a signal that's represented by a combination of of frequent frequency and time-based codes.

Frequencey and time-based codes that had that create phase changes different  to the existing oscillation pattern.



And the phase changes changed the phase pattern. So every so So every time I signal is received, it changes, what was there?

It is inevitable that one tiny neuron firing eventually changes the entire oscillation of the entire brain because that is what the physics of oscillation tells us happens if you understand the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. Every oscillation entity knocks on everything other oscillating entity if it has the physical means to do so.

03:38
it changes the previous pattern that was it was repeating and then here again and that's how the brain is combining. What was previously learned with what's with? What's new is because the brain is essentially repeating and oscillation pattern that was that was the tape of the previous learnings, right?

04:07
And then those collide with this sensory inputs: ie the new learnings

and those changes the changes to the old learning embodied in the old oscillations are how the system absorbs reality in a collective way that is tracked from both the individual scale (of a memory stored in synapses) to the collective scale (of the cortical colummn or the oscillating group) and this is the path of conscious recognition from a micro memory pattern stored in synaptic connections to a macro patterns that the whole brain is engaged with. This is the key to multi-scale information pattern learning & pattern recall.

04:38
The recognition that parents have multiple scales, like, it's like, I don't know. I've I think of the Alice in Wonderland when she tries the shrooms and she like, has a spatial disassociation and I've I felt on occasion sort of like, I can't figure out what's bigger is my head bigger or like, you know, how you ever had like, you feel like, if you're really huge inside your head or on, or maybe you're really small inside your head, like you play with play with size and dimension and imagine that, you know, all of a sudden like the entire universes like filled with your head. (or the entire universe fits inside your head)

05:19
or play with the idea that it's it's your head is really tall and tiny and the whole universe. Like you can feel whoever's we had effect this little tiny dot it's like so freaking tiny that I think you like this entire solar system is super tiny and so you're like this ultra tiny thing and because you're at the scale of the whole cosmos and you're imagining the whole visible cosmos down.

05:49
It's like so freaking time and there's so much like around it. Right? I finish. It's like a year plus. I'm just playing this scale, like take that area and shrink that down.

06:05
And then take that area, make sure that so take the area, that's the size of the whole university, you can imagine and shrink it down to the size of a marble here, again.

06:48
So imagine that the neuron is a megaphone with a microphone microphone for listening.
So you have all this the listening to whole bunch of different things (with the dendritic branches), but then condensing everything that it's listening to into the into the frequency and duration of the action potential. But then magnifying out like a speaker (the exit terminal or the post synaptic branches)

07:18
The neuron is magnifying its signal out,
# *search the notes in this repo for 'magnify & inhibition' specifically in note a0129z.md , a single neuron that fires magnifies its stored memory pattern by inhibiting many nearby neurons, I realized this concept by connecting the discussion of neurons inhibiting nearby neurons in Numenta's work, "A Thousand Brains & On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkings, and papers from Numenta" with the discussion of a photocopier being a magnifier in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz"

the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections

# *(search my notes on information theory (SEE NOTE a0621z.md on "Information Theory"))

So it can fire with different features, right?

8:06
But it's but it's only going to but it's not going to contain the whole feature. Like basically, the feature is contained in a network and the network is triggered when a certain sequence happens, right? So it's this like the memory is stored. Hit the micro scale at the individual neuron, right.

08:30
But it's only deduced by the tomographic reconstruction of the signal path,
# *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

triggered by the memory in that neuron. So with that neuron its going to trigger, right? It's going to magnify a signal to a whole group of neurons, (by inhibiting downstream neurons) And then the collective action of that group of neurons is going to represent the magnified signal of the single neuron with its connections, right?

09:02
So it's retrieving a memory from a neuron, that stores memory as it's own connections.
# * KEY: It's a specific memory in those synaptic connections because those connections are tuned to respond to specific inputs only.
And then, the, the memory is restored when all of those connections are bumped by the EXIT terminal connections of the neuron that fired in in the memory's receptive field.


So, all of the other timing (of the nearby inhibited neurons) is bumped in a way (the phase rate of the group of inhibited neurons is set by the decay rate of the neuron that fired phasically, in otherwords the duration of the action potential leaves the calcium gates open for a novel duration which causes between 0-3 vesicle sacks to release neurotransmitters which changes the timing of the larger group of nearby inhibited neurons which magnifies that memory to the oscillating group, and then to the rest of the oscillations in the brain because eventually that oscillating groups entire phase is slightly altered, which pulls on the rest of the oscillators in the brain eventually.

, EVOKES the restoration of the memory that is stored as the connections, as the learned connections, right?

09:33
So that's how our number is is restored into consciousness. But then that bump keeps on magnifying like like another part of the brain will read that bone like those neurons that or the ones that fired, right? So there's this. So the ones that fired from that seat from that learning systems, right?

*See my notes on "telescope" /c0002x.md I compare the brain to the eyeball, in that the lense of the eye, with the retina, is a fractal of the brain with the neo cortex as the retina of the brain, and patterns in the synapses scale up at micro, meso, and macro scales, when memories become the focus of our minds eye, when we are thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.

09:53
So there's another stage of a learned pattern that gets played after that, right? And so, there are subsequent problems and so it's like, yeah. So there's a sequence that gets played out at a higher level, which is multiple, which is, which is a sequence of multiple different oscillatory networks that are firing, and phase sequence, right?

10:16
So one pattern appears in this question neurons. And this the next part of that pattern appears in another brushing, your eyes and the cycle through the brain, where basically you have neurons that are that are firing and large groups that are oscillating. Sorry that are receiving bumps in large groups. And that is triggering certain other neurons to fire.

10:44
And those are creating and the sequence, the sequence that fires that's created is .

There's a firing statements that sort of represented in the network by all things that are bumped or sensed physically like the physical or sensation of of, what of the sequence set is fired.

11:21
It's felt by all the neurons that are connected to it, right?

# And that's how the brain sees its own patterns Because you have a sequence of networks that are firing that are representing larger patterns as the learned connections that are bumping. That the bumping the network in a way that is detectable because those neurons that were bumped are going to off set their phase anyway.

11:51
But now they're going to oscillate to a different to out of out of frequency,

like that group is going to oscillate and a new frequency.

And the new frequency is defined by the patterns that bumped it. And so, the patterns that are existed in microscale are magnified to the meso scale of cortical columns (hippocampus included as cortical column #1) and then the macro scale of the whole brain eventually (via the return of signals from the pyramidal cells at the top of the cortical columns to the thalamus and to other cortical columns and down the brain stem via the motor output paths.
