olfactory cortex Neurons (audio) Neurotransmitters

00:00
That's a pretty good. All right? And then I'm also like I mean, I guess it's because when you that what they're saying is when you're when people are chewing food, there's like little tiny particles that are wafing up out of the mouth and into the nose. And so you so people can smell what they're eating.

00:19
Basically some, you know, I don't know if you're, I don't usually I didn't like it. Yeah. It's like I don't really think of the fact that I'm smelling when I'm eating what I'm eating but I guess it doesn't make sense. Yes, it does. Yeah.

00:40
And commitment for testing, is, What's the mean the men for testing, the main nerd, the type, even the type of type of neurons, right? So it says that there are several types of neurons in the olfactory pole and I can go over them. So one of them is like the mitral cells and the tough to relay neurons.

01:08
The granules cells and the paragraph paraglomeular neurons and the the mint. So the mitral cells and the tough relay neurons. They form connections with the olfactory receptor neurons in the glomeruline and they receive the olfactory information and then they carry it from the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex which is the main site of processing, olfactory information.

01:39
Now, let me see where is the olfactory cortex. Wow, so I'm just like looking at, like, go like images on dot dot go, which is a search engine and I'm searching for olfactory. Chords accents showing me.

02:05
Huh. So there's a olfactory tracked, olfactory, bulb, and then there's say, and it goes backwards. And there's a lateral stria and in towards an immediate stria is closer to the center of the brain. So I like it goes a little bit from the nose back towards the center of the brain.

02:28
Quite a bit. The olfactory nerves transmit impulse to the olfactory. Cortex provides conscious awareness of smells. But my question is that, which level in the brain the mediola orphans were the right. Exactly. That's what that's just right. That's exactly what I. It is. The point of this of this group is where exactly does it connect to the rest of the brain.

02:58
So I'm actually looking at images right now to see if I can figure that out. I see the olfactory bulb, the menstrual sound the olfactory cortex. Okay. Now, I'm looking at this, so there's the prefrontal cortex and the primary olfactory cortex appears to be the prefrontal cortex it. I mean, it's not so I mean it's not.

03:21
It appears to be in the prefrontal cortex like on the very bottom of it and it's so it's right below. The the sub colossal gyrus looks like interesting. So hmm. All right. So like I look. Okay. So so we have the Also trying to create cortex because it looks like it kind of enters into the parietal and to the print prefrontal cortex.

04:01
I mean that's right. It is it doesn't enter the freeform before test and that's amazing right away. It doesn't it there's nothing to do with the has nothing to do with what the brainstem. I think I'm still trying to figure that out, but I think it goes directly to the cortex to the prefrontal cortex.

04:34
I am real, as I know that also rises from the gang aliens in the stem. Maybe different levels, but not to distribute cortex right away. Well, so so when it comes to the ganglions in your eye and the ganglions in your ear and those go to the thalamus in the brainstem first and then they go to the cortex and that's true.

05:05
Also for touch and taste, but olfactory is different. Well, factory is the unique one. So if you, if you think of yourself is having five cents is there's more than five senses, right? You have interior sense, senses as well. You know, you have sense of balance and so forth, but if you just think of your temps is, you know, taste touch site hearing.

05:25
And what's the fifth one? I forget so feeling tastes. Those are two hearing and oh yeah. So for so four and so the fifth one is olfactory. Okay. That was so silly, right? But the four of the five, right? The ones that are hearing vision feeling and tasting those ones.

05:52
Go to with that. Go to the to the thalamus first and then they go to the neocortex. But it appears that olfactory goes directly into the cortex. That's what I don't know why. Because it's, it's it's it's some, it's yeah, that's it. It's that is actually kind of what I'm trying to figure out, like I'm just actually, I wasn't even sure that it was going directly to the cortex.

06:22
And, and that's why I'm sorry. Let me see if I can just try to find more information about this. So we've got the, the neocortex, got the glamorous, I'm looking at another picture here.

06:35
Hmm.

06:46
And then yeah. So I'm like I'm wondering. Okay. So I guess. Oh and looking old factory quartets about I was talking well, okay, I searched it. They say the only exception for the premise them all the nervous arises from the premises, except for optical factory. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I said, yeah.

07:24
Say, I'm gonna see if I'm looking at this document wasn't telling me the olfactory testing. Okay. Frontal lobe or factory bulb with end up olfactory tracked and terrier commissioner temporal lobe. Ventral. I see septal area, the limbic globe on the medial aspect of the cerebral. Hemisphere the three parts of the limb globe, singular gyros.

08:02
Hmm, so the septal area cortex is very close to the prefrontal lobes. Well, also the singular genres. What is the singular diarrhea is like, it's like, you know, it's not that close but the

08:25
Yeah, so that's yes. So that the septal area cortex is the closest to the olfactory bulb of those three, infigure, three Tim translated. So, I'm seeing I'm seeing if you look up the septal area, cortex, that's SCPAL area cortex. I'm looking at that too. It's a subcortical region has strong projections to emotion generating areas and has a key role in feelings of social connectedness and bonding and rats.

08:58
Oxytocin binding in the separate area has been associated with the maternal behaviors that promote two ship bonds. Oh, that's interesting. Mmm.

09:16
The prefrontal cortex. So it's interesting. There's like there's channels. Like like if you go from the prefrontal cortex back towards the midbrain, it suggests that GABA signals are going back towards the mid-range. But what's going from the midbrain towards the prefrontal cortex would be dopamine signals. And that's really interesting, right?

09:48
The pollutant and then glutamate is traveling from the prefrontal cortex towards the basal ganglia and that so that was that would be how nicotine and opiates activate dopamine transmit transmission from the veins. Basal ganglia because the basal ganglia is going to cause the brain stem to to transmit more dopamine to the prefrontal cortex.

10:17
So, let me ask you this question, what will be the normal response to? I mean, what are the chemical neural transmitter and response to a good smell and if it differs, then the ones who for bad smell

10:40
That's an interesting idea, so you're saying that. Okay. So you're your idea is that different combinations of neurotransmitters. Would would would represent the smell. Maybe, maybe. Yes, of course. There must be like a different response to difference, please. Hmm, other, otherwise I would how to differentiate between a good smell and that's good.

11:10
Well, even between smells like every every single from the other. I mean, that's interesting. But it's, it's it's like

11:29

It seems like the like I think of like the okay. So, if you think about how like, you know, the the content that are you just you subscribe to me like, he being learning like, when sells that the for, you know, the phrase, when sells fire together. They wire together.

11:48
Yeah. You mean that some some neurons, the fire together in responsible for the stimulus and the other neurons got stimulated for different temp estimates, right?

12:11
Yeah, yeah, right. Well, no, I mean it's about the timing it's about the timing. So the idea is that if they fire within, if you have a whole bunch of neurons and two of them fire at the same time, then they form connections between each other, right? And so, is the phrase neurons?

12:30
The fire together watch together? It's like if they fly at the same time, then they form a connection and that is the sort of like the building block of memory. And so what I sort of like have been thinking and it could be incorrect, is that it doesn't matter?

12:45
It doesn't really matter what type of neurotransmitter is sent between the two neurons. All that matters is, is the fact that a signal was sent? And if two signals arrive at the same time then that's what matters, right? So if it if all that matters is that two signals arrived at the same time.

13:09
Then I I'm not sure that it matters. What type of neurotransmitter is that? So what when I'm suggesting is that if we took, I mean, what I was thinking, was that if we took out the dopamine with, with this wrench and replaced it with a settlement or gaba or glutamate or, you know, something else we, you know, then then the the signal transmission with which still happen and the brain would still function.

13:42
And this in the same patterns could be learned regardless of what neurotransmitter gets transmitted. But what you're saying does I guess I guess it should make a difference if? Yeah, I guess you're right. You, I mean, you're but you're racist argument. I think is correct. That that a different neurotransmitter is gonna have different properties, that are going to affect the perception of smells to some degree in combination with the timing.

14:17
So yeah. Okay. And actually, it's interesting. Like we have like maybe like thousands or even several thousands of different smells and you can differentiate between every one of them so we don't have like thousands of neurotransmitters. But the physiology how it works is I think it's a very big problem puzzle there.

14:48
Yeah. Well so I mean so basically what I'm thinking is that that if you had that somehow, if the type of neurotransmitter matters and then it might be because it's it's really yeah, it's really. It might be because it somehow affects the the timing of signals. Does that make sense?

15:23
The amount of some some smell. I'm just trying to think I don't know. I don't have information about that but just trying to think like if we have a combination of several neurotransmitters and you like you make like a mix with certain smell, then you make the other one another mix with the third one.

15:49
I think this is how it works.

15:56
You are making not just the transmitter, you mix the transmitter together. You get like a brand new substance and the brain. So this is how can feel it. Can perceive different smells. Hmm. See, I haven't heard of this something, I know but I'm just trying to think about it.

16:31
Okay, okay, so I asked someone a question recently about whether like sodium and like why is it? This sodium doesn't doesn't doesn't mix with calcium like so, the sodium ions sit next to the calcium ions and they sit next in the, and they sit next to, where the nerd where the neurotransmitters like a set of coline and dopamine will go.

16:57
But they don't mix together because they have different salinity. No, because both of them have as different have the same charge. Also them are positive ions. So they cannot what I mean, is like, they have to. So different say different salients. Like they have different, right? You know how like you if you look at two, oceans that have different like one ocean has like they that are not mixing like there's pictures of oceans, that are not mixing together.

17:28
Like there's two different colors, and you can tell that the water is separated in two different colors. To the two, different oceans, and they're not mixing because they're big one. Ocean has too much salt, and in the other ocean might be like very little salt, okay? So calcium and potassium posts of them are positive, ions.

17:48
So they are charged positively. They would repeal, they cannot get close to each other, they should rebel because of aesthetic, you know, positive repels positive, native representatives. But the thing is, like that's already ions stick together and those are all positive, right? And actually don't know yet. You're right.

18:15
So for some reason, like the cat, but in the, like in the brain, well people have told me is that the calcium and the sodium and the potassium, they all, they all share the same space, but they but in, they pee scientists don't see them mixing together and in the explanation that they said was because it's different.

18:36
Like, the have different different, like different savings yet. Look at that. Why I'm gonna look up on the sharing system? Why is it that neurotransmitters?

19:16
Down next, I'm just gonna see with it.

19:32
Let's mixing potassium, I'm mixing. That's settle calling and Syrian but I don't know if we want it yet. Sodium. I just want to see if like a set of volume and dopamine sequel. 
So, I do know if neurons inspired different types of neurotransmitters. It seems like they would, right?

20:02
But I wonder if it's like, if, if a synapse can like change, what kind of can have multiple kinds neurotransmitter transmission? Because that would that would be like that would be. Could you because what I'm saying? It's like if you have so if you have one synapse that is that only does dopamine

20:30
Then then it does not really any mixing that could happen in a way and if you have one synapse that only does a set of choline then there's not really mixing that happens. It's like in this usually I think that's usually what happens is you have like what it's called like dopamine dopamine neurons and you have Java neurons, you have set up holding neurons and they primarily just use dopamine and there's in.

20:56
So, for each synapse, you have one sentence like dedicated to just dopamine. And, and that would mean, there is nothing else there that could be mixing with that dopamine to achieve the smell. That's what I'm saying. I it's what I think but do in if, you know, maybe I'm incorrect with you.

21:16
Never.

21:22
Let's say maybe the difference is not the neurotransmitter, but there are different receptors.

21:35
Yeah, there are different types of acceptors. So maybe the oldest matter is one or two or three but the response will for several several smells how to differentiate between several smells may be not neurologists matter but the different type of receptors

22:16
Okay. Well, so different types of receptors. So, I mean, like, so what the receptors are doing, right? Is like, we, the receptors are like opening the, the metabolic tropic receptor gets knocked, by by a, by a neurotransmitter, like dopamine and then that opens up another receptor, right? Like in the other receptors ion receptor.

22:46
So the metabotropic receptor opens up. Opens up an ion receptor and then you have been sodium. Flood sodium, either floods into the cell or calcium does. And but that other receptor is like either. It's either going to be like a sodium receptor or calcium, receptor, or potassium receptor or a choline receptor.

23:16
And so either, you're going to have a potassium and choline coming out of this cell, or you're going to have sodium and calcium going into the cell. And then the, when the neurons that the transmit, the is right, the ions, like the sodium ions. When they fill up the, the salt to a certain amount, they create the charge, which causes the neuron to fire.

23:46
And so, the only thing that's mixing together because, because the dopamine and the acetylcholine are outside the cell in the synapse, in a dopamine synapse or in acetylcholine synapse, that those that acetylcholine is never going to mix with dopamine but what might what would could come together as you?

24:06
I guess you could have the, basically, the inside the cell and outside the cell, you have combinations of ions like 30 ions, calcium, ions, potassium, ions. And but they can't, it's kind of like there. They kind of stick to their own areas, right? But they yeah, you can get a bunch of different kind of.

24:31
You can get a mix of neurotransmitters inside a cell with the the main thing that matters is that they add up to the cells threshold and then the the the action potential event gets it's fired.

24:51
Comparing to the taste buds and the tank. Every part in the tank can only can only receive response. Like some parts. Kills can taste, salty other parts can test. Read other parts can test better. I suggest that maybe the factory nerve receptors works the same way make

25:32
I'm not sure, I'm not sure. Exactly. Because you said something like the tongue can taste different things, right? And then you sort of like well, maybe the nose works the same way, right? Is that kind of what you said or was? It was really different? I think this is it.

25:47
Yeah, that's what they said, but it's not according to knowledge. It's just according to thinking, try to think what's happening. Yeah. It's, it's okay. So you just okay. And then by the way, someone is someone else came into the room and should reinvite, but last name is Salinas. It's in right.

26:13
This gentleman to speak with us.

26:21
You're welcome to come up and join us. We like it's more of a, more of a, we don't really have a presentation, it's more of just, we're just trying to figure out how the olfactory bowl is connected to the olfactory cortex and how those signals travel through the prefrontal cortex, and the network of the brain.

26:46
And so if you know then you can help us figure out how it's connected and how they can how like I'm interested is like what is the path basically of? What is the narrow pathway? No pathways of the whole factory cortex. Well factory pathway inner. Let's see.

27:25
Sensations perceived by the body are organized into two. Major groups general sensations such as touch pressure, pain, temperature and special, sensations, such as vision, hearing tastes, and smell sense of body position and movement. The olfactory nerve is the first of 12 cranial nerves. And one of the few cranial nerves that carries special sensory information.

27:53
Only. In this case, the olfactory nerve is responsible for our sense of smell it originates in the epithelium of the nasal cavity. It's transported to the brain via the components of the old factory nerve premium nerve one and olfactory pathway. A decreased sense of smell has been associated with Parkinson's disease, and thus can be an important clinical marker in this and other states of disease or injury.

28:25
So, to understand the olfactory nerve and it's clinical implications. This article will trace the olfactory nerve from its receptor cells from, it's this article traced to olfactory from its receptor cells, located in the nasal, epithelium to the olfactory cortex and beyond, this is exactly what we want to know.

28:44
It will highlight some of the unique characteristics of certain cells within the or factory pathway and the connection of the pathway to memory and behavior related brain regions. Excellent. Yeah. So keyfax. So a function is the census smells special since the smell, the oath factories cells. These are key facts about the olfactory nerve in pathway.

29:10
The olfactory receptor cells, they sense odor. And then contain cilia supporting cells. Basal stems basal stem cells replacing old and damaged. Olfactory receptor cells and the CN I formed out of a collection of olfactory receptors. So axons which passes through the crib reform plate and into the roof of the nasal cavity.

29:36
It's the relay station of the olfactory pathway and contains olfactory blah. It's made up of axons and and of the axons of mitral relay neurons and they are the medial and lateral divisions of okay, so that's all okay. So I am messing up a little bit. So So okay, so the idea is that we have, we have this list of functions.

30:05
So, the old factory cells, the whole factory nerve though, battery bulb, the factory tracked, no factories industria, low factory cortex in a factory destination or the output destination, so with which is basically the whole factory destination. So that's the orbital from your cortex. I wanted to viewing one study about the retract and the anatomy and physical physiology they say yes that there are different groups of 45 researchers and the earth is the reputed along to the mucosal moons, the of the nose and and along the action of the nerve.

30:51
So they are different groups that not, everyone of them is simulated by some group of others. Like one one group is still stimulated by certain group of orders and doesn't work with another order. Come through. Hmm, right. Yeah. Okay. So that so the sound at this and right, that you're going to have different types of receptors in the, in the would you like a potato and would you like me to read it?

31:37
Yeah, go ahead. Have a great. Do you hear me? Yes. Yes, I hear you fine. You guys doing good. I'll just meet myself. And and isn't right process, the group of ethical severe and better than the mucus alternate recognition and signal transition are initiated at the membranes of these chemosensory and culminate.

32:32
And excitation of the factory receptor cell, the financial activation by oderance of destiny to groups of factory receptors cells. Generates platters of neuronal activity that take to order quality and concentration identity. This primary alternate and recognition site at the very brain remained to be established. However, as a significant body of information has become available with respect to the factory constitution mechanisms, it is now becoming clear that will factory across the ocean involved with the enterplay of several seconds.

33:26
Messengers system response of these equal equivalent. Exactly sensitive keywords actually runs.

33:45
I'm done. Well, that was great. Thank you. Yeah, I'm on. I'm on a similar. I was similar page that I'm reading. I mean that I was reading. I was listening to you but yeah I'm on the same page. All you can think we used to drive like different group of receptors.

34:06
Yeah, that's stimulation of some groups, not the others iteration of the neutral. Transmitter, the make different reception. Right. So it says from the olfactory cortex that information about smell is sent to the orbital frontal cortex via the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus. So that's kind of tripping me out, okay?

34:42
Because through the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus. So so remember you said, it doesn't we had this question that, you know, it says that the the nose goes directly to the cortex somehow, but but then a kind of goes from the the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus. And then back to the the cortex again.

35:13
Right, because here's it. But no, I mean, no best way. No, no, no, it's not exactly, it's it seems, it's and I could be wrong about this, but it seems like it's saying it goes from the the olfactory cortex is part one and then it goes to the thalamus as part two, and then it goes to the orbital frontal cortex, which is on top of the olfactory cortex, right?

35:46
So it's, it's not going back to the same area. It's going to a different area when it leaves the thalamus. So this is all surprising because this is stuff. I didn't know at all, but it's seems like yes, so it's like it's it's almost like zigzagging. Like imagine a z, right?

36:07
It's got so goes from. So let's put like, okay, so imagine the front of your brain where you're closed. Maybe close to your right on top of your nose in between your eyebrows, okay. Let's say that in between your eyebrows, on top of your nose. That's where that's somewhere around there inside your skull in your brain.

36:24
That's where the, the orbital I'm sorry. That's where the olfactory cortex is and it's not it, it may like it seems like it's not connected directly to the orbital frontal cortex, which is right on top of it. It's so it's like you have a piece of the neocortex, which is separated from the neoport Texas on top of it.

36:50
Instead of one communicating directly to the other, it goes to the old brain first and then it comes back, so it's it's kind of it kind of seems like this whole factory cortex is not directly connected to the orbital front or cortex and that's sort of like what I'm actually trying to confirm right now is how those are really connected because it seems like they should be connected.

37:14
So I'm I'm that's a mystery but I mean let me look this up is I'm gonna say is the or factoring or text and acted to the orbital frontal protests

37:39
Frontal. Lobe circuits. There's a video. Oh, that's cool. And the functions of the orbital vendors.

38:03
I'm looking at a YouTube video but I'm like it's taking a long time to lose if I can fast forward it. So scenarioing, it's just it's the ventral, the orbital frontal cortex is the frontal part of the brain that connects to the magnetic cellular medial and nucleus of the thalamus.

38:31
It connects to the magnocellular, needle medial and nucleus of the felons ventral surface or yeah. Let's say it ends up on the thalamus. Okay, baby? Yeah, no. Collise pain that are other like another origin of neurons. Go to the cerebral cortex. The function of these neurons just to localize pain where to feel where is the pain is?

39:27
So there are two different functions. Feeling pain is the problems, but look at that to know. Where is the location of this pain? Is the cerebral cortex. Maybe the whole factory nerve goes this way to feel the smell and it may be this is a function of the thalamus.

39:51
But to differentiate between smells and give you like like what does it smell mean and if you like it or no. So then I mean the emotional and educational part. You felt the 
smell but you know you need to explain what the smell. Is it? Good or bad? Does it belong to a good situation or best situation?

40:20
This needs different center in the brain, not in the brain, not of the eyebalamus and cerebral cortex. Again, to like to explain. What does it mean brand? Yeah, not really. That's that's basically, I forgot I was on you, I was talking on me, I'm sorry about that. I agree that basically right, that you need your brains, to be able to connect feeling of pain in the pilot, in the sense of smell together.

40:54
So, there has to be a connection between the two level because like, it's like two different functions to, to feel or to perceive the thing. This is one to know its locations. This is two. I mean this is in the case of pain but in case of smelling to feel to to sensors the smell, this is a function.

41:22
But to really the other knowledge regardless of smell, is it good? Is it bad? Do you like it? No, it's about situation, it's the best situation, maybe dangerous situation, it needs a repair cortex again for higher processes like that.

41:45
Yeah, you know it's weird is that it looks like the the orbital frontal cortex includes the the old factory ball. So I'm confused about that. Maybe I need to look this up. Orbital in front of cortex because I'm not sure if it includes the olfactory bowl. Or I mean, I'm sure the olfactory cortex it is.

42:17
So the olfactory cortex is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes, which is involved in the cognitive processing of decision, making and not human in non-human primates it consists of the association courtesies area, 11 12 and 13 and humans. It consists of vitamin area, 10 11 in 47.

42:50
Say, so it's considered to be anatomically synonymous with the ventral medial, prefrontal cortex. So the region is distinguished due to the distinct neural connections and the distinct functions that performs. It is defined as the part of the prefrontal cortex that receives a projections from the medial dorsal, nucleus of the thalamus and then maybe that's what I need to.

43:21
Look up some medial dorsal interfaces on this and start to represent the emotion taste olfaction and reward in decision making it gets its name from its position immediately above the orbits in which the eyes are located and let's see, it's weird. It kind of get big. It's, it's always locate.

43:46
It's located closer to the eyes. And so I got its name from the eyes, so that's the orbital frontal cortex, but has nothing to do with eyes. It's just close to the ice. It's function is cognitive function. All right? Yeah, we're gonna. Yeah, made it related to decision making, right?

44:11
I'm eating myself for a second, okay? But you don't have like any information about like specific for football factory dinner.

44:24
Well, it makes me this difference. Smells it makes cognition of this meal? What does mean? If it gives you warning, if in the win whenever you have the smell, so it's dangerous creation, or cyber situation or whatever.

44:47
We just, we just say it again into this area. But then what they think this area of the higher brain functions like cognition and decision, making as you said little factory network go there. It gets the cognitive part of milk like that is sensory but pure sensory like this made itself and the cooking there is other processes related to the system.

45:29
Maybe memories may be analysis of situation if it is good or bad or warning or anything else. So you need cognition to understand what you are. Smelling spelling is one thing and the decision, when you split the thing that when you have this milk and how you understand it, and now you perceive it and act upon it's a different process.

46:09
Just it? Yeah, I'm still here. I understand what you said that that we we have different processes of you know, attention planning organization abstract thinking, multitasking and active memory that are somehow involving smell. It seems like right if this would have kind of seems like that, there's that there, the area that is managing the sensation patterns of smell is also somehow involved in and in decision, making and abstract thinking and attention.

46:47
And,

46:51
Right? That's that's that's a little bit weird but I guess, yes, but the sense of humility as a like, as a beautiful of you a beautiful function, maybe it's in the sub. It's a little.

47:17
You're thinking it's just processed in the thalamus but it's not processed in the prefrontal cortex. No. I mean, sense of the sense of smell. Yeah, it's perceived by themselves using it because the fact the other idea is related to is made on the celebrities.

47:53
Okay. Well I mean so the scientists think that the some scientists not all of them, have expressed the ideas that the salad messages just like a relay that just takes signals that it's so it's so thin and just takes signals from from a sense Oregon and connects them to the neocortex and they think of it as like a like a router, like a Cisco router, it just routes information.

48:25
Do you agree with that or do? What do you think is that? Yeah. What's I think is the synonyms is like the setups and prints. Them is like primitive function, but the higher functions are located in the separate cortex, right? It's by your you're kind of thinking that the talent is also perceiving, this smell.

48:52
It's the one who perceives a smooth. What's the celebrate cortex is the one who exemplain this month and gives the memory and gives judgment and then gives the action. Hmm. Okay yeah let's that's a pretty cool. I like that. That's a good idea of how my work so let's say that.

49:18
Okay so let's just let's just I mean describe that again in my own words, right? Question first? Yeah. Go ahead. I'm well I'm actually I'm actually going through all the different sense sensory pathways. So I'm just trying to like understand the general map of each of the sensory pathways and today I'm just sort of like looking at the olfactory.

49:42
So I'm kind of going through it kind of go through it all. Since you start with, or you started another room, I've done. I've gotten I've already gone through the visual and the auditory pathways and the, the touch, the touch pathway to the somatosensory cortex. I haven't done the tongue yet so there's only there's, there's one more.

50:09
There's I guess there's one more room to be to go on in the future which should be how the tongue connects to the save the tongue. Let me just type this out. So tongue connects to the meal cortex, because I guess I want to see actually, I heard that the I mean I had this idea that the tub connects it.

50:35
So out of sensory cortex, but I'm actually not sure. So I'm gonna look it up.

50:48
Is the

50:59
And you study in the medical field, I'm writing a book. I'm writing a book on neurophysics. Okay. Great. Yeah, so I I studied I used to I do in fact study the medical field but I'm I'm at am at the point where I'm writing a book about the brain and I'm sort of like right now I'm the reason I'm like hosting like really fine detailed and added an anatomy discussion.

51:29
I mean, this is really neuropathy. This is really a this I could actually rename the room to narrow pathway exploration and that would be the same sort of idea is the olfactory improved frontal and network connections. And because that is basically what I've been looking for is like the neural pathway.

51:51
Neuropathways of sensory information because like because like you said, like I mean I like, you know, at some point if you're gonna have the sense of pain is gonna be connected to the sense of of touch, or the sense of smell or the or site or hearing, if you want to hear, where's the pain coming from then?

52:15
There has to be a connection between these different different reasons, right? So that, yeah. So I, I'm on that page and I agree with you. When you said that I was like, yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too. I think that's the client. I think that's what everybody thinks in the field of neuroscience.

52:33
Basically, I think that you're on the same page is the rest of the field of neuroscience I think, from what I know. But but yeah so I want to see also what is the time because you brought up the timer as well. So I think you're interested too. So the tongue and let's use, maybe I'm gonna just have to type tongue to motto sensory.

53:03
See if that helps tomato sensory processing of the time. Yeah. So that is correct. The tongue actually does connect to this manifest. Your cortex connect to which nerve I'm looking at. It's it's epithelial sac filled with muscles and connective tissue. These muscles can be controlled willfully in our generally referred to as skeleton muscles or voluntary straighted muscles which are divided into intrinsic and extras that muscles and is very functions.

53:54
Wow, but like it's really interesting. It's like we have. We've basically like, you know, the the, the word,

54:08
FBSC epothelial cameras as an epidemic. Let's see this.

54:21
Just, this is actually the long paper, tongue weaknesses, as matter of sensory disturbance, following oral endotracheal exhibition, exhibition in the mouth or else industry awareness, maybe this could be. So in, or the somatic, this medicine modulation depended on the specific direction of the tongue of intrusion following these findings, they perform several studies.

54:47
Assessing the functional organization of the monkeys and cortex reported from several extended roster.

55:00
Tongue plays an important role in the functions of case functions are not only due to the tongue since we functions but also motor pumpkins strength. Oh right. So like so like as you is you like your muscles, the muscle a tongue is a muscle that's like imagines like a tiny arm in your mouth, right?

55:26
And it when it pushes food around that that you that gives you the awareness of like the pressure or the density of the food that you're eating, right? It's part of, it's part of the sensation. It's not just the taste buds. It's also like it's like when you when you when you grab something with with your hand and you try to lift it and you feel like the torque of your if you feel like how good the torque of your hand is compared to the weight of the objects and and you have that sort of sensation.

55:59
And so, the tongue is doing that, too busy. Yeah, it's not only one. No three. No. Oh until it. The frontal. Third of the tongue is the facial nerve, okay? Which is many more. But the only sensory part is the interior third of the tongue and then comes the glossopharyngeal nerve.

56:31
And then for the other parts of the buckle cavity, the Regus nerve the nerve number that. Did you know that that octopuses see from their skin like they can like their their skin is photosensitive. So it's like imagine that that that your skin basically can see like that your entire skin was basically an eyeball.

57:02
Can you same the same sense but yeah, it's cool to sense. That means like different types of light waves or not like waves, different type of waves can affect the skin. It can produce some but it's almost getting rid of the skin. Yeah but that just it's just like how some waves can betray the skin and other can make documents as possible.

57:44
The scale like ultraviolet.

57:54
I'll see. Octopus. Can see with fair skin because this skin can like change color, it can detect light and respond to it. And so it can see like whatever is whatever texture is underneath it and then it can change to match with that texture is. So the skin is, it's like, it's like this alien technology because like imagine that if you stay like, no matter what you stand next to you, you just let you just like merge into the background.

58:33
You just like you, you are like it'd be like your skin is not just an eyeball but it's an eyeball that can represent whatever's behind you. So, you look like the background, isn't that amazing? Okay. That's yeah. And that's part and like yeah. And then so octopuses can hide from everything else.

58:55
Like they can look like whatever ground is around. They can just match the color of it. And so you like you have like creatures like well they can even hide from other octopuses like that's how like it's scare the crap out of each other because like imagine like you're hanging out with your family and you could just like perfectly blend into anything and then you could surprise people that's unless lady I tried.

59:29
Yeah I it is too is the draft is to genetically drop some octopus skin on to your skin and then you maybe you can do it. And I mean well I mean I don't know, there's probably more to it but I guess that I wonder. I wonder if that could work.

59:49
Actually, the reason I, the reason I wonder, I wonder if it really matters, it's octopus has to be very thin because it doesn't have like it's not a salt. It's not like I mean I've almost heard I've heard octopuses describe as is basically like and liquid a liquid creature.

01:00:10
It doesn't have like a, like a hard skeleton like, we do so so it can kind of morph into almost any shape, not any shape, but almost, you know, it's like like a bag that can take, I can take on and like an enormous amount of flexible shapes like this.

01:00:32
Octopus has anybody? Yes, I'm saying is the fact that it's lean, the fact that it's raining fish. It's a lot of different has like I guess muscles, I think, which is very the I mean the body to of the octopus is really. It's it has no fat. It has a strong muscles.

01:01:01
It has like tough texture. There's not like a jellyfish. All right, and then welcome BA.

01:01:16
Oh, hey there. Yeah. So in case you're interested in the topic we were just like pondering some, the neuropathways of how the olfactory cortex is connected to the rest of the brain like to have the network connections are and it does look like it goes, the olfactory. Cortex goes to the thousands and then it goes to the then it goes to the orbital frontal cortex, but I'm sort of like trying to figure out, you know, why, why can't they go from the

01:02:00
The, why can't think I was travel from the or factory cortex directly to

01:02:13
To the orbital frontal cortex. Because the right next to each other picture, nice place for processing, along the way where so the olfactory cortex and the, in the is right next to on the orbital frontal projects.

01:02:34
And and but I'm wondering why signals don't travel directly from the. How would you travel? Oh, they I did come in because of the room title and it kind of carried over from the. Yeah. Yeah, when I came in and you were talking about the color changing texture changing.

01:02:58
So I back channel view a link. You got me thinking. Yeah. I forgot we can send links to your back channel. Yeah, I forgot about that. Thank you. Yeah, you sent me a link. Do you want to send this to the other person in the room too? So that so that link is chameleon inspired robot skin changes colors instantly.

01:03:20
So that's yeah. So, the octopus is basically a chameleon Yeah. Squid and octopi are and raise just like everything crazy interest. Yeah, yeah. So how so what is the right? I'm sorry to ask you about the route. Yeah, so the route from, so, the route from the. So you have the nasal cavity, right?

01:03:55
Which and then you have sensors that go from. You have you have cells that go from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bowl which is right above the nasal cavity? So the but also that it's it's really it's like I might be for some reason, I'm like searching the web and I'm not finding good answers.

01:04:24
So let me try Google because I was searching back that go. So the all factory cortex versus the orbital frontal.

01:04:43
Here we go. It's like there we go. Oh I did find a paper. Okay.

01:04:55
So, the orbital frontal cortex in the olfactory bulb volume protect distinct aspects of olfactory performance. And healthy subjects. So our recent list recent studies have shown. So I so here's my point of confusion is, I guess that the olfactory cortex is distinct from the, from the orbital frontal cortex, but in some pitch, in some pictures, they're like depicted as being in the same area.

01:05:27
Do you know what I mean? So it's it if they're just soft the other, I don't know. They I don't think you did anything that would have affected that would have caused them to leave. Unless unless they had a really like weird idea in their head which is not likely.

01:05:57
They seemed like a very ordinary person to me. So I doubt you did anything that would have caused them to just checking it. You know, I can be awkward and some, you know, don't realize what I'm doing. Yeah, I don't think so but of course we don't know because because they're not here to say anything, but I doubt it any probably not.

01:06:20
Let's see, characterizing the functional pathways of the olfactory system, by the way, if you think of someone that would be fun to invite, by the way, like, anyone is like a neuroscientist. I was like I've connected to like a thousand people on clubhouse but I forget like okay. Who is the doctor right?

01:06:44
Yeah, I'm

01:06:54
Know it really see anyone in that area. I mean, maybe any doctor or neurosurgeon? Yeah, it doesn't look like anyone that I know who's in, you know, specific to this field online rate. You know what about least the watts. She you never know what she has tucked in her hat.

01:07:20
She knows a lot of. She just has a lot of random. Yeah. Okay. Need anything like maybe at least a lot. Let me see if I have Lisa on here because she is one of these humans that just has a schmattering of crazy knowledge across the broad ranges, but she also knows a lot of people there she is.

01:07:49
Yeah. So maybe at least it doesn't people that. Yeah. So Lisa BA suggested that we summon, we requested request your company because we're trying to figure out basically the neuropathways of the census smell and how and how that, and how that connects to the brain. And one of the question is one of the questions is as how are the is about the anatomy of the no factory cortex and the orbital front of cortex because it has, I guess they're saying that the census mouth goes to your to the olfactory cortex first and then it goes to the thousands and then it goes to the orbital firm to cortex.

01:08:36
But when you look at different, a different images of the orbital frontal cortex and the olfactory cortex, they look like they're almost in the same area and so I'm trying to like see like what's what are the what are the distinct areas between the two? I mean, if the signals have to go from one area to the another area, then they should be to stay various.

01:09:03
So why is they look like they're in the same area? And I don't know. Let me just put my meet myself for a second like I'm just gonna study a link. I'm giving through a paper right now, that please get very specific. Sounds good. This is slightly comical. I you may never remember this, but there was a room little like a while back and I said something a little lines of.

01:09:33
Yeah. Well, it's spells not entirely understood and I think I didn't maybe phrase a world. Yeah, I have a lot of ideas about it. I did talk to a person that was specializing in taste and I have kind of some theories loosely around. Yeah. Changes in the more false you the Jacobson's organ and how that might relate to a whole bunch of things.

01:09:57
But yeah, the best I can suggest probably is if you wanted to map it out I would use the Nasmia from the Kovic cases, as like a controlled to see what like where the specific damage occurs basically is there. It's through the east to the epithelial thing, but the permanent loss of smells should be affecting the part of the brain that you're looking for.

01:10:21
I think it could be from what I've just, it sounds to me. Like there is some small degree of small fiber, not fully housing and I think it, this is just my, you know, like how it looks to me because I do have this progressive home. So, and I will occasionally lose certain senses from drop in and out, but it sounds to me.

01:10:53
I mean I would I would I've been guessing this whole time that there's some small amount of actual nerf fiber damage and some cases it's not too expensive for the body to repair and in some cases it's going to, you know, like they will repair with the proper supplies, right?

01:11:18
But not give us this, you know, in the continents, the signal issue or brain issues, I think it needs.

01:11:33
Okay. Lisa, what were you saying about in terms of what I should look up? Again, I want to write that down. You said search for? Just positive and just helium nitric oxide system. I think is how the damage occurs. And I'm, I would, yeah, I think of a better way to try to person it out than to look at the analyzment.

01:12:00
It's such an odd signal. And it's happened in mass and they're available. Brain scans for, you know, the great British train or whatever it was, so there's before and after covenants of people and you could probably cross reference, that was a nosy. And that would give you like a light up kind of picture of where in the brain, in particular, the damage occurs.

01:12:22
Yeah, that's probably the most helpful thing I could think of. Okay, wait a minute. Okay, well I know this one's missing brain damage. No. Don't know. Just like I don't mean I'm not going to these today information that I don't deliberately and so this is new to me but it causes brain damage.

01:12:47
Yeah. In like a majority and in those with mild illness, it's a great brain study was like, it's pretty yeah, you should look it up. I'm not at you know in your side is then but it seemed fairly humid, don't know, it's just completely new. Like I said like here's what I'm I'm hearing you know, I'm hearing individual reports.

01:13:12
You know, a lot of people that I know will you know describe their symptoms. Like I'm going through this and you know, just from listen, listen, listening to symptoms. I'm like oh okay. It sounds to me like there's some kind of small fiber nerve damage going on and it repairs, but over time.

01:13:28
No, ideally. So I had no well, we what I mean I was I was lucky enough to be in in some of the groups of folks that were we did, we did know because of

01:13:43
Really early research that was shared with a lot of people. So we we were talking that but there was there was a lot was a mystery for a long time about exactly how had that worked. And and I'm suggesting the New Zealand, nitric oxide thing on the basis of decks yet, I took that break from him deck, suggested it and then all of the treatments, I was aware of that works.

01:14:06
Actually acted on that nitric oxide system. And was that if easel and nitric oxide nasal spray early enough in the treatment. He thought you could reversion or, you know, yeah, sure.

01:14:27
I don't know if you know text please. I'm not sure. What is that day? Does being pretty knowledgeable about the brain? I think he's. Yeah. Listen by decks. Let me let me search for him. D, e x. Okay, let me send it. I just sent to an invitation and he said he, that's the nature.

01:14:47
He interviewed the nature not like cascade is a huge blaming it on but you should be able to follow the braid like these two receptor and everything to the direct part of the brain. Then give the skin right? Well, I mean, obviously the brain has a lot of blood vessels and part of the brain is exposed underneath the blood brain barrier and you know, blood vessels have the endothelial lining, right?

01:15:13
So, at least that, I mean, at before I before you pointed this side, I mean, that was, at least part of the way that we could think about the, the virus affecting the brain is, is via the blood vessels and in, especially the part of the brain. That's underneath the butt, the blood brain barrier.

01:15:36
And or not pretend part of the brain is not protected by the bloodburn politely. Very but yeah, the end of the lining of blood vessels. But I mean I guess this is is this is kind of like you have vascular and your physio. This is basically nitric oxide. It sits synthesizing.

01:15:59
The vascular endothelial and the substrate L arginine and a reaction catalyzed by the endothelial nitric oxide synthase. And this mediator influences, the function of circulating, soils, and underlying smooth muscle to contribute to the tonic, and thorough protective, and thrombopistic and vast undilator. Influence of the endothelium. And right because these two receptors are going to be involved.

01:16:29
In vasodilator influence, the dysfunction of the anethe serial nitric oxide pathway appears to contribute to the path of physiology of variety of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, atherosclusives and pre-eclampsia and 1980. First got in. So Watsky, reported the relaxation of the rabbit. My aorta in response to. So Colleen was entirely dependent on the presence of an intact and a thing of the lining of the blood vessel.

01:17:07
Yeah, my understanding is that the rest was very like that. It's entering through the nasal passage into the cavity and then stents from there. And situated symptoms. And so that's what I'm seeing. Through scenes, hit marker. I can think of. So I mean I totally get that but I'm not I'm not finding the path.

01:17:31
The narrow pathway though, because this is I'm kind of like, yes, I get that part but I like the narrow pathways from the sense of smell to the to the olfactory cortex to the thalamus, to the orbital frontal cortex and wet in. So I guess my question is is, are there any direct connections between the the olfactory cortex and the the orbital front of cortex?

01:18:07
They do not go through the thalamus. They just there's direct connections between two areas and cortex or are they like roped off? I hope that they connected and I'm like, and the other idea is that I'm thinking, it's maybe the the olfactory cortex is technically part of the orbital frontal cortex.

01:18:27
That is all another word idea that I'm having, because they're saying like the basically, like the old, the orbital front of cortex is on the under side of the prefrontal cortex. And they're also sent in another picture, they're saying that the olfactory that they're described, there's one picture that says, the orbital frontal cortex on the underside of the, of the front of the brain, the prefrontal cortex.

01:18:49
And then, there's another picture. This is the, the orbital frontal cortex is on underside of the prefrontal cortex. So like either both on the underside of the of the front of the prefrontal cortex and they're two different areas, or they're the same area and that's what driving me nuts right now.

01:19:08
I'm like what is happening are they the same area or are they two different areas? They're both like there's in and there's no article that I can find. That's addressing this which isn't driving me that I'm like, wait a second. What do I need to look up to figure this out?

01:19:21
How does it, how is the anatomy actually? Are they are they really the same piece of cortex or they different pieces? Of course, patience with wisdom imaging and human if he's on who listen WISN thinking, right? Let's see if you want to invite folks, I mean made it. So you can both advise folks and so what we've or what with them WISAM.

01:19:55
Okay? So I sent my invite but he may guys has like he's on online, okay? So oh goodness. Yeah, you know with some usually has a lot of good knowledge especially about dendrites. Hey, so yeah, you know. This is so quite the mystery way. We're talking about the receptors to the epithelium, to like the, you know, the mitral or whatever they are, right?

01:20:33
Picking it up. And it my following here or did I get lost? Wait, say it again. Okay. So nevermind, I just needed to find a diagram and figure out. If I'm picturing it, I'm kind of doing that. I'm kind of like being a stone tomorrow. Well, it's weird is it's so the old factory bulb.

01:21:03
Wait a second. Hmm it does. Look, it does look like the olfactory. Bulb is underneath the prefrontal cortex and a separate piece of tissue and then that and then that connects to PC and PC is the, let me, look at this page.

01:21:47
Yeah, because because I've been operating under the sort of idea that the okay. So what's surprising for me today is I've been operating under the idea that the, you know, they say okay so if you have so the the main the the there's several different kinds of senses but the the five that we we talk about the most are your site, you're hearing taught taste and smell, right?

01:22:15
And then you'll be interior senses as well, and you've other ways of describing sensations. I mean, those are just the five big concepts of sensations, but but it's like the idea is that you're you're vision travels to the thalamus and then to the neoport and shells from your eyes to thousands and into the vortex and that same process happens with your ears.

01:22:39
And it also that process happened is happens with your, with your sense of taste. And your sense of touch is that they, they each travel from from where they are to the, basically, to somewhere close to the center of the brain, where the thalamus is. And then they travel to the the neocortex to some spot in the neoportex and that's where the senses enter into the into the, the big part of the brain.

01:23:10
And but and then what I've been told is like, okay. So basically like the note, the olfactory doesn't do that, but now which kind of like causing me to like go ahead and never mind. I'm really sorry. So what I'm saying was with kind of causing me to become confused, is everyone has been telling me for years and I've been bleeding for for years that the whole factory doesn't, it doesn't travel even like in Busaki's book, 2006 is like in an even like like this is something I've heard.

01:23:46
I feel like I've heard this over and over from neuroscientists. And and now that's really confusing. Because what I'm looking at is is saying what the opposite of what people have been telling you all these years is that the nasal denasal pathways are going through the thalamus after all, before they go to the the prefrontal cortex.

01:24:11
And I'm like, I'm saying that right now, and I'm like, that can't be right? That's not what I've been hearing my whole life. How is it? How is this happening? And so, this is quite confusing. So, I'm really just trying to, like, sort of, like, have a better understanding of the narrow pathways from this, from the census, smell into the brain.

01:24:33
And then in, it's so smelling taste.

01:24:44
And in a sense of taste, goes to your medulla oblongata. And then up the ponds to the thalamus to the tomato sensory cortex.

01:25:03
Let's see and then let's see there's this other essay. We have remagged like a magnify this picture, so the old factory receptor. So if you go on like Google images, maybe I should share share this. Well, make sure actually. So I'm actually using my laptop and then so I'd have to send the link to myself and then I have to send it to clubhouse.

01:25:31
So this is this is a 10-way trip.

01:25:53
Okay.

01:26:05
Yeah, so everybody knows Kyle. Right. Oh, did we let we lost? We lost somebody. Okay. That's okay. It's 11 o'clock. I might my brain is half asleep and I it was least Lisa was here that was nice of Lisa to join. Yeah, she usually, yeah as expected. She has unexpected some information tucked away here.

01:26:32
Yeah, I don't know. I'm finding like good explanations for animals, I think. Yeah. What ahead, right? And humans have some of this thing.

01:26:51
For animals. All right. We need to order like a couple first. What'd you say we need to order what I was making a really bad joke about ordering humans for lab rats? It was not a good joke at all. It was not a good joke. I was like, how come the information is so much more detailed with my senator humans because they're ordering humans for I see.

So is that Zara or Zara? Welcome. And if you want to join the stage, you can I think I sent to you an invite. But if but if you want to raise your hand, also you could you can. But the the scope of the room is just basically trying to, we're trying to understand the narrow pathways between the olfactory cortex and the the prefrontal cortex and in the brain.

01:27:58
So basically the neural pathways of smell and it's kind of a discussion where we can go on the computer and look up stuff and talk about it. And we're trying to and I'm just starting to discover. So if you if you want to just come up and ask a question, it's not we don't it's not really a presentation so it's not like there's a prepared, you know, thing happening.

01:28:24
It's like well, what are you curious about? And what interests you and and then we can look, we can then everyone can look it up and sport. See, olfactory bulb.

01:28:49
Okay, let's see. Oh, here we go. This simplified diagram of primary reasons. Olfactory bold. And then this connects to the olfactory typical

01:29:07
Then it connects to the pair of chair form cortex, and entering a quartet and the hippocampus. And, and the signals also traveled to the contralateral side. So the olfacto the ill factory is going to be right above the right about the, the nose, sort of, or what? I'm sorry.

01:29:34
Not right. It's sort of like but in but right above the mouth, that's actually right. And then it's going to kind of go towards the thalamus at some point before coming backwards towards the orbital frontal lobes, which are the underside of the prefrontal cortex. And so, that's what I kind of want to understand.

01:29:59
Is can we could could we like interpret the all overall front of cortex is like as like a sort of mirror for the

01:30:14
Here's the thing is I've always been told that there's a primary sensors are the somatosensory cortex which does taste and I mean it may pause. My got here for a second and just I'm just gonna meet myself for a second and think about this here.
