A preserved note that was part of the planning for Neo Mind Cycle: The Neurofeedback Salon

(ATP, neuron) Please feel free to share interesting pictures, ideas, links, news, on any science topic, on neuroscience, on artificial intelligence, on technology, on nutrition, on something cool that your working on or thinking about or a vacation your planning. Post a picture of a beautiful island you want to visit. What are your hopes, dreams, likes, do you see the future in the context of science fiction? What is the future? What's coming?

Topics that are near and dear may include Brain Health, Nutrition, Fitness with Neurotechnology, Neuroplasticity, Neurophysics, Nootropics, Cognitive Nutrition, Cellular Nutrition, ATP Optimization, Energy, tCDS, fMRI, EEG Neurofeedback, Binaural Isochronic Brainwave Entrainment, AVS Mind Machines, Physical Exercise Discussion, Neuroscience in regards to Personality Types, Awareness Expansion Coaching, Artificial General Intelligence

However topics are by no means limited to predefined categories. Feel free to say something.

Neo Mind Cycle is a philanthropic organization seeking the optimal health, functioning and performance of the essential cognitive faculty of reason, aka the human mind. Neo Mind Cycle was built with a vision to support greater brain function in all of our communities around the world, It's about brain optimal nutrition, and brain optimal activities such as neurofeedback combined with other advanced neurotechnologies such as isochronic beats and light and sound brainwave entrainment.

We have the technology to stimulate and encourage the growth of new brain function, new neurons, and new neural connections across many important regions of the mind via the principles of brain plasticity, and decades of research, as well as major studies done by the global community of interested scientists.

Also our true ketogenic nutrition program is optimized with all essential vitamins, amino-acids, fatty-acids, and other nutrients as well as very useful non-essential nutrients in order to maximize cellular fitness and ATP production. While this high fat low protein low carb core diet is for brain optimization, it's also incidently an anti-aging diet, an anti-alzheimer's diet, and anti-diabetes diet, an anti-obesity diet, an anti-epilepsy diet, and an anti-cancer diet.

Neo Mind Cycle for the greater good, based on Neuroplasticity, it's Neurophysics in action, and strong effective long term Nutrition Planning for both brain fitness and physical fitness.

Some of our free services, will use EEG scanning technology, to help you to recognize your own brainwaves, as you link the patterns you see & hear with your thoughts & feelings you will gain a new level of mastery within the inner state of mind.
