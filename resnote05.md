Agentic Viewpoints & Spiritual Agendas.

I'm sharing my dream journal entry, I don't intend to include any religious metaphors in our paper discussion, what happened I think is youtube videos that I watched last night of Donald Hoffman's conjecture, along with Joschua Bach's conjecture influenced my dreams resulting in these thoughts this morning that seem synergistic with what those guys talk about.

My thoughts this morning are finding synergy with Donald Hoffman's conjectures (from youtube), Joshua Bach's conjectures (from youtube), religious conjectures, and Michael Miller's reply this morning via email to what I sent over last night, and other thoughts that I've been absorbing lately.

Essentially I put these ideas together while I was asleep, I dreamed that I was, or once was, part of God, in the way that a cookie is part of, or once was part of, the cookie dough, (we all were). Then I woke up and wrote this idea down, well I wrote down what I could remember and then elaborated on it.

Essentially a perspective, or viewpoint, rendered by section of cooperating brain cells, is a section of the electromagnetic field. It's a tomographically constructed pattern of mechanical, electric, and magnetic waves that oscillated together, and formed rendered patterns through NAPOT or Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (Rendering would be the sixth word), these patterns were then connected together in larger patterns by the brain with Nonlinear Continuous Differential Approximations (Harmonizing the renderings into larger multi-agent patterns).

In a valid metaphorical sense the human perspective constructed in our brains (via NAPOT) is a slice from the pie of God's perspective (if you defined God's perspective to be the whole set of all of possible electromagnetic viewpoints that make up the known universe & beyond (this concept adapts the concept of omniscience or all knowing to an argument that every particle in physics is essentially a viewpoint) (and this includes non-physical or massless structures beyond the known spacetime, including the amplitudehedron as an example))

In secular terms each of us (with a brain) is in effect rendering viewpoints of reality by making patterns from slices of the electrogmagnetic field, but if all of our inner conscious rendered viewpoints are slices of the electromagnetic field, then the entire EM field can be interpreted as a viewpoint with each distinction in it (each particle/wave, atom, or atomic lattice) as a physical viewpoint that is a relative distinction from the whole viewpoint.

All of our slices (of the EM field in our brains) are essentially viewpoints that our minds are constructed and held together temporarily, but these rendered viewpoints are approximately like a series of reflections that our molecular, mechanical waves and other electromagnetic frequencies have bound together to create pockets of phenomenologically conscious experience (inside brains & bodies of cells)

We (those with brains) can be described as constructed molecular networks that produce constructed (rendered) images in a sense, constructed inside the cosmic network of electromagnetic distinctions (particles).

We, meaning our brains, construct our inner image with the fabric of God's image in a metaphorical sense.

We are patterns of rendered electromagnetic field viewpoints bound by a molecular structure that also consists of more tightly bound electromagnetic viewpoints.

We are inner components of a universe that is made from a fabric of viewpoints (at this point I'm overplaying the idea of quantum particles as viewpoints). I'm imagining particles as viewpoints which you could also call relative spacetime derivations, relative from the whole, thus distinct from the whole, and in a sense any particle is a distinction, born out of, or stretched from, or relative to, the whole of the cosmos, every particle is a distinction and every distinction is a viewpoint.

So these Agentic Brain rendered viewpoints, emerging from these Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximations (or Equilibriations: Equilibrium + Calibrations) connect, bind, and entify into larger entities.

The Entification concept from my book again: The different viewpoints entify or entificate (many single sensor transmitters bound together in oscillatory synchrony entify and become a single entity that is a unified fractal containing many self similar parts, so an entified whole human is a single sensor transmitter system made of smaller sensor transmitter parts bound by oscillatory synchrony).

At the same time the electromagnetic viewpoints rendered by groups of cells effectively bind together or entify into a singular viewpoint via the NDCA oscillatory synchrony of all of rendered patterns emerging from all of the Nonlinear Differential Continous Approximations emerging from all of the groups of cells.

Thus smaller agents bind together to form larger agents that are fractal agents, or entities with self similar parts. A human, made from smaller agents, becomes a unified entity, entified through the processes we have discussed to be a single agent.

I feel like saying humans are fractal agents, made from smaller agentic pattern rendering cellular systems, and when we (each human) find synergy with the views of other humans we are putting together even larger patterns, and these larger inter-human and cross species patterns undoubtably also have agency, collective agency, allowing group functions or coordinated group activities.

So the next level of discussion is about AGI's made of many smaller agents that entify into singular Agents.

Since functional connectivity depends on frequency matching, it means that when Agents within the mind are saying the same thing or are on the same frequency, their messages connect into larger patterns, patterns in the brain are essentially amplified when agents have synergistic output, in otherwords when they are all saying the same thing we get a dominate phase wave differential rhythm as an output, that becomes a chain of conscious rendered thought and action.
