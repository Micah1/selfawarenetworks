Christoff Koch's lecture
WSU: The Biology of Consciousness with Christof Koch
(available on youtube)
at the 36 minute mark he begins to shares slides about an experiement that illustrates why consciousness involves higher level areas but not lower level areas.

Watanabe et al (Science 2011)
look at the middle of the screen
"dissociate attention & consciousness"
they mask or camoflage a certain sort of temporal pattern
they watch the brain responding to the change in movement
but the person is not conscious of the change.

its modulated by what you attend to, but not by 

the primary sensory cortex can track things that you are not conscious off, but this fits with the anesthesia study that points to disabling part of the function of apical pyramical neurons that are at the tops of cortical columns connecting different regions of the brain together with long distance interneurons, so there isn't a widescale integration of cortical column information under anesthesia, globally coordinated brain activity is disrupted, and even if you stimulate a local area the person does not become conscious.

comparison to the FNIRS study on hemispheric lateralization
where when you attend to the right or left, moving your eyes, it causes shift in blood flow

My argument is that activity of the rich club networks of long distance interneurons that synchronize different cortical columns in different regions of the brain give rise to consciousness which in other words is a kind of contextual symmetry, or like each cortical column is a matrix of information, and with consciousness you have many different matrices of information achieving a sort of temporal oscillatory synchronization so that the information contained in each has a kind of integration with all the others, that is sort of like the integration of different frames in a movie, with each active interlinked cortical column being representing another frame in the movie of consciousness, with the possibility of multiple frames being active simultaneous in order to present complex spatial patterns.
