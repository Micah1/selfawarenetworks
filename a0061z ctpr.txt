Imagine that Neurons compound/bind patterns as they chat, that means that neurons are decoding patterns in a round about way, by sharing multiple views of an item, place, person, or concept, with post-synaptic neurons learning when other neurons agree on something, when they don't, and even when a misfiring happened (an illusion) because the chatter resolves all the dimensions of what is real and separates it from illusions, with neurons binding information together at lower levels but also in every direction no matter which direction information is received from, eventually mapping their own signal environments to the degree that an oscillator of neurons can invariantly represent any learned pattern with any neurons that are in that oscillator.

In this scenario there would be no jennifer aniston neuron, but some neurons or some neural oscillators could be more likely than others to fire when Jennifer Aniston's face shows up.

the distinctive signal modelling capabilities of a single neuron allow it to make distinct feature representations that other neurons can recognize such as one temporal frame of a woman's sneeze, or the entire sneeze squeezed into one moment, sort of a compression of time, so that the past becomes condensed into the present, like a reduced size representation, a jpg, a compressed file. At a larger scale features can be selected or tuned into, via synaptic connections to other neurons that look for coincidence firing within certain intervals and can have their intervals reset by other neurons such as with the pyramid cell. Reference Criterial Causation by Peter Tse for other descriptions of how neurons can reset the thresholds for firing thresholds in the AMPA and NMDA receptors which is a fractal variation on the same thing, spikes happen fractally, where they repeat on multiple scales triggering coordination across high level, mid level and low level regions of the brain simultaneously, across multiple columns, withing columns, and within neurons, with the neuron representing the reduced version of the pattern or wall of tiny details that is large and also far away, but the stuff in your field of view is the mid level brainactivity, like a lens effect, and the stuff that your are focused on is the high level version that activity, but it represents what you are focused on at that moment, like a lense effect, its like your brain is rendering all the tiny details of everything in the scene around you at the lowest levels of the cortex, everythink you expect to see that is outside your attention and focus but still being tracted and predicted by your brain, in the mid level the oscillator or column represents your active field of view or part of it, when its active, and as you move into higher levels connections between the pyramid cells knit everything together in rich clubs, that is intersection represents the center of your focus, like a lense effect.

I think of neurons has having a radial distribution on one end and a radial listener on the other, with the variability of the listener being able to make noise sometimes and the noise blaster being able to listen sometimes, and its a fractal like hands on the tips of hands, or like each of my arms is a branch, and then each of my fingers is a branch on a branch

but signals in lower branches collect pattern representations by collecting ions in each of their synapses until the synapse fires crossing its threshold, then the branches of the dendrite repeat the same fractal at a higher level collecting ions until they fire, then the whole dendrite fires, that precede aka predicts a soma firing event.

so the neuron is physically capable of learning a vast number of representations that sculpt its action potential into a frequency pattern that represents so something like an instance of a modality for one frame of consciousness, you would need many such hertz firings perhaps to represent a painting, temporal hertz patterns of many spatial hertz to represent that painting over time as you were moving in front of it. The rows of neurons that are collecting the electrically charged ions are doing the physical act of listening the collecting charge is the screen you are watching, the molecular structure is recording to the electric charge and the observer is the tonic oscillator while the words of the mind, and the content of the mind including our sense of space itself arises inside the notebook or canvas of the mind that is a spectral electromagnetic graph, with magnetic and electric dipoles as created by the oscillators interacting and the differential between them and phasic firing neural circuits in multi-level fractal patterns

I think I understand why the brains unique properties can lead to a conscious mind but in essence we need for a way for the computer to render its own patterns, detects own rendering, detect its own movement, render association patterns between its own movement and its inner rendering, those associations become a part of its inner rendering which in a sense is a spatial & temporal topographical pattern in the grid of cells consisting of hertz frequence patterns as initated by action potentials of all sizes, from synaptic to axon. ie our neurons are creating our screen as a hz pattern or a frequency based topogical  electro-magnetic pattern on oscillator graphs at multiple scales and our other sensory representations are connected into it as fast phasic firing rate neural activity on branching topological patterns that represent actived areas of the tonic firing graph and also the quieter inhibited area creating a sort of dot matrix printer for inner representations, everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and feel. Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.
