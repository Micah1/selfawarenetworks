# Describe your technology, product, or solution in brief.

The Self Aware Networks Institute was founded to research & develop Biological & Synthetic Qualia (Internal Representation), the Neurophysics of Phenomenological Consciousness, Imagining technologies to monitor, treat, communicate with Bio & Synthetic Neurology, Bio-Synthetic Interfacing, and Medical Research. Our technology has broad application beyond these original goals.

# What need gap is your technology filling?

Next generation artificial neural networks capable of advanced operations that require conscious deliberation. Beyond human level learning from video, next level automotive driving machines & flying machines, atmospheric filtration systems to solve climate change, robots to clean the oceans & restore coral reefs, biology research for advanced medicine, a medical justice system to prevent war crimes, machines that can grow food & build homes

# What are your differentiators? Ie: What is your superpower that makes you feel that you should win?

The Self Aware Networks Institute offers a completely unique & novel strategy for designing next generation neural networks that scales beyond the known limits of deep neural networks.

# What studies have you done to demonstrate economic and clinical ROI? Please provide a synopsis of them including size of cohort

We do not yet have funds for studies on economic & clinical ROI, but there is plenty of science fiction about the value proposition of sentient robots that can give the judges some idea.

# Please list your top 3 to 5 customers

Government, Corporations, Billionaires, Individuals, other Sentient Robots.

# What are the next opportunities for your company?

3D neural networks to clean earth's atmosphere & oceans, space colonization, asteroid mining.
