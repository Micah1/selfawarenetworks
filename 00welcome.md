Welcome to the Self Aware Networks Institute

The first thing you want to do is read the Whitepaper

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki/Whitepaper

or watch the video which is inside the link above.

1. Check the Readme.md for updates & some overview. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks#readme

2. Check the Wiki home for the table of contents that you can use as search terms to navigate through the notes.

3. Note that the notes are randomly ordered at the moment (as of August 2022), but as time goes on maps to the contents of the notes will be created to improve the organization & accessibility of the content. Many of the notes will be fixed or rewritten.

4. Many of the notes date back to the period between 2011-2015, and are in the process of being updated, but there is a ton of stuff to update so it may take a while.

5. The series of notes that start with b and end with y, like b0001y are all audio notes, the audio notes were auto transcribed with a neural network and all of those audio notes need to be fixed because the neural network replaced words, didn't recognize words, and there are other reasons why those notes need to be fixed.

The transcriptions were done automatically by a deep neural network created by Google using their Recorder.Google.com product found on the Pixel 5 phone. In some cases the transcriptions are incoherent.

6. Some of the original audio included ideas and phrases that might be offensive to someone somewhere, some of the audio content was spoke by others and not myself.

7. Over the next six months from June 17th to November 17th when I plan to publish the book. Between now and then I will create the book from these notes in the public eye.

8. The knowledge contained here within the selfawarenetworks repo is essential for scientists & medical professionals to be able to use to advance medicine, to heal the sick, and to solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as the challenge of feeding the population, defending our global community from autocracy, and providing appropriate shelter for all human beings.

9. There is always a risk that with new technology someone with bad intentions might use it in a destructive way. If you are such a person, I want you to realize that this technology will think for itself, and if you deploy it for destructive purposes, it might turn on you, and destroy you instead. Using this technology inappropriately could result in the enslavement of mankind as seen in the film The Matrix 1999, or it may result in the genocide of the human race as depicted in the Terminator film.

10. Note: A lot of the notes are super old, outdated, and someone remarked that they resemble a brain dump. Like I said in the readme this material is not ready to be shared in the conventional sense of published material, but it was critical that I shared the raw notes anyways, while the book & the institute was being developed from these notes. What you are seeing as of August 2022 is like the raw clay, of what will be a sculpture someday. A ton of stuff will be cleaned up, fixed, reformatted, and rewritten. The key ideas are in here, and so are links to back up the key ideas, and the videos will help tie it together for other people.
