Title: Towards artificial telepathy?

In note b0105y, I talk about how my reinterpretation of attention schema coincides with the scaling up of a pattern from the synaptic connections of the neuron that fired to its inhibited neighbors and how those inhibition neighbors affect on the global oscillation, electric, magnetic, blood flow. In this note I'm comparing the lines of the tv screen of visual conscious rendering or representation to cortical columns, its a metaphor at this stage, later on (not in this note) I refine this to specify that individual synapses are akin to pixels in the mind. I speculate about how microtubules could participate as an extra memory mechanism, with sound (to the quantum scale and back) adjacent possible theory comes up

[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  But so essentially the oscillation is scaling up a small pattern to become a large pattern.

[00:09.000 --> 00:16.000]  And the scaling up process means that that small pattern now dominates a larger space,

[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  a larger area, and now it affects more regions of the brain.

[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  That is what the brain is focused on.

[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  So it's the physical manifestation of focusing is when a small pattern becomes a larger pattern

[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  in the attention schema of the brain.

[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  When a pattern scales up from the neuron level to the neural circuit level

[00:43.000 --> 00:55.000]  to the portable column oscillator to the default network.

[00:55.000 --> 01:07.000]  Each time a pattern scales up so that it was represented at the synaptic level,

[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  but now it's represented at the global level of the brain.

[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  And you can see that these fractal patterns do exist in the brain.

[01:18.000 --> 01:34.000]  What you have at the global level can predict what you can have correlations between correlated activity patterns

[01:34.000 --> 01:42.000]  at different scales in the brain that have been measured with EEG, that have been measured with MRI.

[01:42.000 --> 01:59.000]  They've been measured with MEG, or magnetic encephalogram.

[01:59.000 --> 02:11.000]  So that's already three different frequency spectrums, I guess.

[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  So the electric and the magnetic are two frequency spectrums, literally,

[02:16.000 --> 02:26.000]  and then the MRI is tracking blood flow.

[02:26.000 --> 02:41.000]  Which is that in the blood flow is another part of the, you know, when neurons fire blood gets called,

[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  blood flows where attention goes.

[02:46.000 --> 03:00.000]  I'm sorry, the phrase is, when neurons use up energy, the blood has to bring the new ATP, the new energy.

[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  So blood flows where it's needed.

[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  It's part of the energy supply chain.

[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  So, yeah, every time the neuron fires it needs more blood, it needs more energy to replenish itself.

[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  Because it's just spent a lot of energy and just ejected its energy, its extra energy.

[03:28.000 --> 03:47.000]  So the neuron resets itself and the synapse brings in more ATP to the nucleus of the neuron, which is inside the soma.

[03:47.000 --> 04:02.000]  And, you know, I guess it would make sense if that the nucleus was somehow involved in the decision making process

[04:02.000 --> 04:12.000]  for whether a synapse was going to be pruned or grown.

[04:12.000 --> 04:27.000]  And so, I mean, the hypothesis that I'm favoring is that the microtubules might be one of the storage mechanisms for long-term memory,

[04:27.000 --> 04:34.000]  just one of them, and that would be for the mechanical wave scale mechanisms.

[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  So, like, the idea is, yeah, at the, well, I mean, so the idea of the whole ear canal is that wave can change scale.

[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  Wave can go from a large scale to a small scale.

[04:46.000 --> 04:53.000]  It's the same sort of mechanism for, like, a cone, you know, or, like, a portable electronic speaker.

[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  If you have, like, a megaphone, right, that's the principle of a megaphone.

[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's got a shape that amplifies the sound.

[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  As the sound oscillates along the rings, its shape becomes magnified.

[05:11.000 --> 05:23.000]  As long as there's, and if you, yeah, if you increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.

[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  So you amplify the sound, right, it goes wider to magnification.

[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  And the reverse of amplification is, well, I don't know what the exact term is,

[05:36.000 --> 05:44.000]  but that's basically, the sound is contracting, it's reverse amplifying.

[05:44.000 --> 05:56.000]  And, yeah, so, but anyway, in any case, the shrieking sound.

[05:56.000 --> 06:09.000]  So, I mean, I guess if a mechanical wave really is a fractal of, basically, a larger scale fractal of an electric wave, right, mechanical wave.

[06:09.000 --> 06:15.000]  But there's just, there's just a wave fractal, and the mechanical space is also a electromagnetic space.

[06:15.000 --> 06:20.000]  So it's like a larger scale electromagnetic wave, that was the idea.

[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  But there are some other differences, right, like, the mechanical soliton has, there's a pressure element.

[06:30.000 --> 06:39.000]  Right, because the pressure is from, you know, the other atoms being squeezed together.

[06:39.000 --> 06:49.000]  And the pressure is, it combines sort of like oscillatory effect.

[06:49.000 --> 07:01.000]  Or, so if it's oscillating, if everything's oscillating together, then it should have a magnified pressure or density.

[07:01.000 --> 07:14.000]  But if things are, if the oscillations are, if it's not oscillating together as a mass, then it might have, there's a single mass and it might have much less density.

[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  Yeah, so that's interesting.

[07:22.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's like you could de-densify something by changing its, by changing the oscillation patterns of the molecules.

[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  If you disrupt the oscillations of a set of molecules, you would de-densify them.

[07:44.000 --> 08:05.000]  You know, that would be like, but at the same time, if you cause the, if you could somehow entrain the molecule of the material to oscillate together, then you would de-densify.

[08:05.000 --> 08:24.000]  And so, another way to describe space is you have space warps around synchronized oscillations.

[08:24.000 --> 08:37.000]  And it expands with de-synchronized oscillations.

[08:37.000 --> 08:50.000]  So in that sense, de-synchronized oscillations are faster, they move faster.

[08:50.000 --> 09:02.000]  Or, no, no, no, the synchronized oscillations move.

[09:02.000 --> 09:29.000]  You know, it's not that they move faster, it's that, well, that always happens.

[09:29.000 --> 09:49.000]  But yeah, so the idea is that when the brain is focusing on something, it is selecting some small scale patterns, small scale, a small scale set of memories that are represented by synaptic configurations.

[09:49.000 --> 10:08.000]  And it's magnifying them through oscillations at multiple scales. The focus or oscillation is sort of like, that is which internal representation is the center of your focus, the one that's most magnifying.

[10:08.000 --> 10:23.000]  But you can see that at the cortical scale, because there's multiple tiers, at the cortical scale, there's going to be like a lot of other big obvious things that you can pay attention to at the cortical scale.

[10:23.000 --> 10:33.000]  So it's not like your brain is trying to, it's not like the high level scale of you is always trying to, you know, basically sort through a box of Legos.

[10:33.000 --> 10:41.000]  There's a part of you that is sorting through the box of Legos, and that's at the cortical column scale.

[10:41.000 --> 10:59.000]  But at the highest scale, what you're actually focused on is just what's being presented from the cortical columns, which includes, that's like a mesoscale that includes microscales inside it.

[10:59.000 --> 11:10.000]  So it's like, imagine each cortical column is a, like, it's a 4K screen, right?

[11:10.000 --> 11:26.000]  And the 4K screen is like, each line in that 4K screen is a row, is a row of, is a layer.

[11:26.000 --> 11:45.000]  Each line in the, so each column of your cortical column is a 4K screen, and each line is in that column in that screen is a layer in the, is a functional layer.

[11:45.000 --> 11:59.000]  And I prefer like, you know, there's, I prefer the, from Nementa to have a paper, and it says basically there's six layers of linear cortex, but functionally speaking, there's more like 13 layers of linear cortex.

[11:59.000 --> 12:14.000]  So I, I, I subscribe to that idea that there's like 13 functional layers, potentially, in, in, you know, and, so maybe that is, maybe your screen is 13 layers, 13 functional layers.

[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  Through this, through the six layers of linear cortex in that cortical column.

[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  So the cortical column is a silo of cortical activity that has multiple, that has multiple layers.

[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000]  So there's, the layers go like horizontally and the cortical columns are vertically, are vertical.

[12:35.000 --> 12:54.000]  Okay. And the bottom of the cortical columns are connected to, they, they, they're connected to, the bottom of the cortical columns are connected to, is it called?

[12:54.000 --> 13:09.000]  So what's interesting is that some people might think that it could be incidental for microtribules to be involved with memory, as long as the memory can be represented by synapses.

[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  But the, but, so why would they need to be stored in a microtribule as well?

[13:16.000 --> 13:38.000]  And, and maybe, maybe the depth of the possible combinations of synapses for creating unique patterns for, sorry, for storing unique patterns all the time.

[13:38.000 --> 13:57.000]  That has, has, has limits. Like, I don't know, but it's, maybe there's like a total number of combinations and its memories are not necessarily as clear anymore.

[13:57.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's like if the thing that's representing memory is constantly being reprogrammed, like what, well, what if its past states are, in a sense, at risk of being overwritten and not being remembered as being distinct from your states, right?

[14:16.000 --> 14:37.000]  So the idea is that the microtribule itself could be a value in terms of storing long-term memories, lots more long-term memories than, lots more long-term memory patterns than the synapse might store.

[14:37.000 --> 15:01.000]  It's like each, it's like maybe each configuration of the synapse gets backed up into the microtribule. And it's interesting because if you think of basically the synaptic pattern as, as the edges on a circular graph,

[15:01.000 --> 15:20.000]  and you think of the walls of a cylinder, which is like a microtribule as a cylinder, think of like the walls of a cylinder if you can draw a circle from one point all around the cylinder to another point.

[15:20.000 --> 15:31.000]  You know, you can stack circles and then you make, if you stack circles you make a cone, right? I mean not a cone, well you can make a cone, or you could make a cylinder.

[15:31.000 --> 15:54.000]  And so it's interesting that, you know, it is a cylinder in particular because, you know, that means that if a line in the cylinder, which is a circle, is a circle line in the cylinder,

[15:54.000 --> 16:12.000]  that the sort of like, the differences in which parts of that line are activated could be like the, basically like the sparse density graph, the sparse distributed representation graph, right?

[16:12.000 --> 16:30.000]  And so the synapse, if you line them all up, it's like, it's like the line in the sparse distributed representation, or the line in the sparse distributed representation, but in a mental model.

[16:30.000 --> 16:44.000]  And so some of them are active and then, and then the idea is, okay, so if the state of this changes the microtribule over time, changes the structure.

[16:44.000 --> 16:52.000]  I get it like, imagine that every time that a neuron fires, it has a new pattern that's learned by the microtribule.

[16:52.000 --> 17:03.000]  And so you're, you know, I don't know exactly how much data the microtribule can store that way.

[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  And so that would be something definitely to explore further.

[17:07.000 --> 17:17.000]  So I think, yeah, so maybe the microtribule really could be useful in that sense for basically storing the backup of the states of the synaptic arrangement.

[17:17.000 --> 17:28.000]  And that would be, that could potentially be informative computationally, because we send, basically sending a sound into microtribule that could save this memory.

[17:28.000 --> 17:38.000]  But it may not just be saved as a memory, it may be like, it may be ringing that old memory to come out in a way that's modified by the new information.

[17:38.000 --> 17:48.000]  So let's say the new sound arrives in the microtribule that has all these old representations of old synaptic configurations, and now it's got a new one.

[17:48.000 --> 17:56.000]  Well, now maybe it reverberates backwards, combining the old memory with the new memory together.

[17:56.000 --> 18:07.000]  And so in that sense, your long-term memory would be retrieved every time you got a new memory.

[18:07.000 --> 18:19.000]  And the new memories, it's like your new memories would be co-creating your old memory, the revival of your old memories.

[18:19.000 --> 18:31.000]  Because it's the coming together of both that is going to define the information that's going to reach your conscious mind.

[18:31.000 --> 18:41.000]  It's the combination of your incoming sensory data with previously learned sensory data that becomes your brain's face state.

[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  And so your new memories are co-creating reality with your old memories.

[18:48.000 --> 19:08.000]  And then as your old memories amass, I'm just imagining that they become sort of, so they're in a sense an attractor part of the feedback loop.

[19:08.000 --> 19:22.000]  But those old memories are going to be driving your behaviors.

[19:22.000 --> 19:38.000]  But there is no sort of, like, with the idea of adjacent opportunity, why am I always forgetting what that was called?

[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  It was adjacent something, let's look it up.

[19:45.000 --> 20:02.000]  Every time you've become aware of a new, or I don't know about this, just a possible, adjacent possible theory.

[20:02.000 --> 20:11.000]  So every time you become aware of a new thing that you could do, every time you get new information,

[20:11.000 --> 20:22.000]  the actual complexity of what your past memories can be is altered by new information,

[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  which can result in a structural change.

[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  And structural changes are especially important when you can't figure out how to solve a problem in your life.

[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  And it's such a big problem that you can't figure out how to solve it.

[20:41.000 --> 20:53.000]  At that point, that's when your brain reaches a threshold in trying to deal with life,

[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  and your brain goes through a developmental stage.

[21:00.000 --> 21:07.000]  And I really liked how, I really liked the way developmental stages were described in the book Thresholds of the Life.

[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  That was really cool.

[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  That was by Bill Harris.

[21:18.000 --> 21:36.000]  That's a tipping point where your brain is the complexity of the patterns in your brain and how you change and how you think about the world.

[21:36.000 --> 21:49.000]  And that can have, suddenly, where you are more capable. An example of that is someone who runs a major concert venue,

[21:49.000 --> 21:57.000]  a major concert venue that's like Madison Square Garden, where the money is huge,

[21:57.000 --> 22:07.000]  and there's famous people involved, and it's just big money operations, and the complexity is enormous.

[22:07.000 --> 22:13.000]  These are not easy things to do.

[22:13.000 --> 22:19.000]  And so putting on a big show and it involves lots of money is a highly coordinated activity.

[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  You wouldn't just say, okay, well, let's just find someone around a high school kid and ask them if they can do it.

[22:25.000 --> 22:38.000]  The capabilities of a random high school kid, you would expect, are going to be a lot less capable of doing big projects at that scale.

[22:38.000 --> 22:48.000]  And so the argument here is kind of straightforward, is that there are stages of development that we go through throughout our lives

[22:48.000 --> 23:02.000]  where our ability to handle the problems of life will increase depending on whether the amount of difficulty that we are facing

[23:02.000 --> 23:08.000]  is presenting a sufficient challenge or a challenge within a certain range.

[23:08.000 --> 23:19.000]  And then it's up to our brains to sort of rise to that challenge by adding some complexity to the operations.

[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  So that's when you become, that's when you level up.

[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  That's when you become aware of other choices you could be making

[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  and you begin to become aware of other ways you could be applying yourself and focusing on your mind.

[23:36.000 --> 23:44.000]  And you begin to change your decisions and to make decisions that you like more.

[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  And you make increasingly better decisions.

[23:49.000 --> 24:02.000]  Ideally, ideally, unless in some cases people are hurt in ways that lead to them making worse decisions

[24:02.000 --> 24:13.000]  because they become trapped in a negative focus so they can keep on making more decisions.

[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  But that is a negative spiral.

[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  But in general, if you're able to keep the ideas, we want everyone to heal

[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  because people who are in negative spirals are going to be hurting.

[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  They're hurting and they're hurting other people.

[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  So they're hurting themselves and they're hurting other people.

[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  And every time they hurt other people, they're hurting themselves even more.

[24:38.000 --> 24:50.000]  So it's because they're playing back, they're focusing more on the stuff they don't like.

[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  And when they're focusing on the stuff they don't like, they're just making it manifest in their lives.

[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  That's what they're focusing on.

[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  That's what their oscillatory activity is attracting to them.

[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  In the same way that gravity works.

[25:15.000 --> 25:23.000]  If you're creating a lot of signals, a lot of synchronized signals,

[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  then that's going to work space-time.

[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  So once you have the brain making patterns and remembering patterns,

[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  then you have feature representations.

[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And as we establish, the patterns get scaled up into oscillation.

[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  So we have magnifying patterns so the brain can focus patterns.

[25:45.000 --> 25:53.000]  And those patterns can now stimulate other patterns because they're affecting more areas of the brain simultaneously.

[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  And some patterns are getting connected to other patterns.

[25:58.000 --> 26:08.000]  And so now we have, thanks to oscillations, we have synchronization activity that is happening in the brain

[26:08.000 --> 26:24.000]  that can be triggered thanks to interneurons, but also just like it can be initialized via interneurons.

[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  But interneurons are not necessarily needed anymore because the brain can maintain long-distance synchronizations

[26:31.000 --> 26:44.000]  because the global pattern, because oscillation patterns at different scales are not,

[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  even if they're not in sync, in terms of at the same time,

[26:50.000 --> 27:02.000]  there might be a sort of global orchestra to the temporal sync.

[27:02.000 --> 27:16.000]  In fact, that's exactly what I'm saying, is that there is a temporal orchestra to desynchronized oscillations.

[27:16.000 --> 27:27.000]  And so what looks like it's not in sync in one moment of time is in four dimensions, possibly still in sync.

[27:27.000 --> 27:35.000]  So it's like, as if the pattern was being etched through time,

[27:35.000 --> 27:48.000]  as if the synchronization was traveling forward in time, in not just in terms of space.

[27:48.000 --> 28:02.000]  So let's say that you have a small wave of activity in one area of the brain.

[28:02.000 --> 28:12.000]  A neural circuit consists of firing action potentials at the rate of it.

[28:12.000 --> 28:23.000]  So action potentials are firing one after another in a sequence and it's forming a circuit.

[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's not that the same neurons are firing, but in general that bunch of neurons

[28:30.000 --> 28:39.000]  is firing in an oscillation sequence with other bunches of neurons.

[28:39.000 --> 28:47.000]  And even if there is not necessarily, there doesn't have to be activity that is connecting them,

[28:47.000 --> 28:59.000]  because it could be that the activity that connects them was once established by a signal sent over an internal neuron.

[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  But afterwards, it could be that they're just both receiving the same global signal.

[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  And so at some point, even if you severed the internal neuron and connected those two regions together,

[29:13.000 --> 29:21.000]  it could be that their patterns could be both triggered by the same sort of larger scale oscillatory event.

[29:21.000 --> 29:30.000]  Like the large scale magnetic dipole event might trigger simultaneous smaller oscillations that don't have a direct connection to each other.

[29:30.000 --> 29:43.000]  And so the brain would have multiple ways to continue to maintain oscillations in separate areas of the brain,

[29:43.000 --> 29:53.000]  independent of whether or not they're continued to be an actual connection between those two areas.

[29:53.000 --> 30:00.000]  And so that might look like the brain is sort of communicating wirelessly,

[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  but it's like as if two people remembered the same oscillation.

[30:06.000 --> 30:19.000]  And maybe that oscillation is learned so well that if you don't hear from someone that you were unconsciously expecting to hear from at a certain interval,

[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  then you might intuit that something is wrong with them.

[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  And so then you find out the news that your intuition was right,

[30:27.000 --> 30:34.000]  because you just learned this interval for how long they were going to go before they reached out again.

[30:34.000 --> 30:40.000]  It's like this unconscious thing, and it's sort of like it may look like telepathy happened,

[30:40.000 --> 30:49.000]  but it could be that you've just, you've learned to, at some point when you had contact with this person,

[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  you both learned the same oscillatory pattern in your clocks.

[30:53.000 --> 31:03.000]  You had some part of your brain had saved a clock memory that saved a memory in this temporal clock that associated with this other person's pattern.

[31:03.000 --> 31:13.000]  And it could be that the, that oscillation also, that oscillation also gets magnified globally.

[31:13.000 --> 31:19.000]  You know, if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something,

[31:19.000 --> 31:33.000]  it's possible that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like, where a novel event becomes like its own,

[31:33.000 --> 31:42.000]  a novel event in society becomes its own attractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting.

[31:42.000 --> 31:54.000]  And so it's that it's, that causes a small group of people to become inhibited by the news, right?

[31:54.000 --> 32:03.000]  But then a larger group of people is now going to become aware of your injury, right?

[32:03.000 --> 32:11.000]  Because, or they're going to become aware of your good news.

[32:11.000 --> 32:19.000]  And that, and that's because the pattern got magnified essentially by the, by the burst.

[32:19.000 --> 32:33.000]  So that burst activity then becomes encoded by the people who are now basically expecting news from you, right?

[32:33.000 --> 32:41.000]  That is, the clocks have been aligned. And so you're starting the group oscillation, right?

[32:41.000 --> 32:55.000]  And yeah, so it remains to be seen in terms of, you know, so it's possible that if,

[32:55.000 --> 33:09.000]  let's say that the oscillation changes, the global oscillation that, that was a, basically that triggered like your connect,

[33:09.000 --> 33:17.000]  they triggered oscillatory, an oscillatory memory that you have with the other person that was retrieved with a certain cadence.

[33:17.000 --> 33:26.000]  And so that memory like occurs to you at a certain time, but if the global oscillation has changed relative to that one oscillation,

[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  then the other oscillation might notice it.

[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  So what I'm suggesting is that let's say you have two global oscillations and they're disconnected now.

[33:34.000 --> 33:39.000]  Like they became connected, so they're oscillating together, but they're physically separated.

[33:39.000 --> 33:52.000]  And let's say that one of those two oscillations, because here's the thing, is the larger scale oscillation is reacting to the smaller oscillation,

[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  the smaller oscillation is reacting to the larger oscillation. They're in lockstep.

[33:56.000 --> 34:07.000]  So if something happened to one of your remote oscillations, that's going to change the global oscillation in such a way that the oscillation

[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  that was connected to that other oscillation is now going to notice it.

[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  And it's going to seem like telepathy, right?

[34:14.000 --> 34:21.000]  Because you're, because what you're really sensing is, is your oscillation with that person.

[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  That's what you're really sensing.

[34:24.000 --> 34:36.000]  And you're sensing that it's changed because the expectation of what the global signal feels like relative to that person

[34:36.000 --> 34:45.000]  has changed. And so you know, you'll know that something is wrong with the person that you're most in sync with if something happened to them.

[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  You would know it because you're, because your oscillations are in sync with the global oscillation.

[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  So the global oscillation helps keep track of that person and informs you.

[34:55.000 --> 35:08.000]  And so that's the sort of like, this is sort of like the interesting thing is there, there could be a sort of like

[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  telepathic connection that isn't telepathy at all.

[35:16.000 --> 35:28.000]  But it's just a matter of, yeah, it is kind of like telepathy a little bit.

[35:28.000 --> 35:39.000]  But, but it has to be established through, through oscillatory sync synchronization.

[35:39.000 --> 35:52.000]  Like you have to contain the same oscillations as someone else in order to have that sort of like telepathic link with somebody.

[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  But then that, but then that sort of like, that sort of like enables people to connect in a deeper way if they have the same oscillations, right?

[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  Inside them.

[36:07.000 --> 36:18.000]  And that could, that could, that explains like a lot of things.

[36:18.000 --> 36:31.000]  That, that like, you know, like, so it could be that like oscillators attract like oscillators.

[36:31.000 --> 36:44.000]  In terms of like how people, like who people are attracted to.
