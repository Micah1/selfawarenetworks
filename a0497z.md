In some interpretations of the Judaic and or Kabbalic tradition, G-d before he enter's man is Ayn Sof, infinite boundless, nothingness, aka nothing, and then when he is inside man, he is still nothing, but he is the eye of the hurricane, and man's dissipative system is the vortex. So in a sense it means G-d is the space in the center of your mind. The inner peace. So in a sense it's not a matter of believing in Deity, but defining deity as a spacial and temporal metaphor within yourself and beyond yourself

"In some interpretations" the correct interpretation obviously is that G-d is nothing.
or zero
the prophecy is a prediction, like any prediction inside your mind
the prophet is you, it predicts you, a collective moshe
a second coming of Moses that is everyone, and noone
like the point in the Matrix, when Neo commits Satori
collective messiah
one in which you become one neuron, a fractal inside a collective
your brain communicates with other brains, the same way your left hemisphere communicates with the right hemisphere
it's not a religion it's a conceptual threshold, a paradigm
the tempo-spatial metaphor is the wisdom that philosophy consumes
so I say it's a concept that relates a spacial metaphor for philosophical digestion
G-d is food, brain food, food for your mind, your cells, which are hungry, so eat smart, and eat well
you are the messiah, the old wise people are the grandparent neurons, and the children are the v1 neurons
protect everyone
feed everyone
this is the alignment between short term, and long term, in a healthy mind
and a healthy society
If something doesn't exist does it have to equal zero?
How could there be any difference between two abstract numbers like 5 and 7 if neither exist, and both are really equal to nothing.
5+7=0 because numbers don't exist, they all equal zero
if you think of the number 7 for any length of time, it alters your brain's neurophysiology did you know that? it changes your brain, could this happen if the number 7 didn't exist?
every thought effects your neurophysiology
5 does not effect your brain the same way 7 does
some people see red with the number five, and green with the number 7, this is called synesthesia. synesthesia is real it's not made up, and it's been verified over and over again, but this would not be possible if these "non-existent" numbers didn't have an impact on your brain
You can take any topography, any three dimensional surface area, and convert it into number sets and functions, a program that is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing. There is no difference between the version that is functions & number sets, and the actual three dimensional structure, it's just a conversation, so for numbers to not exist, is the same as saying that space doesn't exist
or it's to say that space time and gravity is "in your mind"
the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.
if you subtract all of the descriptions from space, and all of the artifical abstract distinction, you get non-dualism, or space that is not even two things, no distinctions, and no artificial descriptions mean that space is not distinguishable from anything, it's not white, it's not grey, it's not blue, you can't tell the difference between your feet and a cloud in non-dualism, you can't tell the difference between a sharp knife and a butterfly without all the non-existent distinctions in your mind, that are no less and no more non-existent than any number
a number is description, and so is the spatial metaphor that is your foot
the second a number doesn't exist, neither does your foot really, because both are artificially conceived distinctions that are not there without your mind
thought is the memory-prediction, that is a conceptual formation of all that's there and real, in order to coordinate movement. every distinction your mind makes is like a number, in the sense that it's knowledge about the world that's in your mind, not in the world
numbers and functions are programs, the topoi of anything you see is really a visual program, if you see a bell drop, and hear a bell drop, and your brain aligns both patterns, it's not just an association, it's a topological program that you can share with any person verbally or in text, and the verbal way of saying what happened triggers the same neural firing as if you were to watch or see a bell drop. What the human mind saves is a topological program that represents every kind of sensory memory as a shape, and transmits a snapshot of that shape to other parts of the brain when it is triggered by it's association in any input from any sensory modality, such as seeing a bell drop, hearing a bell drop, reading about a bell drop, or hearing someone describe a bell drop.

Some might say that without your mind, there are no trees at all, just atoms. So perhaps trees don't exist? A tree is just an artificial description assigned to a body of atoms & molecules & cells with particular properties. Trees are descriptions, and like numbers, they don't really exist (as information entities).

If a number is description and does not exist, then nothing else exists, because everything you know about the world isn't in the world, it's knowledge in your mind.
How do people think that their thoughts do not exist? Thoughts effect your physiology, if you think about Santa Claus or the Easter bunny that has a physical effect that causes changes to your brain's structure, and your neurons are connected to each other and every system in the body in one way or another.

Santa physically exists in your mind, because he is effecting your neurology. You can think Santa doesn't exist, and that's fine, but he's about as real to your mind as your hands are real to your mind. You can say your hands don't really exist either, and that's fine too. Thinking about your hands is causing real changes in your neurophysiology, just like thinking about Santa Claus.
If something truly doesn't exist, you can't think about it. It's impossible to think about.
and trees exist, but only as simulations

I would say that intelligence is neither subjective nor objective, instead it's predictive. You still get the "ctive" part. And predictive is more descriptive than subjective, while not requiring a meaningless context like objective.
How does prediction imply an irreversible timeline? How is implying an irreversible timeline a problem statement?

"under certain conditions timeline can be reversible (small time frames)" under what conditions, can you cite a reference?
"prediction is not the only model of intelligence" what model of intelligence stands incompatible contrast to the 'prediction' model?

How is it that prediction cannot predict reversible timelines? If time is geometry, as in spacetime, general relativity, then it seems like reversible spacetime should be predictable as well.
I don't think of time as something that's irreversible. The fourth dimension is part of spacetime geometry. The past might be changing all the time, the future might be changing all the time too.

How is data compression a timeless task?
The word task implies a temporal dimension. In fact the phrase "data compression" implies a temporal dimension, a point when the data is not compressed, and a point when the data is compressed.

"No you can't change the history. It is a part of initial conditions." I didn't say that you could change history. What I'm saying is that there is no reason to believe the past is static, fixed, and unchanging. With general relativity we realize that time is a dimension of space, like any other dimension. Space isn't morphing in three dimensions, it's morphing in at least four dimensions.

">How is data compression a timeless task?

Backtracking in the decision tree. You can return to any point of decision making and select an alternative. We can't do backtracking in environments with irreversible time because we can't restore the historical state of environment."

This data packet is too compressed. Can you take it apart and explain it in pieces so that I can understand more clearly the point you want to make?
Are you saying that prediction applies to online problems, and online problems have a temporal dimension?
Are you saying that prediction does not apply to offline problems, and offline problems do not have a temporal dimension?

It seems to me that prediction does apply even to offline problems, and offline problems do have a temporal dimension. For example. if you look at a static yet complex image for several minutes, you may notice something new about that image that you didn't notice at first.

The static yet complex image is an example of an offline problem, there isn't any new information, but your mind is able to predict something new about that offline problem after looking for several minutes.
So prediction does not only apply to online problems.
Now you say if you sent an AI program (not based on the principles of prediction) to search that picture for patterns, it's still a temporal process, from start to finish, for that program to run, execute it's functions, and finish.
The out put of the AI program, no matter how it was designed, can be construed as a prediction.
Prediction=Result of Application, it's result is a prediction, just as the result of my thinking is a prediction. It's not the method that makes it a prediction.

Prediction is the secondary context, it's relationship to what we do with that information next.

1. Do the laws of physics exist?
1a. Are the laws of physics really laws?
1b. Do the laws of thermodynamics really exist?
1c. Does gravity really exist?
2. Do you exist because of the physical laws of the cosmos?
2.a Can you be separate from the laws of physics?
2.b Is your choice defined by the laws of physics?
2.c is everything you do really done by the laws of physics?
2.d are the laws of physics everywhere?

I don't know if there is a correct answer to this test. It's just something to think about. If you don't want to weigh in with anything besides "I don't know" that's fine. you can try plugging in some answers, filling it out, seeing what it looks like, then plugin a different set of answers, see how that looks like, then compare the two lists of answers to figure out which set of answers seem more plausible to you

Haskell is a lazy programming language, because if you give it an instruction that another programming language would go bonkers with, Haskell doesn't go bonkers with it, it just runs it once. It's not looking for all possible situations, it's okay doing a lazy result.

Awareness is just a bet, no matter how complete it seems, the lazy bet is the intuitive bet, the zen master can do it, but the ego cannot, the ego needs to be right.
Intuition is a sparse distributed representation of reasoning. What it loses in high resolution accuracy it makes up for in efficiency and ease.
Each method, reason and intuition are like tools in a tool box. I use the right tool for the right job. Not one tool to the total exclusion of the other.
not an illusionist, a teacher, "zen master" : I mean "zen teacher" and zen is not the practice of illusion, perhaps it is in some sense about removing illusion
a human thinks he is more evolved than the grass he walks on, but evolution does not see the human, and it does not see the grass, it only see's the replication of the dna code. anything that is alive today is on par with us, and you could think of the whole genetic code including all plants and animals as that which is evolving, instead of thinking of humans as having a separate evolution, separate even from one another

Oh you think consciousness is real? Where is that funny video, one second I have to get it and share it with you. You will probably like this http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mcafee_are_droids_taking_our_jobs.html?source=faceobok#.UGEMu59TYIJ.faceobok

"Up to this time most of people have more-or less similar self-model that make them compatible with each other." They have changed history since I left highschool. In your history books there was no such thing as war? Oppression? Religious conflict? Burning witches? Greek God's?

Whether awareness is categorically an "approximation" or "a bet" may actually be the matter of a secondary relationship (it's functional parameter outside the set (it's categorical context) that defines or filters out the more abstract function of it's interior calculus)

When is an approximation considered a bet?
When you modify your understanding of the interior process by it's external application ie it's internal function can be reinterpreted by what the brain is doing in the scenario that fits your model, and also it can be interpreted by the brain in the scenario that fits another model.

Such as:
The system of the brain is matching previous input with new input. It's never an exact match, so the match that's made is the best bet.
What I seem to approximate --> becomes a memory-bet.
The creative aspect of the brain might be a result of broken expectations or broken memory-bets, the bits that didn't match reality become creative distortions, sometimes stimulating neurons in an exaggerated way, like with "Rasa" in the context of art and music.

The brain is perpetually matching the wrong previous stimulus with the new information. See how this can be described as either a bet or an approximation, depending on whether or not you are inclusive of a particular function in a secondary relationship, ie it's associated function.

Consciousness is an internal description, like every other description, like a number. If a number isn't real, then consciousness isn't real, if consciousness is real, then a number is real.
fyi I have no position on whether or not consciousness is exists or does not exist,
the point is that it has to be consistent with whether or not numbers exist.

because "consciousness" and "numbers" both belong to the class of "descriptions"
if you say numbers don't exist, but consciousness does exist, then your in self contradiction on some level
how do you know it's undecidable?
the dynamic behavior of a brain in it's ecosystem is contained inside the description that is consciousness

just like the dynamic behavior of an intelligent program in it's ecosystem is contained inside the description that is it's file name.

on the contrary to the suggestion "self-perception of our subjective consciousness is not complete mathematically"
self perception is 100% mathematical
"file names were arbitrary within the length and allowed-characters limits of the operating system."
I'm not suggesting that consciousness has a file system similar to a computer operating system.

"it implies halting problem." please explain. fyi I am talking about an algorithm that defines one frame of consciousness, and the behavior of next frames at every level, in a subsequent frame
how does this true statement: "internal decision trees are limited in height." imply this statement: "All feasible tests for consciousness are incomplete"? I'm must be missing part of your logic here. How did you arrive at that conclusion?

Reproduction is a halting problem, like eating, and pooping, when will humans stop reproducing?
However there are categories of associations that can inhibit eating, pooping, and the process of reproduction.
Lets say reproduction is B : C -> D (two people = c become d = three people)
A -> B, but B (the reproduction program) cannot happen until B exists.
B doesn't exist until A exists Z : X -> A
So inhibitory cells fire and prevent Z from firing. So reproduction does not happen. That's a halting moment. In both computer code, and in the brain.

The program can have an inhibitory region, that can inhibit any other part of it's program. Just like the brain, halting, or allowing. It's all included in the description of consciousness like the description of a computer program.
if there is a limitation to what a computer program can do, that should apply to consciousness as well, and visa versa

If information was non-physical, then numbers don't exist.
If information in your brain is physical, then numbers do exist.
I'm not saying numbers exist, and I'm not saying numbers don't exist.
(Patterns are in physical objects, but invariant to them.)
Likewise I'm not saying that consciousness exists, and I'm not saying that consciousness does not exist.
The Buddha (and higher mathematics) recognized that somethings can be both true and false, and or neither true nor false. Not everything is a dichotomy between true or false.
What I want to know is if both of you can agree that if consciousness is real (it's just description in your mind) that numbers are real (also just description in your mind) and if numbers are not real then neither is consciousness.
Can you both agree that numbers and consciousness are equally real and or not real because both are descriptions in your mind? I mean I don't see consciousness anymore than I see numbers. That doesn't mean they don't exist, just because I don't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I don't see germs, or ultraviolet light. I've never actually verified through my own senses that the earth is a slightly squashed sphere.
How do you dismiss the argument (all things that don't exist are equal to a quantity of exactly nothing) Thus two numbers cannot be distinct from one another because they don't exist (they equal nothing, because what doesn't exist is nothing) Does it not make sense to you that every number is nothing if it doesn't exist? How do you dismiss that argument? What is your reasoning regarding that notion?
Note: I am really not taking the position that numbers exist, (nor the position that they don't exist) just interested in the brilliant reasoning abilities of the members of this group.
If information is non-physical then your physical brain can't interact with it. Physical things can only interact with other physical things.
If the numbers on your exam are not physical then your brain can't interact with them.
Your brain can only interact with physical information.
if information is non physical then it would pass straight through your brain, your brain could not contain any information (if the info is non-physical), you can't contain something that isn't physical, that's magical thinking

do electrons exist? do chemical reactions exist? do you think your physical brain can interact with non-physical things? Do you realize that saying information is non-physical, or immaterial is no different than claiming that information is supernatural and or spiritual? How can a physical brain interact with something that is non-material? It doesn't make sense. Thoughts are physical, and if you say thoughts are immaterial that's isomorphic to the religious person's argument.
There are no independent entities, from quantum physics we know that everything is literally defined by everything else, literally. A rock is a description, and so is a generality in your mind, no difference, both are descriptions defined by everything else in the cosmos, you didn't create any notion or thought unless you are one with physics, because the physics of the brain developed those thoughts.
does non-physical=spiritual? does immaterial=supernatural? if you think numbers are non-material doesn't that make you Jesus Christ or something?
Is information physical and material, does information, like numbers exist, Curt? Do people who think numbers don't exist think that because of the illusion of dualism that you spoke of Curt? Is thinking that numbers are non-existing like the magical dualism you spoke of Curt?

if a number is a physical pattern in a brain, and if a concept is a physical pattern, and a rock is a physical pattern, and your foot is a physical pattern, are they all equally real, equally physical patterns, do they all exist?

cough, um, isn't it true that electrons can be in superposition. Isn't it true electrons like other quantum particles can exist without a location in spacetime until observed? Isn't it true that an electron (like any particle) is a potential difference between mass and the higgs field? doesn't this suggest to you that spacetime itself is just a potential difference? that we are just a possibility neither truly real, and neither truly not real, simultaneously? it seems that all the information in the cosmos added together is just a possibility, or a potential difference between total mass and total emptiness (a zero higgs field). How can A mean A in so many places if the three lines that make up the capital letter A does not exist potentially, as a possible form between mass and the higgs field like everything else, before the human mind recognizes it? Are you saying that lines do not exist in space abstractly? Are you saying that abstractions do not exist independent of locality? Then do you deny that particles can exist independent of locality?

cuz you humans might be non-real abstractions, no more real than the abstract numbers that you hyposthesize as non-existent, can you prove that you are not an abstraction?

further how can an AI distinguish what is real and what isn't? How does an AI realize that a rock is more real than Santa Claus? how does an AI know that an abstract number does not exist as a potential form in superposition until it is localized with observation?
because non-locality (of particles) destroys the argument that numbers can't exist without a physical location?
taking the position that numbers are between existing and not existing, and so are we?

How can we know that existence fully exists, as opposed to being a potential between existence and non-existence?
Is the existence of existence perhaps less than a self evident axiom?
Is the existence of existence perhaps a logical fiction?
Is the existence of existence an article of faith?
How do we know existence isn't just existing as code, just like numbers only exist as code?

"Whether something exists truly doesn't depend on the knowledge of the observer. The representation of the something's existence on the observer's " 
A number isn't defined by a separate observer, its defined by the whole cosmos, by everything. The whole cosmos defines everything you think, including numbers, not the dualistic illusion of a separate observer who creates numbers separate from the whole cosmos.

"we don't have privileged, "raw" access to reality (or, to be more precise, we *do* but our resources are nowhere near the possibility of processing reality *as it is* - a sea of interacting elementary particles)." 

Everything in your brain is raw reality, your brain is not separate from spacetime, that's dualism. If your point is that the map of reality in your head isn't the actual territory it represents who has argued to the contrary? Still the form in the map may be a potential existence just like the form of a rock, just like the form of an electron, existing in superposition without locality before it exists in a location.

"Oh, I can quote in full, worry not.
> "Everything is literally defined by everything else."
This, is bullshit (and quite clearly a variation on the general sentence I provided abov" No that's documented fact, its a part of quantum strangeness, did you watch the video?
The point is that your reasoning for dismissing the existence of ghosts must dismiss the existence of branes from string theory for the same reason. A healthy mind cannot perceive branes.
So if you admit branes could exist then your argument for dismissing the existence of ghosts is either invalid, or not yet fully articulated.
I am in favor of little pacman style ghosts with a little yellow Ms Pacman to eat them.
on what grounds to you have to state that reality is objective instead of a potential between real and not real? (a probability) and how much have you studied quantum physics and also neurophysics? either study should produce lots of doubt in your mind over what is real and or not real.
it seems that in a quantum universe probabilites are part of the facts, how can you deny this? do you dismiss quantum physics like a creationist dismisses evolution?
the notion of the cosmos pre-quantum was an objective deterministic certainty, post quantum the cosmos became was an indeterministic probability. Remember Einstein objected to quantum physics at first "God does not play dice"-Einstein but probability is proven, quantum physics is a proven science, and it applies to the whole cosmos. "reality is a persistent illusion"-Einstein not an objective reality.
So again how can you be certain that the cosmos is objectively real and not just a probability (a potential difference between real and not real like an electron)?
how do you that the whole cosmos did not exist in super position before it had a location? how do you know that numbers do not exist in superposition before they exist as a map in your mind? how do you know that everything isn't literally defined by everything else? aside from your axiomatic belief, what proof exists?
if the rules of quantum physics apply to everything as you say then you have defeated your own argument, and it wasn't necessary for me to say anything at all.
it means existence does not have to be a true or false dichotomy, reality could be true and not true, and neither true nor not true.
The rules of quantum physics doesn't ever concern metaphysical nonsense like "difference between the real and the unreal". And don't talk about probabilities with me until you have actually learned at least the basics of the math. Take Yudkowsky's introduction, for a good example. Read it. Get it. And then come back. Preferrably while *not* being high.
thinking that existence is either true or false is flatlander

The reality is neither true or false - it simply *is there*, and it is our descriptions of it that can be more or less true, depending on how accurately they depict their slice of the territory.
it might be there and also not there at the same time, simply there is an on position, its there on average. Space is empty on average, and the rest of the time its matter. Thats what there and not there at the same time means, thats space as a probability, or as a potential. mass is 99.99999% empty space, but only on average, its between mass and a zero higgs field, its not simply there, its potentially there, or there on average
the cosmos is a potential between total mass (real) and total zero higgs field (nothing) but only on average, thats why its a potential, and not simply there
In metaphysics the cosmos is simply there, even if in reality it's potentially there, or there on average.
However in the end it was revealed that actually he was making a metaphysical argument, "existence is simply there"
while my argument demonstrated that physical reality is potentially there instead of objectively there.

Reality is a definition.
A definition written by each human mind in collaboration with reality. If every sparse distributed representation, every instance of stored or transmitted data, is in some sense a prediction about what's out there, and in another sense a reaction to what came before. Then in at least one sense Reality as defined by the human mind, is a prediction about what is real,. A prediction about what is real is a probability. That's why how you define data actually must be consistent with how you define the result. How do we define reality as not being a probability when our entire brain thinks only in terms of one memory-prediction algorithm? The only thing we can ever know is a probability. To think we can know more than that, to think we can know that the universe is more than a probability is an extreme viewpoint.

The brain does not think in terms of one algorithm. That's like saying Lisp is one algorithm. It may have a common structure, but you can't sort the meaning of phrases and sentences the same way you train a machine on a set of pictures to recognize a car for example. There might be a common structure, but like Lisp, that common structure allows a broad variety of very specific specializing algorithms. Some of them you might describe as long term prediction, or short term prediction, but other you might describe as just sensing the difference between two textures, or between light and dark, or associating dark, with street, with stranger, with fear, at the micro scale they might be made up of memory-predictions or memory-reactions-associated-in-a-tree but we don't really call them all prediction algorithms.

Finally the point about the brain being like it's own programming language like Lisp was actually a good one. Reality is still a definition, even if the definition is more complex than just a prediction. The definition is whatever it is, and perhaps all the extreme views of today will be the moderate views of tomorrow. Who knows. With Ken Wiber's map of cultural integrations, what he calls integral life, it's clear to me that I don't need to worry about any of this. In time wisdom prevails, or we all die.

If a man is not his ideas, then he is meat, and if a man's actions are not congruent with his words then he is spineless meat, without integrity or reputation. The grand ideas expressed by the fool must be borrowed, and not originating from that fool. Otherwise it is not reason that chooses a man's choices, instead it is the random impulses of chemical imbalances and man's mind is damned eternally. Such is the hope and fear of AGI, that we may build happy minds, that are kind, caring and loving, and that we may, because of our own chemical imbalances build horrible minds, war machines, to hate and kill, for such is the whimsy of man, crazy enough to engineer his own demise.
