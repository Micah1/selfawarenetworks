# A short poem before the article:
"drifting off when I saw "fermi(...)" my mind starts to wake up, my poetic EPSPs  innervate my Layer 2/3 Pyramid Soma's, I think "wow new article on fermions" alas not fermions, "fermi paradox" ugh, then I feel my inhibitory interneurons decoupling my excitement for a physics post."

Disclaimer for this note: I use the word neurons almost exclusively in this note but a lot of cellular computation in the brain is done by other types of cells that interface with neurons, the mains ones being glial cells like astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and there is a lot of interaction between neurons & t-cells, and all the other cells of the body interface with brain cells. So while neurons are the focus of this note, keep in mind this is not the whole picture. An astrocyte cell is thought to be able to carry out essentially the same types of functions of a neuron, but at a slower time scale, with different internal processes, a slightly different set of gliotransmitters (with some overlap with neurotransmitters) and they have a slightly different role to play in the brain. Also while I talk about neurons generally the primary focus of this note is about pyramidal cells in particular, a type of neuron that maybe have branches for the soma in addition to branches for the basal dendrite, and computationally sophisticated apical dendrite branches. I would like to think other types of neurons share the same functional framework with albeit different morphologies, but obviously 6th layer neurons do not burst (at least not with the frequency seen in 5th layer neuron bursting) and so there are going to be functional differences in non-pyramidal neurons that do not have fancy apical dendrites, but do have backpropagating action potentials.

# Neurophysics: Linear Non-linear Computation at the neuron, neural array, cortical column, and column assembly scale memory-prediction-rendering of the mind that is the phenomenological conscious experience of being someone and or being somewhere.

Essentially phase wave differential oscillation patterns formulate a tomographically shaped topological experience. In other words the computationally rendered experience of reality is both threaded & observed piecemeal by cells in oscillating feedback loops. Our cells are printing the patterns of the mind onto each other inside cyclic oscillations that are functional fractal feedback loops. Our brains are computationally printing our sense of being somewhere, and or our sense of being someone, from the contrast of our raw sense. Our raw sense is a formless awareness established by tonic oscillatory brain activity, and in this formless awareness of raw sense forms arise that shape the experience of being someone and forms arise that shape the experience of being somewhere. The forms of all distinct things arise in contrast, as constrasts, or phase wave differentials, from the tonic oscillation background pattern, what I call the formless raw sense, or the ground of being, or the mind in its awake criticality state.

Essentially communication in the brain at the neuron level is about phase rate changes with varying neurotransmitter magnitudes resulting in unique communication patterns that recode the synapses of each neuron. An array of neurons pass their phase wave changes to other neural arrays, and columns of neural arrays in the neocortex maintain an active memory state with a regular tonic firing of action potentials, at a certain cadence such as 20hz, 40hz, 60hz, 80hz, and also these are identified as the powerband frequencies in EEG imaging: Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and High Gamma. Tonic frequencies are thought to be gaussian, or like pink noise, or almost random, with low to no information, they have high magnitude which enables widespread synchronized firing, and low frequency. They manage to keep the brain in a ready state, or a criticality state, and their pattern fluctuations are very precise, serving as attractors in neural activity to maintain patterns that are changed by irregular action potentials, burst rate firing, and slow wave potentials which when absorbed by the regular tonic firing result in your mind being changed by new rendered patterns that oscillate and then are observed by the brain the same way patterns from the world around you are observed by the brain, in fact this is one unified process and I just said that in two ways to help explain the idea.

The varying magnitudes & frequencies of synaptic transmissions, dendritic activity, and the soma burst rates of whole neurons, plus the changes in the frequency patterns encoded in whole columns of the brain, and across the columns of the brain, the thalamus, and the hippocampus result in varying levels of inhibition & excitation, variations in the timing of oscillations, and tomographically entified rendered patterns that are observed by the same cells that are making the rendered patterns which are phase wave changes passed by the neuronal outputs, the neurotransmitters.

The synaptic, neuronal, column & brain wide network oscillations sculpt and render the experience of reality from the brain to the brain via oscillating feedback loops. The brain is effectively doing computational rendering & then reading it’s own output pattern, from neuronal outputs, as that pattern is looped or played back to the neural network of the brain which detects it, with neuronal inputs, and re-renders (outputs it again) with new sensor input data.

# This is Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography Theory Revision 5.

The varying frequencies & magnitudes of action potential transmission & the varying frequencies & magnitudes of neural transmitter release result in the unique transmission of patterns from neuron to neuron, from neural arrays to neural arrays, within cortical columns, and across custom cortical column assemblies in the brain’s macroscoptic networks via the Thalamic Matrix Inhibitory Interneurons, and also Thalamic EPSP relays from 6th Layer Pyramidal Cells.

With each transmission of phase wave change differentials, including forward & backward propagation at the synapse scale, forward & back propagation at the soma scale, and looping signal transmission across cortical column assemblies, there are cortical column frequencies that are changing, and individual neuron tonic frequency patterns changing, and frequencies encoded in each synapse of each neuron are changing.

With individual synapses upregulated in frequency or down regulated in frequency affecting different neural patterns that result in different neural pathways that shape the configuration of patterns in your mind as you experience them.

This phase rate coding with varying magnitudes of neurotransmitter release, plus individually encoded synapses, results in a considerate detection: Meaning the neuron & the dendrite consider patterns that they have grown to prefer, and their physical & synaptic phase rate configuration allows them to selectively ignore or pay attention to patterns on a millisecond to second timescale at the single neuron level, at the neural array scale, and longer time scales at the column scale, and longer timescales at the multi-column or whole brain scale.

Considerate Detection at the neuron scale is paired with a consequent emission, a phase wave rate change & a magnitude release of neurotransmitters that is different from usual, and or it can be described as an unusual pattern change. To the brain an unusual phase change is information the context of information theory, In fact it is rendered information because the phase change is persistent, it oscillates in time & space like printed object with low persistence (a term from Virtual Reality when discussing displays that lose the image they are holding quickly to prevent image blurring, and also they transition faster to update to the next version of the image from the new head position.).

The neuron with its synaptic configuration represents the considerate detection because it's detecting clusters of patterns in a stepwise manner. The dendrite is doing a step wise, or computational, or a mostly linear summation of nonlinear cluster based computation. (See the Clusteron) (ordered or clustered via arrival times & arrival proximity) from its synaptic inputs across the neurons whole body over time. 

I argue that the metaphor of the leaky integrate & fire neuron is conceptually flawed, because the control of potassium outflow is very precisely controlled because the up or down regulation of individual synapses is critical to the phase wave shape change. So it’s metaphorically incorrect to say that dendrites have leaky membranes, and it’s more correct to say that neurons have precisely regulated valves that open & close to compute the phase wave output of the neuron.

We could say the neuron doing a non-linear input computation, but that just means the inputs can arrive in any order from any of the synapses, and basically a non-linear input means that the neuron’s threshold mechanisms at different scales are considering the sum of the aggregate charge from all possible inputs within a temporal window that is in part also configured by the morphology of the cell & it’s connections, plus the up or down regulation of individual synapses. These are the neuron’s pattern detection mechanisms. 

The neuron's output is formed from the clustered sum of its inputs over time so a neuron considers the clustered sum of its inputs over time which is the same as a non-linear computation inside a linear computation. The non-linear computation is also described as the gradient potential, and the linear computation can be described as the synaptic thresholds that feed into the dendritic thresholds that feed into the somatic thresholds.

In other words the neuron detects spatially distributed inputs across its membrane, and computes them with almost a combination of summation & multiplication (of the inputs) (multiplying charge if for example two NMDA synapses on the same branch located next to each other fire within milliseconds of one another, adding the charge if two synapses fired from different branches of the dendrite) and via the synaptic, dendritic, and somatic thresholds the Neuron is converting the spatially collected information into a temporal pattern, creating a phase wave variation or differential that has a magnitude & frequency. The magnitude & frequency of a wave have an inverse relationship, so that when one grows the other shrinks, and that phase wave change results in change in the magnitude of neurotransmitter release (which is part of the phase wave), which results in changes to the synaptic frequencies of down stream (and sometimes upstream) neural arrays. In short, small synaptic changes result in bigger somatic phase wave differential patterns and vice versa.

The Neuron is effectively considering information patterns through the weighing of charges, positive and negative ion charges, and the clustering of these charges, based on where they are coming from and at what rate, and its doing this complex pattern detection with its unique dendritic branching & synaptic connections with it’s social network (it's network of synchronously oscillating cells).

Side note: Also a human being is essentially a fractal of a neuron. Perhaps your digestive system is a fractal of the mitochondria, your heart might be the soma, your head might be the nucleus, your hand and arm on the left side might be the basal dendrite, and your hand & arm on the right side might be the apical dendrite. Your head is like the fractal of an eyeball, the outer layer of greymatter is analogous to the retina, and the thalamus is analogous to the focus point where light converges, as all the sensory inputs signals eventually connect the thalamus at some point and the thalamic matrix inhibitory interneurons connect all of your cortical columns together, and co-regulate the configuration of your cortical assemblies. Your fingers & toes are also like dendrites and the palm of your hands & feet are like the soma, and the legs & arms that connect to your body are like axons. I imagine that in the future we will have machines that can instruct your body to reconfigure it’s biological shape, because your proteins can turn into viscous liquid temporarily and then reformulate into solid structures. A human being is essentially a liquid metal robot that is apparently without the processor or energy to facilitate a real time biological transformation, but biological transformations are computed and they happen over the course of evolution. With advanced computers we could in theory expedite evolution to happen many times in a single lifetime, and we could in theory transform our bodies & minds into anything we want (as long as what we want is biologically possible)

The primary input to the neuron, the dendrite, is doing the detection or computation of patterns with branches of synaptic inputs. These synaptic inputs are accepting or releasing charged ions (or other receiving other signals) based on signals from other cells, allowing a single neuron to represent a unique temporal & spatial pattern on a millisecond to second timescale (BTSP). Its pattern is encoded by other neurons, but a single neuron can also help re-code its own patterns via signal feedback loops with other neurons.

The result is a change in the neurons output, and that means a change in the neurons phase wave, which translates into a change in the magnitude of the neural transmitter release. The neuron will fire an action potential every so often at some tonic firing rate, it has a clock like regularity, and a neuron is effectively a biological clock. You can imagine the large Layer 5 pyramidal cell with its apical & basal dendrites as a clock that has a regular cycle for soma bursts, and that it’s clock speed for soma bursts is changed by phase changes in its synapses across its membrane, and the changes in the upregulation & downregulation of ion channels, including input from metabotropic sensory receptors are changing the charges in the apical & basal dendrites which change the timing, or the priming of the clock’s readiness to change its timing in response to certain signals, (the parts of the (Pyramidal in this example) neuron which may include the basal dendrite, the soma, and apical dendrite are constantly being either excited or depressed towards a change in the neurons whole phase rate or burst rate) resulting in a change in the neurons output (the neurotransmitter release (that is the attractor that represents the phase wave pattern change, that then modifies the synapses of other neurons).

The change in the neuron’s output, or phase wave pattern, has several options. 1. It can return to spiking at some regular interval, what I call the tonic firing rate, that could be at 20hz, 40hz, or 80hz for example. These are powerband oscillations like Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and High Gamma. Tonic firing is higher magnitude and lower frequency but the important characteristic is that it synchronizes broadly with other neurons. It becomes part of a group oscillation, usually whole cortical columns will oscillate together at the same frequency range, but in addition the brain unites cortical columns that are oscillating in the same frequency range, and it inhibits connections between cortical columns & cells that are not firing in the same tonic frequency.

Synchronous phase rates link cortical columns across the brain change depending on the task that you are focused on. The change is accomplished by feedback loops between the cortical columns & the thalamus. The combination of tuning from 6th layer Pyramidal Cells via thalamic neurons excites somas of 2nd & 3rd layer Pyramidal Cells with EPSP and this programs the phase rate changes of the cortical column. This excitatory synchronization from 6th layer pyramidal cells to the somas of 2nd & 3rd layer Pyramidal cells via Thalamic Neurons helps synchronize multiple neurons & cortical columns across the brain as long as they are firing at the same tonic frequency (power band frequencies like Alpha, Theta, Beta, Gamma, and high Gamma).

Also the synchronous activity between the 6th layer Pyramidal cells, and the Thalamic Matrix Inhibitory Interneurons that connect cortical columns together will use GABA neurotransmitters to inhibit communication between cortical columns & cells that are not oscillating together at the same tonic firing rate. This inhibitory interneuron process allows your brain to change the tasks that you are focused on very quickly, by realigning which cortical columns are working together, and which cells are working together, and which patterns are evoked in which sequence.

# "Dual midbrain and forebrain origins of thalamic inhibitory interneurons"
"In contrast to cortical networks, excitatory neurons in the thalamus do not connect with each other (Bickford et al., 2008; Hirsch et al., 2015; Jones, 2007; Rikhye et al., 2018b). Instead, local connections and computations within TC circuits are dominated by the resident inhibitory, GABA-releasing neurons (interneurons) (Hirsch et al., 2015; Montero, 1987; Pasik and Pasik, 1976; Sherman, 2004)."

 The three papers explain how the Pyramidal Excitatory Tuning in 1rst paper, and the Thalamic Matrix Inhibitory Interneuron Networks described in the 3rd paper are cooperating in synchrous activity via the 2nd paper. In other words your excitatory Layer 6 Pyramidal Cell signals, and your GABAergic Inhibitory Interneuron signals are cooperating to coordinate your global brain function from the synaptic scale upwards moment by moment. On the astrophysical scale everything in your brain is driven by the physics of oscillation.

# 3 "Core and matrix thalamic sub-populations relate to spatio-temporal cortical connectivity gradients" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307102
"(...) thalamocortical connectivity recapitulates large-scale, low-dimensional connectivity gradients within the cerebral cortex. (...) diffusely-projecting Matrix regions preferentially correlate with cortical regions with longer intrinsic fMRI timescales.
(...) Core–Matrix architecture of the thalamus is important for understanding network topology in a manner that supports dynamic integration of signals distributed across the brain."
"The complexity of cortical circuitry has also been shown to underpin a gradient of temporal scales across the brain, with associative regions fluctuating across relatively longer time scales than sensory regions (Murray et al., 2014)."
"A phylogenetic perspective on the brain (Cisek, 2019) suggests that the cortex is supported by several subcortical structures that shape, constrain, and augment its activity on a moment-to-moment basis. One such structure that is crucial for shaping whole brain dynamics is the thalamus (Halassa and Sherman, 2019; Jones, 2009; 2001; Shine et al., 2019b) (Fig. 1). Located in the diencephalon, the thalamus is reciprocally connected with the entire cerebral cortex, along with primary sensory receptors (such as the retina and dorsal column tract) and numerous other subcortical systems (such as the basal ganglia, superior colliculus and cerebellum). These inputs innervate distinct, anatomically-segregated sub-nuclei within the thalamus (Fig. 1) that are surrounded by the shell-like GABAergic reticular nucleus (Jones, 2001). Through activity-dependent GABAergic inhibition of cortically- and subcortically-driven activity, the thalamus likely plays a crucial role in shaping and constraining patterns of whole-brain dynamics (Halassa and Sherman, 2019; Jones, 2009, 2001)."
"3.3. Matrix thalamus preferentially couples to regions with slower timescales. We observed a significant positive correlation between CPC and both: the intrinsic timescale, (...)suggesting that regions the longer integration windows in associative regions of the cerebral cortex (Murray et al., 2014) may be due to an increase in regional fractality (i.e., larger H value; Dong et al., 2018) and the presence of long-range correlations. 
"these results suggest that the associative cortical regions preferentially supplied by the Matrix thalamus were associated with a longer intrinsic time scale when compared to the regions supported by the Core thalamus, at least during the resting state, and may support the notion of quasi-criticality in the resting brain (Wilting and Priesemann, 2018, Moretti and Munoz, 2013)"
"Our results describe relationships between the relative weighting of distinct cell populations in the thalamus and low-dimensional spatial, temporal, and topological gradients in the cerebral cortex."

# "A midbrain-thalamus-cortex circuit reorganizes cortical dynamics to initiate movement"
"Motor behaviors are often planned long before execution but only released after specific sensory events. Planning and execution are each associated with distinct patterns of motor cortex activity. Key questions are how these dynamic activity patterns are generated and how they relate to behavior. Here, we investigate the multi-regional neural circuits that link an auditory "Go cue" and the transition from planning to execution of directional licking. Ascending glutamatergic neurons in the midbrain reticular and pedunculopontine nuclei show short latency and phasic changes in spike rate that are selective for the Go cue. This signal is transmitted via the thalamus to the motor cortex, where it triggers a rapid reorganization of motor cortex state from planning-related activity to a motor command, which in turn drives appropriate movement.``
"Many behaviors, including purposeful movements, are composed of sequential phases that require different computations. For example, while waiting at a red light to make a turn, we plan to rotate the steering wheel while pressing the gas pedal. After the signal turns green, we achieve our goal by executing a program of skilled movements effortlessly. The planning and execution phases are produced by distinct patterns of neuronal activity (Svoboda and Li, 2018; Vyas et al., 2020)."
"Our experiments suggest that the midbrain sends simple contextual signals to the cortex via particular thalamic nuclei to modulate cortical activity modes. Different thalamic nuclei contain neurons with different projection patterns (Steriade et al., 1997; Clascá et al., 2012). For example, VM contains neurons that have broad projection patterns to layer 1 (''matrix"). VAL instead projects in a more focal manner to middle layers (''core") (Jones, 1998; Kuramoto et al., 2015). These different thalamocortical projections activate cortical microcircuits in specific ways (Anastasiades et al., 2021). The spatial distribution of thalALM neurons with short latencies to the Go cue appears to differ from those showing delay selectivity"

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Columns in the NeoCortex maintain a synchronized firing state with other neurons in that same cortical column, and these synchronized states are primed by the 6th Layer Pyramid Cell Apical Dendrites via the thalamic relays to excite the somas of the layer 2 & 3 pyramidal cells making the cells effectively more attentive to incoming signals.

The tonic synchronous criticality ready, achieved by EPSP Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials sent to the soma’s of Layer 2 & 3 Pyramidal cells makes your mind excited, ready, sensitive to incoming signals. This is how your mind is alert & paying attention, the higher the tonic frequency, the more alert you are, and the more awake you are. This priming of the mental alertness state makes the brain more sensitive to irregular spikes, whether they are phasic spikes, high phasic bursts, or slower inhibitory patterns or slow wave potentials.

The neurotransmitter release change is an attractor that changes the neural oscillation patterns that your brain is in subsequent neural arrays via chain reactions, with Sharp Wave Ripples being one example of a chain reactions. In my conjecture the Sharp Wave Ripple sequence not only produces a chain reaction of action potential firing, but also a chain reaction of inhibitory slow wave potential firing that dispurse more widely but travel less distance.

Maybe I should say slowing wave potentials because the effect of inhibitions & slow wave potentials is to slow down the aggregate sum of brain activity by some tiny but precise amount. Slow wave potentials, or as I also term them negative action potentials, are also soliton waves that have a persistent oscillatory effect that travels, and has information value in the context of information theory where less common signals have higher information than more common signals.

Whether it’s a phasic, high phasic burst, or a slow wave potential what is changing is the relative clock rate or frequency of neural action (at multiple scales) and the phase wave changes of burst rate firing event trigger a change in the magnitude of neurotransmitter release that sends a unique message rippling through the brain (via chain reactions, and this is called a Sharp Wave Ripple), and the cell grounds it’s remnant energy or inverse charge in the extracellular potassium gradient contributing to the brainwaves we measure with Electroencephalogram (EEG). The phase rate changes are also encoded in changes to blood glucose levels, blood oxygen levels, and blood flow so we can study brain activity with a broad variety of other medical imaging techniques MRI, MEG, and infrared light, or FNIRS, to name a few (actually there are a lot more medical imaging technologies that I’m not going to list in this paragraph but you will be able to learn more about them in the Medical Imaging Technology Section of the book & the Institute.)

To recap, a neuron can be inhibited for a duration, or it could fire at some faster range, and there are multiple faster ranges, with burst rate potentials that range from 150hz up to 600hz in special situations.

The irregular phasic action potential, that fires irregularly, fires faster than the tonic action potential. Inhibition fires much more slowly. Bursts fire much faster and travel the farthest, and they have both the highest frequency & the lowest magnitude, because with waves there is an inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency.

The lower frequency tonic waves cause mass synchrony in part because low frequency waves have high magnitude in terms of their area, regional, or spatial effect, but the distance they travel is also shorter, so it takes a lot of links (the Thalamic Matrix Inhibitory Interneurons) between a lot of little cells to maintain synchrony across vast distances.

Rephrasing: Normally a neuron is going to fire regularly at a tonic rate, but it might fire phasically faster at an irregular interval that is both different & faster than the tonic firing rate. Irregular intervals provide a contrast to the regular intervals, and their irregularity implies that they have information value (in the context of Claude Shannon’s Information theory) and the irregular intervals affect the clock cycles of every other neuron in it’s synchronous assembly via the physics of oscillation that apply to everything including clocks & fireflies (reference to Steven Strogatz’s work.)

If that action potential happens again at the same time or place as the previous time or place then it represents a concurrence of past & future events in spacetime, and the brain tracks this by having the post-soma side of the neuron, sometimes called the Apical Dendrite, sometimes call the Exit Terminal, learn the patterns from the Soma, and send a back propagating action potential towards the soma when the spacetime event is expected, if the front side of the neuron, the dendrite or basal dendrite receives the expected event at the same time the charge that it sends to the soma combines with the charge that was back propropated to the soma and that creates a high phasic burst potential. An example is that a neuron that was oscillating at 80hz could suddenly burst to 200hz, creating a Sharp Wave ripple or a cascade of action potentials in a firing sequence across the brain, that mirrors a series of steps that the organism acts out in the real world, followed (after the action is completed in the real world) a backwards playback of the same sequence (which is how your brain understands that you did something in the past, it plays back the internal mental sequence backwards really fast).

Interspersed between the chain of action potentials in a sharp wave ripple are low frequency high amplitude inhibitory waves set by the decay rate of the Action potential or the plateau phase, or the action potential duration, resulting in the magnification of the pattern that action potential represented by the synaptic configuration of its exit terminal. These inhibitory waves cause tiny shifts in the oscillatory timing of the widespread high magnitude tonic frequencies and this changes the magnitude of our expectations in a subtle but noticeable way.

# Conjecture: Emotions as Tonic Frequencies Speculation Sidebar
I'm thinking that emotions are probably changes in the tonic frequences, like big emotional shifts may amount to big shifts in tonic frequences of whole cortical columns and column assemblies. Big shifts in the tonic frequences may result in whole brain areas becoming re-aligned, like several cortical columns are shifting at once from a tonic oscillation of 40 hz to 60 hz or 10hz to 80hz.

This correlates with the research on depression where people who are depressed have a greater activity in the delta & theta frequency ranges, the lower frequency tonic oscillations, and people who are drinking coffee and are very alert & focused might have many more beta waves, and people who are very happy might have a lot of gamma waves and so on. When you feel relaxed, such as after drinking a beer you might have many more alpha waves. It seems that there is tonic brainwave frequency correlation with emotion, and so the idea that emotions are actually the low information tonic frequency patterns that are also high magnitude so you feel them in a lot of areas but there is not a lot of data in your emotions, they have low information which is what we would predict with information theory when signals are very common over a great distance, tonic frequency emotions would have more feeling and less thought in them.

To recap I argue that because emotions feel like high magnitude and low frequency information, and because they are widespread, or felt in a lot of places, and because there is not a lot information in emotions, and they seem to be open to interpretation that the emotions we feel are probably the large scale shifts in the synchronized tonic oscillations at the macroscale of brain networks, and their meaning defines which brain networks are working together which may pre-dispose the organism to being more effective as somekinds of tasks verses other kinds of tasks.

That's why I am thinking with big emotions we are experiencing big shifts in the tonic frequencies that amount to our large scale brain regions reconfiguring themselves with tonic frequency shifts.

If this is true the neural correlates of a big emotional change could be a big change in the areas of your brain that are cooperating or communicating together or functioning together.

Big emotions might mean big or small shifts in the tonic frequencies of cortical columns that help define which regions of the brain are functioning together. I suspect that a big shift in emotions results in a reorganization of cooperating brain structures and they should be measurable with EEG, and big emotional shifts probably have been recorded in EEG research. I would look for EEG studies on mothers giving birth in particular, and ignore studies on EEG sleep research.

# Somatic Communication: Defining Pre-somatic & Post-somatic terms for discussing the triggering of burst events following the activation of a place cells in the cerebral cortex. (or a local event cell)

The idea here is to discuss both sides of the neuron in a way that is focused on the soma as a coincidence detector between patterns detected on both sides of the soma. For this purpose I have defined the terms pre-somatic & post-somatic. The pre-somatic side of the neuron, in Pyramidal Cells, refers to the Basal Dendrite and it's relationship to the Soma, and then you have the post-somatic side of the neuron, which refers to the Apical Dendrite and it's relationship to the soma. In a non-pyramidal neuron the pre-somatic side of the neuron is the dendrite, and the post-somatic side of the neuron is the axon & exit terminal branches. This terminological also makes it clear that we are not talking about synaptic communication, we are talking about somatic communication.

Ideally the pre-somatic side of the neuron is facing towards sensory input neuro pathways, and post-somatic side of the neuron is facing the direction of the motor output pathways.

If that irregular action potential happens again at the same time or same place, then it represents a concurrence of past & future events in spacetime, because now you have the post-somatic side of the neuron and the presomatic side of the neuron. These two sides of the neuron work together to encode seconds long BTSP Behavior TimeScale Synaptic Plasticity in places cells outside the hippocampus (or what I am calling local event cells), that are going to encode seconds long tempo-spatial pattern coincidence detections on both sides of the neuron, and this means that the pre-somatic side of the neuron, and the post-somatic side of the neuron will together super charge the Soma’s Action Potential event, creating burst firing.

A burst firing event means we got a back propagation from the post-somatic apical dendrite that coincided with the pre-somatic basal dendrite.

If it same spacetime event (an event of consequence) happens again at the same time (or same place) as before it produces high phasic burst rate firing (between 150 hz - 600hz)

**I’m arguing (and I don’t know how many others may have previously argued this) that place cells can be thought of as local spacetime event cells (or local event cells), and that the functions of local event cells are ubiquitous throughout the brain.**

# The Hippocampus as a Reference Frame for Cortical Columns

The functions of place cells or local event cells are primarily to encode significant local spacetime events (where and when some event happened relative first to the reference from of its cortical column, and it's cortical column activity being relative to the reference frame of the  hippocampus as a macroscopic scale reference frame for the brain (Reference Frames are a concept that I learned about reading the book "A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins), so the event cells (and their columns) are predicting when those local spacetime events might reoccur, then computationally rendering their occurance to the brains network with high phasic bursts that create chain reactions of spiking & inhibitory waves from each spike. 

Local Event Cells (Place cells outside the Hippocampus) are doing tempo-spatial pattern coincidence detection & rendering via burst rate firing that sparks chain reactions of spiking cell activity with other cells across cooperating areas of the brain.

**Memory Prediction Rendering (MPR)** Memory Prediction was a concept I first read about in Jeff Hawkins book On Intelligence. MPR Memory Prediction Rendering is combination of the concept of Memory Prediction with NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. It means that our cells are making memories, the partially activated memories are predictions, and the output of the action potential is a rendering to it's inceptive field.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

The primary purpose of place cells or local event cells (a term for Place cells outside the Hippocampus) is to create burst firing events, initiating sharp wave ripples, when there is a pattern match between the pre-soma & post-soma sides of the neuron. And I am arguing that place cells or what I like to call "local spacetime event cells" are effectively ubiquitous throughout the neo cortex, not just in the Hippocampus, but in every cortical column, and mini column.

However I would argue that 5th Layer Pyramidal Cells in the NeoCortex are functionally place cells or spacetime event cells, that are not having to do with the place of the organism, but are instead having to do with the place of the object, concept, feeling, or thing around the organism, such as the example of a cortical column tracking the orientation & place (or position in space) & sensory features (texture, heat, color, size, weight) such as a cup of coffee, which is an example from Jeff Hawkins book A Thousand Brain. I argue that the Apical & Basal Dendrites work together to create seconds long memory-prediction-renderings (This concept is a combination of BTSP Behavior TimeScale Synaptic Plasticity with NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography) so what your mind is doing, within the context of a cortical column, what your mind is doing is rendering the spacetime events of a cup relative to your place in space which is thought to be organized by the hippocampus, and the interplay between the memory-prediction-rendering in the Hippocampus and the Cortical Column activity representing the features of a Cup, via the Thalamic Matrix signal loops yield how your brain is representing a coffee cup to yourself, at each interval of your tempo spatially rendered experience.

The coincidence of firing from the back propagating Apical Dendrite and the Forward propagating Basal Dendrite then represents re-occurrence of a past spacetime event, or a memory-prediction-rendering, that other neural arrays tomographically assemble via synaptic coincidence detections, dendritic pattern detections, and somatic pattern coincidence detections back into phase rate changes that cause the process to repeat or recycle or loop in other neural arrays, and eventually back to the same neurons, and eventually to your motor outputs & nerve endings to change your movements.

You have the post-soma side of the neuron (the Apical Dendrite or exit terminal), and the pre-soma side of the neuron (the basal dendrite or input terminal), and these are going to encode seconds long BTSP Behavior TimeScale Synaptic Plasticity changes, but specifically they allow neurons (focusing on Pyramidal Cells) to compare patterns.

The pre-soma side of the neuron and the post-soma side of the neuron are going to super charge the action potential event, if the same pattern happens again at the same time or in the same place. It's like the post soma side of the neuron, the Apical Dendritic, gets encoded with expectations set by the previous action potentials, but it’s backpropagation timing is modified when the synapses on the Apical dendrite are upregulated or downregulated by other cells. Essentially the patterns represented by the branches of the Apical dendrite or the Exit terminal can be recoded, not just by other neurons, but by signals sent out from the same neuron via an excitatory thalamic feedback circuit that loops back to the same neuron or to other neurons in it’s cortical column.

# New Concept Combination: Behavior Timescale Synaptic Plasticity Memory Predictions aka BTSP Predictive Coding, for seconds long pattern coincidence prediction within the function of a single neuron or 5th Layer Pyramidal Cell.

The post-somatic side of the neuron is encoded with expectations or memory-predictions learned from somatic firing, and these memory-predictions are modified by bidirectional synaptic plasticity on the Apical Dendrite, and when Burst firing happens the Memory Prediction becomes a Rendering, a Memory Predicted Rendering to it’s inceptive field defining the neural array that it outputs to.

In summary the Apical Dendritic pattern the Post-Somatic side of the neuron learns when the last irregular phasic firing happened. Its back propagation firing, based on the pattern it is predicting, will be adjusted with signals from its synapses via bidirectional synaptic plasticity.

When the Apical Dendrite predicts that the Soma is going to fire it sends a surge of back propagating charge from the post-somatic side of the neuron back towards the soma. And if the pattern of the neuron from the pre-somatic side matches the input from the post-somatic side of the neuron, then the soma does a burst rate firing.

That’s a higher phasic burst. At that point the neuron at least temporarily jumps into a different phase pattern. Burst rate firing could be 150hz, 200hz, 300hz, 400hz, up to 600hz.

# I argue that the human brain is a finite state machine, because the total number of possible states are between 0.02 hz and 600hz times the sum of all places where phase states can exist (the sum of every synapse, and every brain cell in the brain)

So the total number of possible brain states might be something like 86 billion neurons + 1,000 trillion synapses x 600.18hz

600.18*(1000 trillion + 86 billion). That would include all possible state changes from metatropic & ionotropic receptors, and all top down state changes from cortical column assemblies.

The maximum frequencies seen in the brain are around 600 hertz. I don't know if 600Hz frequencies have been measured in human brains specifically, but I’ve seen papers where they have been measured in other species.

In animal brains it has been observed that burst rate frequency firing is between 150hz up to 600 hz.

But we can see from research that there is interplay between high frequency phasic patterns and low frequency tonic patterns.

For example there are papers that highlight the interplay between high-phasic gamma bursts and slower tonic oscillations in the theta frequency.

In note a0001z there is a note that shows us that when an organism is driving it’s own behavior, you can measure the amount of signals coming from the frontal cortex back down to the lower part of the cortex, you can see in the pattern of signals that there is a greater quantity of phase wave signals coming from the top down. From the most distal ends of the hierarchical feedback loop (such as the Prefrontal Cortex areas, back towards the limbic areas or the midbrain, or down the major nerve fibers towards the vocal cords for example. When the organism is making choices and determining its own behavior information flows this way, from the top down, or from the distal gray matter towards the midbrain.)

You can measure the amount of brain activity coming from the front of the cortex back to the lower part of the cortex. You can see that the shape of the pattern of signals is that it is a lot greater. There is a greater quantity of activity coming from the top down. 

From the furthest or most distal end of the hierarchy feedback loop backwards towards the sensory inputs, and motor outputs. 

Sensory input goes into a hierarchy to the top, which might include the frontal lobes, and then it loops, cycles & oscillates for a time while your brain is considering and compiling its next action sequence, and then the action potential sequence program shoots back down to the motor output channels causing your movements.

*I like to imagine, as an analogy, an oversimplified perspective on the flow of brain activity, where at macroscopic scale, from the birds eye view, where phase differential activity comes into the tonically oscillating brain network, and this phase wave differential information loops throughout the cortex, like the wind, following different & interesting neuro pathways across cortical column assemblies.*

# Default mode network

Beyond the raw formless sense described in the initial paragraphs of this note that I argue consists of high magnitude low frequency tonic oscillations across the cortex, the more advanced form of this concept would be the Default Mode Network.

"The DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal-oriented tasks and was sometimes referred to as the task-negative network" Source: Wikipedia

But the Default Mode Network becomes involved in tasks via cortical column assembly which I talk about in this note.

# "Reward enhances connectivity between the ventral striatum VS and the default mode network DMN"
"Strikingly, we found that the experience of reward enhances task-dependent connectivity between the DMN and the ventral striatum, an effect that was specific to the DMN."

This article highlights the modularity of brain regions to couple & uncouple, in unique arrangements to accomplish different tasks at the behavioral time scale for organisms. These modular cortical column assemblies can unite areas of the brain such as the ventral striatum and the default mode network. The paper above does not explain the neurophysics of rewards, in terms of how they mechanically strengthen the connections between the DMN and the VS, but based on my reading of the paper on Neural Tuning my conjecture is that the valence or voltage or phase wave frequency is matching between the DMN-VS when they are united in joint brain activity, with areas that are out of sync being inhibited by the interneurons to support their continuing or oscillating communication

# The abstract birds eye view above cortical column assemblies. 
You could say sensory input signals go up into the brain's network, then they cycle in brain signal activity loops, then the activity goes out through the motor pathways. Driving behavior changes. If you want a really simple & kind of silly analogy that may help translate this complexity to something we could build in a computer system imagine the game Sonic the Hedgehog, which involves a running character that runs through 360 degree loops that go upside down. In an abstract way our sensor inputs bring in phase wave differentials like Sonic the Hedgehog entering his loop. With the loop representing abstractly the strange neural pathways through the brain, the path of the loop can change, but for Sonic the Hedgehog one neural pathway is functionally isomorphic to the next because he goes in one side (the sensory inputs), loops around it (the hippocampal, neocortical, thalamic loop), and comes out the other side (via the motor outputs to the nerve endings and down the midbrain to the nervous system below the brain.)

Repeating this abstract analogy, imagine Sonic, representing incoming signals, goes into his 360 loop, from the left side of the loop because in a big circle upside down and it back out of the loop on the right side of the loop. 

Imagine your loop for each of your senses, each of your neurons in each neural array, and each neural array in each part of cortex & column, and each column in each cortical column assembly (consisting of multiple brain regions working together), is an additional loop that Sonic the Hedgehog has to loop through. Some loops (neurons) are drivers, which means Sonic passes through essentially the same as he was before he entered the loop, and some of the loops are modulators, which means Sonic is changed, reprogrammed, each time he passes through the loop.

To complexify this abstract analogy even more, the signals are also noised over time & distance as the phase wave differentials are gradually pulled apart & absorbed by the brains tonic oscillations which can accurately be described as a gravitational effect of oscillatory physics that pull apart, distribute, or dissipate the phase wave differentials across the sea of higher amplitude low frequency tonic oscillations. However the changes in the structure of the neural network that grow between neurons, or atrophy between neurons as a result of these dissipating Sonic the Hedgehogs are actually learning to predict, in a process called memory prediction, the paths of future incoming signals, predicting future patterns, which leads to the brain being able to render to into its own mind increasingly more complex information patterns over time. So that an adult brain will necessarily have a higher definition conceptual rendering of reality compared to a child’s brain.

When we scale up from neural arrays or neural circuits or edge communities to mini columns and cortical columns, and assemblies of cortical columns, and loops between the midbrain & the cerebral cortex, think of this again as like a larger set of loops inside loops. 

Imagine a stack of Sonic the Hedgehog loops inside the formation of a loop. Now imagine Sonic the hedgehog is dissolving as he travels, but he is also reappearing later on when high phasic bursts trigger Sharp Wave Ripples.

# "Cortico-cortical and hippocampo-cortical co-rippling are facilitated by thalamo-cortical spindles and upstates, but not by thalamic ripples"
"thalamo-cortical spindles and upstates strongly facilitated cortico-cortical and hippocampo-cortical co-rippling. Thus, while thalamic ripples may not directly drive multiple cortical or hippocampal sites at ripple frequency, these sites may ripple synchronously in response to widespread activation from thalamo-cortical spindles and upstates."
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507471v1

I imagine the process of Sharp Wave Ripples can be abstractly compared to Diffusion networks, such as Stable Diffusion. It’s not just a behavior pattern that is rendered by a Sharp Wave Ripple, that behavior pattern is also a rendered sequence between neural arrays in each step of that Sharp Wave Ripple sequence, that is rendering images in the mind’s eye of that organism. The Sharp Wave Ripples are chains of phase wave differentials that represent the patterns you can see in the canvas of your phenomenological consciousness.
https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release

At the 5th & 6th layer Pyramidal Cells there are loops from the top of the neocortex back down to the bottom, to the second & third layers, and the 4th layers, via the Thalamic Matrix Neurons and to the first layer via the Thalamic Core Neurons.

To summarize, the neo cortex can be anatomically described as having 6 layers and the top two layers have thalamic connections that route signals back down to the first four layers. However there is interesting work at Numenta that argues that there are more than 6 functionally distinct layers, in each cortical column, in terms of how signals are routed.

Again so you imagined a silly abstraction of incoming signals entering the brain as being like Sonic the Hedgehog traveling through his 360 loops, his path can change, and he can be changed by his path, but the paths that signals travel loop, and the functional neuro pathways themselves have been observed by neuroscientists and are very clearly described in papers such as the one by Numenta linked above.

I think this analogy can help people who are unfamiliar with computational neurobiology & neurophysics to begin to build a picture in their mind that phase wave differential signals have to travel a path, and at each step of the path a mental image is being rendered in a neurotransmitter release that is being observed by the next array of neurons.

Most of your incoming senses head straight along nerves to thalamus and then they are fed into the neocortex. The Olfactory neural pathway is a little bit different, in that 4/5ths of it connect with parts of the neocortex before they connect with the thalamus, but essentially the Thalamus is like Rome as described in history books, all roads lead to the two Thalami, and from the Thalami throughout the whole brain.

The Thalamic core neurons loop signals within a cortical column, and the Thalamic Matrix Cells (inhibitory interneurons) help shape connections between columns.

Thalamic activity also connects with the Hippocampal Entorhinal loop, sending & receiving information like a central hub, some have compared it to a router, but it's different from the abstract comparison to a router because the Thalamus modulates signals, helping to shape signal paths between cortical areas, helping to define cortical column assemblies.

Maybe I ought to rephrase cortical column assemblies to macro-meso scale cell assemblies because in my mind I am also including cortical connections to the midbrain, including live cortical assemblies that connect to hippocampus such as the hippocampal entorhinal loop, and cerebral to basal ganglia connections for example the connections between the Default Mode Network and the Ventral Striatum. My expectation is that these areas of the brain are united by synchronous firing, and separated by inhibitory interneurons with connections to the Thalamic Matrix neurons playing a role in selecting blocks of cooperating brain areas that are useful to accomplishing one task versus another task.

So the thalamus is like a central player that helps program and is programmed by oscillations from all the areas of the brain that it connects to. When the paths of signals change, your rendered memory prediction sequences change and your mental lived in experiences of reality change. However you are not a passive observer in any sense, because any thought that you have and any action that you take is feeding new information into this looping computation and that is shaping a new outcome.

When phase wave differentials aka mental information comes back to the hippocampus, it doesn’t always loop back into the neocortex, sometimes it travels down the midbrain, into the limbic system, to your body, to your fingers & toes, generating new movements for your body, new actions for the organism to take, new tasks that you carry out moment by moment.

When signals leave these abstract Sonic the Hedgehog loops they travel out the motor branches.

Motor outputs include your eye movements, your head movements, your larynx to create your voice. Your motor output pathways are distinct from your sensory input pathways, but there is also a feedback loop between the two called the prioceptive feedback loop. So your incoming sensory signals are for example helping your brain to adjust your motor output signals on a moment by moment basis as you move your hands, fingers or feet, you are paying attention to your movements as you move and modifying them as needed to accomplish your goals in a very precise way.

The motor output branches and incoming sensory nerves also extend into your lungs, controlling muscle movement, but giving you feedback on the status of your breathing, or the status of your organs. 

I described earlier that the timing of the post somatic side of the neuron is going to do a back propagation signal is partially set by the pre-somatic side of the neuron, and that there is also modification of that timing from other neurons through the upregulation and downregulation individual synapses, via bidirectional synaptic plasticity, and that includes backpropagating signals at the synapse from the postsynaptic membrane to the presynaptic membrane and visa versa.

In summary there are back propagating synaptic signals that are coming from a postsynaptic neural array backwards to the presynaptic neural array. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity helps modify what the neuronal tonic oscillation frequency is, how excited or alert the neuron is to incoming signals (or how depressed it is), and it helps to either synchronize neurons setting the stage for the LTP process or new neural connections or desynchronize them which might set the stage for the LTD process or the disintegration of connections between cells.

# My argument in my work is that the physics of oscillations are helping to coordinate where & when the LTP & LTD processes are taking place. The basic concept is that if an LTD process is initiated a lower threshold of activity causes calcium to

"Calcium influx into postsynaptic dendritic spines can, depending on circumstances, activate three forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP), short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term depression (LTD). The increased postsynaptic calcium concentrations that trigger all three forms of plasticity should activate the alpha isoform of calcium-calmodulin kinase type II (alpha CaMKII)"
"It appears likely that alpha CaMKII is involved in the production or global regulation of all three forms of synaptic plasticity. We propose that the activation of this enzyme is a common step in the induction of LTP and STP, and that alpha CaMKII activity is required for the normal production of LTD."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7953554/

Bidirectional synaptic plasticity can include signals that travel backwards across the synaptic gap that are either down regulating or upward regulating the synaptic pattern, which contributes to the frequency of the Apical Dendrite which is going to change the time of when the Apical Dendrite will send a signal that back propagates to the Soma, and if it arrives at the soma at the same time the Basal Dendrite floods the Soma with charge with might see a high phasic burst potential, or in other words a sequence of burst firing that initiates a sharp wave ripple or a cascade of action potentials & inhibitory waves.

It’s like the neuron with its branches and its individually modified synapse represent part of a pattern, the idea is that the pattern is a sparse & distributed representation that is rendered when the neuron outputs its pattern through the exit terminal to other neurons. The pattern in your mind is partially rendered when one neural array sends its signals to the next neural array.

You can imagine as a metaphor that the synapses are like piano keys, the dendritic branches are like musical organs, and the soma’s are like bass drums. With the sound of each affecting the whole shared sound that the organism both creates & experiences, because your cells read the output of other cells. Whatever you create you experience.

When the neuron’s output to the next signal is a rate change

The default tonic oscillation is that the neuron will fire regularly, in for example the theta frequency. When the neuron detects novel information that is represented with a phase rate change, or an irregular spike, or inhibition, or a phase rate bursting event.

The tonic rate frequency or power band frequency could be 20 hertz, 40 hertz, 60 hz, or 80 hertz. Or described with frequency ranges such as Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or High Gamma (delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (14–25 Hz), and gamma (30–100 Hz) bands), but despite the frequency the point is that the tonic firing is a regular pattern, with low information, that serves as an attractor for synchronous oscillations of the brain’s neuron processors, or neuron clocks.

The combined effect of up & down regulated synaptic connections results in determining when a neuron or neuron cell assembly might shift its tonic oscillation to another power band frequency, which helps determine the relationships between large scale structures in the brain, as groups of neurons tend to oscillate together but neurons can shift in their associations between one oscillating group and another.

The frequency tuning of a neuron and the tuning of its cell assembly is accomplished in part with EPSPs from other cells, or IPSPs, to exit or inhibit parts of a cells membrane, and after some threshold is reach the neuron can shift to a different tonic oscillation frequency, which means it now oscillates with a different cell assembly.

# Tonic oscillations are not random noise, they are precisely tuned attactors for regulating neural activity, for regulating your mind, the ground of being is not a chaotic mess, it’s an organized formlessness, it’s the shape of your experience, it’s the shape of being someone or the shape of being somewhere, rendered and observed by the same process.

While they look like noise in EEG measurements the tonic oscillations of your Default Mode Network are very precisely maintained from cell to cell through synaptic configuration changes driven by phase wave differentials between neural arrays. The tonic oscillations are thought to have lower information value, but they maintain a precisely tuned differential oscillating pattern, they represent memory attractors that guide your expectations & your behavior to seek new information.

The 6th pyramidal cells in the cortical columns will send EPSP via the thalamus to the prime the soma’s of 2nd & 3rd layer cells.

# Read my notes on the "Neuroelectric Tuning of Cortical Oscillations by Apical Dendrites in Loop Circuits" https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0007z.md

The pyramidal cells in the cortical columns will receive signals that sort of prime the soma to have a certain energy threshold that is more excited than the sensory inputs.

So the combined sensory inputs, when combined with the excited level of soma activation, will be more likely to trigger irregular action potentials or burst firing at the soma.

If you have less sensory input, a primed soma can be more sensitive to that lessor input because there's already charge in the soma ready to set the neuron off.

In a pyramidal cell the interplay between dendritic branches and somatic branches can upregulate or downregulate the sensitivity of the soma to dendritic signals, increasing or decreasing the resistance to phase wave changes via the primary soma based action potential event. This is a fractal pattern of the up regulation & down regulation of synaptic channels that might let sodium in, potassium own, increasing or decreasing some portion of the dendritic branches sensitivity or resistance to incoming signals.

If the Dendritic is a microphone (or a camera) metaphorically, imagine that its synapses are doing carefully calibrated gain control of the sound, if the sounds are too loud it dials back its receptivity so it can parse patterns from the louder noise, if the sounds are too low it dials up its voltage (and its attention) to parse patterns from the quieter noise.

So the amount of excitation of the soma will make the neuron more sensitive to signals from the dendrite, and inhibition of the soma would make the neuron less sensitive to signals from the dendrite. 

Individual receptors can also modulate their own sensitivity to incoming signals.

So neurons get excited, their excitement goes up, and they become more sensitive, more tuned in. 

Imagine when a person gets motivated about some topic. When you get turned on. Like turned onto the idea of eating food, or playing a game. Or turned on to the idea of going somewhere.

Maybe it's about food, you get turned onto the idea of food, you start thinking about food, and it’s like a excitation messages EPSP’s from your 6th Layer pyramidal cells are tuning the 2nd & 3rd layer Pyramidal neurons that are in cortical columns that part of synchronously firing & communicating cortical column assemblies, which might consist of parts of the Default Mode Network and parts of the Mid Brain such as the Hippocampus, and parts of the Basal Ganglia, with the Thalamic Matrix Interneurons blocking communication from regions of the brain that are not in sync with your food acquisition strategy.

You start looking for food and thinking about food, and in your brain there are phasic bursts initiating Sharp Wave Ripples that replay sequences of sensor modalities, flashes of sensory flavors, sensory smells, sensory images of food, your eyes start to notice food if it's around you. 

Maybe you are thinking about cheese, imagine they start looking for cheese even on the unconscious level, they notice an ad for cheese on social media, or they are walking through the grocery store and they get excited about cheese, start seeing cheese everywhere.

I remember I was walking through Trader Joe's grocery store in an aisle that does not normally have cheese in it and suddenly I noticed the can of dry parmesan cheese (next to the soup).

I’m sure you have heard the example of blue cars. You start talking about blue cars, visualizing them, and then later you notice blue cars a lot more when you go outside.

The idea is that the parts of your brain that have become really good at recognizing the features of cars are being upregulated, tuned up, excited, with EPSP, so that part of your brain is sort of on the hunt for blue cars, because it was excited by your preparatory thinking.

In this way what you practice thinking in the beginning of your day has a long term background duration imprinted in your tonic oscillation that shapes your results for the rest of the day.

If you are thinking about blue cars the inputs of your mind begin to prefer the pattern of blue cars. The aggregate sum of your excited neurons & excited cortical columns is distinct enough to produce the pattern of cars in the rendering of your mind, but also distinct enough to set your tonic oscillating patterns in a precise way to drive your expectations towards being alert to blue cars when they do appear in your receptive field.

Thinking about something is going to excite your unconscious expectations to be on the lookout for that thing, you are setting your unconscious mind, you are encoding patterns into your precise tonic oscillations to be tuned into things that fit the criteria that matches what you have been thinking about.

So if later in the day you encounter something that you have been thinking about your brain is going to do burst firing because your set expectations (tracked by apical dendrites) are going to collide with your real life pattern detections (tracked by the basal dendrite) and that’s going to trigger burst firing, and initiate sharp wave ripples (Sharp wave ripples are sequences of internal thoughts and external actions)

This process of imagining what you want to do before you do something is going to excite certain patterns via a configuration: a large configuration of cortical column assembly or neural assembly based patterns. Patterns emerging from brain structures that selectively unified to support what you want to do in part organized by oscillatory physics tuning brain regions to be more in sync with one another, and in part their selective cooperation is tuning out signals from oscillatory brain regions that are very far out of sync with the help of interneurons that inhibit pathways between regions that are far out of sync with one another.

# Essentially the physics of oscillation organizes your cortical column assemblies, and the relationships between the cerebral cortex and parts of the midbrain including interactions between the basal ganglia, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus & the cerebral cortex.

The physics of oscillation are the organizing process behind which of your brain areas are cooperating, the physics of oscillation is driving the tuning of synchronizes cooperating brain areas, and the physics of oscillation is synching the thalamic matrix inhibitory interneurons to the activity of the pyramidal cells so that the areas of your brain that are not in synch have their channels down regulated so brain areas are not interfering with other brain areas.

To restate this phase wave differential, phasic bursts, and sharp wave ripple patterns are assembled & passed across brain regions that are in sync with one another, across cortical columns, and across parts of the midbrain, back and forth. The parts of your brain that are cooperating are firing in the same tonic frequency power band range, and while high magnitude synchronized tonic frequency bands have low information value in the context of information theory they serve as very precise attractor states for neural oscillations that represent precise synaptic configurations that represent expectations that are manually set by high phasic bursts or phase wave differentials or irregular action potentials, or slow wave potentials.

At the same time brain areas that are not communicating on the same frequency are ignored or blocked off because of inhibition, because of the inhibiting effects of Gabaergic Inhibitory Interneurons that are part of the Thalamic Matrix Neuron Network that connects most of the brain together.

Thanks to inhibitory interneurons you get selective blocks of cooperating brain areas that can specialize for the task you want to be focused on.

Thanks to inhibitory interneurons, and oscillatory tuning you get select patterns of neural activations from different columns that can represent different patterns, like the cars and houses and votes and cats and and different neural patterns can play through your brain evoking different kinds of sensory renderings to your mind. This can happen because the narrow path of sequences that plays back in your brain is defined by the inhibitory interneuron gabaergic firing.

So the firing in your brain produces patterns that can be modified in your brain in real time through gabaergic inhibitory firing which changes the neural path that your brainwave oscillates through.

And the inhibitory interneurons are insync with the excitatory tuning of the 6th layer pyramidal cells routed through the thalamic matrix and thalamic core neurons that provide a feedback loop for your brain to self-regulate its own internal patterns.

Essentially when you change how something looks in your imagination, the rendering in your imagination is being observed because its a form or a model of something that is being pass through the thalamic feedback loop back to your cortical columns and your inhibitory interneurons are changing what that pattern in your mind is by changing the neural pathways that oscillations travel, which changes the patterns that your mind perceives when your eyes are closed. When your thoughts change it is because your inhibitory interneurons are inhibiting neural pathways, and your excitatory postsynaptic potentials are synchronizing other pathways to reorganize your active brain into new functions that you carry out through the course of your day.

Your mind consists of these synaptic configurations of (phase wave differential) patterns that are changing the individual timing (of oscillations) and the combination of the timing of different neural patterns across different cortical columns and within different cortical columns in the widespread high magnitude or high amplitude tonic frequency firing.

You have in your mind different configurations of oscillating firing patterns across the brain that are coordinated through oscillatory synchrony, and differentiated with phase wave changes, and coordinate with inhibitory interneurons, accomplished through bidirectional synaptic tuning mechanisms, namely excitation & inhibition.

Brainwave signals are coordinated through synchronous firing thanks to oscillatory physics, and the oscillatory firing also binds the signals so that your whole brain can be combined into a single sensor transmitter system.

So the changes in brain activity, the high phasic burst firing, the phase wave differentials, and the slow wave potentials are changing the regular tonic oscillatory firing by tiny amounts. In particular the Sharp Wave Ripples are triggering cascades of inhibitory waves that result from each fired action potential, and it is the inhibitory waves that are changing the tonic oscillation patterns because those waves are the slower frequency higher magnitude (also known as high amplitude EEG waves).

Signals are coordinated through synchronous firing thanks to oscillatory physics and the oscillatory firing also binds the signals so that their whole brain can be a combined sensor transmitter system.

The way the pattern phasic burst rates change the tonic firing, which has higher magnitude & lower frequency, is the process of which your brain is detecting it’s own information, and the process through which your brain is rendering it’s own information, and the feedback loops in the structure of the brain allow the whole brain to reflect upon the whole brain’s renderings.

So the burst rates represent the rendered information of the mind, and the tonic firing rates represent the canvas to which the rendered information is rendered to. The canvas of your mind is the tonic firing rate, that is changed by the burst firing rate, which is the pen of your mind. The interplay between the pen of your mind and the canvas of your mind is shared by the whole mind, through the process of the tonic firing absorbing the phasic firing.

So it's like the pen, the paper, absorbs the pen.

That paper is this higher magnitude lower frequency, and the pen is this higher frequency lower magnitude.

Think about pen ink, pen ink is higher frequency lower magnitude information, your mind notices the ink more, but it takes up less magnitude by area. Whereas the paper is lower frequency it just fades into the background, as a contrast to the ink, but it has a higher magnitude in terms of the surface area.

If you flipped the color of the pen & ink so you had a silver ink pen on black paper you still have the high frequency silver ink which is more noticeable but takes up less area (lower magnitude) compared to the black paper which has greater area (higher magnitude) but is lower frequency (it serves as a backdrop for the ink to be in contrast with).

The point of the color swap between the ink and paper was just to compare the reverse analogy to the anti-action potential, or the DC potential, or the slow wave potential, SCP Slow Cortical Potential soliton waves which are like downward shifts in oscillatory from the tonic frequency of less than 4hz in degree, lasting for milliseconds up to seconds.

And that would be the negative action potential, which is the slow wave potential, which is a temporary slow down in the tonic oscillating pattern.

Yet that downshift in speed is still going to be noticed by the canvas of your mind like the silver pen on black paper because of its irregularity, its irregularity makes it stick out, it has higher information value in the concept of Information Theory.

So whether the phase wave differential is excitatory (bursting) or inhibitory (slow cortical potential) it etches its ink into the canvas (paper) of your mind.

What is interesting is that in your brain, when things are happening in real time, your memories are played in a forward sequence, when you think about memories that happened in the past those memories are played in a backwards sequence. I came to the concept by listening to a video lecture titled "Preconfigured Dynamics in Our Brains" by Brain & Behavior Research Foundation https://youtu.be/izVCKEsDSq0 The lecture was titled "Brain in the body: mental functions, sleep and obesity" by György Buzsáki

Essentially a sharp wave ripple plays out three times. First it plays out really fast, maybe at 200 hz and then it plays out at the behavioral time scale, where you or the organism play out that pattern, the same exact pattern of neural firing that happened at 200hz now plays out at a slower time scale, as a series of slower paced action potentials the neural correlates of real life actions that an organism is taking accomplish some task with motor movements.

So when you do something, first you play out the pattern of what you are going to do in your mind really fast, maybe at 200hz, and then you do it, and the same action potential sequence repeats, and then you remember that you did it, because your brain plays the same sequence back backwards after you do it. I think the backwards playback is sort of how your mind encodes events that belong to the past. At least that idea makes intuitive sense, because we see with medical imaging that the same pattern that you thought about turned into an action that you thought about after the action was in the third step played in reverse. It’s a past event played in reverse. In theory whenever you are thinking about past events your mind is playing back sequences in the reverse order (perhaps to keep separate distinctions between past and future).

To recap: When you're about to do something, you think about it, you think about what you're gonna do first, and the neural correlates of that happen really fast.

Then you do it and when you do it the neural correlates of what you are doing happen much more slowly, on a behavioral time scale, and then after you do it, you get this receipt, and the neural correlates of that are the same sequence played back really fast in reverse. This is what medical imaging shows us.

Basically the neural path that represents the task that you're thinking about happens real fast, and the name neural path repeats more slowly while you are taking the steps that you are taking to get to some goal, and then when you are done you think about what you just did, and the neural path happens again really fast but in the reverse sequence.

That path is a sequence of burst firing, a sharp wave ripple across your brain, between some synchronously cooperating brain areas, with a path defined by inhibitory interneurons.

The means of sequence of firing patterns happened both within one cortical column and across many cortical cortical columns and other brain areas that were linked together with synchronous tonic oscillation patterns. Representing a select group of assemblies of cell assemblies across regions of the brain that function as the collaborated paper canvas for the pen of sharp wave ripple firing sequences.

So this firing sequence is inside the cortical columns that are coincident with firing sequences inside other cortical columns.

So at a higher scale beyond cortical columns there are sequences across cortical columns and other brain areas.

The computation of the brain is a temporal spatial phase differential firing sequence. 

Brain computation is a stepwise non-linear or clustered summation of inputs via the consideration of charges, which become weighed when charges exceed the thresholds.

The thresholds are defined by morphology of the neuron & its synaptic configuration, both in terms of grown synaptic connections, and in terms of the live status of the frequency of those synaptic configurations.

Neurons will grow to adapt to the inputs that they are getting this causes the preference of certain patterns, but this also shapes neural paths, the paths of oscillations that define your experience of being someone somewhere in some place with some ecosystem of items objects, things,  concepts, as well as the experiences of other people and animals.

When neurons grow and form long term memories this also shapes the paths along which signals will travel, which shapes your mental models, shaping the preference of how signals will travel. 

So long-term changes are happening to your brain on the individual synapse scale, and this leads to changes at the neuron level, at the neural array, neural circuit, and edge community level, at the mini column and cortical column scale, and at the cortical column assembly with other oscillating cell assemblies in the midbrain scales, ie network wide brain activity scale.

The network of the brain is a network of individual neuronal computation that is networked together in feedback loops with excitatory & inhibitory messages to translate spatial patterns into temporal patterns & into changes in neural pathways that tomographically stitch together the outputs or phase wave differential renderings that the mind makes & oscillates into a picture that your mind perceives.

The brain is a network of individual neuron computations that work together in a modular network of interchangeable nodes that shift their configuration to create new patterns of brain activity that specialize in the various kinds of tasks that you might execute in your day to day experience of life.

Your brain activity that can selectively work together to experience and play out mental sequences that correlate with physical actions.

Oscillatory Synchrony drives both cooperation between brain areas and inhibition between out of phase brain areas, resulting in a vast array of cross phase wave differential pattern configurations. 

Configurations that play back combinations of learned patterns that result in sequences of behaviors, learn sequences of behaviors, that connect to rewards in the environment, rewards that are continually modified to drive new consequences, or new rewards (which are also a type of consequence: rewards or penalties are both consequences), but basically new consequences change the learned configurations and the learned playback sequences that play across your brain rendering your mind and your actions.

As the organism navigates the environment, with this neural computation, that I have coined Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, the development of their learned neural pathways and learned brain network configurations continues in perpetuity throughout your lifespan.

Yeah, it's basically it.
