(field) imagine that each node (What did I mean by node when I wrote this? a neuron, a cortical column?) is processing the whole of consciousness but at a different scale & each represents a different perspective in a sea of overlapping perspectives light a display from light field labs where every pixel has a spherical representation of the image pattern from every angle representing the view through that volume of space,

the potential consequence of that is that reality inside our heads closely matches actual reality

Okay I think this note was about how all the little tempo-spatial phase changes in each area of the brain, from the synapse/dendrite scale to the cortical column scale is creating a different part of the lightfield, or a different part of the holographic computational rendering that is the mind.

I think what I was arguing here, but didn't finish, is that the phase changes at a high level result in features 

These are the papers that just came out June 9th that made me think someone had been given access to my book, but its probably a coincidence.

So my book notes and my book is intended to talk about how activity in the synapse scales up to the whole brain, that the picture of a memory is magnified from a single neuron because it alters the timing of the firing of the downstream neurons that the single neuron impacts by inhibiting nearby neurons, (the neuron that fires inhibits nearby neurons to prevent them from firing, the folks at Numenta talk about this in their research) but what I'm saying is that this is like a photocopier effect, essentially magnifying that single memory to the entire cortical column because of the area that is inhibited represents the pattern that neuron represents with its connections.

That creates a phase rendering in the oscillation group of neurons (that is acting like a single sensor/transmitter like a group of firelies referencing the book Sync).

SO the phase changes are constrastive, and that points to how while there is for example a powerband of alpha oscillations for example, within that power band there are multiple alpha frequencies, and the contrastive differences amount to the rendering that makes up the information of your mind, allowing the self to perceive reality and at the same time to be rendered by reality.

This paper is not related to that

the ground of being as the tonic oscillation of unconscious expectation based awareness is like

like the contrastive paper

This next link is an example of deep learning applied to medical imaging, what is interesting is the idea that a synapse which is gap junction between transmitters & receptors can be thought of as a fractal of a neuron, with inhibitory & excitatory neurons having inhibitory & excitatory synapses on them, and functionally speaking a sodium receptor inside a synapse is like an excitatory receptor, and a potassium receptor is like an inhibitory receptor. So we have two fractals levels here. That's before you dive into what is happening inside the receptor. Biology, and reality is so weird. So weird it's actually a functional fractal, not always a geometric fractal, but functionally a fractal, with the same operations happening at different scales. Excitation & inhibition, it's this like positive & negative charges in a functional sense?

Uncovering features of synapses in primary visual cortex through contrastive representation learning
"we show that excitatory vs. inhibitory neuronal cell types can be assigned to individual synapses and highly truncated neurites with accuracy exceeding 99.8%, making this population accessible to connectomics analysis. Finally, we present a data-driven and unsupervised study of the manifold of synaptic structural variation, revealing its intrinsic axes of variation and showing that synapse structure is also strongly correlated with inhibitory neuronal subtypes."

and its like the mnemonic paper
"The mnemonic basis of subjective experience"
"we argue that these subjective qualities can be understood in terms of their similarity to other experiences"
https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00068-6
 
but its also like the description of how human beings see colors, as relative contrasts, or differences
meaning that in human perception patterns are distinct from some baseline pattern
new sensory inputs are contrasted with the tonic oscillations set by past sensory inputs

On a larger scale we can make an argument that the differential firing rates of different large scale clustors of cells provides macro scale contrasts between microscale learned representations so that the organism can differentiate between concepts in its internal representations, or mental imagery, or qualia, or mind.
