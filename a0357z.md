30 years of neuroscience beats 5000 years of philosophy, I've read Wilber and many more. I've also read many neuroscience books. There is no observable mechanism of choice in the mind, it's a self similar structure through out, it does one thing in summary and that is make predictions, these predictions are part of one long chain of cause and effect. We automatically gather the best information we can, and we are automatically doing the best we can with the information we have. Choice really is an illusion, it's an illusion that might trick someone into choosing worse choices instead of better choices. Without choice we really do have to believe we are doing the best we can with the information we have, because technically its true there is no other choice.
From the senses electrical signals representing the frequencies of the world around us travel up the neo-cortex to the hypothalamus and back down again toward the senses. Along the way actions get triggered, feelings get triggered, thoughts get triggered, thoughts that may represent billions of neurons firing all at once. Creating a pattern that you suddenly think is a word that popped into your head just now. Maybe you brought your hands together suddenly. It might be unlikely another person can predict your every action, but we are all somewhat predictable. We can predict that at about 2 years old a baby will start behaving in a very terrible way. They call it terrible twos. Your breathing is automatic, your blood flow, your growth. There are so many obvious signs that you are an automatic being. As sure as a tree we reach for light, nutrients, and resources. When were not doing that there is some information we need, it could be nutrition information, or security information, or philosophical information. We gather information automatically. Stop. Are you still thinking or reading? See automatic. Even perfect zen, perfect stillness of thought is automatic.

that is all true. But in a moment of action, you sebjectivly feel like making a conscious effort, Especially when its a choice for action and an action that pushes you beyond your boundaries. Even if later on and looking backwarda and upon sth everything may seem to have been determined, you cant reduce the inner phenomenological reality. YOu can reframe it, so individuals might lear n ever more what in their choices and actions is actually authentic and what has been given though mechanisms and context. If we may look upon it developmentally for a moment:; you actually deconstruct everything through the course of your life seeing the mechanistic nature of things evermore and more Seen from here: the ongoing deconstruction of your false believes are a relative intensification of your freedm from and too. So there is a gradual defintion of freedm, whcih may make more sense than absolute freem now and forever.
That ongoing of the upward lifting deconstruction is guarenteed by the interaction of Individuals within Society
once again, its actually simple ,so simple you might miss the point first: if you search for an observable free will, you, before you do anything, define free will as observable in a simple sense, right? But free will belongs by the definition of the word, primarily to the subjective realm. Now, if you could actually OBSERVE free will, it would be objective(an object,, something to LOOK UPON), not subjective(that which is looking. When I am Looking at that which is looking, i still just see the outside of that which is looking, not the interior I-look-phenomena). You get it? The criteria you propose is a criteria of OBJECTIVE TRUTH, not SUBJECTIVE Truthfulness. BY THE LOGICAL VERBAL DEFINITIONS OF THESE WORDS you cant reduce them onto each other without getting logical chaos. That means, that the goal of science when researching anything like free will must be reframed, because an "objectivist method" like natural science can find what is "Objectively True", subjetcigvist methods find what is subjectivly true

I understand the issue your raising however your making some terrible assumptions "you cant reduce the inner phenomenological reality" oh can't I? The you that you are isn't really an individual, it's a collective, a collective of cells, singing the song of "I am". Everything you can sense, every feeling, every concept, every experience, and thought is a prediction. What you think is you is actually a network of electro-chemical reactions, it's 100 percent reactive. There is zero control, and the only think your mind does in summary is make predictions. The concepts of choice and freewill lend themselves as predictions, means of explaining the actions of others when they diverge from your own. No balloon can choose to stop rising toward the ceiling. The only reason some balloons rise higher is that their corner of ceiling is higher. In this sense what we mistake for choice is more like altitude. As your awareness expands through life, your prediction-altitude increases, and you automatically make better choices. Literally some people are stuck thinking they are somewhat less than perfect because they are trying to hold onto the illusion of choice. Lose the illusion of choice today, it's the only way to perfection. :)
