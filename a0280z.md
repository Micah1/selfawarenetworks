Protein Oscillation Tomography & Protein Signal Processing & Novel Protein Function, Protein-RNA interaction with Cells.

# Protein Oscillation Tomography.
Cutting to the question of what a single neuron can do, can it self regulate? Well this says that a single protein is capable of integrating multiple signals, so the concept of Cellular Oscillating Tomography applies to individual proteins.

Proteins detect coincident or temporarily cascading activation patterns, because of their distinct structure & react or activate behaviors based on those incoming signals. The behaviors or functions or reactions that individual proteins make to novel or new incoming sensed patterns effect a computation of future protein structures, or computed biological structures, that go beyond random mutation, but are still subject to natural selection.

"We present a general model of reversible protein modification networks and demonstrate that a single protein modified by several enzymes is capable of integrating multiple signals into robust digital decisions by switching between multiple forms that can activate distinct cellular processes"

Protein-RNA 

Biology is more badass than many realize. Protein-RNA can turn into a drop of liquid that needs no membrane, it's viscoelasticity becomes programmed with a custom time interval before the Protein-RNA becomes solid again. This is beyond human technology today, but not tomorrow.
