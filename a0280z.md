Protein Oscillation Tomography & Protein Signal Processing & Novel Protein Function, Protein-RNA interaction with Cells.

# Protein Oscillation Tomography.
Cutting to the question of what a single neuron can do, can it self regulate? Well this says that a single protein is capable of integrating multiple signals, so the concept of Cellular Oscillating Tomography applies to individual proteins.

Proteins detect coincident or temporarily cascading activation patterns, because of their distinct structure & react or activate behaviors based on those incoming signals. The behaviors or functions or reactions that individual proteins make to novel or new incoming sensed patterns effect a computation of future protein structures, or computed biological structures, that go beyond random mutation, but are still subject to natural selection.

"We present a general model of reversible protein modification networks and demonstrate that a single protein modified by several enzymes is capable of integrating multiple signals into robust digital decisions by switching between multiple forms that can activate distinct cellular processes"

To develop NAPOT theory even further, even more detailed studies are needed to map the actual physics of how cells communicate. The general theory ought to hold, even as specifics are added in such as how exactly vesicle fusion occurs. How exactly the Dendritic memories are calculated on before their summations end up changing what the neuron produces in its exit terminal. Finally a detailed map & model that predicts the exact phase changes that a neuron will produce given a wide range of possible combinations of messages that it's receptors will have at once time or over time. In the latter case the potential message complexity that a neuron can receive is vast, reducable perhaps only in terms of likely messages, and in terms of the finite number of ways the neuron might respond to the signals it's receiving.

"“The brain is an amazing network of communications,” said Rizo-Rey. “When a cell gets excited by electrical signals, very fast synaptic vesicle fusion occurs. The neurotransmitters come out of the cell and bind to receptors on the synaptic side. That’s the signal and this process is very fast.”"
"“Supercomputers weren’t powerful enough to resolve this problem of how transmission was occurring in the brain. So for a long time, I used other methods,” he said. “However, with Frontera, I can model 6 million atoms and really get a picture of what’s going on with this system.”"

"Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to visualize the pre-fusion primed state during synaptic vesicle fusion is very original and this approach will certainly be used by others in the future. This work provides new insights into the protein organization prior to vesicle fusion that will help better understand the mechanisms of vesicle priming and evoked-release."

Protein-RNA 

Biology is more badass than many realize. Protein-RNA can turn into a drop of liquid that needs no membrane, it's viscoelasticity becomes programmed with a custom time interval before the Protein-RNA becomes solid again. This is beyond human technology today, but not tomorrow.
