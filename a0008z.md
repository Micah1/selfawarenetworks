# My 2014 Neurons are transmitting their shapes theory revised.

Originally from 2014. This was my long lost equation for the neuron & brain as a fractal of a neuron, found again in 2022. I just updated it with some new knowledge.

How do you describe the action potential of a neuron with a differential equation?

The rate of Change in Delta X - the rate of Change in Delta Y = Z the delta of vesicle release per interval relative to the rest of the group oscillation (referring to the oscillating group of cells that the neuron is oscillating with).

(something needs to be added to the equation of a neuron for a computational implementation that represents thresholds for receptor spikes, dendritic spikes, and soma spikes, but otherwise the main point is understandable in theory, at the network level, an equation to represent on going changes in synaptic configurations + simulated morphological changes, that encode what memories the neuron physically represents via it's structural configuration, which determines what inputs it responds to, and the degree of it's response)

X is the balance of positive charge in the dendrite branches & or the soma, possibly from sodium influx.

Y is the balance of negative charge in the same dendritic branches and or the soma, possibly from potassium outflux.

1968: "Sodium and potassium fluxes in isolated barnacle muscle fibers" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5651768/

If we triggered all the receptors at once we might have maximum potassium outflux, and thus an inhibited neuron.

If we triggered enough of just the sodium receptors, without triggering all the receptors, and we triggered them fast enough, we might get enough sodium in to create a phasic or a high phasic action potential burst.

By high phasic I point to studies on high gamma as one type of high phasic signal
Reduced neural feedback signaling despite robust neuron and gamma auditory responses during human sleep"
"Next, we focused on auditory-induced high-gamma (80–200 Hz) power responses, which are known to be closely linked to neuronal firing rates in human auditory cortex37, and compared them across wakefulness and NREM sleep. The results revealed highly robust auditory-induced high-gamma responses (Fig. 3a–d; additional examples in Extended Data Fig. 4). The magnitudes of high-gamma responses in NREM sleep were not significantly different from those in wakefulness"

When the soma bursts triggering a phasic or high phasic action potential event, the energy it sends from X to Y balances out the neurons's charge distribution topographically. From a polarized displacement of charges from the rate of change of X exceeding the rate of change in Y, the neuron becomes depolarized.

The quantity of potassium in the cell at the moment of depolarization determines the wave shape, also called the magnitude, but specifically it means the duration of time that the calcium channels on the exit terminals are open, which determines the quantity of the release of vesicle sacks filled with neurotransmitters.

"Using genetically encoded calcium and NT sensors, we further revealed that both calcium dynamics within the PVT-BLA:NT projection and NT concentrations in the BLA are enhanced after reward learning and reduced after punishment learning. "

Basically the neurotransmitters are attractors, so there is nothing special about neurotensin or dopamine and these researchers just haven't put the puzzle pieces together yet. The gradient quantities of NT a great for timing, which is essential for movement at the speed that animals move.
"Researchers Identify Molecule That Orchestrates Association of Events With Positive and Negative Memories"
"It turns out to be a molecule—a neuropeptide that acts as a neurotransmitter—called neurotensin."

Essentially the excess charge, quantified by the potassium ions, is sent via a variation in the number of neurotransmitters released to downstream neurons.

This is how one neuron transmits it's excess charges to the next neural array: The vesicle release of neurotransmitters through the synapse to the dendrite of another neuron.

Z, the delta of vesicle or neurotransmitter release is the next neural array's new topographical distribution of electrical charges (via the stimulation & opening of receptors on the post synapse) AND the it reflections the neurons:

1. cell body shape (morphology)(morphological changes to dendrites, and new proteins resulting from reactions, and new spines all of which change the responsive properties of the cell)

2. connections (synaptic connections define what a neuron response to and what it doesn't, synaptic connections are a cell's learned memory response. The physical pattern it has grown to respond to.) connections

3. connection morphology or the types of connections matter, when potassium receptors are anchored together with ankeryn repeats they become mechano sensitive or sensitive to mechanical waves like touch.

4. a variance in it's electrical charge density (from lost or gained neurotransmitters before the some burst or action potential event.)

5. oscillator state (what part of it's oscillation cycle it's in.)

6. the state of each of it's receptors (whether it's receptors are active, inhibited (blocked) etc.)

All of which result in distinctly new signals, with new frequencies, magnitudes, and oscillation phase changes disbursed through the brain.

Distributed via a new path of connections which change as electrical thresholds are reached in specific areas.

The neuron is transmitting it's phase change, but the meaning of that phase change comes down to what the neurons in it's exit terminal have learned to respond to. It's as if the neuron is a blinking LED to all of the neurons in it's exit terminal. 

The Dendrites are the observers of signals, the Exit Terminal Burstlet is like a television display pixel for the next array of dendrites, and the physics of oscillation are binding the picture together at the cell assembling (or oscillating body of cells) scale.

When brains (cortical columns (neurons (dendrites))) receive neurotransmitters, or fire because of an imbalance between positive and negative ions, the result is topological change, topological changes that a combination of category theory and differential calculus would be very useful to describe.

These are changes happening in a grid (brain),
 
These changes are brainwaves in a grid (the outer cerebral cortex),

This is brainwave activity between cortical colums (connected to the edges of a grid (inner myelinated axon fibers visualized in DTI).

This brainwave activity is literally the result of electrical diffusion of potential differences from action potentials in neurons (in a 3D grid that is the brain),

and action potentials in dendrites in a grid (neurons)

and action potentials from receptors on the cell body such as NMDA & AMPA receptors.

Another way to understand this, is that the Neuron is both passing on excess energy (above it's threshold) and encoding a topological change that means it has been effected by the brainwave that (came close, ended on it, or passed through it) (a simple way of remembering one point of the wave) (which may through connections, unintentionally encode the represention of a vector pattern between points of neurons that fired)

Neurons are information programs that transmit a phase change that represents the activation of a memory it learned to respond to through grown synaptic connections or not respond to via pruned synaptic connections.

In a valid sense the neuron is reporting it's learned morphology including it's synaptic connection configuration to the rest of it's oscillatory group. The learned morphology is going to affect the equation at the topic, the rate of change in X - the rate in change in Y. If a neuron grows a lot of new receptors, sodium or potassium receptors, that changes the core equation, the rates of change in X & Y, so a neuron can grow more sensitive or less sensitive with more receptors depending on the type, the location, and the types of incoming signals the neuron is receptive to, because of morphological changes to it's leaky membrane that might dissipate charge increments coming in with certain patterns, or the cell might act on charge increments with certain other patterns based on it's morphological structure.



A new protein, such as what happens during LTP changes the cells morphology, the cell has now grown, so it's response is altered slightly.

# In 2014 I called this the Neurons are transmitting their shapes theory.
My conjecture back then was: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topopology is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topopology is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.

In 2014 I argued that you could store infinity in a curve, in the curves of the morphology of a neuron, in mathematics you can, but can the protein structure of a neuron represent the infinity of a curve? and what is transmitted is argued to be an SDR, a sparse distributed representation of the whole, a tiny statistical fraction of the vast amount of information that might be in the ever changing topography of a neuron!

The idea I had (in 2014) was that the neuron is transmitting a program that is a temporal/spatial metaphor of it's shape, into a fractal brain, that is doing the same thing, so it's like a temporal spatial metaphor on both the individual neuron level, and the neural network level.

This theory was an attempt to explain how we can have both distributed representations, or concepts that including the firing of entire brainwaves, and also individual cells that have individual memories.

Imagine that when you first learn to move your hand it takes up an enormous amount of mental resources. Massive brainwave activity. Then the peaks of this massive brainwave activity are slowly represented by neural connections to just the peaks, the highs and lows, as well as the lefts and rights, to a single neuron then links the edges so that no longer do you need the whole brain to spike to represent that whole brain wave, when a single neuron can just fire and trigger the neurons at the peak of the brainwave that caused your movement. Thus overtime moving your hand takes less and less mental energy. As what was once represented by a whole brain, is reduced into spatial temporal representations in the connections and body of a single neuron. The learned connections of one neuron represent a reduced energy efficient memory of a pattern that used to require many cells to represent.

It takes more than a single neuron to coordinate your hand, but you get the point about reduction of a large spatial metaphor to a small spatial metaphor.

It's a story to try to explain HOW a single neuron may store the memory of an entire brainwave.

By connecting to the neurons at the x, y, z peaks of that brainwave
it's physical form and connections create a distinct signature, and what we need for a distinct memory is a distinct signature
that's what you say, but you haven't provided an actual counterargument that articulates both my position and why it doesn't work

"With all the proteins that define a neuron, there is an extreme amount of "information" complexity in it's structure."
https://www.coursera.org/course/sysbio

A cell does not have to communicate the entire complexity of it's structure, instead it communicates an SDR, a tiny fractional set of data representing a few points representing the distinct nature of it's structure.

A cell does not have to represent every aspect of the brainwave, only an SDR, or a fractional set of data representing a few points that describe the distinct pattern of that brainwave.

BIG NOTE: I am not saying or suggesting that neurons can communicate an infinite amount of information, someone took that away from what I wrote, that would be a total misunderstanding of what I wrote.

Neurons communicate a sparse distributed representatio (SDR) of their complex structure (meaning their dendritic sensor structure that defines the memory they have grown to represent via its synaptic connections & morphological properties) storing an infinite amount of information and communicating an infinite amount of information are two different things entirely.

It's the difference almost between sending a photograph of Taj Mahal and sending the actual Taj Mahal. Like a pixelated (sparse) representation of infinite curves.

A photograph being an SDR of the actual place. The phase transmitted by a neuron represents a sparse pattern (I think of it like an LED light) that it's exit terminal can recognize via their learned patterns. It's Exit Terminal (or the Down Stream Neural Array) is receiving many LED patterns from many neurons, so the exit terminal arrays get the full TV screen, and the signal from this one neuron represents just one pixel of that TV screen. (The tv screen is a visual metaphor, but the arrays of signals can represent any kind of modality, sound, touch, concepts, ideas, or a spatial pattern at one interval of time, like the frame of a move, or a moment in a sound track)

# Stanford's Neurogrid paper 2021

I remember discussing Stanford's Neurogrid project in 2014. I remember they had a novel approach, they were able to build their own chipset, I can't recall if it was from one of those overseas companies that let people design their own chip, they fabricate it and sell it to you. I think I remember looking into doing my own chip design after reading about Neurogrid. I was surprised to see a 2021 update to Neurogrid. In the paper linked below they break down the algorthim for their artificial simulation of biology. It's a good read.

If Neurogrids neurons are dimensionless & all the same how can they selectively respond to some patterns and ignore others?

At first glance the Neurogrid does not appear model Plateau potentials, APD Action Potential Duration, or the variation in Calcium Ca2+ channel duration that might caused by the quantity of Potassium K+ and other factors, resulting in a change in the quantity of vesicle release.

At first glance I'm not seeing Neurogrid model how individual synapses on the Apical Dendrite (or the neurons exit terminal array) might be up regulated or down regulated based on various factors (such as the synaptic & dendritic activity in the basal dendrite, the Soma burst AP wave shape, or cyclic-AMP signalling (up or down regulation of the Apical exit terminal resulting from basal dendritic stimulation, or metabotropic receptors in the basal dendrite)

I do not see Neurogrid modelling variation in the number of vesicles released or the magnitude of Neurotransmitter release.

Figure 2.1 Neurogrid uses the leaky integrate-and fire model of a neuron.

"The unit amplitude pulse prise(t)’s width trise models the duration for which neurotransmitter is
available in the cleft following a pre-synaptic spike." So instead of a variation in the delta or the quantity of neurotransmitters released they have created a duration for how long neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft. If you have more neurotransmitters released during an AP it would take longer for the biology to clear them out, and for that synapse to reset, but if you are releasing the same quantity of neurotransmitters each time how would there be a situation where it takes the biology a greater duration to reset the synaptic cleft?
"This address-event bus has been successfully used to build networks with thousands of neurons
with a few hundred synaptic connections each [7]. It has not scaled beyond millions of synaptic connections,
the point at which traffic saturates the bus’ signaling rate.
To break this communication bottleneck, Neurogrid adopts a hybrid analog–digital approach that follows
design principles the neocortex uses to minimize its wiring [8]. Neurogrid uses fast digital routers, operating
serially, to replicate signals for distribution and uses slow analog circuits, operating in parallel, to sum signals
for aggregation."

In effect Neurogrid has made the dendritic branches & the synapses obsolete by making them wireless. The question is are they throwing out the baby with the bathwater? They are just delivering signals, between the branches of pre & post synapses via network routing, like twitter messages.

"Moreover, extending several dendritic branches to meet a terminal branch of an axon allows that branch
to make multiple synapses (bouton cluster) [19] (figure 1(b), top). Synaptic signals from many axons sum in
a dendritic branch and these branches’ signals aggregate hierarchically. This principle minimizes the dendritic
tree’s wiring [18]."

What matters, and I'm not sure their model accounts for it, are factors like the growth & decay of synaptic connections, the up or down regulation of individual synapses, adaptions to the morphology of the dendrite that make its responses more adaptive or less adaptive to certain memories, and receptor specific adaptions to or away from certain kinds of sensory stimulus.

The synaptic & dendritic configuration needs to be grow or decay to be responsive to selectively respond to certain neural patterns that it represents with it's high dimensional morphology, and it needs to be able to dynamically change it's response to the patterns it has learned on a case by case basis.

Virtualizing the dendritic branches & synapses into router messages should be fine as long as you are allowing the synapses & branches to grow, decay, and vary in their high dimensional response so that they can be selectively in their responses, and capable of tuning their response outputs to the rest of the network.

"Importantly, Neurogrid achieves scale and efficiency without sacrificing biophysical detail"
I am not able to agree with Neurogrid's conclusion at this time. I think they have sacrificed essential biophysical detail.
