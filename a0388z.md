(dendrite, quantum, decoherence)
Quantum effects work with my theory, but my theory also works without them,

You see if a ripple emerges from the microtubule, it might be added to dendrite which is counting incoming electrical charge, accumulating sodium ions for example, the signal from the microtuble might add to that charge, and it could be the tipping point of the signal that causes the neuron to fire, however I think its likely that the quantum signal from the microtubule will be in most cases too small to effect the firing of the neuron, but either way my hypothesis for how consciousness works with the quantum physics element, and without it.
