The reality that you see is a computational rendering. It's not that Anil Seth was wrong when he said that we hallucinate reality. He's right. It's just that there is another way to describe what we are doing. Our brains are rendering a representation of reality and our selves with computed graphics, the natural neural networks of our minds are rendering reality similar to how neural networks can render 3D graphics in a computer. When makes it conscious then is the activity loop. The Cycle of brain activity learning reality through sensory computation inside the oscillatory activity, across network nodes, in a multi-scale functionally fractal manner over time.

Predicting Reality with Predictive Coding
Reality as a cinematic illusion
Reality as a Hallucination
Computational Rendering in a feedback loop.
It's that your whole brain is echoing itself creating a holographic feedback loop.

I created a new term HFL Holographic Feedback Loop
Or a set of Neural Arrays passing Phases Patterns that represent learned data that is rendered to the next array.

The feedback loop travels through neural & glial cell activity. It's a feedback loop of arrays that see other arrays and create an image for yet further arrays in an endless looping cycle of neuron arrays learning other neuron arrays and creating multi scale models of the world, but also create memories of multiple representations that are stored at the level of individual group oscillations that can be magnefied into focus when you are aware of that pattern or set of patterns at a particular moment. So the brain is dynamically fluid rendering machine.

But yeah, I guess like that's the thing like we don't like I get like the there's one trust like one transformation of of sound happens right when it hits the wood for example, right it becomes mechanical energy, but then that mechanical energy has to be converted into electrical energy and we're referred to we transit transduce through the rest of the tree to hit the roots and the fungi for example, that's that's that's where I'm like, Sort of.

00:31

Stuck.

00:40
It's so Carla is there like action potential in the tree. Action potential as far as I can just ions moving through. I really only know this as like a physical. Theft, you know. I haven't been able to you know, examine excellence but. But so so basically, you know, when a when a bird sings it's not just a bird saying.

01:18
Oh vibrating everything that it's made of. So technically. Resonating. This body so these minerals then basically speak to the same minerals in the tree and fungi I system and so basically it's. Um, it's also that but then I mean, we also have the basic electricity flowing through the tree anyway from photosynthesis, so there's like a lot of different types of electricity actually flowing through the tree, but the reason well just as a.

02:07
I mean I'm saying not to do it because I know how it works but basically like the reason that I would be able to know that it travels through the fungi as an electricity is because there's a delay. So you can get a delay and then you get one tree you can tell it's only one in the distance that will come that will output that sound.

02:37
Well so then I guess the yeah, I can totally see how like the mechanical vibrations are gonna go along the tree no different than if I take like a two by four and I cannot hit the end of one certainly gonna vibrate at the other end but I'm still curious as to how it would propagate the signal because that mechanical resonance is going to dissipate over time just purely passively, right?

03:04
So somehow that signal needs to be I guess quote unquote amplified exactly wrong along the pathway otherwise, it's just gonna dissipate out otherwise like there can be no ever-ending. Transduction. Well, it's definitely being. Because.

03:29
So. So basically when you hear the sound of how this works, it's literally the whole breed that's going and it's like really it's I guess it's kind of unimaginable so. Sorry for throwing it at you like that because even when I've like tested this in other people's presence, it is still don't believe what's happening because it kind of defies your idea of what the tree is connecting but I think what I what I'm kind of trying to get is that you have soft skirt wood on the outside and you have harder wood on the inside and so the softer would allow.

04:23
It to be echoed and amplified further and the hardwood is is.

04:34
I you made it yourself. I think.

04:41
Okay, can I ask I just add a quick question was I was sort of half listening were you talking about like an actual tree a tree made out of fungus a dendritic tree that's part of it, you know, like a neuron like what I was sort of half listening but it's really interesting.

04:59
To the functionality of the neurons and I'm trying to see the similarities because I mean, if you think about it if the universe is if the universe uses physics homogeneously everywhere then the patterns that we see are not just visual, you know happenstances. They are they very well can be representative of the the same functionality.

05:34
So just like the fungi are actually like considered the neural network of the forest what I'm trying to see is the exact functional components that basically do the same thing in the same pattern. So, I'm curious as it. The limb and like with like really fine or really precise recording equipment and record it changes and find temporal skill like like electrical changes.

06:11
It's very, can you repeat that? So, I'm assuming the fun guy connecting the roof is the mycelium, right? Yes. And so I'm was wondering if there has ever been somebody who can kind of go in and find currents in the mycelium that are are transmitting the electrical electrical signals with like whatever fine recording equipment, you know, that needs to be done used with.

06:42
Well it's it's actually long been known. Fungi and mushrooms carry electricity. So that's kind of like that's been around for like I don't know like 80 years or something. But I try to record as far as like the sound going into the root systems, but it's really hard and you don't want to damage the root systems in place because every time you break the soil, you're actually like, you know releasing more carbon into the atmosphere which isn't great.

07:13
So yeah, a couple times one is um, I guess everything in the cosmos is part. Of the electromagnetic spectrum right So we would expect the electricity to be everywhere and to be to be part of any sound signaling. But I think that like also like, you know, when you if you if you strum a guitar then, you know, there's there's sound vibrating throughout the guitar but we wouldn't necessarily describe that as electricity flowing through the guitar but but in a sense you can't separate the sound from electricity because everything is the electromagnetic spectrum one.

07:48
But also, I was thinking how to stop there for a second. Well, I mean, if you think of it sound is sound is made by the movement, right? And so it's like a layer. So you need movement to to create any type of electricity. So sound is an inheritance inherent property of electricity regardless of like if we are cognizant of the sound it is just an inherent property of other I don't think sound is like light where it's part it's just a part of the electromagnetic field.

08:27
Sound is a, Sound requires air and it's a so acoustic vibrations is just the mechanical progression of rarified air and compressed air moving through space. And so and and I don't even think that's gonna be enough to create static electricity. So, you know, it's there's no electricity as movement of electrons across the medium, you know, usually a metal something that's conductive so any conductor.

09:04
S like one of the worst conductors it's basically a giant capacitor where no electricity could move through a very little and. And so there if sound is making something turning something into electricity there needs to be like a sort of transducer that's responsible for that but sound on its own does does not create electrics, it does not move electrons, you know, it's just come it's a mechanical pressure.

09:34
I mean, that is nothing air that is.

09:43
I'm really just looking for the the parallels of the neuron functionality, you know. I super appreciate like all the other input but but I basically proven everything in my research already and so so it's kind of like like you know, it's it's fine to to analyze it from your perspective but like I can I can show you how it works like it's not it's like it's it's a it's a thing that actually functions oh no.

10:18
We're just like we're just trying to like understand because it's so novel to us. I mean, that's pretty cool it's like it's like our wrap our minds are from it, we're just like trying to figure it out. If you think about it in just terms. Feedback system. Just think about.

10:40
So we're like okay there's this many animals in the forest and as they sing their little songs and do their little things for us the tree picks up their sounds and is turning that into electricity the electricity helps to make it rain so that more plants can grow to actually keep those animals alive in the forest this is this is a system of balance and feedback, so it's like hey guys, how many of you are out there, oh that many okay, we're gonna need more plants, alright so rain we.

11:15
Need rain okay, let's do the red thing so I mean it's it's kind of like super simple but and I mean, I know it's hard to like picture or like kind of understand but but it but it's also like I feel like it's also simple but that's you know, everybody feels like that when they're doing something well, I guess I guess like as far as the comparisons between neuronal signal transduction or the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into.

11:50
An electrical activity. I don't think the comparison can be made is as far as like we know it right now from the explanation just because we have no idea like in a tree if that you know, the vibrations are somehow converted by any sort of mechano trans like I should say mechanical sensitive channels into an electrical current.

12:14
So I think that part is completely different between the two systems. But yeah, and then also the fact that whenever you're propagating a signal typically you're opening up channels along the way which within sort of this biological field that you're describing it doesn't seem like that's the case either.

12:36
So I think, I mean, I've never I've never patched a mushroom and hit a tree so I you know, if I if I hate a fun guy in the ground and I had F yell at the tree and I measured a deflection in voltage. I think first of all, I would probably like.

12:58
Fall over because of my astonishment not that I don't doubt that it's there but. Yeah, I just I don't even know how we would go about measuring that.

13:12
I you have curious if you are going to have your thesis on this. I would be interested in just getting into the nitty-gritty if if that's out. I have a like basically my work on my website but I'm an independent researcher and I'm just trying to save the world.

13:37
So, so I think this group. You've done to the ecosystems because part of the the vibrational transduction is resistant. So when they use this in electrical production, they use diamagnetic materials and the thing I know about this system inherently is that well one fungi have just a slew of minerals.

14:10
And and that's how they're able to you know. Them out to the forest network. But, They collect. A goal. Grow from it and there was some it was some research done in Australia about this, but the thing about gold is that of course it's a diameter element and it's also it has biological components.

14:40
So, So basically I'm pretty certain that that the forest and the ecosystems. Gold. To help propagate the electricity through the ecosystems and I think actually that the mining of gold. Haired the electricity in this network as so yeah, but but fungi like they'll just collect gold and they'll just like grow from it because they grow from electricity.

15:19
And so gold is there is their jam. But yeah. So is there is there any references or publications that have recorded the transduction of the energy from the tree to the fungi, no no.

15:44
So this is this is antic anecdotal theoretical hypothesis, it's really not. I it's just what? Well, I mean it has it hasn't been published or anything. I haven't published it yet so yeah, so I was just saying this point it's it's still a theoretical hypothesis, right? I guess yeah.

16:08
Um so going back to what people said earlier it it's not really necessary if the if the electricity is a good strong enough poles for the sounds if the sound being converted into electricity is strong enough like for example in the in the case of electrical impedance demography, you don't need to amplify the electricity at all for to flow through neural tissue or through a tree it is it what might what would happen if the electricity signal is strong enough is that it will flow through, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.

16:57
In in in in terms of understanding the house hand is affecting trees and that would be industries are generating electricity so EIT you could use that to to prove that trees are our turning sound into electricity but um, another thing that I think is that if it's true that the sounds of animals in the forest are are causing trees to create rain you could play music you could play the sounds of animals to trees and see if that triggers rain and and then just like measure if the, Frequency of rain increase that year because you were you were playing um, Lots of sounds of animals and then you could you could prove your hypothesis.

17:52
Each animal in this forest system is eating the plants in this forest system, so it has all of the minerals and the elements from that specific forest system, so when it sings it's it's not it's not just you know sound it's also everything every mineral that it had collected from the forest and from living in that forest.

18:18
And so it is specifically related in that way and I did try you know a recording and didn't work but I will say that again, please don't go singing to trace because it's not it's. Not our place. But I did do it and what happens is um, you end up seeing little.

18:50
Like little puffs of clouds start to appear in the sky and that's just what's happened every time so yeah, even if that you know, you may think well, oh well that was your like thing that you saw that's not empirical but that happened every time it will happen every time so it's not it's at this point.

19:15
It's really not a thing. I I just I just know that this is how this works and but anyway, sorry. I think it's very it's certainly the most interesting thing. I've heard this week. I think at this point I remain skeptical which is totally five more scientists were skeptical about everything but I think until unequivocal evidence has been proven.

19:42
I'm gonna remain skeptical on that one, but it is an interesting thought. Okay, well thanks guys, yeah, thanks girl.

20:00
Does anybody have a really questions?

20:06
I though of like, I do like sort of thinking about things in other networks and just relating. It in a broad sense, like how things are similar to each other.

20:24
Yeah, definitely. I mean. Certainly interesting to even within like the same. System so in this case like, um the same organism you see. How some they're simply like similarities across different of what I guess like different organs and like how it works and that sometimes helpful for like furthering research.

21:01
Yeah, certainly uh was a mental exercise, which is good.

21:09
I I couldn't understand like at first what would it was then? I was like, oh wait, hang on now it makes it. So after you uh, you doing more recordings this week. Yeah yeah, um, oh my name is Scott by the way, I just messed up my name because I was trying not to use my last name so huh yeah and now I'm just used to everybody calling me up but yeah, yeah.

21:40
I have what so we had a problem breeding our mice so we have like eight cages going there's like finally one litter and that we use. So we believe me and the end of the postdoc we're like sharing these mice like like one day. I would slice one day he would slice in his plane one day.

21:58
I'd slice in my plane and he would just like be taking the the leftover slice and just getting a couple extra cells because the real name five miles. But uh, we used four and then I was gonna save. It's like older now and it's past P30 so I was just gonna I have like one more good data collecting mouse and then I'm gonna use the rest of the week for just you know, practicing how fast I can get my slit.

22:22
I haven't sliced in a while like 2020 was basically like dead for me, so I need to get back in the swing of things still so I'm just, you know, getting rid of the de noising my rig etc. How old can you record up to for your experimental prep?

22:38
Oh, it's just about health like. 8:30's great for me. I mean Thursday, I recorded from a p seven hundred miles and I got two cells. It was just way harder. Yeah, see we after P10 that's about our limit. So we got to get the brain stems up like P5 to P10 like.

23:00
Oh, wow. That's that's small. Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, it's a fine motor controls game. I guess. 30 miles. I was gonna say I was gonna say so what one thought for for Nick was is that book, um rhythms of the I think it was rhythm, so the brain maybe that mighty bit not be the right total the title, but.

23:33
Yeah is that relevant to your work neck. I was just curious. To be honest and I just heard about it through clubhouse. But potential I heard about it through my advisors, it's legit it's it's like the best. I hope to check it out yeah. I mean, I've heard it but I honestly haven't read it.

23:56
Is it like what kind of rhythms is it looking like large-scale brain wave activity or all the way down to like single cell type of rhythmic activity? I think it's okay.

24:14
The first chapter but he he definitely opens it up talking about large scale stuff. I don't know how much he's gonna get into resonance but he really takes a like approach of explaining how it's generated so he's definitely gonna cover all the bases, you know, he talks about oscillators and like what's needed for operation?

24:34
I ended up like citing that in my grant that book in my a bunch of times because it's just explained so it's explained so well, Interesting yeah, let's take a look because yeah, my field of studies coined is rhythm generation, so. It's probably take a look at that.

24:55
Bye. Take outside of the box of the persistent sodium burst themselves and the recurrent synaptic excitation. Yeah, that author has two books and I'm currently reading them both but I I I haven't I can't speak to the whole book but I think they're I think he's trying to cover the topic of it oscillations from micro to macro.

25:22
I'm good. Give me the SparkNotes. Sure, um, I was gonna say sure but I was.

25:40
N't really read through that. What does he start talking about in that book?

25:46
You may say let me just pull it up and I'll refresh myself.

25:52
Did anybody have any questions? Come. Hi this is Alicia Evalu just here in Germany and. My results field is on stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, morally. We do research and the gravitational zero gene conditions to explore the impact of zero g on the sides and very excited about your guys discussing about science.

26:30
I was wondering whether you guys would like to to. For science communication group, where maybe you will explain. Neuroscience research in a very simple flight way to the common public so that would be really great like so I was wondering whether you have some sort of spare time to join the club.

26:59
Sure, absolutely. And the Dallas the platform. That's the science communication platform where we wealth itself. So basically, you have to just explain. Your like. Research area or something, you know, very closely for example yesterday we discuss about unity and vaccine how it works. Like very funny way so people have their queries and they put understand it and then they can easily understand the common people who are not associated with the biology or biological terms.

27:50
So we are planning monthly once now since we could not able to. Gather a lot of audience so far, but maybe slowly we will and yeah the the topic switch we are so far covering like gene editing. Stem cells then then vaccine yesterday, so I was wondering who can like help me with the club, maybe that could be really nice.

28:28
If you guys do another recommended inviting like Ramsey and Paul probably in addition. Should always explain anything ramps any kind of knows a little bit of everything and it makes you know those people. Yeah, yeah. Yeah all there's Ramsey there's Clayton there's also good Scott rich, he's also good as well yeah just to just be because the audience has really.

29:03
From the anywhere they don't connect with biology, so they do not have a single like kind of idea what the what the things but when we explain them giving example of some movies some kind of characters some kind of weapons some kind of play so they nicely correlate what exactly happening in a very actual manner and they enjoyed it and they get involved and which I also believe and it's very nice thing, they should more public.

29:38
Should believe and more public should interact with science and that's a that's how we we made a club there so so if you guys want then this will be really great that to talk about your neuroscience research something. Yeah, if you're a invite I just I just followed you if you send us an invite to the clubs and feel free to contact I got a bounce here pretty quick, but Scott how how do I get how do we get in contact with each other you don't have any yeah.

30:23
Okay. I just followed you on twitter. Oh perfect there we go because eventually we you guys set up a mechanisms of neuroscience rumors or something yeah that's always that's what we need we need. I need to like get some practice hosting rooms if people are here just to people are even more interesting about this neural links, you know about some disease which you may explain because it's your expertise like some older people want to listen about to the Alzheimer about multiplication, maybe this kind of.

31:02
Top six. Often facing old days homes and they want to get involved and want to know. So many in simple way if you guys help that will be really wonderful. Yeah I did go into an early link around the other day. I was trying to keep it realistic and I noticed so these things are so room dependent some rooms like they're really down to keep it really scientific and other rooms it just gets taken over and they don't want to hear like others kind of go.

31:37
I don't know I'm new to Clubhouse but I'm realizing like people are if you go into if you let people if going into sudo science other people will just like jump in and then it gets huge and then they then like, The people who know what they're talking about and the believing like you know, and so I if I was gonna start a room.

31:56
So Nick if we talk back inisms of stuff we should I probably need to figure out or practice how to how to approach when the pseudoscience takes over especially for reasons of time, you know, and like how to politely I don't know how to like, To learn myself Um so maybe I can help with that so like I mean, I have a ton of experience as a as a moderator in terms of I you know, basically over ten years of moderating groups and podcasts and stuff and and it is to keep the audience's interests and to keep the speakers interested you do have to sort of like if someone searches taught starts to take things off topic, whether it's pseudoscience or just off topic really period, then you've got to sort of, you know, maybe do like a reset and and move people back to the audience if The conversation's not relevant to what people came for.

32:59
Nice. Yeah, it's a it's an art. I tend to be a little bit just the caution if anybody starts diagnosing things or giving suggestions for medical advice or getting way too pie in this guy. I just kind of come in and say, I agree that phenomenon might be occurring that for mechanisms that have been unmeasured but at this time I think we're still, you know, skeptical to the ideas, so keep it more towards the the known facts for the sake of the audience that maybe not in the research world.

33:35
Yeah, definitely. But yeah, I definitely want to get into making mechanisms so part of my thesis is actually generation of gamma oscillations from PV intern around fast-working internet. So so definitely would be interested in any any sort of neurotok so I followed Yeah, I'm following everybody here. So yeah interested.

33:59
Yeah, like some physicists also they explain about black holes, it's very funny way. Really like engaging. I mean, I mean, Usually we used to. We go to church we go. Where the publics are like really. I really really have no clue and they have their own perception about something for example when it's stem cells means they used to think maybe killing the gene editing they used to think think it's a dangerous and it can create some human animal hybrids.

34:48
It's kind of something up to break and we have to be very polite when it's extremely polite to be because they have a perception that scientists are quite arrogant, so we.

51:08
I'm.

54:47
If.

59:23
You.

59:42
Unlimit Singapore. To I don't know how much more of our introduction do you need? So my question is what's the confusion with? The reality that you guys have like why so much credence to?

01:00:07
Well, one of the basics simulation there is is that at some points very near future.

01:00:16
Achievable and the theory is that if a society is able to create. And if a society is able to create one simulation, it will create lots of situations and therefore the chance that we are actually. Universe and not a simulation is very low if there's a huge number of simulations that we created.

01:00:41
This is one of the original thoughts of simulation theory, but it's not the only one. So friend right so I don't know much about you but so do you when you say v like a new represent some organization or something when you claim this or are you talking as Fred as a person?

01:00:58
When you raise this question, okay, like there's this hypothesis that okay so missing relations can be done well that right let's say when you say that are you saying it as a pink usual or are you represent your collector? We as in the human race has the ability very soon to make Grand Theft Auto 5 be to so close to the reality that you can all of us humanity cannot tell the difference regardless of whether or not the same liberty happens, we're looking 10 to 15 years.

01:01:30
Moore's law and we will not be able to sell the difference. So we. Started doing property. So. Like the my profile picture is of a chair.

01:01:48
Yes, I was just saying when I say we are late. Inside so I don't know whether based on my interactions so far on clubhouse would you? Believe that I'm a human.

01:02:02
Well, I think several people before me have said that the only thing that you're really sure of is that you exist and maybe you can even argue that one, you know. What if I'm asking you between based on the convention you have been having do you believe but then the person talking to you called sucrote with the profile picture of a chair is a human being.

01:02:29
Well, this is not the problem to explain the ages explanation for you talking is that you. Who's talking so. You're not massive to the big problem. You have to explain why in 1950s, we weren't up on Brown writes a novel about a civilization on Mars in their leader is called Eloy Give to Explain why Elon Musk rights sacrifice companies and gets it right every time.

01:02:53
He has saved games. It must be a simulation for the benefit of Ulmask. Declare. There's no other way. To answer that's not fine, but my question is.

01:03:07
The question. Bar because her interrupting and I don't think I'm all right exactly exactly.

01:03:24
Like clear. Friend from.

01:03:39
Me.

01:03:55
The reason I hesitate is that the reason is the date is that if I look at it. Socratic standpoint. I cannot prove that you are a human any ridiculous way. So exactly, exactly. I reserved. The the the I reserved the judgment just like I would reserve the judgment that the sun is gonna rise tomorrow.

01:04:23
I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen in fact. I'm almost steady my life that it's gonna happen but it doesn't mean that I guarantee. A hundred percent that will happen but you're a question with. Manatee when I. Said we and I met humanity. I am making a generalization and there are exception to the rules just like there's exceptions to people that believe that the earth is flat etc, so yes.

01:04:50
I was good. Thank you friend. I think I think he left he just we have to bet people a little better before bringing them up. Donna yard did you want to speak the whole idea of us this relationship the more I think of it more first they become because well in my line of work I.

01:05:17
Am Docker containers and they often tend to start and break down and the older I get the more of my feel like we are living in a darkest timeline so I find really repulsive and you know frightening to think that it might be living in simulation that's just a test drive or a bunch of stuff, you know container on.

01:05:44
In sense so in the future perhaps because if we will have a ability to run simulations overall to really want to I mean, I hate to put it in ethical terms or in terms of morals, etc etc, but yeah life is no way to treat an animal or is it thank you?

01:06:18
Um, I was thinking about what Fred said and I I really I would love for the congregation to advance that quickly in the next 15 years but I just think that I think it's gonna be longer a lot longer than that just I mean, like if you just imagine how much the universe has to compute for everything it's in our brains and and everything that's in our galaxy that's just, you know from the micro to macro.

01:06:47
I think it's just an incredible amount of things to compute and a 15-year timeline seems a little. Short, but but I'm open to hearing what other people think.

01:07:05
Of so I'm most theories are quite hard to simulate on the classical computer but. You know, let's say we have a working quantum computer and you can update we we take the most powerful predictive or the the most powerful theory we have that sort of spits out the the standard model and it will what would it take well.

01:07:32
I mean just as an example, I mean, I guess definitely was going to reply because myself. I'll just say like you're a really big thing Google. Simulating not obviously not full string theories, you're stimulating full string theory would be tantamount to stimulating, you know, the universe itself it like the most fine-grained resolution possible, but there there.

01:08:05
Fitting a very coarse-grained version of string theory using a hundred or so entangled cubits and there's this whole initiative called quantum gravity in the lab and it's actually much more substantive than you would initially guess like they genuinely are stimulating things that look exactly like prototypes of spacetime it's it's becoming more and more parents space-time itself is emerging from some sort of quantum entanglement between some underlying degrees of freedom that we still don't.

01:08:40
Fully understand and the thing that I really like about this is it's deeply substantive and quantitative like it doesn't have to just be a loose analogy or something we can philosophize about. You can calculations and all the calculations. Seem to this deep fact and now they can even run experiments that demonstrate.

01:09:04
The demonstrate these ideas, so it's it's super exciting and I guess it does tie it into these ideas of to what extent you can simulate reality even if you don't buy interesting relation theory or any of that. And then I was just going to clarify your question were you looking at like maybe maybe as Alex was just talking about what would it take to simulate kind of the smallest smallest model or small thing relating to this drink the very or like basically simulate the universe at the most basic possible level and I'm just curious of string theories amenable to like this criticization wanted to something bad at some cubits or something, oh that's a really hard question for the longest time that was a huge problem with string theories that it wasn't.

01:09:52
Even imprintable something that you could put on a computer and try to stimulate because we didn't we didn't even know what what you know to discretize what the degrees of freedom were etc we've made a lot more progress in this direction, in fact in summer genes, it looks like string theory isn't a theory of strings at all but is rather this thing called random matrix theory, it's a theory of.

01:10:21
A large number of extremely big matrices with random real entries that interact with one another and amazingly studying the eigenvalues of these matrices gives rise to space-time. I mean, it emerges out of eigenvalues statistics of random matrices, and this is again something that's super substantive and is connecting to experiments that people are running in labs again that to to simulate 20 models of the vicodins.

01:10:53
This really to the values state criminalization, yes exactly exactly the words eigenstatetorialization hypothesis appear, very frequently here, I guess on the string theory side what does eigenstate the realization hypothesis response about you it corresponds to space-time smoothing itself out and starting to look like the like, you know Euclidean space because before I can state the realization it looks to chaotic it looks like a bubbling pool of you know of chaos before space time becomes coherent.

01:11:24
Yeah, I mean from ice effect perspective is more just a pure quantum picture than Ethiopia is a mechanism to give rise to the local thermal dynamics from from ages global pure state. It's very cool. Thank you Alex, that was awesome so mean. The hey sorry is it the Jay yeah today yeah.

01:11:55
I have nothing useful to add okay, thank you. I need power you nice to see you. Is anybody else have any hey, I'd like to add them since if that's okay sure please do hey everyone good today good to see you. I've been listening to this while driving so excuse me.

01:12:14
I haven't been talking up until this point so.

01:12:20
The world as the world of computers assimilation after simulation so when I look at programs running on an operating system, it really truly is very comforting to think about those programs as little conscious things that have very limited consciousness that interact with each other and have a life and they pass away if it's a super comforting.

01:12:40
I don't know why I think about them that way and then it's then very natural for us to think okay, well maybe humans and maybe the entire universe is a program and so when you think about it that way from a computer science. Behective at least I feel like like computers are that simulation there's one on top of our electrical engineering understanding which is a simulation that runs on top of our physics understanding which is a simulation that runs on top of our understanding of a lower and lower levels until you get to okay, what is what is what is the universe and anything can something be simulating the entire universe and,

01:13:32
Space and and physics in general like if we have a model for how the the universe came about we can then start talking about another layer below that and the fact that we can't seem to ever come to any satisfactory lowest level probably indicates that we are some kind of like seriously thought limited program that just cannot think outside of its own confines like the flat land example of a line not being able to.

01:14:05
A three-dimensional world or would be very difficult for it so in that sense. I think the best we can do is to keep on building models that abstract the level higher and hope that that never ends. Or what we can hope that it doesn't and if it doesn't then we can say we don't live in a simulation and if it never ends then we're going to be pack going after this question forever, that's my true sense of the idea, even if it does and there's so many questions.

01:14:45
Because I suspect that research. I mean, something different. I was thinking if we have a complete description of foundational physics. And preso. I was saying that if it never ends means that. Can never find a model that can explain itself sufficiently well that we stop asking about where that model comes from.

01:15:15
I think that the ultimate question might be better we can come up to some kind of low level physics that is completely degradable but obviously we can describe everything that's completely what degree will sorry this is something that one Twitter or started to degree those things as a service rebuilds are features that are built.

01:15:41
Into objects in movies to make them look more three-dimensional like structure in space of models and so on so they look larger or in drawings you have things that make the character look three-dimensional like wrinkles and shadows and so on where they are not really necessary to convey the meaning of that whole thing they are just add ones that put use the structure that you perceive and so many degree buildings people would send them pictures like profile pictures and he would make them flat in very expressive and to their mental and removed all the external speakers, so if we take this idea.

01:16:16
Of degree bling to physics it would mean that you come up with the theory in which you remove all the unnecessary structure and you only end up with the completely minimal set of axioms from which everything follows and ideally it's like one axial right so because if you have multiple ones, why are these and not any others you could have a foundational zero of physics that is many many many pages long and it's still very unsatisfying because it doesn't explain why there's such a long source code where does the source code come from why it doesn't look like this right ideally you would want to have one principle that should maybe.

01:16:51
Oppose. And wait approached from nothing or for whatever but so a completely grateful physics is something where you see this is it couldn't be anything else it could be no more elegant representation of the whole thing and of course you kind of other theories that are more complicated very basic that allow you to stimulate everything predict everything that capture all the no laws and regularities, but you still wouldn't know why there are the way they are.

01:17:20
Well there's always a simpler possibility, which is that there could have just been nothing. Yeah, why not why is there not nothing?

01:17:31
Hey Amy I have a question. Gave it at the bottom, sorry. I had David hey, hey so so here's my question, right? So if you look at Thomas Edison, okay track current that's what the laws of physics correct you look at Nikola Tesla alternate current he used some physics, but use something completely different which now based on what he discovered.

01:18:00
Almost all of the tech is run by so my question is. How did Tesla do it earned did he understand if this was a simulation or not well. I mean, we won't know because he died right? I mean all of his papers were were gone from his little apartment and he died very poor he had some interesting ideas about I think was.

01:18:30
Was at 369 is that what his. His his I don't know there's a mathematician here. Sean do you know anything about Tesla? What he was studying at the time. I hate to put you on the spot like that, hey everyone. I'm just gonna. Bunch of things that let me just take quiet and listen for being thanks.

01:18:58
Amy sure sorry about that anybody else want to try man on what they know job go ahead. I think the most profound evidence that we're in the simulation is identifying the potential objective purpose of it which could be lowering entropy if we can establish that high entropy is fear and that fear is the root of all evil / negative experiences fear being high entropy or disorder confusion or many arrangements of outcomes when one.

01:19:28
Proceeds future outcomes whenever they proceed many outcomes that differentiate from the desirable outcome that can experience anxiety confusion depression and they're willing to commit the you know, evil behaviors to increase certainty when when looking at society the answer to the problems is synergy, which is these emergent advantages that arise from cooperation in order to.

01:19:57
You know gain these synergistic satisfiers, there has to be diversity in order. Once again, low entropy is popping up. Could the objective purpose of the simulation be evolving away from fierce / high entropy which is disordered high high hidden information and evolving towards love which if you look at the most exemplary characteristic of love.

01:20:22
I would argue that it's loyalty which loyalty is. Predictability consistency one potential arrangement of outcome. I think when when we look at nature perception is everything whether it be looking at the placebo effect and no seabo effect looking at epigenetics how our ancestors perceptions of reality are encoded on top of our genetics perception activating dormant genetics at every scale it seems to be there is no emergence without water organization coordination.

01:20:55
Could the purpose of the simulation be lowering entropy and y'all sharma big fan of your S even listening to you describe the intelligence, you know, being our ability to construct these mental models of reality that we can apply and then gain consciousness by restoring the information that we learned and then designing our mental models more effectively which is lowering entropy as well.

01:21:17
I'd like to hear your your reaction. I'm not sure that I have a reaction because that many of the notions that you'll project are too much driven by an intention already. I suspect that this intention that you basically experience tell us the thing that it has the purpose that is drives itself in a certain direction is an equal of the Taylors that you perceive and the construction of your own perceptual universe, but there is a possible university experience as the ground tools as the nature of tools that we are embedded in at the separate from our own self.

01:21:56
And this nature of this brown shoes is not the physical universe. It's the thing that is it already has dimensions of carrying the built into it because it's built by our own brain and so the things the entities that you perceive all have an intrinsic relevance that keeps them stable and important to us in our perception and even if we are disassembling and deconstructing our own cells this universe visits intrinsic rather than remains and the experience its agency, which is the agency of the underlying organism or of the thing that tries to make sense.

01:22:31
Of the universe as an organizing principle of the mind itself and so it's very tempting to take this underlying force that be perceived as instrumental and constructing our reality and projected into the physical universe but I think the physical universe is boring. It doesn't care it is just some uncaring automaton.

01:22:53
It's best to explain this out any kind of projection of meaning into it. That the meaning can only be explained so the lens of a mind How can that be when the greatest factor in our future probabilities is the certainty of our own perceptions in the future. You look at like an athlete who wins an award let's say that when an MVP the the first thing they're going to say more than likely is they thank God for opening up the door.

01:23:20
They're at a low entropy state certain that they know they know what they have to do to achieve what it is, they're trying to achieve the lofty goal that they set for themselves and they know that if they live up ordered predictable lifestyle sacrificing all their. Randomness that doesn't pretend to their goal that there's going to be a higher entity that opens the door up for them.

01:23:40
So because they're certain of the outcome, they not only activate genetics that allow them to evolve more than their parents do physically but also increase the probabilities have better performance from from being certain of the outcome. At every scale perception seems to be everything but even interpret your thing that that's still an emergency phenomenon type, of course grading of the universe.

01:24:10

01:24:29
It's the thing that you're part of it's a hypo organism. They are evolved are to be stapled and you're not just tribal organisms and the spirit of this state is itself in agent and this agent is creates. It by the coherent activity of its constituents. So true the degree that the individuals feel that they are serving some kind of next level agent some transcendental entity visited the degree to which this entity exists, right?

01:24:59
This is the degree to which it can come into existence because it's implemented by the individuals the relationship of the individual to this type of God is the same relationship that the cell has to the organism. The organism doesn't exist by itself. It is so coherent pattern in the interactive.

01:25:17
That are built in such a way that they are committed. Very the organism is entirely virtual It's a pattern that you can recognize in the activation activity of the cells because they are some of coherent and the organism itself is cause is a causal agent that you are organism you as an organism can decide to punish certain themselves if they don't serve you well for humor you cut them out.

01:25:41
If they are very helpful, you might try to preserve them and nurture them. It may be at the expense of others. And now imagine that these cells were sentient and would try to make sense of what's happening to them and they cannot see you because you don't. Exist right there.

01:25:57
It's only other cells that exist. It's you don't have any image you aren't organizational. That only becomes apparent from an entirely different perspective that a cell could have And in this sense you could say as a sentient cell. Oh God, it'd be to this position. I'm grateful for God opening up this and this is a baby this career out for me.

01:26:19
This opportunity to meet all these people and this all happened because there's an underlying pattern a pattern in the interaction of many people of maybe school counselors and parents and advisers and other people that all believe in this next level agency and give you little notches on your own quest to preserve this next level agency and then Sadly many things appear like synchrony.

01:26:40
Why did all these random things come together? Why is not just the economy that forces me to this position? Why is it possible that the world serves some kind of purpose? And then there's of course the entropic argument for everybody where this does not work out. They're not going to North.

01:26:56
Right it. It's something where everybody who finds it himself on the first half of this elevated position where we feel gratitude and so on they can easily project the existence of that. God that got them there and the other spawned. He also would you agree that fear is simply high entropy or uncertainty or many potential arrangements of outcomes of a perception?

01:27:20
No, I think that fear is different from anxiety fear isn't object directed. So you are not anxious you have an emotion about an event or a thing that you will not be able to compass and therefore you avoid it. It's basically a more that you are in and there's more focuses you and that can be a very useful emotion right fear is the emotion that makes sure that when you drive a car you never stop to attend.

01:27:51
You don't crash as a result but where when you are normal conversation, You will not have tear right so there is nothing that needs to be constantly online you can space out you can get up and make yourself a couple of tea and so on this is something that you're never allowed while driving a car you always need base level attention and this is the emotion of peer that is triggered by the constant of the anus.

01:28:12
There's an event in your future when you attention that you will not be able to handle castle event. This is the native nature of fear anxiety can be about not knowing the future and not having big coping potential for unknown events. Anxiety is emerging of uncertainty of fear. Yeah, but no fear is the concrete thing something turns into fear if it has an object.

01:28:38
My argument being that in a digital universe where you know like James Gates identifying self-correcting linear binary code at the root of all these supersymmetrical equations that describe our physical universe basically information being energy and and simply describe this discrete package of information zeros and once one being the low entropy state complete certainty or one arrangement of outcomes being loved zero being zero known information about the state complete uncertainty or the high entropy state one out of two probability.

01:29:10
A coin flip having no known information about the future. Complete uncertainty JW are you super yes sir, of course this isn't making us all use to yourself because you're so many connections everything is fundamentally it is no emergency skills without organization orders like nature just to dimensional sound wave function that oscillates potentiality and then once these zeros and ones begin to organize scale by scale emergency curves now.

01:29:46
I think you're over 15 so basically intuition. S that you have for large incorrect but you're seeing patterns where there might be not your opinion though, that's the problem with this conversation logic in a log e logic you're talking about assimilation that's illogical for the human brain so I think you know that is perspective.

01:30:06
I know a lot of brilliant people and one of the things through history you see they've focused on logic a guy like Nikola Tesla had logic but also looked at things from different perspective that's why he said everything is light and he found patterns. Just like for the Nachi that's a pattern things that spin they spin in nature they spin on the universe so I just think we should be open to everyone's perspective instead of trying to say I'm gonna convert you to what I believe that's just me of course but you know listening to yours just speak about the existential risk basically how we're on a path for self-termination and the only solution being cooperation lowering entropy order, you know, I mean the when when defecting from cooperation is incentivized in the Se markets and you couple that with existential tech we're headed for self-termination and I'm just more focused on creating a cultural revolution that will save us from our inevitable clubs and society okay?

01:31:12
I think I can kind of take some of the points that JW is advancing and kind of like integrate them into a different perspective of our model and you know with this topic of you know, being in a simulation if we can just like take it from the ground up, you know, we look at our universe.

01:31:34
You know, it started started, you know in a much more, you know primordial state and and we've been undergoing a lot of evolution, you know stars have formed you know, and and exploded and and and reformed as a new stars and and you know clusters of stars have spun into galaxies and then and then accretion disks have formed which creates planets and then plans had you know, the perfect configuration of of water and and earth and where.

01:32:09
The perfect distance where the goals were there in the Goldilocks zone where they were hot enough where chemical reactions can happen but I but not too cold where you know, everything is frozen, so we're kind of and and then on earth, you know, where all these like conditions were primal where we're primed we had the evolution of life and you know life if you look at it from the perspective of the gene genes, you know per you know, Richard Dawkins genes are selfish, you know genes, they're only intentioned.

01:32:44
To. Replicate and and that's kind of like a principle that is held constant like throughout all of life, you know since the very onset of life the only intention of genes has been to replicate themselves and when genes replicate, you know, they they create life and and and kind of came to what JW was saying, you know life, you know, like these organisms the the continuity of genes is very much, you know, an example of the universe counteracting entropy in some sort of way, you know because typically, you know, according to the second law thermodynamics.

01:33:21
Things will inevitably head towards a higher state of entropy, but when it comes to the DNA or RNA or genetic code, there is a a heightened degree of integrity of the code that you know, it's not completely impervious to entropy, you know, there's mutation and and and modification and and stuff like that, but it in comparison to other processes in the natural world, you know, the processes of life in particular like the genetic code has you know, a higher resiliency to the processes of entropy.

01:33:56
So when you kind of like to see that intuition I can kind of understand JW's intuition where there is something special there's there's some proclivity where there's this like inversion of entropy, you know, it's it's not like it's not like a complete negation of entropy it is a height resistance to entropy and I think you know, one of the ways that I frame my worldview is you know through this lens of evolution and the lens of you know, cosmic evolution biological evolution, you know seeing how you know, we, Did come from the a very much more primordial state and one of the ways one of the models that I like a lot is Conway's game of life because a few I don't know if it's been discussed in this room because I feel like every time the question of our being a stimulation gets brought up everybody always brings up.

01:34:50
Conway's game of life and I think it's for a reason because conways give of life shows that you know, very simple systems with very simple rules you get create like these complex environments, you know that evolve on their own and in a way, you know. Are universe you know started from a a primordial set of rules and then from that primordial set of rules, you know stars evolved planets evolved life evolved humans involved in here we are so you know, I think that this this idea this idea that our universe is entailed through some sort of simulation process at its surface, you know, I consider to be plausible but that might but then my question goes, you know, say if say somebody use the example and like 10 20 years who knows we might have like a grand theft auto 20 where It distinguishable from our own universe, this makes me affect the question is can those characters in that game are they ever gonna have any ability to have any consequentiality on the external world our so another way of putting it?

01:35:57
And let's say Conway's game of life if it begins very complex enough if you if you tweak some things in the game and you make it so we can model it can eventually evolve into you know universe like this one are those agents or those entities in that game ever gonna be able to modify or glimpse at the transistors that are that are creating the stimulation and and it's a to apply that to us if we are in a simulation given that it's plausible are we ever gonna have the ability to look at the transistors to look at whatever is inhaling this simulation, are we ever gonna be able to go beyond?

01:36:32
Our ground of existence into the the universe the beneath us or above a set of things that is simulating us. I don't think so rather my my take is that our universe is self-contained and if we are simulation, you know, we are an internally self-contained system and I think that in terms of whether there's gonna be any discovery of what's outside I don't I don't think that there is there's anything there for us to work with I think if we if there's a simulation we are self-contained and I think that we might be better just the understand the mechanics.

01:37:07
Of our universe you know through ours through our inquiries we're a physics or a quantum mechanics and I think you know that's and and through our our our morals are ethics, you know, I think that the question of what of whether we are a simulation, you know, it's a fascinating intellectual increase but ultimately, you know, the the more pressing question is how do we deal with our own existence like in this realm in our self-contained universe and that's my stability thanks for listening.

01:37:32
I heard somebody's trying to make comments that was me I wanted to respond to you Ramsey so okay, so so we think about Ramsey just said in terms of but but also think about All the compute that would be required to similarly all the physics that Ramsay spoke about like all the commute compute required to to to for the DNA of not just of every single life form and you know that the and to simulate evolution and the mutation and the physics of all that so a software simulation of reality in a computer a reality like Grand Theft Auto is about rendering graphics that have artificial physics, but that's not like real physics and and so like when we're talking about simulating string theory or I on I can state thermalization and based on random.

01:38:17
Local based on local random matrix theory or computer simulations of extremely basic particle physics, like extremely basic particle collisions, these are things the supercomputers that astrophysics labs, you know, working on things like LHC, they they're using the world's biggest supercomputers for these basic physics simulations so what I'm saying is like there may not be enough compute on earth to simulate even one human brain before 2050 and not and maybe not even before 2060 and and even then I don't think we're really talking about simulating the particle physics.

01:38:52
Of every neuro oscillation in a single brain so the idea of a computer that could accurately simulate the entire cosmos is itself just it's it's because of the amount of compute involved it just by itself just a far-fetched idea, but this computer with its vast resources would also have to likely exist in a universe that may also be simulated so if one simulation contains many smaller simulations and those smaller simulations contain many more smaller simulations each subsequent simulation should be draining the compute resources of the first simulation of the highest simulation, so as you explore this idea you begin to see that.

01:39:27
Each. Simulation within a simulation increases the amount of compute required by profound amounts on each new sim is decreasingly likely is basically decreasing it's a decreasing likely situation and the most likely situation is that the number of simulations is like one or zero because like there's like the amount of compute complexity just increases with each new one and and so that was my point up.

01:39:52
I I agree with you Mike I agree with your your premise and you know, well I one time I brought this up and I posted the question okay, so if worse stimulation and This the universe is simulating us things simulated and that university know is the turtles all the way down and I think you make a great point that you know, every subsequent simulation, you know, there's going to be some diminishment of the capacity to you know simulate things and you know, perhaps if given granted that let's say we are simulation, you know, it seems it seems like it seems possible that you know, the the one the the universe or whatever you want to call that realm simulating us might be like the ground one but um, I think you know if when if we're gonna think that way, You know, like I think it's it's very hard for us to like cognize, you know, what kind of realm that could be that you know has the the potential to sing later universe like this, you know, it could be around there's like beyond anything that we can even conceive and perhaps, you know, perhaps.

01:40:57
Simulation without having a simulate tour, you know without having some sort of agency responsible for the simulation perhaps this is that's just how universe's work that's how universe is, they they they function through the through an arbitrary set of of physics. On stims you know like perhaps they're like speaking to like the multi multi the many worlds hypothesis you know there could be many universes with which with slightly tweaked, you know, fundamental constants and and this this universe just happens to have the constants that are like finally tuned to create this sustaination of life and there can be other universes that after their big bangs they just fizzle out and and and nothing happens and and it and other universes where you know stars and perform and and you know, I'm saying, like there could be an incident repertoire yeah of possible outcomes and and, That could just be like some fundamental nature of potentiality that has nothing to do with some agency programming a special stimulation, you know with with that type of intelligence so I think there's there's we have to kind of like probe that our assumptions, you know, and in our and our our our things do that we apply to everything models go ahead yeah well we're in a loop right now we've actually been here like two hours ago, we did this loop and I don't think my career you were here, that's what I'm trying to get us out of the loop.

01:42:24
And Yosha ended up talking about a beautiful metaphor, however to see in a plane of water and I wanted to ask my question on that so maybe we can jump out of loop and fast forward to where we were when he was answering okay and it was. Use my question because I've had the Yoshi you're the first person I've ever met with who thinks as it perhaps a human brain is a vorticity and first off that's a monopole, so what's your opinion on the manifold dipole thing if that's how you think about things and second.

01:42:55
I've really would love to hear your opinion on why the golden ratio or the Fibonacci sequence seems to execute itself pretty pervasively throughout our simulation of air quotes, thank you this is Robert Carbone and I'm complete. That you are complete maybe the only complete person or who knows it cannot answer your questions really so the news may you can think about Ivan's that are stable and better set are not stable the patterns drug are stable are as essentially those that are in a way periodic that information content in a certain volume constant.

01:43:35
If you are radiating information out of the volume you are using that information inside so that means that you have to look for patterns if you want to have a stable pattern that bends back into themselves so they can be stable and on if you look at continuous substrates and water is something that is approximately continuous it is made from too many parts to count.

01:44:03
The things that are stable and water of what is this it means you have something that rotates around itself, so it stays stable in equilibrium it's a monopole because it's two dimensional and the vortex itself remains stable needs dynamics that extends a little bit about two dimensions, so you need to turn this into this cone.

01:44:25
Only works because you can't bend the surface of the water if the surface of the water would be completely flat don't know if you could have a stable vortex and you you need to have it basically changes in density if you can change the density of the surface then again you can have what disease the fibonacci's viral is a pattern that extends outwards it doesn't bend back into itself and it bends back at the outwards and a relatively simple and stable ratio when disrespect that these outward bending processes, there are a number of them.

01:45:00
In the number of ratios around them and the Fibonacci spiral is just one of the common patterns that you can get when you have a process that or originates at some kind of point some kind of angular momentum addition to the outward force going momentum, if you want to have something that bends back into itself you.

01:45:22
You're cutting out your shoulder in it in a stable process, can you hear me? Yeah in the stable process basically the information needs to travel in a periodic based so if you imagine you take some kind of spiral and you try to bend it in such a way that the information traveling along that spiral does get lost.

01:45:43
Point you get circle right in this is the equivalent of the vertex and the vertices that the particles are made of are not in 2d but there are in multiple dimensions that are not necessarily aligned with the dimensions of the space in which the photonic interactions take place so when somebody like Tesla says, everything is light, I think what he refers to is that the space that you are in is the space where you have locations with the potential for interactions with photons and all the interesting interactions that You observe outside of the core of atoms are interactions by a photons right so in this sum of proximation everything is photons so everything is light that let this sense this is correct but it's because light can interact across certain types of war disease that can form the components of atoms and molecules.

01:46:39
So um, so either packaging came up with the with I think could be the original idea of that human beings are dissipative systems or vortices and so you you can see that you know, basically the entire universe is a fractal vortexes or vortices, you know from like from a galaxy to an atom to to a cell to the human brain to basically everything is a vortex in some sense or a dissipative system and it has to maintain its own equilibrium and export.

01:47:14
Increasing amounts of chaos to the surrounding environment in order to maintain its equilibrium and that says I would say that it's it's if you look up to 40s in in brainwaves or forty season the brain or imagine the if you just google the brain as a vortex you can see there's a lot that's been written about this over the years.

01:47:38
You know text of the thought experiment that I presented I just tried to give something like a visual metaphor that allows us to imagine that an observer is a mighty stable particle system, so it's basically lots of small diseases that form larger vortices and then individual particle. I imagine to be something like mathematical vortex that is oscillating in a multiple dimensions depending on the type of the particles, it can be two four or eight dimensions or combinations thereof and they basically get embedded into a long.

01:48:13
Er surrounding interaction space which oscillates and fewer dimensions and you can embed the things at scale into a cruft 3 dimensional space that is evolving time and so the sinking of yourself as a system of what you see that our mighty stable that our can arrange themselves in such a way that they don't fall apart but they can form memories that so remember things in their past and can use this to control their behavior in the future.

01:48:38
I saw that since they helpful way to think about our own nature, but it doesn't mean that we are literally going around spirals or circles or monopoles. I think Alan Watts has a really great illustration where he kind of like takes this topic of how like we are just like little eddies in in this giant ocean and you know, it's in the eddies our little or little smaller eddies and I think this this topic, you know does have a basis in in a broader intuition and so on wants you kind of like expands the the metaphor even more and and applies it to you know, what we call nouns, you know as things you know, he he says that like all nouns are actually verbs, you know, So um, like we we are not like I am not a human.

01:49:27
I am the universe human ink, you know, like you are not a like, you know that is that is not a tree that is the youth the the universe tree, you know, like every every now is a verb because you know everything that like exists in this in this timeline in this universe like you're like a tree or a human, you know is a process it is a process that is constantly undergoing, you know, metabolism respiration all these processes that are are sustained.

01:49:59
Through in cellular mechanisms and then eventually it expires you know, and if you can kind of look at time, you know with with it's you know in as a dimensional aspect, you know where you can kind of imagine, you know, a timeline from beginning to end where it where where it starts at that like zero and then it as a move to time you can kind of like capture like slices of the frames and then you put a multi together and it creates like this long undulating snake you'll see that everything from its onset, you know from the moment you were.

01:50:34
Conceived until the moment you were die you can kind of like like picture this with time as an added dimension and you go out to the the the higher dimensions from that you can kind of like imagine the timeline of your life as this long undulating snake and and then throughout that time, you know, there's there's everything like, oh like air oxygen food waters pouring into you and then you're releasing a you know, like air water excrement and and and there's like a constant cycle where we're things are coming into you and coming out to you and there's never a moment where there's A concrete static thing and I think it's it's a very fascinating thought experiment to imagine everything you need in the universe as this process as this happening where you take that time to mention and you won't measure things as entrelating snakes, you see that everything is like we are all our little or little of vortices are little Eddies in the ocean and then we're all kind of like it transmitting like matter and energy to each other and we're all kind of like in this embedded sea of like Eddie's among Eddie's and Eddie's and those adding Eddies and I think it's a very beautiful thought experiment to kind of visualize the what the Buddhists.

01:51:44
Call the principal of practices, which is the interdisconent origins of all things yeah and I I oh I owe all this to Alan wants for us knowing it out for me. Ramsey, I'm a huge fan of Allah. Thank you so much for that. I was eloquently set. Quick question if.

01:52:10
Yes, no one else has questions. Please do. Thanks. I have made it. Yeah, my question is. So obviously we need to. See the idea of the real living in a simulation as is something that we want to talk about and consider. So we obviously need to switch from classical computational power to quantum computational power because of the limits as computational power and notion of time obviously.

01:52:42
So my question is so quantum systems, we know that they can exist and superposition of states. And well, this profession is basically described by this wave function and the, Act the observation that causes this wave function to collapse to one of these many possible states and So my question is if the idea well, basically if it's just a pure if it can look at it as a pure simulation, which has no collapse or.

01:53:22
Because like if you want to.

01:53:26
Correlation everything is going to be like a little bit. We can think of it as everything that is. The rest.

01:53:40
That you're living in a virtual reality because it would compute whatever you want to degrade and. Observe it and that collapses it.

01:53:56
About this. Nation or.

01:54:09
Sweat has obviously. We want to like take into account. The time. And computational power we can't have. Simulation like it's it's already a no like because we think about it like you want. Emulate one.

01:54:32
Really classical physics physics that we know it's gonna take 10 years in 20 30 years you.

01:54:42
Just.

01:54:54
A long way from. I would love to know what people think about free.

01:55:10
At least has to come.

01:55:23
State or I don't think it's real.

01:55:34
I mean.

01:55:39
If you isolate system. S. The environment is what's causing the collapse to these butter states, but that's just because you're tracing out the the rest of the degrees freedom of the rest of the world, sorry, could you go into what you mean by collapse every time I like black holes.

01:56:02
I think I think you were talking about wave functioning collapse right yes. I'm talking about a bass function called maps basically means you have one description of the universe as a wave function that changes certainly include the universe as discrete events and states exactly as that propagate through time space and bi observation it collapses into states, so we have this app our universe as a quantum system that can exist and superposition of states and this superposition is described by this wake function of the Universe of space-time and the act of observation causes this vape function to collapse one of these many possible states or superposition of possible states that we have.

01:56:51
So in some sense the present is discrete, whatever you analyze is in some sense definite and the projections that you make into the future is the past are less definite but they are described as as a mismatch between the states of the substrate and the classical states that we use in the classical description and the classical description is a very efficient one that allows us to make very efficient control bottles of the universe then you're in.

01:57:23
But it's basically fitting the curve to a observations that are on the substrate level and the substrate cannot be described by the the classical states right so in some sense there is a mismatch between two levels of description. And and that's mismatches this super position right you the underlying states do not correspond want to one to the supervision yet emergent classical states.

01:57:59
That the collapse of the wave function decoherency when the when the wave loses its infinite potentiality, when an observers known information reaches a certain threshold, so basically when it when an observer reduces hidden information. That because the the collapse occurs because the occurs. JW when you say infinite friendship potentiality, it sounds very romantic, do you have an emotion when you say that or is this a technical term for you just the potential for basically any any outcome to occur in some probability like is it literally infinite?

01:58:42
No because you know, we we know that there's an online amount of energy in the universe from the first long demo okay, so yeah finance that of possible outcomes not infinite in in the metaphorical term the mathematical sense. Literal yes, but you are very using something that is not neutral.

01:59:03
I think that you were carrying it carried away by romantic emotion doesn't belong in the description of reality. I think. Yeah I would say collapse and observers don't like but there's not observation. I mean that again is my perspective more from ever carrying a picture but uh collapse is just an effective description from tracing out of the rest of the world assembly to a player uploading their consciousness through a data exchange with the remote control into a Grand Theft Auto avatar character choosing to make a left-hand turn down the street now once the known information reaches a certain threshold the same can now be rendered.

01:59:46
The the the potential of states collapses into a finite state. Hey I was just referring to the stands that you were taking to your observation it didn't seem to be an unmoved observer but it seemed to be you were you felt a certain enthusiasm that I think does not belong to physics the god of truth is some very cold machine if it warms you you're not serving it, right?

02:00:16
I like to make a question every time I try to solve a problem. I imagine if there's a simple problem I can solve and the problem as it's posed right now is just beyond my ability to even comprehend so I was wondering if in the literature anybody has ever looked into a simpler dimension or just getting rid of quantum mechanisms all together and just looking at classical world where people.

02:00:51
Were able to ask a meaningful investigation into whether they could figure out whether it was a simulation level.

02:01:04
I just what kind of want to reiterate my point that if we are in a simulation I think you know, we were no matter what we're self-contained, you know, like similar leads to how the video game players, like let's it's a premiere and analogy coming metaphor but similar to how the video game characters are never going to be able to see you playing them or like to see the transistors or presenting them, you know, like they there's an engine that are pretty producing them simulating them and they're kind of like like locked in their own self-contained system, so perhaps somebody.

02:01:39
May have an alternate explanation that may rebut this but I think at least my intuition has a very clear that if we are in a simulation we're self-contained and all we can do is like look at our own universe and I don't think there is quite a way to like access, you know, whatever is the ground beneath us at this time, yeah.

02:02:02
I don't Ramsay I have a question so like did you see the monkey by chance yeah? I just I mean, The way I look at it is with the we create an AGI and we create a video game that is interactive with us there is no different there's no different shape differentiation, sorry, it's getting like here on the east coast, um, And I do think that.

02:02:32
Be possible, um, very soon and I think that's why I'm holding this room. I mean, so fantastic discussion but. People from different departments and different avenues we all need to come together to have these discussions because everybody's in their own little world and doing what they do, and if you're not aware of different perspective, I think that it just doesn't lead to evolution.

02:03:01
To your point in physics, it turns out that you can actually look at the world in a different scale so if you look at it the human scale, you see the classical physics and then you can ask the question is there any meaningful questions that I can impose on this world to see if there's something else going on behind the scenes behind the, There is a theorem called homography.

02:03:34
Makes a self-contained which is important that it is logically yourself contained and those of you who may know the classical mechanics it's they try to perturb. Extra. So positively from quantum fluctuation, but it turns out that as long as the perturbation is small then the. Dimensional tolerance of the.

02:04:01
Little break and break out into k motion, but then again we have.

02:04:11
Absorb the hourly. Nature. Was access to. Its underneath it, and so if you're asking the question of can we have the mathematical system. Of examples, but for whatever.

02:04:35
We can experiments there are beyond the any theoretical construct and so there is the hope of discovering something that's beyond the field for constipation. Two things coral, can you number one can use this repeat the name of the theorem that you just mentioned? Chromographs.

02:05:06
G o r o v.

02:05:12
Ison arnold a r n o l d. Hyphen mosa m o s e r you can just you can search camp theory k a n theory and you probably okay thanks for that so okay so that's one so the second thing was so you're implying that there are experiments that might give give you some information input from something that might be underlying but.

02:05:39
Correctly. But whatever is behind the curtain but. I don't I don't think that is a compelling mechanism mechanism to entail that there there might be a way for us to affect an output onto that other. Day output that the Honda current has to observe the simulation, you know what I'm saying?

02:06:05
I don't I don't think they're yeah. I don't.

02:06:15
Want that access to a question in a simpler system so that we can. So get a inkling of what the whether if it shakes any light into the possibility or. And I again I found that you can have the smartest people think about what the world should be but the nature has always trumped us and so.

02:06:40
In other knowledgeable background. I am just wondering okay now where? You and maybe the shape of simple. Appearance shape of some discovery by somebody but just talking about like, How much you killing the words. But I think I think this is again with these number we actually defined simulation again because there can be.

02:07:03
You can define simulation in a way that could possibly be distinguishable from whether it's a simulation or not or anything you can find the way that this industry.

02:07:17
I would like to destroy the store and a thought I thought experiment so so yeah, so maybe if you're thinking about, you know, designing a computer if the only thing that the the character in the computer can notice is the environment that was created by the computer it can be really difficult to imagine what's outside and that's creating that like for the character of the computer.

02:07:41
I mean, you can even look at what is it goes incompleteness theorem or or in terms of like in terms of like trying to? Argue. That there's this things that are outside the sphere that you're in there just there's some things that just will never be knowable right it's that's just so when I'm thinking it's like but if there is if you can model the solar system and people model the solar system, they simulate there's that you can test ideas about how the solar system works without being able to observe everything that you would need to prove that those ideas are so basically the simulation of the solar system helps to helps to prove or help.

02:08:28
To do demonstrate that the idea is of how the solar system works are actually correct and so what I'm saying is like if you're within the simulation and you have enough compute that you could simulate the simulation from inside the simulation then you could create testable predictions that you could say, well if it was if you know, it's like a transistor you like if if if it's like a transistor based, you know computer out that is is creating this simulation and then we should have you know, that something weird should happen.

02:09:03
You know at this point, you know what I'm saying, it's like maybe like I don't know what that test will prediction would be but if you can get really precise about simulating your own simulation, then you could try to make inferences about what would be required to simulate that simulation and then where and what you could look for from within that simulation that might indicate which type of simulation you're in if you're in a simulation.

02:09:39
Of the higher order simulations.

02:09:54
Distinguish from the higher order submission, that could be just one possible example of something that we we might want to look for like provide a clue to what's outside the simulation. Be interesting to think about at what point will if you look at virtual realities we have today come.

02:10:16
To our grand theft auto if we look at the code that the program is great of that virtual reality, we should be able to distinguish the code between the MPC's the novel characters and the actual characters. Post singularity, you know, when artificial intelligence vastly exceeds human intelligence and is creating technology for us at what point will we be able to distinguish potentially between NPCs and actual players in the simulation those that actually have free will versus those that are deterministic creating story lines for others in the simulation.

02:10:53
I have an interesting thought experiment. The old days when there was no accurate watches people are trying to build ever so accurate watches so you can imagine kind is the real thing and the kind that you read off from your watch like this back several hundred years ago, and this is the simulated time reading.

02:11:19
So that meaningful thought experiment is how would you know of one watch was more accurate than unethical? I think you could compare it to some dial.

02:11:48
Station but I was thinking has anybody honored so so okay, so the topic that was just in the room was if you know if,

02:12:03
Yeah behind the curtain so I was thinking of of the mystery of dark energy because dark energy is the energy of empty space, you know, just in the quantum vacuum that is like making the universe expand at a faster rate so is anybody ever pondered that perhaps dark energy is energy that is being input into this universe from from the ground of existence from beyond the curtain is that has that ever crossed any, Way.

02:12:32
I think I asked Yosha this earlier he had a really beautiful explanation of what dark energy is, um, go ahead. Yosha it was dark matter not dark energy, but that's that's right good. Oh I should agree well yeah yeah, okay, okay are the standard model proposes that we have for standard four forces right the strong force which binds the parts of the atomic nucleus together and the leak force which allows them to decay again not fall into each other completely and then we have the, Electromagnetic forces which keeps the electrons and the vicinity of the core and allows the atoms to form by the electrons the molecules and that allows electrons in the two bounds against each other and thereby facilitate the interaction between the molecules.

02:13:38
Right and these are gravity which is the weakest force of all and gravity describes the curvature of the space in which the photonic interactions take place and there imagine now that there is something that interacts with strategy but for some reason it's not electromagnetic at all, so it does not interact with electrons this protons at all and this is the non-periodic matter 20 percent of the universe is the very idea and this the steps that somehow interacts with.

02:14:09
And this is us right you are interacting with photos everything that we touch the interactive visit with some kind of electromagnetic push against our fingers against our company as or electromagnetic-based hitting our readiness and so we cannot sense any kind of matter that is not interacting via photons except by measuring the gravity occasional effects that it has and they are very subtle because gravity is so weak it's very difficult to make a measurement for changes and gravity or several differences in gravity and by observing the move.

02:14:44
Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.

02:15:19
A mass in this region that is has is not aligned with the supernova that took place so the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter is that that observes this totals but some of the other stuff is still there you cannot just see it we cannot see it but we see that it exerts gravity and so by and large the dark matters seems to be slapped somewhat aligned is what the galaxies are doing but not completely and because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse of the balance itself the problem is dark forces between the dark matter so additional interactions that exist.

02:15:54
In the quantity universe, that is not interacting with. Dark because it's not interacting with photos and I find it interesting to speculate about the dark meta people at that 12 dark voices.

02:16:11
Percent of matter and the universe is not interacting because any of the elected dark forces but only this gravity itself, which is.

02:16:23
Of their university. Then as it discovered them. Related to what goes on behind the curtain right this is all also in front of the curve. The ocean users described use describes our dark matter not dark energy which is in my understanding exactly yeah a minor standing of the dark energy is the energy of empty space that is making the universe expand at a much faster rate because one would expect that after the big bang there would be a dissipation and the expansion would slow down but were actually within the opposite the expansion is speeding up so my question was is there a likelihood or anything that we can entertain about this energy that is making the universe expanded the faster rate perhaps that might be being.

02:17:11
From. Behind the curtain No not at all. The thing behind the curtain would be something that shows that this thing that happens in front of the curtain is somewhat magic that there's a conspiracy going on. The idea of the simulation is that the universe is not what it seems not in a sense that there is stuff that you just cannot observe because it's at the level that we have difficulty observing or measure from where we are as embedded observers, but because the universe only pretends to be what it is.

02:17:43
And behind this pretends that Is a causal structure that exists to produce precisely what your observing right imagine that the intuition that you sometimes might have but as well that we are in is something like a computer game that we are about for us in a computer game. Then that we forget that we exist X6 actually outside of this computer game because all our senses are called completely inversed in it and so we don't form memories of our interactions outside the computer game or maybe the parts of us that are worse than the game don't remember but there is maybe a game master and there is maybe some.

02:18:21
Communication or going on behind the players behind the curtain by the over the board of which this role playing game and visual participate takes place. If you take that intuition to be the reality, then this universe that you're in is basically just the gaming board on which everything plays out and maybe our true self outside in the parents universe has set up this gaming board.

02:18:45
So we can engage in this game visit each other. 's very beautiful. I just want to say hi to Cecilia are in Mohamed. Homage like you. At work in. Quantum mechanics modeling and mathematics respectively, so be interesting to get your take on.

02:19:11
Hi everyone. Thank you very much for having me here. Just recently joined. I'm enjoying the conversations here, so I'm gonna be around and enjoying and I will go basically to try again if I have anything to add thank you everyone. Hi, I actually had a question as it already asked them.

02:19:31
Go ahead. Thank you. Oh, first of all, thanks for letting me come up on stage. I had two questions for Yasuo one rooted in mathematics and another about the theory of simulation. You've presented I've been listening for about three hours and particularly just a little before you brought up certain rotations can be represented in 2D and 40 space but can't be represented in 3D space.

02:19:59
I was curious about this particularly on two points one you mentioned there are two types of. Reputations one rooted on the dimensional plane and another that considers time. I might be picturing that could you go more into why that rotation that considers time what exists but I'm actually more interested on the point you made that is possible in certain dimensions 2d and 4d and not in 3dimensional space is that due to some mathematical difficulty.

02:20:33
Okay, I'll try to explain. It's a slight misunderstanding. Maybe it's difficult to get it across in such a short amount of time. So, Let me try to explain complex numbers for you for for everybody because know them they're very simple to understand. Complex numbers are away to write down two-dimensional.

02:20:55
Number right? One-dimensional number. The real number or an integer number as you all know them can arrange them on a single scale and some kind of array that goes in an unbounded direction towards infinity, right? And this allows you to organize things in one dimension. If you want to organize things in two dimension.

02:21:16
You put in that pair right and X and the Y is. An elegant way to express the X and the Y as a symbol. Item as a sum If you write them as a sum of two real numbers the problem is that you can just send them up and there are signal number again.

02:21:30
So, how do you make sure that they don't become one number? You give one unit and this unit should not be collapsing into the other, right? So in the same sense as you can have apples and oranges, then you will now two dimensions if you add these two dimensions together, they're not going to mix and the number that mathematicians have discovered that is very useful as a unit is I I is the number that is defined as being the Square root of minus one and so it's somewhat like one or minus one only it's not because the square root of minus one is not defined as a real number but so the nice thing is when you multiply this number if it's themselves.

02:22:14
It's imaginary number I if you get one right because the square root of this square root if you multiply it does itself it disappears because it gets squared square root is the inverse of the square, right? So this square root of minus one multiplied because itself gives you one minus one.

02:22:30
And now you can perform multiplications with this I So the x coordinate you would to use your normal real numbers or divide coordinate. You take real numbers marginalized is I, Right? So on the x axis, you have one, two, three, four five, and so on y axis you have one I 2i 3i 4i I is time sub square root of minus 1.

02:22:55
And you can also do this for the negatives of numbers minus 1 multiplied this I minus 2 logic 5 this is on on the y axis and minus 1 minus 2 and 3 just you're all in your coordinate system. So now you can do addition in the normal way, which means you can add for instance 12 plus 13i.

02:23:19
At you at 1 plus 2i and you get coordinate there right you can full normal vector addition of this way. You can also do scaling. You can just logically you are 12 plus 2i is 2 and so you have 24 plus 4. And you just have a normal vector multiplication.

02:23:38
And now a very similar thing happens is your value multiplied as I what is a multiple of I or fraction of I because what you would now do is get that you rotate. Imagine that you look at one you multiply this I to get I If you multiply I this I again you get minus 1.

02:23:58
If you are want to try minus 1 again with I to get minus I and if you come multiply minus I plus I you get 1, right? So you each time you, Play with I you move 90 degrees you want to get 90 degrees. And you can get the intermediate rotations by multiplying with the fraction, but the fraction will not be on a circle so the resulting sink needs to be scaled by multiplying the first the real part of this complex number.

02:24:30
So you can make arbitrary rotations by just by having a such complex number. This means using complex numbers you create write down two-dimensional numbers in such a way that you can perform quotation as a multiplication. And the space of complex numbers notations become multiplications, very elegant. And the same thing works important you can find an ion and a j at decay that have the same property that as the iron complex numbers, you can multiply them with each other out and allow you to do elegant rotations.

02:25:07
But does this not possible in three dimensions? In three dimensions, there is no eye and j that would cancel each other out in such a way. So it turns out you cannot define any kind of rotations in the three dimensional space that are not two dimensional. Of course you can perform two dimensional rotations in 3D, right?

02:25:27
If you can just can always make something in a higher element more space happening can take a piece of paper and not rotate it just on a table and 2D but you can take it into 3D and rotate it in 3D but every time you take your piece of paper imagine it's flat and 3D you only going to perform a 2D rotation around an axis, right?

02:25:51
Going to be a single axis, you can find align this excess any way that you want to in space but you will always around rotate around the plane that is protected into this axis. So in 3D you can only make two dimensional rotations. And 2D you can make two dimensional rotations in one D, you cannot make any rotations in four.

02:26:12
Can make new rotations. Right. There are additional types of rotations that are possible 40. And there are no new locations in five years. Two dimensional and polymerization sites and 16 there are no new ones and 70 then 80 again, there are a bunch of new ones. And this is it there are no more in 16 dimensions.

02:26:32
So the complex numbers and volumes are. That there are some with other portions and then we have the Octonians in these idea dimensional numbers. These are the mathematical reasons but you can have rotations only and truly and 40 and then 80 because you cannot define complex numbers in this way.

02:26:55
You can also try to assemble this. Patterns that go into the. Loop and in the quality. I think this would be the constructive pool that you would need to make to show that you can only build rotations in this way. Thanks and that makes sense. Thank you for explaining that and did you say that there are no more?

02:27:19
There are more than 60 dimensions but on 16 dimensions, you cannot have new rotations all the rotations will. Intervention. Oh, okay. Thank you. There is a block. Thanks for that. So another thing is if you look at the definition of the eye and the one that you could make but you could flip the signs of the eye and still have rotations.

02:27:43
If you do this you get a different rotation. It's it's not one that is Euclidean where the thing that you would hate retains its shape but things get squashed when you rotate them and this also is possible for 40 so your 40 you can also invert the sign and then you describe relatively physics the use of what dimensional space is free spatial dimension at one time dimension.

02:28:10
The time dimension is different from the space dimension and you probably have noticed this right? There is a. Dimension of time in the dimension of space and this you can rotate an object and space and it retains its shape but for some reason you cannot rotate it into time.

02:28:28
And relativistic physics tells you yes, you can rotate it in time but it's very hard to do so and it will change its shape if you do this. Right, so you will ever dilation between space and time if that happens. And this is because it's a hyperbolic quotation. It's one where the time axis has a different style than the spatial axis.

02:28:52
There are a number of beautiful YouTube videos that try to illustrate this point but I found that I did not really understand the underlying mathematics before a friend of mine gave me a book and for the effort in the title, it's written by some physicists who would measure discovered this relationship to number 0.

02:29:12
It's very beautiful. Yeah that sounds very interesting I'll definitely try to understand it more myself, but thank you for giving me a recursive to do that. My second question on your theory of simulation. I've been trying to read chop an hour as well as representation and trying to digest this philosophy.

02:29:31
You may have a better perspective on this philosophy, but for my perspective he described the will as something unpauses and like aimless. In your theory of stimulation where what will exist particularly like interview with that also being a part of the simulated in ours and that we're just, Kind.

02:29:50
Not actually a part of like a unique object that could exist outside of the simulation or would be something that's kind of like inserted into simulation. I think that will only exist in the mind and will is a certain perspective that the representation of the mind of itself will have of its own action tendencies, there are two ways to make a measurement in the world one is the absolute measurement you take an absolute scale of something right so it is a certain value and the other one is, You have take a difference to how it should be so your perceived attention and this tangent is motivating your own action, you have to make some kind of commitment to how things should be because you are not meant to choose what you regulate in the world yourself is not making these commitments these commitments are going to be upstream from yourself these structures of your mind that produce the self rather than at the level that this self self can control so you might perceive for instance that the world wants to be watched there's attention in the world between how.

02:31:00
The world is and well how the world should be the world should obviously be just right and so it's your job to make it more just it's very obvious right because you're perceived the speaking but of course justice are not interesting physics there are features that you project into the world because at some level your mind has made a commitment to how the world should be and it's only when you're deconstruct this commitment and replace it by a deeper commitment you realize that justice becomes instrumental right suddenly you stop perceiving justice and injustice in.

02:31:35
No longer exists.

02:31:40
Need loss or what exists is awareness of the consequences of your actions and exiting based on this or they can be symmetries and behavior and so on that you have suddenly have all these notions and some of them are useful and certain purpose and others are not and you're no longer.

02:31:57
Successes because you have stopped to perceive it as a tribal commitment that exists in your subjective universe right before you achieve the step that you deconstruct your perception of justice and injustice you cannot imagine that you could be looking at a universe those are just as an interest and after you've done this it is very difficult to go back to this earlier stage it make yourself to see that directly in the sense that you conceive it as a primal force in the universe and you see more force fields.

02:32:30
So when you describe little as an underlying factor in the universe you are perceiving that if explorationally there's always something that cares in the universe because this is the way that your own medical simulation is being constructed depends on your material about something and you can deconstruct these care in which it happens when you go on a trajectory to enlightenment right, so the easiest stage that you can get to is that you're no longer move directly by actual impulses that you perceive all the impulses that you have as emanations of your own mind.

02:33:05
And you have a distance to that you are no longer directly move to that by them as you can decide whether you act on them or not based on the consequences that you proceed and when you go on a deeper level you can turn them all off and make them things to mental to an underlying thing maybe the underlying sneakers love and so you recognize love as the primal force for.

02:33:26
Advice serving lots of the right way, you will have to do all.

02:33:34
Day nor organisms, so you can serve blast in the right way and the same way justice for instance also instrumental only to laugh it does not exist. And you can get one step further and yes nothing less passes statics, so you're only interested in finding patterns that make sense and in that stage you are a big disease.

02:33:58
Of complexity and predictive power and if you let go of finding patterns in the world. Then everything falls apart. You stopped the imposing order on the world and what happens if I go through this stage in meditation the world comes.

02:34:22
A basic become unconscious. Until I wake up again in a rebooted state. Very care again.

02:34:36
Commitment or? About the world, but like your experience of your own well. Like a particular will to do something in particular. But my own good is just. That my nervous system makes that some level. Intention.

02:35:15
Yeah yes so like that perception of your will which is I would you say that is the same thing as you will or that would be something separate from your will. So it is no my will apart to. I am only.

02:35:41
Like sentences because I want this outlines let's date it's a it's a viewed state and that's date. I'm I might still feel an urge for movement. But this verge is no longer associated with myself, so I could say that there is something that the universe wants in the perception that exists in the sense, maybe there's thirst in the universe and something to drink must be found but.

02:36:10
Very much about your. I did make no longer motivate you to choose. These interest exists, but it doesn't have a relationship to you. And so in. Between. But it doesn't follow that you should do anything as a result. I'm not sure if it qualifies as well. Already? I would like to say that I I had a deep experience one time where I conceptually reduce the concept of I at the very minimum to being like a directional concept and so as long as you have a directional concept to represent self then you could in the organism that is you could sort of navigate life if they were this direction needs food or something.

02:36:58
It's very the most primitive possible sense of ego is just a directional concept. I'm sorry not the the most primitive possible. Effective. And I'll stop.

02:37:14
I mentioned that there is pain and an integral part of pain. I think this.

02:37:27
Implement some kind of comfortable.

02:37:33
And unveraged you can for instance if you are at don't respond to anesthetics and you need to have some two surgery and so on maybe you'll find it approaches puts you on the state when you no longer react to that pain on what happens is that the pain is still available but it's still information and it is a director of information because you can detain becomes larger or smaller and so on but the pain is no longer the power to affect you and your actions, but you don't no longer feel energy.

02:38:11
Is ordered the strengths of the pain signals on some kind of scale, but it's just a signal. It's not an urged connected to that signal anymore and at this point. I think it loses and important aspect of what it would need to have to become pain, right? It no longer care.

02:38:30
It's it loses its relevance and pain is a certain kind of relevance. It's a dimension of relevance. Bill is a dimension of relevance and if you lose the urge to act on the bill. I don't think it is will anymore. It's just an inflammation. In this imagine that year is Just a place where signals come from signals that the cause movement of your body.

02:38:58
That produces me, that is producing these signals.

02:39:09
I am the. You that the system tells itself So it's not me that that's this The elements of the story are being parsed by the system and feedback into its behavior and influence to behave your insurance, right but I am not the thing that makes this parsing. Okay, but I'm sorry.

02:39:26
I'm not wasn't saying that what I'm saying is like imagine that the constant of you is really just worse signals are coming from and there's no there's no you there's just it's just pointing to where signals are coming from and those signals are like causing this body to move into different directions.

02:39:44
They're causing. To happen. And so you this is the reason I don't think this is this because I can't make this point this concept elsewhere. And people do this regularly great, so you can experience it identity you. See.

02:40:05
If you are then on the person. Yourself into a memory or into. Of an imaginary person. And this may not be a useful interpretation, right? It's that doesn't have predictive power. It doesn't tell you what? Actions.

02:40:29
Dominantly point their self-concept.

02:40:34
The fact that it's useful.

02:40:41
To. Presentation.

02:40:47
Try to.

02:40:51
Raise pointed out on. HY can try to portray and I think humanity self is like this directionality. You know, I think we can harken back to the other metaphor that we've booked earlier on of you know. The self of people of our individuals.

02:41:13
You know have this have a behavioral component. They have a a directional proclivity. They have you know, like these these values of attraction these attractive values that kind of entails the the behavior and and I think you know this as this this this concept of of people being like these eddies and embedded in the larger system is sort of like how I relate to the Buddhist concept of anatomy, you know, because when we say that the you know the con, Stant of of no-self in Buddhism, you know doesn't mean that like there's there's no such thing as a self it's that the self is something that is a construct of of a broader environment bunch of kin to how an Eddie in water, you know, that doesn't really have you know, a concrete existence, you know in Eddie and water is a constantly fluctuating constantly changing constantly evolving process a bunch of into the how person is how the cells is, but at the same time you can still look at an Eddie and acknowledge.

02:42:36
I love that.

02:43:11
Thing but it's very indirectly remotely yes, it serves them.

02:43:47
Structure of our own. Forward makes our psychologists.

02:44:11
The mind is like Maya, it's an illusion but I want to go back to what Ramsay said in that this this the concept of eddies and them and like imagine your willpower your will is like is like a fountain of of causation and you're just noticing where this fountain of causation is coming from and that location is is the faces of the formulation of a concept of view that your mind is creating that's not really real but it's just a fountain of causation, it's where some causes are coming from that are doing things and That's the content.

02:45:18
That would be maybe not.

02:45:23
Have you approach those things? Still trying to solve.

02:45:29
At the moment professionally I try to understand the nature of. This so I try to understand how mines emerge but are building. What is going to come after the?

02:45:46
Person level I try to figure. Not to be depressed and how to serve my friends. Relationship.

02:46:01
And the many many other tiny questions. Some of them are in physics lost lots of puzzles that try to solve I also. Told. You that how can I become more socially competent if there's a curious example today about a? My name. Is funny to eat. I thought Let's give this as an example.

02:46:32
And it's already if it's a tangent and stop me if anybody thinks it's boring or not interesting. Did we see where is it? Yes.

02:46:47
Received terrible news. Apparently, you can't actually.

02:46:59
And. I thought this is.

02:47:18
Only.

02:51:25
Wanted to explain this. Basically by looking at and. I noticed very.

02:51:43
Preforming that the same task day today, and so I I imagine if they had a story in their head it might be. More under benefited. Of.

02:52:01
What would be that evolved?

02:52:40
And also from ordinary materialism. And this is like interest later properly this is the following I gave this example imagine that your brain is is not just naturally performing the architecture that implements the cells and it becomes conscious basically all at once or gradually by informing all the right pathways and so on but imagine that the brain is in some photo necessance state and bubbles and forms all these oscillations and so on and there is something that can critical causation there's critical coarsenation is the necessary.

02:53:22
Properties to colonize the rest of the brain.

02:53:31
Of them that it can then throw a little part of it.

02:53:39
And. Be a person and do all the things that you're doing and be stable. Who have the stable rates which relies on the living organism that is it's healthy so. Functioning. These oscillations also. Great and there is nothing left. And the idea of.

02:54:19
Pattern that. Way is some kind of positivation that is stable and that is migrating.

02:54:32
That the universe is our planetary surface at these is full of these patterns that are going to be around and trying to find the necessary to possess and because they are so many of these patterns that are bustling around this brain for our mind particles, so to speak that all the conceived.

02:54:49
Function of a minus range. It doesn't take.

02:55:10
Per does not just. But.

02:55:38
Not very if they found.

02:55:45
Cop inside.

02:55:59
And the bullet.

02:56:08
Will break.

02:56:15
During our earthly users. And the most interesting pattern for most people they post the biggest destination for them is sex so after you die, most of us is.

02:56:30
And then they will be very kept drawn into the. Of the nestled embryo and then they're starting to get to the next life. Maybe if.

02:56:46
The application.

02:56:54
About the creation of minds in the first place in brains and it's not completely. But no. And I don't have.

02:57:08
And I think it's possible that somebody just pulled this out of their posterior and so on it's a good story and it caught on and then that's really defined it to miss allergy and that can put into this book and it was certain rights. Stabilized society, so I don't know if it's.

02:57:26
A fascinating thing.

02:57:41
Of the idea that they're. Just found more often. But they heal their some truth to the ability the other mind to be able to dissolve itself.

02:58:50
Creating everything and then you're good to go. I want to sort of like point out something that people might find interesting which is the five ranks of tozan it goes by the name it's basically it's a it's a poem that described describes stages of realization in the practice of Zen Buddhism.

02:59:18
And this what I think one of the big things that that this does is it's the point that it's not like there's just one realization that happened so it's not like you know, you realize your mind is is creating, you know everything and then you're good to go it's there's a huge journey for the human being to go through if you are are a serious, you know it.

02:59:49
Going to be the process of of meditating with that with maybe with the help of awakening to greater wisdom. I think that this is a great illustration but it's like like imagine like if you see if you see someone else who you know, to to try to try to like understand how your mind is or isn't creating everything look at someone else and and their misconception when they or you know, one person will even if you're like if you're mine allergies are just using a dating app one one person tells me their opinion of me and another person tells me their opinion to me and The opinions between the two people don't match and and so you can see like well this person seems like they're a lot more wrong and how could your mind be creating reality if you're you know, how could someone else might be creating reality when they're when they are just so completely wrong about what happens if they were creating reality, they'd be right all the time it's it's a right if everyone might was creating reality you'd always be right so that's not the case that your mind is is creating reality itself, it's and you can see that not it's not hard to say that when you just think about yourself.

03:00:59
If you look at. How other people are falling short then it becomes apparent. So, there's a lot more to realize.

03:01:36
The scientists here, but I'm reading a book and currently is called. Is from Schödinger.

03:01:58
We call it also back down. Already have this kind of. Trends used in the way the weather. Has much more.

03:02:13
Than that. Just because you can stabilize this is a matter. What matters is will you use this? To create something which is where you do something like seating sample altering the weather and solve. Something that. Yes, hell yes.

03:02:37
Patient somehow make us happy. Very excited. And. I just. Talking about a bit more ethical. What is mean after this like if we are really in the simulation we should we do like. Things that we. Even are.

03:03:10
Growing up real.

03:03:17
Quick just thank you very much. We're particularly on. I have actually two questions.

03:03:29
Actually also directed to your shoulder but. Anyone who? Might have.

03:03:43
A good a lot of. This is in some sense also quite a. Ffine. So my first preliminary question is is in your theory of simulation mathematics also.

03:03:58
Think that.

03:04:05
Answer yes. I think that messaged.

03:04:21
Helped.

03:04:40
And.

03:04:48
When. The.

03:06:00
University.

03:15:47
You.

03:18:18
Stop.

03:26:27
Space. That is able to simulate an entire universe. It's where you need a parent universe that is many magnitudes larger, right? So you cannot do that many mature scars and then still end of interesting physics going on a little devil. And so, I think that the lactic that we are in basically identity is just because of that relatively high.

03:26:59
Instance.

03:27:17
By so having a simulation with a intelligent life emerges by itself might require some kind of parent universe that has fewer constraints on their entropy sources than ours. Basically, if you want to have some kind of energy source and our universe as far as we know and maybe there are better ways of doing it you need some kind of a son that produces a neck entropy gradient between the Sun and deep space where energy is radiated off so you can basically build some pump in there that is driving your computer and there is the largest size to the Sun that you can make before it collapses into a black hole and there is a longest duration to which the sun can burn and until it's burned out, right?

03:27:59
If you want to get nuclear fusion, if it's if the sun is smaller than this it's going to not ignite if it's larger than this it's going to burn up faster. So there's a little bit to the number of computations that you can physically realize that our universe even if you overcome this limit of a star and you find better energy sources than stars there's going to be probably limits in in the sizes of universe that You can create by blowing up matter and calling it through a big bang or something.

03:28:35
So this basically largest number that Ben can be computed or that can be stored in a universe. And it's it's conceivable that there are some kind of parent universe that doesn't have these problems and maybe it has unbounded complexity, maybe not infinite but unbounded. Maybe that's possible. I don't know.

03:28:53
I don't know this way actually. This was my initial question. If the bounds we we see now in this in this mathematics is just bound to this world or to the simulation. So I I wonder it's basically the question would be do you find a set of causal principles that keeps rise to some kind of dynamic fractals in which you can find computers and intelligent beings and so on.

03:29:24
And. Is it possible to make one that is substantially larger than the University of And it's it's probably improved that is more interesting and involved than the Riemann contractor. But maybe it's easier. I don't know if I had a million dollars, maybe Bitcoin helps. I can set out the price.

03:29:49
Very interesting Yes Okay it's a very interesting thing but complexity by itself is not necessarily the problem right up to a point. So we can probably make a simulation in which something can become intelligent if we set the conditions of the simulation right in the beginning. But we don't seem to be in touch with simulation.

03:30:11
We are in one not this much much larger. Our intelligence seems to be lucky by product of whatever thing happens because there are so many stars and galaxies around right? So we just maybe random emergence in there.

03:30:26
How may not be? I would like to return to the topic of the room. I'll be living in a simulation and the very this very question is based on presumption that there is some kind of a separate reality and we have the representations of these reality. And I would like to say that this presumption is not is just a pretty function because for example if we take a hand and if we have a numb hand, for example, and we just see it.

03:31:02
So in this way this hand we have. This hand through the kind of representation. But if you restore our sensibility and we feel this hand then we feel it in a very different way when we feel it from inside not that we feel it from outside with another hand.

03:31:20
And on the other side if you're talking about representations, like for example thoughts can be considered representations, but if we consider thoughts in this representations as reality in our internal reality, and we observe them. Do we have representations for these representations? So it shows that this these issue is relative about simulation and for example, if we could initials that we just don't have access to all things like with the example of the numb hand that if you get an access then it's no longer represent the representation, it's no longer given us as a representation but as a direct perception and what if we just don't have access to all events to the universe, I mean the, We have access but we don't realize it we are not aware of it and if by chance we can restore the excess or reach the access to all events that are happening in the universe then there will be no difference between representations and reality.

03:32:34
Think of speaking.

03:32:39
I listen to a question that if we were to discover that there is something going on behind the curtain how are we going to distinguish that from yet new physics? And somehow for us to say that what we see at a lower energy is just a simulation somehow we have to have the intelligence to know that the new reality that we discovered behind the curtain is somehow artifact in some sense and I don't know if we are a smart enough to know the distinguish between whether it's a new physics or an artifact.

03:33:18
And if it's not an artifact then it's just nature and then we're we're about to score one. Thing this is also my question and I also want to kind of integrate something like that behind cousin and also previously mentioned about the self-serve content. I think they are compatible so let me yeah just describe my opinion so so so back to this topic are we leaving the,
