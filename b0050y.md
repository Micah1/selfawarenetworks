2. Summary
The conversation revolves around the simulation hypothesis—the idea that reality may function like a programmed simulation—and its implications on personal growth, consciousness, and our understanding of existence. Participants share personal experiences and philosophical perspectives to explore this concept.

One speaker discusses how recurring situations in their life, specifically related to overcoming stage fright as a musician, seem to adjust in response to their choices, resembling levels in a game or simulation. They interpret these repeated experiences as opportunities for personal growth, suggesting that reality may adapt to help individuals "level up."

Others debate whether the simulation is mechanically computed by an external programmer or if it's an intrinsic part of consciousness and personal development. Some argue that predictable mechanisms, like synchronicity and spiritual practices, facilitate learning and transformation, likening them to the rules within a simulation that guide progress.

The discussion also touches on the limitations of human control and free will. One participant asserts that we are passengers in our own bodies, governed by unconscious systems like the autonomic nervous system, questioning the extent of our agency within the simulation.

There is skepticism about the simulation hypothesis, with some viewing it as unfalsifiable and speculative metaphysics rather than a scientific theory. Others point out that as we advance technologically, especially in creating indistinguishable simulations, it's intriguing to consider that we might already be within one.

The conversation further explores the computational challenges of simulating complex realities and whether randomness can exist within a simulated framework. Participants consider the roles of consciousness, spirituality, and the human mind's ability to shape reality, suggesting that our perceptions and thoughts might influence the simulation.

Finally, the discussion delves into personal desires and societal boundaries within a simulated reality. Questions are raised about what individuals might choose to simulate if given the chance, how that would impact their growth, and whether boundaries are necessary in such a world. The idea of meaningfulness and information as fundamental elements of reality is also considered, proposing that another civilization might understand the universe differently than we do.

The stories and discussions you've provided relate to the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind by illustrating how individual consciousness and experiences may be interconnected within a larger, adaptive system—much like a self-aware network.

Key Connections:

Adaptive Reality and Personal Growth:

Recurring Situations as Opportunities: One speaker describes how similar situations repeatedly occur in their life, offering chances to overcome stage fright and grow as a musician. This suggests a reality that adapts to individual choices, mirroring how self-aware networks adjust based on feedback.
Reality Adjusting to Choices: The idea that the "simulation" or reality responds to personal decisions aligns with the concept of a network that is aware of its components and modifies itself accordingly.
Consciousness as an Active Participant:

Mind Influencing Reality: Participants discuss how thoughts and intentions might shape experiences, implying that consciousness isn't just passively observing but actively influencing the network it's part of.
Synchronicity and Meaningfulness: The mention of meaningful coincidences (synchronicities) reflects how interconnected events might be perceived as the network's way of communicating or adapting to the individual's state of mind.
Interconnected Systems and Feedback Loops:

Mechanisms Facilitating Learning: The conversation touches on predictable mechanisms, like spiritual practices and synchronicity, that guide personal development—similar to how feedback loops operate in self-aware networks.
Agency Within the Network: While acknowledging limitations in control and free will, there's recognition of the individual's role within the larger system, contributing to and affected by the network's dynamics.
Philosophical Perspectives on Existence:

Simulation Hypothesis as a Metaphor: The simulation serves as a metaphor for the complex interplay between consciousness and reality, suggesting that what we perceive as reality might be a manifestation of a self-aware network at a higher level.
Self-Reference and Self-Modification: By contemplating reality's responsiveness to personal growth, the discussion aligns with theories that propose the mind is capable of self-reference and influencing its own development within the network.
Summary:

The relevance of the stories to the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind lies in their illustration of how personal consciousness may interact with and potentially influence an adaptive reality. This mirrors the idea that the mind functions as part of a self-aware network, where individual experiences and choices contribute to and are shaped by the larger system. The discussions provide practical examples of how our perceptions, thoughts, and actions might be interconnected within a networked consciousness, offering insights into the nature of mind and reality from this theoretical perspective.

Those things are capable of adjusting into the video game.
Obviously, the programming that leads the Pac-Man ghost to be on one side of the screen
and then go to another side of the screen, it can appear in different places.
All of that is adjustable based upon what you as the player choose.
And similarly, moving the Matrix, you have a situation where the real people,
like Trinity and Neo, are making choices.
And then the game, the Matrix, is adjusting to them.
And what I argue in my book, The Leap to Wholeness,
How the World is Programmed to Help Us Grow, Heal, and Adapt,
and from the paper that I published, Space-Time Pads as a whole,
is that because space-time is defined as a whole,
then when you interact with something that's existing as a whole,
you're interacting not just with it in the present, but its whole history.
And the history is defined since you last observed it.
And that that history can adjust as a whole.
Like the entire branch, you either interact with one branch or a different branch,
but not part of one branch and part of another branch.
So when you interact with the world,
you're interacting with a world that falls into place in that moment
to match a certain criteria.
And the whole world falls into place in that moment to match that criteria.
So there's a wholeness to the reality we experience,
but it's adjusting up to the last second
to match the choices we make as the subjective game players.
So I want to give an example of this that maybe illustrates
why I think this is so practical and personal for me.
So you're probably familiar with me as a musician.
I play music my whole life,
and I often get up here and play a song or two that I've written.
And in the past few months,
I've been really sort of being recalled into playing music.
It's been really lovely.
I've had a lot of opportunities to play.
I was invited to play in a band.
And so that's all really fun and cool.
And I noticed this one night was a Halloween party.
I was invited to go to a Halloween party for my cousin.
And I show up, and I'm invited to be a musician.
And it's this really intimidating situation
with a whole bunch of people that I've never met.
There's a piano sitting there in the middle of the room,
and I'm supposed to play.
So I spend the first half an hour getting over my stage fright
and sort of settling in.
And then I have a good time.
It's basically sort of a mixed bag.
And I sort of walk away feeling like that was a useful experience,
but not quite the optimal, right?
It was a Saturday night.
It was Halloween or whatever, the day before Halloween.
And a week later to the day, on Saturday night,
I find myself out in Point Reyes,
which is a town I grew up in, at the local bar,
which is a place I've played at before with my band.
There's a piano there.
And so this time I'm like in the same situation, right?
A piano in the middle of a room with a bar.
And the point here is that this is a repeating pattern.
Literally a week later,
it's kind of like a simulation of an experience a second time.
And I go to play the piano.
But the, what's it called?
The machine that plays the music.
It's like called DJ machine or whatever.
The jukebox.
The jukebox, yeah.
It's playing super loud.
And it's like songs that I can't compete with.
You know, and the people are like too into the music
to turn it off or turn it down.
And it's like, it goes for like two or three hours,
just endless.
So anyway, I can't get up the courage to like get myself
into the mix to play music that night.
So it's kind of a letdown.
The following week, Saturday night,
I find myself at a Burning Man screening of a movie.
This time I sort of got the message
that there was like a simulation happening, right?
Three weeks in a row.
So similar situation, I'm at an event
with a lot of people that I don't really know.
This time I brought my guitar.
And I started just, before the movie started,
it was just people milling about,
we had about an hour to kill.
I just started singing songs
because it was kind of a campfire vibe.
People were kind of into it a little bit,
mostly ignoring me.
And then the host of the movie decided,
he said, hey man, come up and play on stage.
So he pulls me up there with a microphone,
puts it in front of me.
While the movie's sort of getting ready to be started.
And he just invited me to play what I was doing.
So I kept playing and played for half an hour.
Played a full set.
It really, it called me into a new place in myself
to trust in the songs that I knew how to play,
to sing with confidence,
and to just be happy with what I was doing and confident.
And just not take on the pressure of self-consciousness
and all that stuff that I'm trying to let go of.
And it was the third week in a row, right?
And I came away from that experience really like,
that was what I was trying to accomplish.
So I want to point out that I think situations
that recur in our lives.
And obviously the situation is very different.
One night it was at a first friend's house.
The night it was at a bar.
Third night it was outdoors.
And this movie, this outdoor movie theater.
And totally different situations, different people.
But the same inner process for me
of what I'm trying to get to
in my next up-leveling of life,
which is obviously the up-leveling of the game level, right?
Getting to the next level of the game.
And so I walked away from that experience
feeling like I get it.
I've got a new understanding of where I'm trying to get to,
who I'm trying to be, and how to do it.
And I would say I'm now operating in a different zone
with respect to that music confidence
and sort of ability and willingness to step into those roles.
So I don't know how everybody else feels about that repeatedness,
but I think that's a really crucial part
of what the simulation's about.
And that it's adjusting to our choices
to bring us those situations on a regular time schedule.
Can I just ask you a question, Matt?
That's kind of super interesting
because I've had very similar encounters
with the same thing where it looks like
there's a gun pointing at my head going,
and you need to level up.
I think sometimes here with the nature
of the conversation around simulation
is that it's being computed.
You know, that there's something,
there is a programmer outside of us.
It has a mechanical feel to it,
and I'm not sure the distinction between
consciousness and us up-leveling ourselves
through a series of challenges,
maybe in terms of being reincarnated
and inside the same lifetime,
and the idea that there is computability
behind what's happening.
Well, I think, you know,
if we really abstract away
and get really sophisticated in our thinking,
what makes something mechanical?
Is it that it's made out of steel and wires,
copper, rubber,
or is it a predictability and a mechanism
that's to it like a cause and effect nature
of the actions in the machine?
And I think that,
I'm sure there's movies like this,
maybe The Matrix is one,
where the mechanism includes emotion,
it includes spiritual insight.
I don't think that just because
we have a spiritual life
and a spiritual world
that that takes away
the mechanistic nature of it.
I think actually synchronicity,
the reason I study it with fervor
is because I think it's a mechanism
which allows for consciousness
to experience the learning
that it's trying to experience.
It doesn't mean it's mechanical,
like made of metal,
but it does mean it's predictable.
Like yoga is this spiritual path
and Buddhism is kind of similar.
It's a spiritual path,
but it's very based on reproducibility.
I think that's because
it's essentially mechanistic.
With synchronicity,
I think that you can expect
synchronicities to happen in life
and you can expect this up-leveling
to happen once you reach certain criteria.
I think it's like collecting
a number of coins.
It's like building momentum
towards a certain outcome,
adding power to the machine
so that you can launch yourself
out of this level
into the next level,
but it's not forgiving.
If you don't reach that level of power,
you don't make it.
You've got to try again.
It's not like you're being
a good or bad person
and the value judgments
and the morality of religion.
I think that's outdated.
I think it's just about
making it to a new level of operation
as a human being
and as a consciousness,
as a way of thinking.
Does that speak to your question?
Yeah, no, I think sometimes...
No, and I think I agree wholeheartedly with that.
I think sometimes the idea of the simulation
gets entangled
with kind of the concept
of advanced computers
having simulated the reality that we're in.
And that's when I start to get a little fuzzy
or I disagree with that concept.
If you don't mind,
I just want to touch on
and kind of edify.
So no speculation needed.
Like, we're not in control.
We're...
Anybody who understands
the neuroscience
of how our brain actually functions,
how our body is controlled,
our higher reasoning center
is the cerebral cortex.
It's not...
We're just a passenger.
When the system
that's actually in control of your body
is the autonomic nervous system.
It's the limbic system.
So that's your hypothalamus.
It sends all the inputs
to your sympathetic nervous system
to actually function your body.
So where we...
You guys are operating
under the assumption
that we have free will.
We don't even have free will
over our own bodies.
You know,
all systems of survival
and continuation
are out of our conscious control.
We have no freedom
to choose whether or not
our heart's going to beat
or we're going to breathe.
And funny,
you know,
if you've ever suffered
a severe head injury,
I had one in 2010
where my automatic regulation
of my breathing
was disrupted.
And I had to consciously
remember to breathe.
and I would wake up
gasping on the floor.
And it was...
For about three weeks,
it was a really...
A real eye-opener.
But, you know,
we have...
We...
We don't have...
When you get emotional
and what...
Your emotions are not part
of your higher reasoning.
Your emotions are
subject to the amicula.
And it's all tied
into your fight-or-flight response.
And we think we understand
consciousness
and we think we understand
our input on the world around us.
But we're only passengers
in our own body.
You know what I mean?
That's not true.
Just a...
Well, well, okay.
So let me do a little bit
of a moderation here
in that we just open up
like five Pandora's boxes
as far as like
what reality is,
what consciousness is,
and if we have free will.
And the real quick response
to that is
no one has the definitive answer
to a lot of those
kind of questions.
We can debate on those all night.
We've had some rooms
that have been debated
for over 24 hours straight
on some of those subjects.
And so that's not saying
that those aren't good questions,
but that they are tough
to get definitive
and they...
But as far as
what I was saying
I was going to do
as moderate a little
is that we have
some wonderful guests on stage
and about six or seven people
that haven't spoken yet.
So if you're new on stage
and you would like
to contribute a thought
or question or comment,
perhaps flash your mic
and then we'll try to get
to all the new people
on stage who raised their hand.
Future, did you have
something to add?
And then I'll get to Eli
and go from there.
Sure.
I can give my patented
simulation hypothesis talk.
It might help though.
You guys might like...
If you go to my Twitter,
I pushed out an old comic image today
that is kind of relevant.
It's just me standing on the earth
kind of talking about
we just kind of woke up here,
you know,
and simulation hypothesis
is something that I've always
kind of felt, I think.
It's been this thing
of a thing, right?
Like with video games
and all those things
that just, you know,
I remember playing hard driving,
you know,
and being like,
oh my God,
there's a reality in there
and just being kind of
awed by arcade games.
And then, you know,
Matrix came out
kind of secretly.
You start thinking,
oh man,
is this happening?
And then it was so cool
when Elon Musk kind of,
you know,
came out of the closet
and was like,
you know,
simulation of us.
Like, oh shit,
I can talk about that now?
Nobody's going to think
I'm crazy?
That was pretty great.
And, you know,
I just,
I posed this to you guys.
Like,
put on your Sherlock Holmes
detective,
you know,
hats.
And,
you just got to go through
this simple thought,
you know,
you know,
jungle gym.
You know,
space,
pretty big,
right?
Infinite.
We find ourselves here
on Earth.
Awesome.
Time,
pretty infinite and long.
Cool.
We find ourselves
here in time.
In this moment.
Where do we find ourselves
right before?
Well,
we find ourselves
right before
this moment in time
where we are literally
going to be able
to simulate
whole realities.
By the time,
20 years from now,
with GPTs
and GANs
and everything,
we'll be able
to simulate realities
that are indistinguishable
from our own.
Like,
it will be,
it will be crazy
how the fidelity
these realities
will have.
I mean,
I don't even know.
Some of the stuff
might hear,
who knows,
there might be
brain jacking
into those things.
Who knows
what's going to happen?
So with that being said,
right,
all that infinite space,
all that infinite time,
we find ourselves
right at the time
before we invent
that very thing
which we could be
inside of.
That is too weird
for me to
ignore,
and hence
I place
a high confidence
value
on that
simulation
hypothesis.
What it is,
what it's going
towards,
you know,
I don't know,
what parts,
I don't know,
but it just seems
like all those
coincidences
seem to add up
to something
a little too
coincidental
for me.
So,
there you go.
There's my
patented
simulation
hypothesis talk.
Very true,
although probable
sometimes,
especially if we
can say it's
very probable,
then it's
tricky because
it doesn't mean
it definitely is,
it just means
that it's
highly likely
depending on
certain mathematical
ways to look at it.
But,
Eli,
did you have
something to add?
Go ahead.
Yeah,
so when it looks
like I wasn't
going to make it
here at all,
I summarized
what was
really a footnote
in the paper
that I was
supposed to finish
just as the
pandemic started,
so it never
got finished
on this
particular topic.
Well,
not the paper,
the footnote
was on this topic.
And,
so I could
pin the tweet
if you like,
or I could
read it out,
whichever you
prefer.
Up to you,
if you'd like
to read it,
or pin it,
we'll check it
out.
Okay,
so I will,
actually,
I will do
both.
Let me,
ah,
I got lost,
sorry about
this.
Oh man,
I've never heard
Eli frustrated,
ever.
That's fine.
If you're not
ready,
we can come
back to it.
Yeah,
why don't we
do that?
Why don't we
do that?
Okay,
so right
now what
we're trying
to do is
watch people
raise their
hand because
they're interested
in this and
we want to
get to the
new people
on stage
who haven't
spoken yet.
So if you're
new on the
stage,
grab the
mic,
flash the
mic,
and we'll
try to get
to the
new people
and then
go back
to Pop
Core
after that.
I just
thought of
this thing.
Would a
simulation have
a random
number generator
in it?
Because it
feels like
there's two
schools of
thought.
Either
everything is
already played
out and
predicted and
there is
some kind
of super
mega computer
built around
the star
that's simulating
all of this.
But I don't
see a reason
why a
simulation
would not
have a
random
number generator
because once
you factor
that in,
stuff like
2 to the
power of
256 or
2 to the
power of
128,
the symmetric
encryption,
once you go
to those
numbers,
those numbers
are bigger
than the
amount of
total atoms
in the
universe.
So that
means that
even if it
is a
simulation,
there would
be a
random
factor to
it which
you cannot
predict.
And I
don't know,
I haven't
explored this
all in my
mind,
I literally
just thought
of it.
Would a
simulation
have a
random
factor which
it's,
because if
it did,
then it
would make
a lot of
things
impossible to
compute
just in
and of
itself.
Because you
would end
up with
math that
the entire
system cannot
make up
for.
So there's
that.
I haven't
really finished
this thought.
So, yeah,
that's all I have to say.
there are a lot
of things that
are just really
difficult to
calculate.
If you ever
want to convince
yourself of that,
just look at
doing like a
full high-level
theory calculation
of molecules
that have 20
atoms can be
really, really
challenging.
You get to the
high levels of
theory.
So, at the
very least,
any of these
simulation
hypotheses
would involve
lots of
approximation
and lots of
multi-scale
modeling.
Yeah, we
can't even
simulate water
yet, so
we've got a
little ways to
go.
Water is really
challenging.
Yeah, we
talked a lot
about that the
last few
weeks.
Eli, do you
have your
footnote ready
or should we
keep going?
Yeah, so I
pinned it to
the stage and
I'm going to
read it.
So, let's
see.
Need to
make quick
work of the
simulation
hypothesis.
There was a
2020 paper that
didn't get
finished due
to the
pandemic that
had much of
this in a
footnote.
So, if
anything, it's
really just
a way...
Oh, no, no,
no, no.
Okay, hold
on, hold
on.
Okay, so
the simulation
hypothesis is
metaphysics
masquerading as
math, something
of a cognitive
dark pattern.
It rigs the
dice in at
least two
ways, positing a
relative infinity
of simulated
universes,
positing all the
simulations are
equally likely,
including the
likelihood for
movement as
base reality.
Then, from this
equivalence, it
calculates that the
likelihood of being
in base reality
is 1 over the
quantity of 1
plus the number
of simulations.
In point of
fact, the
reality of not a
single simulated
universe has been
established.
Prior to the
simulation hypothesis,
we took ourselves
to be in base
reality, but based
on the line of
reasoning being
advanced, we are
led to reject
that.
Here's the thing.
On this line of
reasoning, even
those in base
reality are led to
reject the reality
of their universe.
So, the
simulation hypothesis
fails catastrophically
in the particular
case of interest,
which was the
prior presumption.
In other words,
this is also
elaborate, obfuscated
presumption shifting.
In base reality,
it's a stopped
clock that manages
to never be right,
which is pretty
remarkable,
considering how
much traction
it has gotten.
We can also
note that there
is an elective
affinity between
feeling alienated
and or feeling
disempowered and
being disposed to
accept the
irreality of
one's own world.
This is one of
the actual insights
we get from
the simulation
hypothesis.
The other is
that, as with
the flatter of
conspiracy, many
people can be
convinced of
anything that is
manifestly
untrue.
So, if
anything, it's
reality, it's
really just a
simulacrum of
a hypothesis
inherently
unfalsifiable
and defective
on its face
when viewed
from the right
perspective.
Side note,
I actually agree
with Boston's
early work on
the ethics of
advanced molecular
nanotechnology,
topic of
keenness, just
given much of
my prior work.
Sorry about my
poor reading of
the Twitter thread.
I think you
settled it, Eli,
so I can go
now.
That was
brilliant.
Yeah, my
job.
Well, that's it,
everybody.
Go ahead,
anybody.
Looking at,
I was looking at
Stephen Wolfram's
new theory of how
he tries to
explain the
universe as this
giant graph-based
computer.
computer, and
yeah, there's
this component
there, too, that
the universe is
self-generated, and
it's this computer
that generates
itself, and
because it's
computational, it
makes it very
hard.
No, it makes it
impossible for you
to take a
snapshot or take
a slice off of
it just because of
the computational
nature of it.
It makes it
impossible to
predict what's
going to happen
ahead.
Again, because
because of
stuff like, I
think, stuff like
what he was
saying, like
molecules going
to the power of
20 and then
going beyond
that, it just
makes it very
hard.
But then I
asked a friend
who had done
his PhD at
Harvard on
quantum
informatics, and
all he said
was, I think,
Stephen Wolfram
is off his
meds, and so I
didn't get a
very good response
to that, but
that's as far
as I've
gotten on
it.
So we've
only got
like a
couple people
left that
haven't spoke
yet, so
and then
after that
we kind
of go back
to like
the popcorn
and anything
goes, but
Brent or
Shane or
JP, did
you guys have
anything to
have?
I want to
say hi to
JP.
Hi, JP.
How are
you?
Hey, everybody.
Hope everyone's
having a good
night, and
great to see
you, Hazel.
Good to see
you, too.
I'm so happy
you're able to
make it.
I'd love to
hear what you
have to say
about the
metaverse.
simulation
theory, a
lot of it
seems to
be
intertwined.
A lot of
people that
are into
gaming
actually
believe in
the simulation.
So it's
very exciting.
It's a very
interesting topic
for me,
to me.
So,
yeah,
you want to
tell us
what you
think about
this?
Yeah, I
know.
I appreciate
the invite.
Great to
see some
of the
brilliant
minds of
Clubhouse
here.
I see
Future and
Eli and
Ryan.
I feel
like I'm
in
Romper
room.
Goodness.
Great,
great minds
here.
Shane,
yourself,
and Sierra,
Rebecca,
Mercy,
just an
all-star
room.
I guess
maybe I'll
frame it in
a kind of
different
fashion for
the way I'm
looking at
it.
I really
appreciated
some of the
things that
were said
by Skye
about we
really can't
say anything
in a
definitive
fashion.
We can
just
possibly
offer up
some
opinions
on what
we think.
What I
find fascinating
about
simulation
theory and
the way
we experience
life as
humans right
now,
it feels,
at least
from my
perspective,
that we
have a
really
strange
capability
to
manifest
reality
with our
minds.
That's a
really strange
concept in
some fashions.
It's like
saying I can
grab a
concept and
treat it
like an
object.
I can
grab it
and just
roll it
or I can
just do
things that
just don't
necessarily
make sense,
but we
can often
find a
way to
forge a
path to
those
things.
And to
me, that's
one of the
more fascinating
things about
this, that
we truly
have the
ability to
craft reality
with our
minds.
That just
puts me in
a space
where, as
with this
great discussion,
where I am
baffled by
some of the
limitations that
we're bound
by, but
also astonished
by some of
the things
that we're
able to do
in light of
them.
I guess one
of the other
aspects of
this is that
I think I
heard one of
our colleagues
in the room
speak about
maybe autonomous
systems like
breathing and
how if they
aren't autonomous
we somehow
find ourselves
kind of
offset.
That one
again fascinates
me.
I guess
from a
perspective of
seeing and
being and
then experiencing
there was a
moment in
time where
personally I
had a
strange epiphany
and I'll be
real about how
it happened.
I was in
probably the
strangest
Sylvia moment
in my entire
life.
But at that
moment it
felt like
reality ripped
apart.
Everything
became
atemporal
and as I
found myself
in a place
that I
shouldn't
exist in
odd things
occurred in
the fact that
people showed
up and
started to
move pieces
of reality
away from
where I was
existing and
then they
noticed me and
said hey you
probably shouldn't
be here.
It was a
really astonishing
moment.
Can't say that
it wasn't the
Sylvia but it
was definitely
an epiphany.
It seems like
that there are
moments in
time where we
have the ability
to craft and
do things that
we just don't
understand and
maybe we do get
a glimpse of
a moment of
light in the
dark or maybe
a quick peek
behind the
curtain.
I just don't
know.
I will say
though that
again our
minds are
fascinating and
we truly have
the abilities to
do things that
we really don't
comprehend and
I guess I'll
push it to the
last area that
really fascinates
me about this
conversation and
that's if we
think that this
is reality and
we are able to
then dream.
How do we
find that lucid
dreaming that
some people are
able to utilize?
It's a
discipline.
It's something
that can be
taught.
It's something
that can be
exercised.
It's kind of
like most
people don't
understand that
just like your
body you can
exercise it to
get it stronger.
Just like your
mind you can do
things to sharpen
your skills.
Spiritually you
can expand those
things but you
know in lucid
dreaming I say
that we really
don't know how
that maybe
affects us but
it is certainly a
discipline that
again kind of
puts me in the
simulation theory
because people are
able to go into
dreams and control
them.
It's fascinating.
Speaking of
spirituality with
Buddhism the idea
there's no right
perspectives I think
there is a valid
perspective to say
there is no self
or that the self
is a simulation
that is generated
by the physics
of your mind
and so the
idea of who
is in control
who is making
decisions
who's observing
I think that
if you see it
from the perspective
that there's no
real self
or the self
is a simulation
there's no
passenger that's
separate from
the functioning
of the organism
of the being
computer stuff
like whether
it's metaverse
or a hypothetical
matrix like
reality that's a
simulation thing
and then we say
you know some of
the examples that
we were talking
about earlier
with like reality
just like the
day-to-day our
lives reality and
consciousness and
the universe is a
lot like a simulation
like that anyway
and you know
all these things
that we just
mentioned that
it just gets
what that gets
into whether
that's an
imagined order
like money
that doesn't
even exist
or an imagined
order like
government
that's just
kind of like
something that
we kind of
loosely agree
upon you know
there's all
these things
that are real
because we say
that they are
and they work
because we agree
on them internally
as an individual
and as bigger
and bigger groups
but then as you
try to divide it
up as like is
this real is this
real is this real
the only way to
get to a definitive
answer at least
I believe and
then it'd be
interesting to hear
from the others
and maybe Shane
and anyone else
new on stage
as I'm spoken
yet is at
least what I
believe is
a pragmatic
view because
the reason you
have to look at
it pragmatically
is because
we have such
limited access
to definitive
absolute knowledge
or objective
information
but
pragmatically
we can say
the goal of
life
for starters
is to
survive
as individuals
and as a
species
and as
the universe
as the
biosphere
etc
and then
there are
goals from
there like
to get better
at that
or to get
better at
life
and those
kind of
things
and then
once you can
put it in a
pragmatic
game like
paradigm
then even
though you
can't say
for sure
what all
quote unquote
whatever real
is or whatever
consciousness is
it can
come together
and sort
of like
affordances
or things
that help
achieve the
goals of
getting better
at survival
and getting
better at
being
good
creatures
whatever that
is
but
anyway
I want to
hear from
go ahead
really cool
points there
and
what's coming
to my
mind and
heart right
now is
like
why I say
heart
because what
I want to
talk about
is like
the role
of heart
and
you know
as we
think about
the
unfoldment
of
the metaverse
and
you know
I think
there's this
beautiful
sort of
beauty
and a
danger
to it
the beauty
is that
by spending
time in
places like
alt space
like for
burning man
in 2020
during the
pandemic
in alt space
there was
this great
reenactment
of the
burning man
community
and it
was just
an incredible
experience of
connection
with a lot
of people
that I
never met
before
and I
think that
that opens
gateways to
communication
styles and
new ways of
being that
people don't
have access to
in their
everyday life
because they've
got habitual
relationships and
certain ways of
interacting in
their physical
body
that's why I
like clubhouse
because I
can sort of
enact in a way
that doesn't
engage my
visuals and
only the
audio and
it's a
different
experience and
it allows me
to do some
healing in
some ways and
to try on
different
personalities that
wouldn't otherwise
so I think that
there's a real
benefit towards
the for
evolution from
a virtual
reality augmented
reality experience
I think also
that those
folks who
are on the
leading edge
we need
leaders in
this space
who recognize
the connection
to whatever
you want to
call it but
spiritual
principles or
self-awareness
or mindfulness
whatever that
looks like for
each of us
it might be
different but
it has to do
with understanding
the purpose of
these tools the
purpose of
becoming more
powerful with
augmented reality
the purpose of
being connected
you know the
obvious detriment
of social media
can be that we
amplify non-truths
and have
polarization but
there's a lot of
positives too to
social media and
connectedness I
think augmented
reality is the
same way so we
need to continue
to bring in
humanness and
have leaders in
the space
thought leaders
who model
vulnerability
model good
you know good
room leadership
in clubhouses
like a thing
you know being a
good room
moderator is an
example of how
to turn a
digital space
into a healing
or human or
educational space
and sometimes that
doesn't happen and
you can see the
outcomes are not
as good so I
just want to
emphasize that and
I think people have
been talking around
that as well
other people too
importance of
wisdom
in the virtual
world thanks I'm
Sky and I'm
complete
if one of the
new people on
stage is not
going I would
like to go
this is Dr.
Youngblood
yeah sure go
ahead
so okay so I
want to I want to
dive into this a
little bit deeper
than I think what
we have away from
from some of the
science and maybe
some people refer to
this is make believe
or simulation theory
right so I'm sitting
here wondering 
the other thing I'm
thinking on is if
you in 500 BC are
doing 1692 or
thereabouts doing the
Salem witch trial
if whatever God
you believed in or
whatever Messiah you
believed in at that
time was a programmer
they would be a
horrible program to
have simulated such a
thing that existed
during that particular
time ///////////////// at what point
would you take
yourself beyond the
normal and would you
allow yourself to have
boundaries and rules
because in all these
programs there's a
there's rules right
you have to have
programming rules that
code can only do so
much it can only
extend to so so many
points and I'm sitting
here and I'm thinking
to myself how many
times in history have
we been wrong with
science even on the
wrong side of science
today with COVID even
on the wrong side of
science when it comes
to all the mass
scary diseases from
HIV to Ebola to so
on how many times are
we wrong and I was a
kid Pluto was a
planet now today Pluto
is not a planet so you
know we have to push
eggs black men
shouldn't eat eggs
because it cause high
cholesterol then I
find out I can eat
eggs because it's not
the egg that's causing
the high cholesterol at
what point do we go
past the state of this
simulation and what are
you getting out of it
in do your simulation
get the cross other
people simulation and
if so how as I said
before if you're dating
somebody and they're not
satisfied with you and
you're satisfied with
them do they improve
you in in their
simulation and in in
their real world they
are they're suffering
to what point do we
push the boundaries of
it do we if if the
whole world was a
simulation now is it
is it coded in based on
every messiah whether
it's Allah or Jesus or
Buddha or whoever it
is the famine that's
happening in the
Middle East right now
was that rolled into
the cold that these
people have to suffer
the tsunami that
happened off of India
some years back and
more than a hundred
thousand people die or
what's going on in
Haiti right now or
with cancer right now
at what point in time
do we push the
boundaries to say this
is what this is and
this is what this is and
in my opinion are we
allowed to have
boundaries I don't
think so I think if
it's something that
you're going to be able
to make up why should
you have boundaries
unless you're playing
in somebody else's
simulation unless you're
in their world and
their in their spiritual
realm and their
holistic realm even if
it's phased over into
reality do you get to
say okay did you get do
you get to have a safe
word ////////////////////////////////// just
the conversation of the
science of it because I
mean we're allowed to do
that right I mean I just
said everything I said
was this am I simulating
now or is this how I
really am I mean this is
what I would like to for
us to kind of take this if
that's possible even if it's
just for a few minutes I
would like to know
yeah I'd love to respond to
that this is sky yeah I
love I love what you brought
up and the way you shared
it
um I think that that's
that's kind of what I was
trying to get at around
wisdom that as as as I
experience more experiences
as a human being and try to
learn from them that's kind
of the confusing point that
keeps coming to me is that
like there's if I were to
choose a different life would
I choose anything different or
would I actually because
because you know I would
say my life is frustrating
a lot you know I get
really frustrated and
there's difficulties but
actually when I really look
objectively would I would I
choose a different set of
problems you know there's a
metaphor of walking into a
party hanging up all your
hanging up your coat on the
wall that's all your
troubles you hang them up on
the wall go and have a good
time when you leave the
party you can take any coat
you want but you choose your
own coat because you're you're
those are the troubles that
you chose and so that really
speaks to me just sort of the
wisdom of and that's kind of
the danger of having a
simulation is that people
would think that they can get
rid of their problems by
simply changing the
simulation you know and
that your story about the
boy with no arms at the
swimming pool is really
illustrative we don't really
know what makes us happy we
think that we know what's
going to make us happy we
strive for that and maybe
we're right but a lot of
times when I get to that
point of happiness and then
I you know 20 minutes
later I'm no longer happy
I'm on to the next thing
so I think there's something
about happiness that we
don't understand so if we're
trying to simulate the world
we should try and understand
what the happiness goal is to
begin with before we start
messing with it otherwise
we're going to create
situations that we don't
really want and think that
we're fixing ourselves but
actually create situations
that we're really unhappy
with so I really appreciate the
example you brought up and
what it points to you know
are we really do we really
know what we're striving for
as human beings and for me
it points to having more
humility like I don't really
know and I got to go through
the striving rather than just
trying to fix it on the
surface thank you I'm sky
I'm complete
I'll jump in I don't know I
think that so I think you got
to know like you know JP
brought up a really interesting
thing you know he was like I
like that you know he uh he
tripped out and like saw these
people or the entities like
level designing reality that
that's a really interesting
thought um you know I I think
we do have you know sky based on
your rules I think we have that
ability to some extent I mean we
do that every day it's like man
I'm thirsty let me go get a glass
of water it's like okay cool you
do that like that's just what
happens thought you know turns
into action I I think one of the
keys to do it well you know I've
been lucky I've I've kind of been
able to push and pull reality
better than most I I you know I
job said that like Steve job said
that it was some some point
interview that always made me kind
of might made my ears perk up when
he said that he's like once you
kind of understand you can bend
reality you can do it more and more
and more um you know I think one of
the things to do it like like I
don't know who that last speaker
was is one you have to be at peace
with all of your past you know you
got to realize this moment in time
is all you have right and from
there you know it's about
visualizing what you really want to
kind of have happen now whether or
not it'll happen whether or not
this is a simulation whether or not
this is just quantum you know
whatever or just you know per chance
who knows it's a good way just to
live life anyway and uh you you get
that visualization and you know
maybe maybe that that's this you
know we can't know for sure but
like you know the the moderator
said and JP said it's like we can
only kind of give each other's
experiences to each other and offer
these little tidbits of I mean sky
collects this stuff for his books
and JP's telling us how he's seeing
the underlying nature of reality I can
just share my own experience like
getting a vision being at peace
with your past having a very clear
vision of of moments that you want
to manifest in your future allows
you to to kind of you know get to
things like those things you know and
and and you know it's just funner
living life that way I can just say
it's it's funner to think about it's
in a simulation sure there's I guess
there's dangers that you guys can have
but I don't know I guess I've made
video games my whole life so I can be
very comfortable thinking that I'm in
one it just seems easy easier that
way for that rapper but uh but yeah
it's a you know and and regardless of
this true it's just a good way to live
what life is is really try to self
actualize so any anyway hi hi I can I
see real quick I want to add to what
sky said I think sky said something very
insightful or about um about uh happiness
being the goal and I I I would like to
actually see if we could rephrase that
um you know what if completeness is the
goal and if we can use completeness as
sort of the angle that we're going to
use to approach this then um we can
actually now use Goodell's theorems of
consistency and incompleteness as the as
the benchmark to gauge this um what are
your thoughts on that sky
uh so when I I think of the word
wholeness but you're probably saying the
same thing that you know wholeness is
something that is sort of undefinable
because it can mean different things to
different people what it's going to
make me whole is different from what's
going to make you whole and what's
going to make me whole right now it's
going to be different from what's going
to make me whole later you know I need a
meal right now but later I need sleep
or I need a companionship now or later I
need to feel successful at work and
wholeness I think ultimately comes down
to some kind of like self-expression
and calling down to the depths of our
soul and be becoming who we really want
to be in the world um so I do think
that that you brought up a good point
which is that we're not actually after
happiness or satisfaction or pleasure
but we can experience all those things
from a pursuit of wholeness or a learning
about wholeness and to me that's the goal
of the simulation is to become more
complete human beings and find that
wholeness
hi sky okay now that's amazing okay now
let's add one more thing so whatever it's
not just about finding what makes you
complete but it's about what makes you
complete and consistent and if we can use
that to be our benchmark then the question
becomes you know the do simulations
account for like perceived evolution for
example you know and what I mean by
that is like how do you how do you
program interactions of systems right so
what I mean is by that is basically are is
this thing that this thing that is the oil
the engine for what we call evolution or
what we call whatever uh is it system
independent you know how do we how do we
program the interaction of systems that are
in different levels of the gradient of
what of intelligence or whatever
consciousness I should want to call it
the way I see things is that there are
choices that are conscious that people
may make and there are choices that are
subconscious now as to how the
subconscious choices happen that is a
whole other thing but but at the same
time people have been thinking about this
for thousands of years so so when I look
at the the ancient philosophers my my
favorite one is uh epicurus this e-p-i-c-u-r-u-s
and uh epicurus has a really interesting
saying and the saying is that say to
yourself what what you want to be and
then do what you have to do and it's
really interesting because epicurus himself
was born a slave and then he moved to
rome and then was able to open his own
school and then stuff went down in rome so
he had to leave and was crippled at one
point and then moved back to greece and
then uh his teachings live on to this day
so as someone that was born a slave and
told himself he had to do what he had to
do uh i find it very interesting because
i think he figures something out that if
you if you talk to your subconscious then
you can get to do stuff as well even though
you can't really predict what it's um what
it's going to do yeah so i'll just leave it
at i'll just leave it at that actually i want to
follow up with that and what future memes said
about um about um uh sorry i lost it
what was it tell me
ben oh yeah not not trying to artificially
manipulate the matrix as if there's some
way to do it from outside i don't think we
can get outside the matrix and manipulate it
i think the way we manipulate it is through
practices and disciplines of change and so
future meme yes we can change ourselves we
can evolve and maybe i think that's what
you're saying and we do that through the
the tried and true principles that we we
know of as humanity whether it's our
spiritual traditions or religious or uh our
own our own practice of you know joint
enjoyment or whatever it is but i think
that's what those traditions are really
pointing to is how do we use the matrix of
to up level and change our lives and it's
fully consistent with the mechanisms of
change it's not like and it's i mean the
metaverse is just a way to accelerate that
process by exploring different ways of
being so you can actually choose a new way
of being but still it's a process of it's
kind of like the difference between you know
you you can spend time doing artificial
stimulants and drugs and learning about you
artificial states of mind through psychoactive
substances and then for me moving towards
meditation and mindfulness as a way of
deepening those those experiences was very
powerful and i stopped doing some of those
psychoactive substances and started
meditating and doing other practices from
yoga and that deepened the sort of insights
that i started with with those shortcuts so i think
what part of what we're saying is in the
amplification or transition transformation of
our selves in this in the matrix uh we can
do practices and we can take shortcuts we can
try to shortcut it but i don't think that
really works ultimately we got to go through
the process of transformation that's built
into the matrix itself and that's that's
what we call life that's my perspective
yeah go ahead jake i want to hear from the new
people so yeah go ahead jake awesome and
doctor wanted to speak to so i so i uh wait i
can wait i have a uh oh thanks uh thanks
doctor i appreciate it i'm not gonna stay
long i just wanted to put into real quick
uh i have a unique perspective on this
topic i used to think a lot about whether or
not there was some sort of a matrix or
simulation occurring and the truth of the
matter is the only thing that's malleable and
changeable is your thought and in the real
world and in real existence uh we all came from
a cell and we all now have a body to
manipulate our environment in a real
physical way that will allow more cells to
grow and continue to grow that's pretty much
the only reason why we're here uh i i i died
already once i had a brain aneurysm version
and i know that the realness of life is
lost in semantics and i know that a lot
of the things that have ever been conjured up
uh we're sort of
there and and some of us can see it really
clearly and others can't and and uh you know
science is a good way to define these things
uh but in reality it's all going to end up in
the ability for us to think and look around us
and see where we're at and what we're doing
uh it's not about you know how random we can think or what possible ideas we can come up with
that's all that's all a waste of time
the the most important thing in life is to live today as though you're going to die tomorrow
so make sure that everything that you learn and everything that you do take uh precedence uh in your in your actions going forward make sure that you learn to do things that are going to be positive and reinforcing and growing and and and and and nurturing life and and existence and the spread of intelligence as far as we can possibly do it there's a reason why we we all are on this earth and we're so fertile and we make more babies and we're going to be able to do it
uh it's because we're not supposed to just get stuck on this earth we're supposed to move to as many different platforms as we could possibly do that's what we're supposed to do uh and just sitting here under the blue sky when dreaming about the stars that's not going to get that done
uh so uh best thing to do is live like you're going to die tomorrow and don't spend any time thinking about whether or not you know your your junk was the right size or you know whether your girl likes you or any of that that's all a waste a waste of thought and and your brains are magnificent the most magnificent creations in existence
and utilize that don't let yourself get lost in loop thought where you just start thinking of stuff that don't make no difference
and it's not going to have any tangible reality change or check and most of the time you know we're electrical organs
so the more you let yourself think about things that are not going to make any difference in your life
you're going to keep thinking about those things it's going to become easier to think about things that are completely a waste of time
uh stay rooted in reality stay focused on on the fact that you only have 14 000 more days to live
and that's if you live to your 80s so you know put it into perspective because that guy that uh was the
founder of apple uh he would say the same thing once you've been there and you realize that you've worked
all your life and you just croaked and you've never had a chance to do anything that you really
really wanted to do if you get another chance after that you're going to make sure that you live every
day to the fullest of its ability to do every single thing instead of just talking or thinking about it
you're going to live towards it you're going to take action take action don't just stop because that's
the whole reason why we all have trillions of cells cells gathered around us because we were the one
cell that made a deal and said we can take action when we get there we're going to be able to make
a change in our environment that's it so i thought i'd throw that out there uh i only have a few minutes
and then i got to take off i got 13 year old bed or 13 year old kid to put the bed
so we we already do some things that are simulated in in a world and we enter in and out these worlds
in in about two hours three hour max right we do that with the fair when we go to the state fair or
the world fair we do that when we go to a circus we do that when we go to six flags we do that when we
go to disney we do that when we go to water world or or dinner playhouse we do these simulations
in a physical form all the time sometimes if uh uh for those people who watch porn you do that
for those who do gonna know you're gonna do something romantic on valentine day you do that
we do all these things the the issue of it all is is where do you allow the boundaries
to not be pushed if for your happiness for your sanity for your world to be better financially
wherever the case may be where do you allow it because some of us take the rules and we take it
and we say okay these rules apply to you they don't apply to me so i'm going to push the boundaries of
these rules and if you push the boundaries of these rules further than anybody else then you're
considered a pioneer if you push the boundaries just a little bit then you're a criminal so where
do you stop and where do you know the difference in that and then if you get enough people on board
with you even if you push the boundaries to the point of where a criminal will push the boundary
and you get enough people to do that now somebody will come in and they won't want to make a law or
make a bill about it energy or a different word instead of energy so so so yes because well technically
you can say that energy is emergent right uh uh it it could be anything and um so well hypothetically
let's say uh a different civilization existed and they came up with their own representation of nature
and uh it wasn't einstein's equations of energy and its relationship to speed of light etc etc
and it was some other notation some other you know representation that gave them a good model to
you know to model emergence model uh interaction model evolution etc etc and and and and they were able
to use that uh to represent nature in in from their perspective so my question is then how do we
account for that uh in relation to how we represent the universe from our perspective given that given
that it's almost like uh we have to go beyond the idea of of energy if that makes any sense
yeah yeah that's actually i could comment on that quickly there's actually a structure known as an
adinkra which is an error correcting code so if you want to google that i would recommend you uh look up
the term a d i n k r a s and then those systems or or models mathematical models actually generate
the physical laws uh by their very application so it's a very interesting it has a very beautiful
graphical uh representation as well so that's like the next thing that you'd want to look at and that
is quite the leap in terms of uh what we think the universe is that the physical laws themselves
emerge from error correcting codes is pardon the phrasing but it's fucking amazing and it's probably
the most wonderful thing that i've ever seen where we can take human the human mind human intuition and
go beyond the physical realm and explore something that we thought was unphysical but it actually
generates physical reality it's probably the most magical thing that i've ever come across i've never
come across anything more fundamental than that which generates the laws themselves
yeah that's very interesting io that's uh error correcting i know that that's a big thing in
quantum computing and people are looking at that in terms of cosmology as well from the simulation
uh hypothesis and i wanted to respond to to um is it win or alexander
great thank you and um you know what comes to mind when we think about what's what's deeper than
energy or what else could there be to describe things than energy um you know information is
essentially the organization of energy and in my trying to research synchronicity as a phenomenon
you know synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence two two events that happen simultaneously or
a coincidence of two objects that is meaningful in some way and the meaning from it obviously has some
kind of subjective perspective or aspect to it so the meaning comes from a juxtaposition of two things
and you know and from a physics perspective uh you know like here's an example from a physics perspective
there's really very little difference between
when if it's election day in the united states which happens on tuesdays there's very little difference from a
physics perspective between tuesday and wednesday but from a human experience perspective
from a meaningfulness perspective there's an enormous difference because you can't cast your ballot
on wednesday it's too late but tuesday you can still cast your ballot so you can affect the direction
of an election um on tuesday but not on wednesday and that can have tremendous difference of outcome
down the line so there's a meaningfulness to that to that separation of 24 hours and so i think when you
talk about um another civilization could have you know sort of bypassed an understanding of energy which
is sort of a reductionist way of looking at things energy can be reduced to
its pieces and that's why we say it can be conserved you know you can add up this potential
energy to this kinetic energy and you get a total energy but when you talk about meaningfulness
you can't add it in the same way it's qualitative and i think you could have a whole civilization that
had a physics of meaningfulness i think that synchronicity is a cause and effect of meaning
it's not that you know i have a friend that had a ring on her finger this is a synchronicity
story she had a ring on her finger with which had a blue stone in it and she was trying to figure out
what the stone was so she wrote to her jeweler this is after like many months of trying to figure it
out she finally writes to her jeweler with a photograph she never hears back from her jeweler
the same day she goes to the salon to get her nails done and after the after the appointment that
person asks her for her stamp card to get a credit for the appointment she reaches in her purse and
pulls out her stamp card that's actually the jeweler's business card and on the back it has the
words blue topaz uh the name of her stone she realizes that she got the answer to her question
but it wasn't direct cause and effect right the jeweler didn't write her back and tell her to look
in her purse for the card she found it from an accident from a different scenario so i would say
there's no causality there but there's a sort of correlation that we maybe associate with the
correlation of quantum mechanics of quantum systems correlation is a very um tenuous kind of thing
it's not causality but from a meaningfulness point of view i would say there is a cause and effect
a totally different type of non-physical cause and effect of meaning where the intention that she
had to find this information and the action that she took to pursue the information made it so that
a synchronicity was more likely to happen where the information showed up in her hands in the form
of the business card and so this model that i use as a tree where you're moving along the tree
you're not actually causing the situations to happen as you go but the the future branches which
have apples on them the fruit of the of the outcomes sort of weighs down and increases the
likelihood of a situation to happen so there's a way in which you can have a causality of meaning
even if it's not direct cause and effect and this is all um you know not not verified
experimentally i'm being uh speculative here but that's what comes to mind when we talk about going
a level beyond quantitative energy conservation and looking more at the qualitative nature of things
i saw a um i thought of another um perspective which is that if we can if we can't use the word
energy we could use the word force like like the force in star wars right it's this it's this um
it forces everywhere and it binds everything and so the idea is information is the quantity
is a quantization of patterns and energy or force and and so some other civilization could make the
argument that information is just a perspective on the force um anyway scott let me ride on that
next statement you just made about the uh uh the topaz i like that example it's a brilliant example by
the way let me uh when it comes to einstein he he kind of pushed the boundaries with
quantum mechanics to what we have today what the limited understanding of what we have today
even though he learned from some his some of his mentors and some of their theories
were not correct but what i could ride on your on your example sky one of the things i think
einstein did that really pushed the boundaries more so than his relatively relatively relativity theory
was the way he looked and the way he behaved it made you because most at that time most scientists
were double-breasted suits uh they had you know uh clean cut hair they was not any way looking like
they just woke up einstein always looked like he just woke up so his hair was all over the place
this also pushed the boundaries of uh dyson today um what's the guy that wrote um oh god um um
the harvard guy can't remember his name um it'll come to me um from don king to whatever it started
pushing the the boundaries and the science world it was already it was already there in that cultural
world from uh uh blacks and some other people uh hair was used as this style but it became
this phenomenon thing that in a genius world you don't have to behave and look like everybody else
it is not required for you i'm gonna be honest with y'all about something //////////
that every little aspect of everything plays its position and plays its role
einstein his uh his uh formula yes it made a huge impact in some world when it comes to energy
uh with some other stuff with quantum or solar energy all these different things it played a huge
role but it also gave us a different perspective that you don't have to behave by the boundaries
because he didn't do that he did not do that he did not behave within the boundaries of of
everything that was set out i'm not saying that we don't have to follow rules please don't don't
miss uh consumer i'm saying that but i'm saying you have in order to get what you want out of life
you have to put push the boundaries even within the boundaries you have to be able to push it
and if you don't do that you're not going to get out of it what you what you deserve or what you want
and in mercedes also in some people cases you have you the way you design the way you build the way
you think the way you've been developed the way your your childhood develop you some of us you need
other people to help you get there so you can't get there by yourself you have to surround yourself
with a certain group of people to get into this simulation of what whatever you want out of life
it's just a part of who you are and what you have to do to get there some of the biggest names
