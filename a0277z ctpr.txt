Multi-modal representations, the building blocks of everything we perceive, consisting of patterns encoded in phase differences combined with tempo-spatial patterns accomplished by spreading out the phase differences in complicated temporal-spatial play back neural column firing patterns played all over the brain, with parts of the brain intelligently waiting listening learning sequences in order to predict and in order to fire in the right sequence in the right place and the right time in order to participate in a global pattern playback system, with the whole neo cortex taking turns participating in playing back learned sequences and listening and learning new sequences.

a neuron fires in a millisecond, so to experience a place indoors or outdoors for a sustained period of time is going to require a lot of similar neural firing to fire over and over again cyclically, the place you are in has to be rendered and rerendered by different parts of the brain over and over again in order to give you the continuing impression that you are in an actual place over a period of time. If the place was rendered once and then turned off and then rendered once and then turned off then reality would be like a strobe light, if it was rendered for 1 second and then turned off then you would see the place you are in for that 1 second, with the neural correlates happening for that one second, and then you would be in darkness after that, without visual awareness of the place you are in.

So what I am arguing is that conciousness is like a persistent rendering, or a lot of collated renderings playing out over time, you can say well a movie or a 3D volumetric video is a rendering over time but what is watching or listening to the video? The brain is both rendering a video and watching the video, and its watching because predictive coding is the process of neurons listening to the activity of other neurons, predictive coding is the brain listening to itself, and there are a lot of repeating patterns, a lot of echoes, a lot of the same, so much that patterns are hallucinated like a virtual reality software program, so imagine if a virtual reality software program, like beat saber, rec room, or tilt brush was instead just rendering a version of reality, but then also learning the 3D photogrammety of reality, and then also

is a dipole a soliton wave

is a dipole a magnetic wave

is EEG measuring a magnetic wave?

Dipoles: Your brain is a fractal of dipoles, both electric and magnetic
with eeg we measure the activity of the largest electric dipoles, and with meg we measure the activity of the largest magnetic dipoles, and the resulting activity of each type of activity is very different.
