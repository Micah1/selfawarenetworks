its like the universe is a place field of relative frequences that warp space itself when they colide or form vortices

the vortices form atoms and bounce off each other and form oscillations,

everything is made of these atoms
but its like an oscillation of space time creating a frequency

its frequency is an attractor to other particles, so they start clumbing together over time, eventual stars planets and even what we call life which is actually just a continuation of the fractal of the cosmos on increasingly complex scales because they follow the laws of entropy by exporting increating chaos over all to a surrounding environment and getting enough energy to maintain its oscillation equilibrium

So I imagine that space started everywhere at the same time, and essentially our existence has folded on it self through natural selection as an atomic process combined with ajacent
