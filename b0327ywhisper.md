Title: The flow of information in the brain

Original Recording https://recorder.google.com/b612bace-0639-419d-990a-0f16fd0552f5 

It like literally is like some on-off signal that just like moves away like it's the you know like the

robotic leg anyways it was just a completely complete disaster but so so yeah so obviously I

don't think EEG is the way to go I mean with EEG I think the best you're gonna get is like a click

and and that's I mean I think that's you can make something now with it like if you have an eye

tracker and eye trackers are amazing you can have an eye tracker be like the cursor on your

goop on your lens that's like on your glasses for instance and then just have EEG on like just a

two probe EEG just clicking on or off and maybe even control the contrast to see how like

transparent your screen is gonna be or something but like I think the real way to go is I think

intercranial PCIs are going to like be like a thing that people are all like all on and I think

integrating that with the AR VR world is just gonna be like it's gonna get rid of our iPhones

and it's just gonna be the new thing but that's just my perspective and I had this perspective

before I went back to school and I and so I've been studying neuroscience with the strong intent

of like finding out how the thalamus communicates to the cortex because the best way to sort of

evoke some sort of artificial perception would be the real way that perception happens so I

wanted to learn like how what's the real way the thalamus sort of sends the perceptive signals to

the cortex so I could emulate that since like electronically or with biosynthetics which I've

been like keeping my feet in the in the world pretty strongly in the same time because I don't

think at the end of the day years from now it's not gonna be metal electrodes that are handling

this sort of resolution that we need it's gonna be like bioelectronics anyways do you have any

thoughts on that stuff absolutely I've tons of thoughts and also questions for you so so one

of the thoughts is okay so you so you know that gosh I'm still just starting for a full memory

recall I should have written this down while I was thinking about it but so one of the thoughts

hang on let's see sorry my memory god damn today is today is one of those days when my memory is

just just not super great okay so we're talking about let's try to trigger my memory a little bit

we were talking about brain-computer interfaces and EEG and the limitations you're asking about

the limitations of EEG that's one of the things what is it what is the ultimate

league that is good that you would let me break it into two pieces yeah so the future of BCI let's

say is one piece and that's like the word you have all the ideals we figured out how the

phalamus is communicating in the cortex we're able to emulate it we're able to use bioelectrodes

to just get full result there are tons of resolution and get your four degrees of freedom

or whatever and then on the flip side for right now because if you're gonna start a business you

gotta you gotta have some have it do something and so what can you make work now and on that side

you can do stuff with eye trackers and EEG with like an on-off signal you could say it's a click

hold down on the mouse not hold down on the mouse kind of signal and then the mouse movement you

could just use an eye tracker and track the pupils but like you know so those were like two

areas you have the simplistic like what can we do right now and then I was also on track with

it like where is it gonna be in 12 years okay so so here so I remembered now the interesting

points that I wanted to make and I and thankfully while you were talking I wrote them down

all right so okay so there was this interesting study that just came out where in video they

developed a radically different way to compress video for video chats and this just this is

November 19th 2020 and the story is that they need about they need a couple seconds of real

video and then they're going to use the neural network to render an artificial video that

can that's so it's so good that it can predict all your facial expressions after that first

few seconds and based upon you know just your voice coming through and and also your head

rotating it can it can you know sort of generate your head rotation and it can be used you can

substitute your face for someone else's face and keep talking and you know just like you've seen

in the sort of online the deep fake stuff it does all that in one simple algorithm and and but

importantly that they basically have in effect created a video compression that works with in

10 in 10 at 10x improvement so it's like that means that it's that you need 10 times less

bandwidth to do a video call and and so that means that older phone technology that wasn't

capable of video calls before because it had the bandwidth of the network was too slow is now

capable of a video calling and that's profound that's profound just by itself but then you know

so what I know about EEG is that just just from talking to a very particular neuroscientist who's

you know for a long time who you know he's been a neuroimager for like 30 years and he is you

know like he's looking at a world where the universities want to fund MRI research because

you know MRI machines print money and they don't want to fund EEG and so you have to argue really

hard to do EEG stuff in the research world and and you know or to get funding for a major

EEG project but he but he's you know seeing and has pointed out to me that there's a whole

bunch of stuff that's never been done before with EEG that if there you know for one example was

that you know the the the Chodmite Institute data is this massive collection of data that combines

basically you know eye tracking with EEG with voice tracking with behavior tracking but it does

so in a in a way that they've created a sort of standardized data collection and anyone who can

get access to that data who who can potentially extend that data by making sure that they adhere

to the same data collection standards and so if you had a massive global project where you asked

every EEG research laboratory in the world to start following this exact same data collection

standard for EEG then you'd have something that doesn't exist today where today you can't combine

all the EEG research that's ever been done into a single study because the method that the methods

of of and of doing the EEG capture varied wildly but also in some cases they're poorly documented

and absolutely yeah I've been in a EEG lab before or actually I've been in a lab a computational

neuroscience lab that relied on trying to get EEG data from other labs and it was just a disaster

so my thinking is that you know we were just talking we're just talking about there is these

some there's old like you know there's been these sort of I'm starting to think of them as like

added bad attitudes where you you'll have for decades or more the entire neuroscience community

or psychiatrist neuropsychiatry community or psychology community well we'll have these like

ideas that they're all attached to that turn out to be you know wrong and and but then but then

like the precursors for what was right was sort of like was sort of partially there the whole time

and so then they'll be like these massive shifts anyway what I'm what I'm what in terms of like

what is the the ideas that are dominant you know like with AI I guess it could be an example of how

I don't know if we need an example I mean you know this stuff there's there's been AI winters

where there was a ton of hype and enthusiasm for certain you know for certain kind of AI for

eat for neural networks and then all of it died and then there was a ton of hype and enthusiasm

for symbolic neural net for symbolic AI and then that died and then you know hot and then now we're

still in the deep learning era but there's been like three or four AI winters I'm not sure depending

on but but and then there's okay let me just pause for a second because I remember somebody

in my program the person in my program is like that more of the expert on AI he does like artificial vision he

he's like you know like this I mean neuro or like bio-neuro so he's like the only one he's like on

the AI side and he was telling me all the differences between symbolic and people were all

about that but now deep learning just kind of just massively kills everything else and how good it is

but it's not as it's getting further and further from biological like the most biological would

have been recursive neural networks but like for language processing at least transformal neural

networks and I watched the three brown blood one blue on that so I roughly understand it like you

know what I mean like it you don't need recursive neural networks and highly analogous to the

biological system for it to be good at what it does it was last time so you don't need you don't

need the AI to be close to the actual brain for it to be good at what it does like the closest

would have been like recursive neural networks but those aren't as great as some of the other stuff

around oh gosh yeah yeah I mean I mean all this stuff is in my view is pretty far from the brain

I mean I guess you know like I like I wrote so I wrote this article on my website about a new

study that came out about multi vesicular release being a lot more common throughout the neocortex

with it turns out there's like they people thought this is something that was like multi

vesicular release something that was constrained doing MVPs with multi with multiple vesicles in

them so again are you talking about MVPs multi vesicular bodies I yes so yeah we're talking

in the in the in the axon terminal right well the axon terminal has has vesicles and they get

released and you know with us with a spike with an action potential they release you know one or

two or five or whatever at a time but there's also these things called multi vesicular bodies

which is kind of a new thing that people know about huh okay I didn't know I didn't know this one

go ahead and tell me more oh so multi vesicular bodies hold multiple vesicles and they'll also

take some of the other internal like from the inside the cell the from the cytoplasm and they'll

you know because there's mRNA floating around there's a bunch of stuff floating around so it'll

encapsulate multiple vesicles which have the neurotransmitters in them but it'll also encapsulate

some other stuff and then those get released and they're thought to like transfer stuff from one

cell to stuff to another cell so like a cell that never had any of like should never have RNA from

like you know like because this other cell type makes the RNA for it but not the cell but it can

somehow transfer across cells that's the multi vesicular bodies stuff that's it came out a few

years ago that's cool that looks like that there's um okay yeah that's cool so so no so I was talking

about how so going back to AI so what I was pointing out was that the the core at the core of you

know basically whether you're doing like computational neuroscience or spike modeling or you're

talking about you know you know deep learning which is which is um you know you have you have the the

basic let me see if I can find my article I'm gonna go to my website real quick so SVGN I'm

actually gonna go to vrma.io that's my other page with my featured articles on it and it's the

article that says it's called synaptic unreliability what is it called what's the recipe so if you

go to vrma.io and look at look at the the article that's called so under the featured article

section like the third article down says synaptic unreliability hold on I'm just gonna leave my

mic on while I do this yeah go ahead okay third at WebAR digital fashion synaptic unreliability so um so

this this basically like what the widespread idea was that in in machine learning for a long time I'm

sorry in neural networks was was an idea that um that a neuron would be summed up by by a spike

like an on or off signal and then and then later on they had and that was called um this this um

this idea was fundamental um wait this isn't it so now we're talking about an AI or a note right

yeah we're talking about specifically it's called yeah well we're talking about both

neuroscience and machine this article is about both neuroscience and machine learning um it's in

the beginning it talks about um machine learning but the rest of the article is neuroscience okay so

it's only machine learning in the beginning but but so there's um there's a concept in called the

um why does my in the basically that the model of a neuron I think is called like a positron or

something I'm trying to remember what the what it's called not positron it's like a basic

the computation unit in an artificial neural network it is a let me type in the word positron

I think it's just neuron but that just gets confusing when we're gonna switch back and forth

so um well I think the artificial I think it is yes no people can put no positron or something

else there's um okay so let's just call it the artificial neuron then for the sake of brevity

so in any case the artificial neuron was like saying that the action potential was summed up

and and that created this sort of like you know the probability of they're trying to like you

know basically like simplify they're saying okay we need to put this into machine and we just

need to simplify it because there's too much complexity here so we're gonna that the word

we're gonna like you know cut off the the complexities just we're just gonna say okay

everything they get summed up and so you imagine that no matter what the the dendrite is is thought

to have learned if you have to reduce it to a single you know on or off then then potentially

you're losing a lot of information and later on they made an adaption to where you know it's

um like it it can there's like um if it crosses it if it's it's on but it's above a certain threshold

then you can you can have like a vector that represents the the magnitude above that threshold

so they expanded the the depth of of what a single neuron could do what a single artificial

neuron could could transmit so its output isn't is no longer uh one or zero it's like it can be

like uh something over time it's um well so it's it's it's it's it's it's only like there's a one

or zero in terms of whether it's activated but then beyond that artificial neuron has a is represented

by a vector which is just um greater or or less than the um it's either closer to to zero or closer

to one uh in in terms of um so so it sort of gives some sort of magnitude to the um to the neural

network but so the single artificial neuron uh output is what i was asking yeah so that so that

the um well the output has to has to stem from from that uh you know whether it's it's but

basically it's between zero and one it's it's so it's either it's it's not just zero or one it's

like this vector between zero and one and uh so um so it's a little bit more complex but a multi

a multi vascular release so the rest of it so beyond that is um the idea is that a multi vascular

release um could uh would make neuron make neurons a lot more uh computationally um a lot

more capable of passing along information than than the um then idea of neurons that are sort of

summing everything up in in the in the action potential in a simplified way because because

you have i mean the idea is that so i mean the article sort of covers how it works but and i'm

not sure 100 if um if this article is correct because i sort of um it's i'm sort of putting

together a lot of different pieces of information but basically um i put together that uh based on

others others research that it looks like the the changes in the um there's there's research to say

the changes in the uh for example in in k or potassium are going to change the um they're

going to affect the amount of uh um the pre-snaptic k potassium modifies the action potential amplitude

uh or ap sin which determines the strength of the synaptic signal including the amplitude of the

post-synaptic response and then that leads to how many uh vesicles can be released per action

potential which is between usually between zero and three i guess i could go to five as you said

but but the average uh number i was just making numbers up but yeah that's like so so here's

what i think you're talking about so um so an action potential is so uh cell is that right

so i get minus 65 millivolts uh you get it up to a threshold which let's say it's for the

our example cell we'll say minus 40 which is roughly what they usually are uh then you get

to but then the spike happens where it just shoots way up and this is happening because

there's channels that are just letting sodium in and sodium being positive it's it's gonna

depolarize the cell shoot the action am i speaking like shit that you already know

pretty well no keep going i'm okay okay so like it's letting a bunch of sodium in

and all this positive charge is coming in and it's staying near the membrane which is like

basically shooting the voltage up then you have the voltage sensitive channels so that's like the

positive feedback loop it gets positive so it opens to let these are so more sodium channels

their voltage sensitive sodium channels so like as it gets through negative 40 it's like oh okay

now we can open and so it's like positive feedback loop now there's tons of sodium coming in

and it's just shooting up up up so it's going closer to zero and then 10 20 it goes up to like

positive 40 millivolts but what's happens there is you have this these potassium channels these

k channels that open and start doing the opposite and the reason why you're thinking wait this is

positive wait wouldn't that be more positive current yes except there's a a gradient and so

while there's more sodium outside the neuron than there is inside the neuron there's way more

potassium inside the neuron than outside the neuron so if you're going to open a potassium

channel the positive charge is going to go the other way and and basically end up with a net

negative charge it would be like a negative charge is entering the cell yeah although it's

positive leaving anyways so so that potassium that k current is hyperpolarizing the cell back to where

it was and it even over overshoots it a little bit and that's called the after hyperpolarization

but but the the timing that these things come on are so synchronized and so uh there there's

there there's so fast it results in a spike that lasts less than a millisecond so these

potassium currents start shooting up and before they're even done shooting up the i'm sorry i said

that backwards the sodium currents start shooting the voltage of the cell up and then before it's

even done shooting up the potassium currents have turned on and start shooting it back down

to the point where you just get this in super quick spike and then it goes back down now the result

of the spike the spike transmits down the axon which at the very tip is where the vesicles are

and at the very tip of the axon you have these calcium channels and calcium is something that

needs to come in so calcium is one of the things where there's like a gazillion times more outside

the cell than inside the cell so if a calcium channel opens the the force that's shoving the

calcium in the cell is just soup is like the strongest you're going to get but but uh these

calcium channels on the very tip of the axon they're voltage gated and they're not not going to open

unless unless it's super positive voltage so basically they only open during a spike so that's

split second that one millisecond of a spike that finally reaches the tip of the axon gets this

calcium to come in and when that calcium comes in it binds to something called synaptopagmin

synaptopagmin shut basically shoves the vesicle into the membrane and allows the neurotransmitter

to spit out into the synapse and that's that's the formation of neural communication so that

split one millisecond split positive uh mill voltage that reaches the uh that reaches the end

of the axon allows that calcium to come in now if you fuck with the potassium and you don't

let it come on as fast as it would normally what you end up doing is you end up spreading that

action potential instead of being just a split one millisecond event you by fucking with the

potassium you just made that action potential a two millisecond or three millisecond event i don't

know i'm exaggerating but something super long right compared to what it should be so i guess it

can last as a maximum of like 10 milliseconds right no i think it's way less i think i think the

difference of like half a millisecond to like point seven of a millisecond is like a huge

difference in the terms of what we're talking about but uh but yeah let's just say for sake of

example it's like going from one millisecond to two milliseconds or five milliseconds something

what you're talking about with the 10 milliseconds is the whole process after it went back down and

after hyper polarized and stuff that's not i'm just talking about the the amount of time that it

stays very positive which is the when the calcium will be let in so if you double that or even make

it 1.5 what the normal amount that calcium will come in so much more calcium will come in that's

so much more calcium will bind to the synaptic tagmin which will allow so many more vesicles to

be released so i think that's what you're talking about with the uh by messing with the k the k

currents the k channels the potassium channels you're you're changing the shape of the spike

which you didn't mention but that's basically the result of that and by making the shape of the

spike more spread out it allows enough time for it's not just one vesicle to get released but

like a bunch of them get released uh over that much time because more calcium can come in in

more time because there's the calcium channels open for longer yeah for longer and that's what

causes more of the um of the uh um what is it the um the vesicles more more vesicles released

yeah so the there's there's sort of like so before the action potential let's zoom in to just the

very tip of the axon terminal yeah before the action potential it's just sitting there in

what's called a docked state and so you have this vesicle inside the membrane and it's like

right up against the membrane but you know like think of two oil droplets you know like if the

two oil droplets sort of touch they're gonna they're gonna like come together and make one bigger

droplet right so they're sitting there and you have the membrane this and then this one oil

droplet kind of right next to it but you know it's like not touching and it needs a little bit of

force to get them to touch and sort of like bind and then let the because the droplet holds the

neurotransmitter right so so that the thing that allows it to sort of get enough force to push

into the membrane is the synaptotagmin molecule and that's synaptotagmin I mean it's the synaptotagmin

like linker don't think of it as think of it like a linker um there's other ones there's other names

involved there that I'm just skipping but I'm trying to make this like somewhat comprehensible

and that synaptotagmin needs doesn't do its job until calcium reaches it and the calcium has to

come from outside the cell okay there's very little calcium inside the cell so that calcium

channel has to open so that calcium comes from outside the cell goes inside the cell and reaches

that synaptotagmin but but that use that duration is usually like a split you know like a millisecond

or less which only allows enough to come in to sort of just release like one vesicle or two you

know what I mean it just yeah it's just enough to release one from the docking site but if you

left that channel open long enough it would just keep it would keep doing it and it would release

a bunch from the same site okay so the um so so what so there was um so peter c he suggested that um

the the amount of the ndma receptors um I forget exactly was many years ago I read his book ndma

receptors um could uh be regulated by the neuron or by um by neurons regulating on the other neurons

so to change um basically to change the um okay so so part of this was this idea that the output of

the neuron would have would have a would be able to change its volume like it could it um it would

become you know neurons can be louder or quieter that's what that's one analogy um is so can I

clear acid acrylic filtration so yeah if you're releasing multiple vesicles so if so every vesicle

I think let's just I forget if it's 2000 or 3000 but let's say 2000 every vesicle has like 2000

roughly uh neurotransmitters so those things float into the synapse and then they bind to things uh

you know predominantly the the receptor on the other on the other cell right but if you release

five times that amount so instead of 2000 you're getting 10 000 the lateral spread is going to

increase to the point where receptors very far lateral which it would have never diffused that

far before but because now there's 10 000 of them instead of 2000 now they're diffusing

further and further laterally uh you're activating receptors that probably weren't

getting activated in the normal case is that what you're talking about or yeah yeah maybe

so that's not that's part of what I'm talking about so it's not just it's not so and now

that the neuron is not just passing along frequency information and frequency information

of slightly larger scales is determined by a vector it's also passing along spatial information

because it can reach more neurons right yeah are we going to be relating this back to machine

learnings would would it be like because I feel like in machine learning all the neurons are

connected every neuron has a connection to every neuron in the other layer uh already so you don't

need this well in the current in the current architecture but yeah that's um but but but

I mean if you were if you were to add a spatial dimension to uh to neural networks and you we

would yeah you'd have to give them like a sort of they'd have to the neural net the the neuron

would have a sort of like local a local community and then it would only reach out to other other

other neurons in the upstream and in the so it would so a neuron would only talk to some

neurons in in the in the layer above it but then if if it uh if it could alternate to talking to

all of them to or to just to a few of them you could alternate in between okay yeah yeah that

so okay that's where this concept ties in okay yeah so if if you made a neural network that

that like each neuron only talked to the 10 closest neurons from the next layer then you could sort of

make this event where you have this wide action potential and multi-vesticular release to where

instead of just talking to the 10 closest to it it actually spreads out to the like 30 closest or

the 20 you know what I mean yeah so so then um so then it spreads out and then um you know so

the the um a lot of people have focused on the the ampa receptors but but um but peter um

you know tsc he was saying that the the his focus is on the ndma receptors because they can respond

with um they can respond faster they can react faster like within and the and the way they can

respond you know within like they could vary from like you know somewhere between like one and

in four milliseconds or something like that so they can they can receive a a neurotransmitter

and then send a signal or something do you know more about that so both ampa and nmda receptors

can be fast both of them are very fast uh both of them on the scale of the few milliseconds um

ampa most ampa uh is just so mostly sodium potato it's so calcium is a kind of a weird

molecule in that it's not just making its influence through its charge calcium has this sort of

second influence because it it can act as a messenger so if because the cell is so good at

keeping calcium out outside of it away from it that whenever any calcium gets in it it's it binds

to things that causes secondary messaging signals and they like changes like uh phosphorylation

and d and what dna gets coded so calcium is like the sort of unique thing and so anyways this the

nmda channels let calcium in whereas the ampa channels everything i'm saying is like a most of

the time thing by the way because there's always this like weird thing anyways that if in general

the ampa channels don't let calcium in and the nmda channels do let calcium in

uh but they they're very similar otherwise so yeah so i mean so so one of the questions i

but because i did this um podcast called the neural ace podcast was it was how does a neural

circuit repeat itself so i mean if you could imagine i mean so so so one of the early descriptions

that i heard of neural circuits and and i guess there's a lot of different kinds of neural circuits

are different scales of neural circuits just neurons talking to other neurons um if you have

if you have but i was madding if you had a neural circuit that that consisted of um high of several

neurons that were not directly connected to each other but you could see somehow with medical imaging

that that one neuron over here was firing and then the next neuron over over here is firing

there's no direct connection but then the next neuron was firing and then you saw maybe maybe

six or each firing in a loop so my question was how are they able to keep how is that you know

frequency pattern able to um how could that continue to happen over time how could you have

basically if a neuron might be connected to 200 upstream neurons um and then you know or maybe

10 000 upstream neurons that i don't know what the you know what what the number is going to be

right i like to let's say stick with 200 for this one 200 200 uh or 200 000 um let's say 200 so you

have a neuron and it's connected to 200 other uh it makes synapses on the 200 other neurons yeah

and how does it continue how does how would it like so my question was how would it continue to

connect to um lead to us to a causality sequence so where that where signals from from the first

first neuron that's in the circuit would eventually reach the second neuron on the circuit that's not

directly connected and then those signals would somehow reach the the next neuron on the circuit

which is also not directly connected and so on because it's almost it almost implies that the

signals are traveling along the same path and and so so i so i asked people said is it possible that

you know that there's somehow the neuron in the post synaptic uh the post synaptic neuron

was somehow selecting the signal um and selecting you know you know deciding what it was going to

it was the one it was the one that was going to receive uh the certain signal type and the other

neurons were deciding that they were not and and and another idea was was was was a selection

related to some sort of like electromagnetic property where that that neuron was had the

lowest possible negative and therefore it it attracted the the the signals that it wanted

because i was thinking about you know there's positive and negative charges right and i i was

talking about this in the earliest podcast and then someone else was like well no uh you know

in a later conversation i said basically it's the same distribution every single time a neuron fires

and and all the neurons upstream get exactly the same signal every single time and um and then and

then i i thought well and then they said um yeah so it says no like there's no selection and but

but oh gosh what was the rest of it um yeah so maybe so maybe at that point it was like um

no okay so maybe so if if there's no like

what i'm saying is if um like like how does it how does the signal travel from

how would a signal travel along a consistent path from you know across you know regions of the brain

to to like a consistently repeating neural circuit and is is it yeah so i don't know if you if you

can answer that let me see what i let's see what i followed and then you can kind of tell me if i

followed it okay so from what i understand likes uh you have a an area with some neurons and let's

say uh you're looking at one of them and it fires and then in another area where you're looking at

some neurons you're seeing some activation of some neurons there at that that happened like

at the exact uh time difference that it would take for the signal to progress to that area and

then maybe a third area so and so you're seeing a pattern you're seeing like a neuron from or

these neurons from area one lead to these neurons from area two firing lead to these

neurons from area three firing and and so as far as how exact it is over like so let's say

in in for stuff i've seen so like you give a mouse the same stimulus you give him like a picture of

uh whatever who cares you give him the same stimulus you wiggle the whisker the exact same way whatever

um that's kind the exact same neurons kind of just doesn't happen but the um but but the same

areas do happen so you do see like like 50 neurons an area one fired and then 50 and

neurons an area two in this other second area fired and then 50 in this third area fired and so

that's what people usually report they're like so we're what we get is we get bam a bunch of them

fire here then a bunch of them here so what we're seeing is area a and then area b and area c are

a direct result of wiggling the whisker in this exact way but uh i i'm sure there's like exceptions

but in general you i think it's fair to think of most cases i mean you could definitely think in

most cases it's not like the same neurons firing every time definitely not so uh what what's interesting

though is okay so another thing maybe that's helpful and especially for a lot of competition

the computational people that i talked to even in my program uh is they always think like things

are very strongly connected probably because in machine learning that they are but in in the

brain i think they did some models and i think typically for one cell if you'd like counted

all 500 of their inputs i think it would take like 60 of the inputs or 30 of the inputs all

firing at the same time to be like enough to get that that's to be depolarizing enough to get that

cell to fire um and that has to be relatively within a very you know within a couple millisecond

window um so it's very rare almost never the you know maybe there's a couple strong also there's a

high degree very uh high degree of variability in the strength of connections so with let's say a

500 neurons you're gonna have a maybe just a couple super strong ones that maybe can almost

drive a spike on their own but probably not more than like you know one percent of those ones

but for the vast majority they're all going to be like on the average of one thirtieth or one

fiftieth or something of the size it needs to be do we build a spike in the in the next neuron so

so it's very rare that like one neuron spikes and then the next neuron spikes because that neuron

spiked um uh what's more a more helpful way to think about it is all these neurons are just

like even when you're not receiving any stimulus the brand's just sort of firing in its default

mode and there's just so much activity just already going and so the outside world almost

doesn't cause activity it just sort of shifts the activity that's already going on into something

else so and so the way I think it's helpful on a computational standpoint is think of all these

neurons are already sort of just hanging around near threshold so it doesn't take a ton to get

them past threshold um but they're sort of uh you know in vector calc where there's like saddle

points and attractor states and repeller states it's almost like the brain is normally like on

that saddle or on in the repeller state like not where it shouldn't be stable just waiting

to go to a stable place through any input and then you know and so the the the network is always on

the edge uh yeah yeah I know the I know this concept um so okay so the the next question is the um

is the uh so the dendrite uh so the idea here is that the the dendrite is um um you know in

Jeff Hawking's in Jeff Hawking's explanation in on intelligence the dendrite the hairs in

the dendrite could potentially um store temporal temporal temporal memories right so the memory

that is a that is a uh like a proposition currently like uh a good like uh what's it called like a

standing like like there's not like a ton of research on it but this is kind of what everybody

thinks is the spines of the dendrite which are these little like like bubbles on on the dendrites

sort of like hold like the memory of where the input came so that it knows so that way the neuron

knows what to strengthen for next time okay so then so then so that's how the neuron knows

what to strengthen so so that that leads to the next question is is in and so um so the dendrite

might um you know inform the neuron somehow of of what criteria to look for like like the idea is

it's gonna um you know change the information it collects is somehow gonna go back to the

NDMA receptors and and it's going to you know change the interval of what of what they'll accept

between uh from three milliseconds to only two milliseconds with only one millisecond and and

so it it can so in the idea is that it could change what the um what it's willing to listen to

whether it's going to listen to one neuron or 30 neurons before it does anything um well well

it's always list so the way that it's listening to all the neurons is um you you know so all those

neurons have connections and receptors uh okay so if you look across all the dendrites and you say

there's like 500 areas where axons from other neurons are like right across the synapse from it

all along those dendrites um if any of those 500 axons release neurotransmitter you know those

that that transmitter is going to bind to the receptors and that's going to open channels and

those channels are going to get depolarized so it's it can't really selectively ignore anything

because if it if there's charge coming in the dendrites that charge is going to go towards

the cell body and that charge is going to uh going to you know like add up in towards this

you know and and perhaps cause a spike it's uh the way things are it can be like ignored is this

kind of it they can happen but but it's uh like you can sort of like remove receptors but that

that type of control isn't coming from the the cell bot like the cell body isn't like there isn't

like some center control like saying what to pay attention to what not to so um i mean that that

is kind of the idea of peter tse's book the neural basis of of uh free will is that a neuron can change

uh the the uh sort of like the um what what it whether it what it's ndma receptors are receptive

to but you're saying that that that that's that's not uh an idea that you did you uh okay well not

from the so so the let's talk about the things that can change uh the receptivity of uh nmdh

receptors uh so they can be phosphorylated uh phosphorylation occurs from from uh you know

like there there can be signaling that happens through other receptors near it's other like gpcr

receptors can uh get activated that change the phosphorylation in a specific area but that that

signal is not um coming from the center of the cell you can also like express more kinases

and that would come from the cell but the the kinases are not going to be directed they're

going to be evenly distributed across the so if you up regulate your kinases that's going to just

go everywhere and so that's what the cell itself can control but if there's going to be some sort

of local signaling to an nmda receptors to say phosphorylate these to make them weaker or like

a ret you know have a rest in mind to get them removed from the membrane that type of signaling

i don't know of any way that the cell body that the the nucleus of the cell can really control

it in a space spatial spatial way uh that kind of controls going to come probably from signaling

happening from other cells so i mean the stuff could be right but i just don't think it would be

correct to think about it in terms of like the cell is deciding that it would be like the cells in

the network are contributing to that results where the nmda so um how would the cells in the network

can could modify the ndma receptors of another cell okay so say uh along those are in our example

500 contacts onto the all the dendrites of this one cell let's say like uh 10 of those contacts

are get are coming from a certain cell like an acetylcholine cell where instead of sending

glutamate like most cells do this particular cell is sending acetylcholine and let's say one of the

receptors in your cell in in your dendrite is a acetylcholine receptor that's a gpcr that is a

gi coupled receptor that's going to decrease the cyclic amp in that local region and because it's

going to have that decreased cyclic amp it's going to lower the activity of pka which is a kinase

which phosphorylates and that phosphorylating kinase is now no longer going to phosphorylate

this nmda channel and so then all the nmda channels in that rough region are now going to like get

turned down or turned up or so okay so we're talking about inhibitory inhibitory action

the inhibitory cells right no no no no we're uh this is signaling this isn't inhibitory like in

the GABA sense where you're getting a negative charge okay this is like a signaling molecule

that sort of sends a signal inside the dendrite and tells the receptors to you know uh sort of

it sort of either blocks them a little bit or gets them a little more activated or it even

signals to them to like hey remove from the membrane you don't even need to be there anymore

which would decrease the you know so the net result is you're right an inhibitory result

but i just don't want that to be confused with uh in an inhibitory uh you know response which is a

GABA response which directly just puts negative charge in it like it's a chloride channel basically

where chloride comes in and makes it more negative but that's that's not what i'm talking about in

this case okay but that happens too both of all of those things happen um and so another question

is the um how does the um uh so the dendrite i guess can store um with its spikes it might store

like um temporal information um and is that also is it also storing spatial information like you

know basically like able to set the cell up so that it responds to um not just 30 downstream neurons

but a specific set of downstream neurons like you know like neurons over over in in certain

regions i mean i'm just thinking about like how you know there are certain um you know

uh cells or cones uh in the eye that that might be the only responds to uh information moving

from left to right for example right so yeah yeah so how does that work yeah so i'm just i'm just

thinking like yeah so if you can so so yeah if you could respond to that and i'll remember the

rest of it while you're talking yeah so i'm trying to remember so there's amicron amicron cells that

do that that left to right thing and the way they work is like there's this inside to outside um

kind of thing going on basically it's like it has to do with temporal summation so

so uh you only get so okay first i think it's best to clarify that the action potential

you know only it starts at the cell body and it goes down the axon uh the in the simplest

way to think about it it it sort of doesn't the action potential doesn't go up the dendrites at

all it's just like you add up all so charges come in from the in these little skinny dendrites

and then they sort of travel down and it's you think of these dendrites as a leaky hose right

so if you shove a lot of water in it which is voltage uh you know if you shove enough in it

you know enough will get through the other side and not leak out the hose right you know if you

stabbed a fork with the you know stabbed a hose with the fork a bunch of time but uh so whatever

makes it so now you have all these hoses and they're all sort of plugged into the same thing at the

end and what you're trying to do is get enough water in at the end at the same time and if you

get enough then it like has a burst right like and that burst is the action potential so the

action potential is only happening on the opposite side of all the dendrite leaky hose dendrites um

um which you know in reality there's some that that you for the sake of thinking about it just

consider this to be like roughly true um so so the uh sorry i lost my train of thought well so if

the dend if the dendrite hairs are storing a temporal uh memory um then they would have to

somehow that memory has to um be triggered and sometimes when voltage is being received but

not every time when voltage is being received otherwise it wouldn't have any meaning yeah but

the what what the difference is every is the if you're only looking at 10 of the inputs and sometimes

there it's causing it and sometimes it's not the difference 10 usually is the other 390 inputs

that you're not looking at you know um so so let me finish it i remember where i was going you

you asked about left to right so so the way that that works is imagine so let's say there were

10 dendrites so 10 leaky hoses and you can shove in water at the very tips of all 10 of these leaky

hoses um and and if you get enough water to the center where they all meet at the same time it

would cause a spike now this is how you could get left to right sort of uh firing if the hoses

on on one side were gradually longer than the so imagine the rightmost hose is 50 feet long then

the then the second one is 45 feet long and the third one is 40 feet long and the fourth one is

35 and then 30 feet and so so all these dendrites are different sizes all these hoses are different

sizes if you start putting water in the longest hose first and then a split second later you put

it in the second longest and then a split second later you put in the third longest and so forth

then at the end of the day all of those water will reach the center point at the exact same time

which will be enough to get it over the threshold and to communicate hey fire now if you do it in

the opposite order and you put water in the shortest hose first and then gradually put water

towards the you know get go towards the longest hose what'll happen is water will reach it and

leak out reach the center point and then reach out leak out and then the next the water from the

other hose the longer hose will reach it next but it is basically they don't add up all at the same

time they don't reach it basically the voltage all has to kind of get there because all of the

stuff is super leaky so so it has to all get there at the same time to cause a spike so if the

organization of of the dendrites are such that you know you're going they're longer on one side

and temp tapering to shorter on the other side it's only going to work in the left to right

direction but not the right to left direction if you know if does that make sense it'd be easier

to draw a picture I guess no I know I got it a hundred percent but um but so so then I wanted

to ask you how how then dendritic spikes affect this this equation so dendritic spikes are actually

the thing I was telling you to ignore so so in the in the neuroscience 101 where you don't learn

about dendritic spikes it's just axons that spike the spike starts at the soma uh which is the center

point and then it propagates down the axon to the axon tip and then vessel release but in reality

if there's a spike that's going to start at the soma even though the vast majority of of the energy

is going down the axon there's it's so powerful there's still a little bit getting pushed the other

way too right like when you you know when when uh when two rockets are attached in space and one's

super heavy and one super light the light one's gonna shoot off super far but the heavy one's

still gonna like have a little bit you know what I mean so like the the spike is sort of going in

the opposite direction too and that causes what's called a back action potential BAP uh it's and

back propagating yeah back propagating action potential and uh that that is that is one component

of a dendritic spike there's this other component of it and then so because there's these voltage

gated calcium channels which are very similar to the ones on the tip of the axon that let the

calcium in that let the vessel release but there's very similar channels also on the dendrite um

and and they can sort of add up and sort of propagate in a in a you think about of an op amp

with a with a feet a foot feet forward you know what I mean with a positive feedback gain kind of

thing and so so and actually NMDA channels can contribute to this so there can be but but not

every cell has these really it's mostly layer five pyramidal cells that have these but uh yeah so there

can be um dendritic spikes which are very different than than normal than the classic spike that were

the classic axonal spike that we always talk about these dendritic spikes can happen actually both

uh through calcium channels in the forward direction in those layer five pyramidal cells

but in every cell you have those back propagating uh action potentials where it's happening in the

cell and going backwards and so I think a lot of what we were talking about is trying to define

this uh thing called uh spike timing dependent plasticity um and like how it assigns credit

because in hebean learning you have this idea where you know fire together wire together um

where if one neuron caught like sort of caused the spike of the next neuron then that strength

that synapse should be strengthened whereas if it didn't it should be weakened and so uh this the

idea is like if it goes neuron one then two then that neuron one probably caused it and thus it

should be strengthened but if if the postsynaptic neuron fires first and then the presynaptic

neuron fires then you know that presynaptic neuron didn't contribute crafted the first one firing

because it's the first one sorry to neuron two to firing because that it it didn't you know it

didn't fire before it so it couldn't contribute to it so in that sense it should be weakened and

they've even showed uh moving coupons lab has showed like that you know the closer one fires

before the other the more the synapse gets strengthened and then if it happens in the

other direction the more it gets weakened and the way they've explained it is is uh through

we were just talking about like with assigning sort of the credit to the to the dendritic spine

through this sort of calcium signaling and back propagating action potentials uh and uh i think

rafael used probably has some good uh explanations of it in his book called spines

but but uh but yeah sorry i probably went too far all over the place there no no no you

no you didn't um that was really great that was um so it was interesting okay so so jeff

hawkings was in his book on the new book uh a thousand brains he was saying that um he thinks

the the dendritic um spike could be how the neuron is predicting that it's going to fire

and in addition to everything else he said do you do you agree with that yeah like a dendritic spike

spike uh well the well first off the back propagating action potential that dendritic spike

only happens as a result of the neuron already firing but as far as what you're saying if it

can uh be a large factor in causing the axonal spike then you're talking about it forward

dendritic spike and those yes in the cells that have those in the layer five pyramidal cells

yeah that those are huge huge contributing factors usually yeah usually you need usually you need

that plus like a little bit of something else to get a spike you're you're probably not going to get

it's probably going to be difficult to evoke spikes without that that dendritic spike so so

that was that was that's sort of like jeff hawkings basis for how a neuron is predicting that it's

going to fire without actually firing completely um and uh thank you for like and then so i also

wanted to ask you so i so when i asked about dendritic spikes you you answered a question

that i wanted to ask but i i my i was actually asking about dendritic hairs and how they affect

voltage hoses um fines yeah the the hoses are like the things that i was calling dendrites hoses

yeah and then the hairs are actually called spines the dendritic spines spines so i said

spikes instead of spines and that you answered a second question for me before the first question

and hopefully it doesn't delete the first question from my memory but i'm just kidding

uh so how so how would the dendritic hairs affect the the voltage of the hoses would that

it would that cause the would that mess with the order of well actually maybe i should make

sure you mean spines so by dendritic hairs do you mean like the the length of the dendrite or do

you mean the little tiny points on the dendrite those are spines those are the spots where the

connections sort of happen i meant the yeah the the points on the dendrite not not the length of it

okay yeah so those are dendritic spines and uh not okay most cells have them not all of them

most neurons have them um and how how does how does that affect how does it spines affect the

voltage going through the the the dendrites themselves yeah because is that what you're

asking yeah yeah because because you know if voltage uh if voltage travels through different

materials it changes how fast voltage can can move through material and if there's more material

that should slow it down right yeah okay so um wait what's your background you have like physics

background right can i just talk about v i v equals ir type stuff with you or like what like um i

v equals ir i i'm not uh you're you're just i can hang with you i can hang with you a little bit

you gotta be you gotta use too many acronyms okay uh so you're like c s mostly right yeah okay

that's good that's good it's just good for me to know which which thing you are i have i've got a

lot of a lot of neuroscience and a lot of c s okay cool cool uh so um and some physics some some

astrophysics some some quantum but not but not as much as other experts out here okay so um

um so okay so let's give some background i think it was this was best put in uh

tim erbin's intro to neurolink thing that 80 000 word thing he you've written that right

or have you read that oh what was it called tim so tim erbin wrote this sort of introducing

article for neurolink when they just came out uh on his website wait but why and i think he titled

it like the brain's magical hat or something it's it has like a picture of a wizard hat and he basically

so so the bit the silicon valley is just full of like c s people right so so and then ilan must

like putting up this like neuroscience thing in the center of all these tech people who don't

know what the fuck it's even for so so basically tim erbin wrote this amazing article it's huge

it's like it's the same size as like reading a chapter in a book it's 80 000 where it's probably

like reading 30 pages or something but he basically condenses a neuro 101 class basically like a two

semester class like like literally i remember reading it being like damn i didn't have to spend a

whole year in uh in intro neuro i could have just like read this article and got the same rough idea

you know um anyways i think this is his i might this might be from my intro textbook

or it might be from his article i can't remember but you can sort of think of so yeah the dendrites

are leaky they're like if you took a hose and you stabbed it a bunch of times with a fork and you're

trying to shove water on one side it's gonna like lose a bunch of water by the time it gets to the

other side but you can also like duct tape the holes and then you you can keep a little more

pressure you know keep the voltage lasting a little longer so that's something called the

length the length constant is like how far you can get the charge to travel and then the time

constant is like how long it takes for that charge to leak out of the holes and these things are

dynamic you can actually plug some so there's certain holes in the dendrite called like uh

inward rectifying potassium channels or whatever and so these can act you can actually shut them

you can send one of these signaling molecules i was talking about and sort of just close them all

and then by closing them all you're allowing uh less you're you're plugging the leak you're sort of

like duct taping the holes and allowing charge to travel further and leak out slower and thus uh

the same signal that was weaker you know that you know was a weak signal because you plugged all the

the holes in the hose kind of goes further down the hose you know and and so so this is dendrites

right so so basically these dendrites can be dynamic in a way so the dendrites can be very

leaky or you send some signal it gets sent some signals to it and then the dendrites become

less leaky and now they can transfer charge even further and and uh so normally let's say it would

take you know in that area it would take like uh one you know one neuron to spike a bunch of times

and a bunch of other neurons spiking a bunch of times and them all happening at the same time so

you really need like 15 inputs to all happen at the same time and that's barely enough to get push

enough charge down to the soma but if you plug up all these holes instead of needing 15 inputs

all at the same time maybe it'll make it with like nine inputs so that's that that's one component

of how these dendrites are uh dynamic so you can sort of plug the leakiness to them uh

uh the spines is the other thing okay so all these inputs are coming in at spines which are like

these little bumps uh honestly there's pictures of all these things in Tim Urban's article too so

like you could actually see pictures of spines um and he uses like tons of analogies every

like in everything so and they're all great you know um i did read his article a long time ago

i just had to look it up to make sure but um yeah it's in front of me right now yeah i

read that thing like i told my like sister who's like not even in nurse she's like a

physician's assistant to read it you know like i like but i think it's mostly directed for like

for like tech people who don't have any neuro background uh but like who know tech you know

but uh so so uh the spines are where the inputs come in and the uh so and the inputs are these

channels that that let mostly sodium ions in and that those sodium ions depolarize that area

and the skinnier the dendrite is the the more resistance it has so like some small amount of

current actually causes a really large voltage in these skinny dendrites but then once it gets

spread out across the dendrite it's sort of like it all ends up the same it all just ends up being

this charge that accumulates and maybe increases the voltage a little bit so it usually takes a lot

of a voltage to cause a spike and then the the signaling of like how do we know what contributed

which which inputs which receptor areas contributed most to the spike that's not known but the way

it's hypothesized now is is through these spines so like if there's signals coming in and the spines

and there's also these calcium calcium buffer proteins and if there's these calcium channels

going in and it holds calcium enough in those spines for just long enough and then a second later the

cell spikes and sends a back propagating action potential so now that area that got the input

now knows that there was a success on the other side you know like oh we got it to spike and so

maybe it gets that signal from the back propagating action potential and because it still has calcium

sitting in the spine together it's like it like somehow signals that spine like hey we did it

you should strengthen uh but but there's no sort of control from the cell that's like hey it was

that spine over there let's go strengthen that spine it's more like that local area is probably

holding some sort of information and probably the idea right now is like maybe it's calcium

is being held in the spine and then if a split second later you get this back propagating action

potential that's the success signal so the spine kind of knows hey we did it let's strengthen and

then the way it would strengthen would be like let's put an extra receptor in there let's put

an ampere set let's add another ampereceptor uh you know which will allow which will just be another

input in the exact same spot so it'll it'll be like two receptors are now there that can that can

open in response to the neurotransmitter across from it okay so let me get let me get this right

so i so i thought that that um uh that's that's spines increase and decrease in number um rapidly

like all the time and they get like bigger and smaller and uh uh so this this receptors on spines

the receptors on dendrites it doesn't have to be spines but yes off uh many times on spines um

um they are constantly getting extra implanted in the membrane and getting removed from the membrane

so uh spines also are dynamic but i don't think you as far as uh i i don't know if the if it's

worth talking about the function right now at this level of the spines being at uh getting at it or

not because that's a slower process the spines growing towards uh a new so it's like if a new

axon is coming in and now it's this new cell that it you know it's this new connection that it hasn't

even been made before then maybe a new spine will grow out to meet it but that's like more of a long

term plasticity thing that's not like on the terms of likes you know right now we're talking on the

scales of like seconds uh milliseconds seconds and maybe like a minute or a couple minutes whereas

fine growth is more along those maybe hours or days you know what i mean so maybe let's

skip the spines growing and and not growing for like just right now okay so um so we have uh

receptors changing on the on the order of either millisecond scales or minutes um on yeah let's

just say seconds since that's a good middle at ground and then and the spines might be added

or removed but it's on it's on it's in terms of hours or days it's it's much longer period of time

now um are the spines uh when when long-term potentiation happens is that part of the process

of spines getting added or removed? Yes yeah the LTP is it's first you would see more channels

getting put in there so you'd get more amper channels maybe more NMDA channels and then

if you're put putting in a bunch more then you're probably going to get some more spines

to meet new connections uh but that's going to be slightly slower i mean i say milliseconds and

seconds and then seconds and hours i don't actually remember the precise uh uh scale of time but like

that in relation to each other that's what they are okay and then uh so when when protein

synthesis happens uh is that um also uh so that so long-term potentiation protein synthesis is a

part of it is can you can you explain how protein synthesis might be connected to spines being added

or removed? Yeah so i don't that's i don't know the proteins involved in spines being added or

removed i know uh yeah so calcium, calmodulin uh complex can be like a signaling thing that

initiates that um and i don't know the details you're going outside of my okay but i know

and then i this is i'll just like i'll highlight this is a research area

awesome and then um thank you i i have more questions i don't know how much more time you have

but i i i just thought we were gonna end up going back to bci's at some point yeah we yeah um yeah

we can so um uh but i mean i you can keep asking me stuff for net till till you run up till we hit

a dead point then and then we can i don't know however you want to do it so uh okay let me just

look over might the notes that i've typed out here so oh shoot i should have somebody was raising

their hand i should have called on them i think they left oh no whatever i didn't even notice

because i was looking at my notes i noticed a second ago but i wanted to finish my thought

before i brought it anyways yeah you're gone uh okay let's go back to your question about um uh the

the bci so so you wanted to talk about the thalamus right well were you the one that had

brought up artificial perception before um yeah yeah i was okay so that's something i've been

super interested in okay um so you know in the you you can uh in like the ar vr or in vr world

you can solve all the visual issues for artificial perception but then you're missing tactile and

you know auditory and or no i guess auditory you have but you're missing some stuff right you

can like put yourself you can wear these gloves that put pressure on things so it makes it feel

like you're touching stuff but what if you could connect in a way where you can just input the

perception right into the neural activity i think we were talking about like broccoli one day with

some guy right and somebody didn't believe that you could like imprint broccoli in your thoughts

yeah yeah that's that's my that's my example that i um i i i came up with that and uh talked about it

in the narrow lays pot a podcast the idea that that broccoli um uh you that it might have a

temple of spatial patterns that are characteristic enough that even if your brain was organized

completely differently from someone else's brain they could consistently rep recognize

that temple spatial pattern of broccoli and you could consistently recognize the temporal

spatial pattern of broccoli and so you could both talk about broccoli and understand what

each other was talking about and talk about the properties of broccoli together even if your brain

was formatted differently um and uh so let's just break this break this down into something uh half

as complex what if you were just uh watching what if you just wanted to uh taste broccoli

and so you didn't you don't need to know what somebody else's taste of broccoli is what if you

just wanted to imprint but let's like let's do something a little more palpable actually let's

say you wanted and actually this is already a problem an issue in uh in prosthetic devices so

let's say you have you're missing an arm but you want to give the sensation that somebody touched

your hand and you're missing arm and I think this this sort of uh this is totally like it's a very

similar issue it's like if you don't have if you do have an arm what if you just want to input

the sensation of somebody touching your arm directly into the uh sensory region for arm in

your brain you know it's let's set a broccoli let's use that and so that way you're not translating

what it feels like for somebody else to be touched and what it feels like if you do touch

let's just say like I want it to feel like somebody tapped on my wrist um without somebody tapping

on my wrist uh that's sort of like I think a simple like artificial perception issue

um is do you follow like does that is that close enough to the broccoli example for you

yeah I mean so I mean I so so I I I lost focus a little bit um but um are you

are you basically saying that if we we're going back to I think we talked about this the last time

and that if you if you stimulate uh neurons that correspond uh or areas of neurons that the

correspond to um that stimulus that it's going to reproduce that that um that sensation is that

sort of where we're going here the artificial perception yeah exactly yeah so if you

you if you look at the area of the brain that uh transmits that okay so so that the area so that

information gets transmitted from the neurons in your arm it goes up through your your brain stem

it makes one stop there and then it goes to your thalamus where it makes its second stop and then

from the thalamus it goes all across cortex so what I've been interested in is seeing how

and then so basically everything kind of goes through the thalamus uh not smell of course but

like everything I'm talking about here so yeah what if I could just decode what if I just could

decode what's going on in the thalamus and then risk and then uh sort of copy that in so basically

like okay whenever you touch the wrist it's like it's a pattern of like these 700 thalamic neurons

and it goes like these 40 and then right after it's these 20 and then these 50 and then these 10

and then these you know it's like this pattern and then when it activates in this way uh you know

those thalamic signals get out to cortex in this pattern and so but but uh you you figure out like

what the pattern is and and there can of course be variability and it's still going to feel similar

the same and if you can reciprocate that that pattern back onto the the thalamic outputs

then you can basically evoke that artificial uh perception and and I mean Neuralink talks about

this and their stuff they're like yeah and then you can even add in perceptions like we can only

see red and purple but what if you could see ultraviolet and so you could do that you know I mean

so you can add to this uh so yeah so um for I mean we so I I talked about this in the Neuralink

podcast which was um years ago and um you know yet it was uh we I was doing the Neuralink podcast

before even Neuralink existed and and and talking about this and so um the yeah so the idea was

that uh I I brought this up to David Eagleman a neuroscientist once at at a meetup and um

and I said uh something like something to the fact that um if you know since you were since you're

you know your the idea was that uh what if you know I guess it was it was an idea of like oh what if

um your thalamus is like is like your your camera and uh you know like if you're designing like a

VR program and your thalamus is your camera and your and the neocortex is is the environment

that's right that's rendering the image right and uh so so the the stuff the stuff comes in and so we

it goes it goes to the thalamus and uh and that's you know you get you get to observe this stuff

um but um but actually it's like the eyes are the camera and the thalamus is more like the

wire so you can still get the in you can still get all the info you need from the thalamus

if you can just hack into the wires you know what I mean yeah like like the like the detect

like the light detectors the camera lens it's like the camera and the lens itself and the

photo detectors are like in are on the eye but like if you can take the but the camera

spends an electronic signal out and so if you can cut off the signal halfway in its tracks

and then just pump out the signal um you know on the other side then then that's the same scenario

right yeah and I feel like that's the thalamus kind of so so I mean I felt that I felt that the uh

the thalamus was kind of like um uh you know a point where you sit up for a second and just

like really think about this um that the thalamus was like a point where you could intercept the

signal and uh you could um let me just uh let's see it would be like um okay so it's it's kind of

like in so so instead of needing to study like every single part of the neocortex to decode the

brain if you could just stick a microphone to up to the thalamus itself then you might be able to

to decode what a person is thinking about across across their brain and no no not thinking about

not at all I think the thalamus just gets you the sensory inputs so it's like it's like uh

sort of seeing seeing hearing right so okay so it'd be the equivalent to uh if you have a neural

network and uh and you feed it like an image right and the the image all goes to layer one of the

network imagine if you could just record all of what happens in layer two of the network and say

you know it's a 20 layer network if you can just reciprocate layer two next time um it should give

you the same out you shouldn't have to show the network the image again you should just be able

to plug in all the the values for layer two and then it it should sort of like if it decodes like

dog or cat right so if you basically instead of showing it a dog or cat what if you just knew

what the uh layer two weight uh not weights the layer two values were for dog for a particular

dog and then you just put them in then you now uh now the network will will think dog but you

didn't even have to show it dog

maybe yeah i don't know maybe that's not but but basically so you're not knowing what all you

don't know all the all the thoughts are happening in the upper layer you know they're happening in

layers three four five six seven if we're analogizing to to machine learning uh to ai uh all the

thoughts are happening in the in the upper layers the thalamus is sort of like trying to just just

grab what the inputs were you know without having to look at what this you know like the screen so

i i guess one of the questions that i really wanted to ask you um had more to do with your

exploration of the thalamus and how signals travel so i mean i obviously i've um well that's not

not so obvious but you know i've i've taken cop narrow one-on-one and and they talk about how

you know that a photon might bounce off your your eye and and uh eventually a signal might

travel um from your eye along the optic nerve to your thalamus and then backwards to the to the

neocortex to the to the um uh to the uh what is it called the um the cortex in the back of your head

yeah v1 and in the occipital lobe yeah but um but i wonder um there's a lot more detail than

that so would you mind maybe like just describing because you because then you i actually i thought

what it's conventionally thought of that the uh that the the note the the gustatory system didn't

travel to the thalamus but you found out that one of five pathways do everything yeah so the

yeah it doesn't so everything has to go through the thalamus before it reaches cortex really um

yeah except the olfactory system the the smell the smell has five paths and uh and none of the

so of the five nuclei that none of them are the thalamus but one of those five nuclei does go

to the thalamus next so basically in once the olfactory bulb you know goes to piriform cortex

and olfactory tubicle and all these other places i forget which one maybe it's the tubicle or something

then that one goes to like anterior dorsal thalamus or something so the thalamus does get like a copy

of the information but it's not the sole router of it you know it's not the it's not the telephone

operator for for smell okay whereas all the other senses you know it like all the other senses but

before it goes to cortex it has to go through thalamus okay and then um so what part of the brain

does the um uh do the does the gussetory system connect with olfactory bulb uh that so smell i

don't that's not my area but it the the primary area that's studied is the piriform cortex okay

and then um okay so then um so so information comes out of the thalamus right and it goes yeah so let's

so it lets ignore smell and so like for all all the other modalities yeah yeah so you get touch you

get taste vision hearing all that information comes through like the the receptors on the outside of

the skin and the ear uh you know like everything there's it's like these sensory transducers

basically and then they make you know they go through the spinal cord or wherever they go

through and then they go up to the thalamus and the thalamus is sort of like the center station

and then from the thalamus it just like goes all over the it doesn't like once it gets to the

thalamus it no it no longer follows that sort of we go here and then here and then go here um it's

sort of like spreads it sort of starts spreading out like in a in a way where it's not it's not

that useful to start saying to keep the hierarchy going you know i mean there is some degree of

hierarchy but uh it's no it's not as strict as it was before it reached the thalamus before it

reached the thalamus it was very stepwise like all the signals go here and then they and there's not

much there's not like a ton of computation decoding it it's sort of like just goes there

and then gets passed on there's not like a bunch of algorithmic computation going on

but then once it reaches cortex now you have all these computations going on so it sort of doesn't

make sense to try to hack what the cortex is doing because it's so complicated but if you just

want artificial perception what makes more sense is just find out what the input is before the

cortex even got it and then copy that and that way you don't have to figure out the you know

thousands of years of research that it's going to take you to figure out what the hell cortex is

doing if you can just grab the signal beforehand right but but what i'm saying is is um so yeah

so i remember now with the neural ace podcast we were saying that um uh we're decoding the

signal on the thalamus but also um stimulate stimulating the thalamus directly to to reproduce

the um the signal right there because then it would then it would just be carried to the rest

of the neural network right that was that was the idea and yes that would be great and then the

then it comes to the heart issue the thalamus is like in the center of the brain and the furthest

possible thing you could reach the most dangerous thing to go for and so it's actually the worst

target but what you could do is try to influence the term the thalamic terminals you know that

that was an idea i i was working i'm thinking i'm constantly thinking about how to approach it that

way uh one of the ideas that i came up with um again this is the neural ace podcast if you

want to check it out but it was yeah i definitely will i i just looked up that guy and he looks

like somebody i should look up the the were you with were you talking with him the stanford

professor uh which one uh it says uh david eagleman i don't have a podcast with him yet

but he's promised that he'll do one with me oh he's not a professor he's a stan alumni stanford

university he teaches oh yeah he is a professor okay yeah yeah yeah but uh but yeah i'll definitely

check it check it out uh that that podcast so so yeah we could probably uh talk more easily if i

if i followed that podcast um but what i was going to go before was um i so i i pitched the idea

that we could target the um we could stick the uh the uh the neural ace up the up the nostril

via like a nano robot would climb up up the nose to the underside of the of the brain

as close as as close to the thalamus as we could get it and that's how that's how we

would decode the um the thalamus and and uh and and and and stimulate it basically yeah and that's

a reasonable like solution like they are ready i'm the stuff with uh they're like putting in some

type of electrode through the vest through the blood vessels um and oh yeah i'm right about that

that that's a new it's a actually it's actual neural ace that they they stick the they they um

there's a it it goes through the it's you can actually stick it in through someone's arm and

then route it up the blood vessel into the brain and then when it gets to where it's supposed to be

it expands i wrote about this as well on so if you look you can see my you can see i interviewed the

guy who who was doing it actually and and that's uh who does who does do that by the way i'm curious

let me check my website i'll i'll tell you the who it was yeah i covered this news yeah i mean it

must have not i mean it must have not been that awesome because it came out like three four four

years ago and i haven't ever seen or heard anybody talk about it oh i you know at least that at least

that work i mean i see talked about all the time and the pop science stuff but like in the neuroscience

side i haven't seen much so maybe it's a slow moving maybe they're maybe it's like in a clinical

step or something uh hang on let me just um i think i need to hit the search button for uh neural

no place on my it may have been so long ago that i wait oh shoot

oh here it is okay so it's called stent road yeah that sounds right so the virtual rally for pain

relief in stentrode a brain computer interface can be implanted in the brain without brain surgery um

so i interviewed uh at the game developer conference of 2019 i spoke to david protrino

he's a phc at mount cyanide um and i talked about his neural ace product called stentrode um and uh

so if you message me uh later i'll send you the link to this article since it's a little bit harder

to find or you can just search my website for stentrode and you'll find my article and it has

the interview with him and also i linked his talks you can see his talk at gdc which you

you weren't able to find before okay yeah no i mean i followed you yesterday or two days ago on

uh on twitter so i i can i can message you and stuff on there okay good um i don't know if i'm

following you back yet but i i hope i'm yeah i don't think you're following me back but you'll

i don't i don't know as hopefully you didn't get too many followers in the last two three days

no i mean i've gotten in the last like four weeks i've gotten uh like a hundred followers and i i

want to follow every single person back but i just i sometimes i'm not aware

yeah i'll message you or something um yeah that's that's that's really cool i mean so

it looks like this this has been like uh you you seem to have like done a lot of interviews

and podcasts about it uh maybe over the you know like three years ago and stuff um i'm reading

your thing right now i when i was reading like your your vr stuff too i was i thought you were

i was getting the vibe that you were interested in like integrating those two things too uh yeah i

am i in the in the earliest podcast i talk about how it opens the door to having vr and ar without

um direct uh brain stimulation so some of the software that i'm writing now for vr applications

will will eventually be um neural a software that's great yeah i was trying to learn a frame

actually because that seemed like the best thing that could at least communicate between people

but i i mean i don't know but you know like i only know how to program in python and

and batlab and stuff so i'm not like i'm so i i'd be happy to help you with a frame stuff

because i lead a coding meetup and um we are it's really about helping people to to make

whether it's our code and um in addition to aprim i'm really excited about um there's a

there's a class on 3js it's it's really great that i'm that i'm taking and then um i'm really

excited about react 3 fiber um because uh it has um mainly because it has it's it's it's a

normalcy simplified the process of of creating uh really awesome uh 3d applications that run on the

web but also it can run natively whereas whereas aframe uh doesn't run natively at the same speed

it doesn't run at native speed if you run it if you run it in an app and unfortunately so um

so i'm excited about react 3 fiber for that reason and also because of the fact that the the pool of

react developers is much is is much more massive than the pool of of aframe or 3ds developers

and so that means potentially um you know i think that all the facebook and and twitter and

netflix all those big companies will they'll create the ar and vr versions of their websites will be

the exact same websites they have now but they'll they'll be 3d and you'll see them in ar on your

phone or with ar with your glasses etc but they would build with react react 3 fiber and i think

those companies don't realize this yet but i but i i um i can i can see this trend happening because

the because the masses of of react developers at facebook will will um will realize that they have

really the best tool they have for creating vr is is with uh r3f or react 3 fiber so react should

be something that i look into more than like it uh other things i think that just the sheer scale

of the number of uh react developers means that it's it's going to become the dominant

technology but um but but in the short term i'm i'm like um you know maybe i would i would say

recommend maybe learn 3js because 3js is at the core of both aframe and react and if you are a master

of 3js uh then then um then what you can do in both react 3 fiber and an aframe it's going to be

it's going to be massive but i can help you a lot more with aframe stuff there's a whole community

of people who are who can help with the react 3 fiber of stuff as well so so as a complete

infantile like i i don't even know what 3js is what where what would be like a good intro uh

i mean i i i know like i mean yeah so what would be a good place to start

so um so one is that you can join my discord uh which is the xrweb.com and that will give you

the link that will give you an invitation link to my discord and then um two and that's a developer

discord for building web xr apps and and uh and we organize meetups around the topic and and there's

lots of resources inside the discord to lots of different links to uh react through fiber to 3js

to aframe and um lots of great code examples that show you some of the amazing things you can do

with all of these and then finally um you could just go to 3js.org um and there's really excellent

documentation and um 3js journey you can find on you can go to 3js journey uh just type it into

google and that's a great class it costs it's usually 100 bucks but if you wait and if you just

follow the guy on twitter and get his notifications eventually he's gonna say okay it's 40 off today

for the first 20 people or something and then you just get it you get a good discount if you

want to discount but um but it's only 99 bucks if you don't get a discount okay um and that's you

know that's like way cheaper than the university class and the value you're getting from his class

is just um i think it exceeds many university classes right they might cost a thousand bucks

or it exceeds the value of many conferences that cost more than a thousand bucks i think so i i had

no trouble paying it i was just like yeah this is worth it but um so 3js would be something to

learn kind of first uh just because that will allow me to pivot anywhere yeah that 3js is the core

and then um and of course um i so i i helped create a um i co-created an eg application

that was working in uh webvr and we used aframe to do it so um so you so my code is open source

and so you can immediately use that in the same application we're using because uh it basically

it visualizes time series data like it takes the um we collect the the voltage signals from the

sensors on the forehead and uh send them in they're collected as hex values by the machine

and um then they're converted into numbers and then there we run some program to to reduce noise and

and uh uh there's a there's a server some low pass low pass filters basically for the noise

yeah low pass filters um i think uh then there's this is like 2018 so i'm like

like is it is it i i get i get a feeling that like we have a lot of non i like our

like our skills are like just touching but not almost like not overlapping like the things

you're saying right now like oh god i'm you're probably like i'm going to go look and it's

going to be so above my head at all the things you're telling me right now uh well i'm happy to

i'm happy to like like again like if you if you connect with me on the discord we can go over

the code and and and in one of the online coding meetups with the with the community and and teach

everybody at the same time and and if you want we could record it and just share it with everybody

but um or whatever but um but uh but yeah so so the so the signal i have i i i i guess we're

kind of winding down but i want to see if i can squeeze in a couple more questions um so so the

signals pass into so just so just so jeff hawkins he was talking about um the the fact that the a

neural column um is is now going to represent uh you know an an object in in front of you like

you're hoping you're holding a bottle and it's going to track the rotation of the bottle the

appearance of the bottle the um uh the sounds that the bottle makes and all of your expectations

of the properties of the bottle and it's going to sort of create a it's going to hold on hold on

one second i'm having a glitch okay yeah okay so the speakers speakers were the wrong speakers

were playing and it was talking over you sorry okay i'm listening now sorry about so so the

idea in the thousand brains is that a neural column will um will is a every object in the world around

you that you're seeing right now is going to be sort of managed by by a different neural column

um and uh so so and there's lots of there's lots of ideas um that's just one of the ideas and some

of the ideas are sort of conflicting and and that's why i sort of like there's some good questions

and um so that so so one of the ideas is that a neural column is going to uh manage all the

properties of that one bottle and so that you'll you'll have um uh the it'll manage all the the

orientation of the bottle it's distance from you it's distance from your hand where your fingers

are on the bottle uh what the bottle looks like what his appearance is what the bottle sounds

like it has anything in it like all of these different all of these different um sensor streams

come in through through different parts of your of your sensor apparatus and then they

get they go to the thalamus and then and then um and and then they go to you know like you have

at the point of the thalamus you have not yet formed the percept of the existence of a bottle

that at the point of the thalamus it's still in the mode of like edge detectors and like pixels

think of it as like pixels are now like a lot are now like it's like at the layer where it's

like talking about lines maybe instead of pixels it's not there is no cohesive bottle yet that's

probably two or three steps up the ladder okay um i i'm with you on that like you know but in

in terms of like you know so it's taught it's it's commonly thought you know the the hierarchical model

of learning you know the v1 might have lines and edges and then and then curves and then and then

maybe the v2 will have a higher level of shapes right and then v3 would have shapes and would

would you have complex objects with multiple shapes connected to them or something right

and then yeah and so once you get to cortex those models start being like highly debatable but

at least in thalamus you know it's like at still at some low level like that but yeah that's that's

the idea so so he so he was talking about how in the mass brain the mass brain is mostly like

level one cortex and so that means that for the mouse most most of its its world is just level

one cortex even though there's six layers it's just you know the amount of tissue in level one

it just dominates and and so the idea that he he was talking about in his book a thousand brains is

that uh that we could have entire objects like whole complete objects in just the level one

of the cortex and then um i started thinking about you know well you know people um uh

sometimes say the eye is really part of the brain because there's so there's so many different

layers to when to to um it's it's great so that's developmentally it's it's um so like

developmentally there's three types of derm it's like ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm and so like

the endoderm becomes like your stomach lining the mesoderm is like in between and the ectoderm

becomes your skin and your brain so so basically um the eyes actually come out of the ectoderm

that's not your skin so it cut your eyes developmentally your eyes literally are your brain and then

the part of your brain your eyes actually develop from is is the same as the diencephalon which is

the part that also has contains the thalamus so the so basically when you start describing things

in a developmental sense that um the eye really is brain the eye is just sort of like a it's like a

part of the brain that did its own thing um yeah so yeah it is it is part of the brain right it grew

brain from cells that were set aside to be brain cells and it seems like in the eye itself we have

these descriptions of um you know what like we covered earlier that uh there's there'll be cones

and receptors in the eye that only track when an object moves from left to right um and when an

object uh is a certain color and right and um so that means that like at the eye itself maybe I'm

thinking I don't know if this is what it means but I'm thinking maybe edge detection and color

detection and like the v1 type of activity is really happening in the eye itself um instead

of in the v1 um well here Julia you're you're you're you work in the visual system I don't know

how to get you okay all right well the retina um it's probably work no she's right she's around

here it's like the other room we're I mean I'm like I mean we're in the same spot but I just

oh okay get a page plus nope Julia oh she's at your house like literally yeah yeah

it's funny it's actually also funny to me that I thought of that like like uh 20 seconds before

it made it to to my language before I said it that's also funny where's the invite to speak

there it is okay there anyways so like um so I don't think there's too much uh context that reaches

that first of off the retina gets like basically no input from the brain it doesn't get a lot of

input it doesn't get I don't think I mean maybe maybe some crazy sparse like non-functional

like vestigial like one sort of axon gets in there to control the muscle or something but

for it basically the retina doesn't get any information from the thalamus or from the brain

and um so there's no context it's literally just like did this pixel get light flashed on it or

not kind of thing uh there's there's a little bit more going on because like the ones that get light

can sort of inhibit the ones next to it so there is a little bit of computation there but you

definitely don't want to think of it as at like the level of like it it can formulate what an

object is at that point it's the best just it can basically just detect edges at that point

and then in the thalamus first well the thalamus sort of doesn't the thalamus cells sort of don't

connect to each other really much at all so there's not a lot of like I mean there's modulation that

could happen and sort of like ignore this or maybe pay more attention to this but there's not a lot

of computation happening in terms of decoding what the object is in terms of the thalamus so

I don't think any of the actual percept is formed until you get to be one once you get to be one

there's all sorts of cells that are connected to each other and and connected outward and inward

and in a circle and just like all sorts of crazy connections that are clearly doing some sort of

computation but at least at the level the retina and then at the level of thalamus things are sort

of like one thing connects to I mean I'm exaggerating here but like it's almost like one thing connects

to one thing connects to one thing and it's just like passing it on a little bit with with some sort

of math uh think of it as like a gross structure modulation but not it's not decoding much and

then and then there's this huge jump right when it gets to be one now it's like really starting

to figure out what it is and then v2 and now and since it's actually since thalamus is sending it

to both those areas at the same time anyway maybe v1 and v2 aren't even the best names for it because

v2 gets gets sent stuff directly from the thalamus too it's just it also gets sent stuff from v1 so

now you just start everything starts getting connected to everything so clearly things are

getting decoded there but yeah I definitely wouldn't start thinking that like the information of bottle

is held in the retina or in the thalamus it's definitely the idea of of bottle I think sticks

in the cortex and if if the cortex is making some prediction because the cortex does send

a lot of information back to the thalamus um I don't know I uh I don't know how much the cortex

predicts like bottle and then sends it back to the thalamus um but it's if it is getting sent

that way it's definitely not just that because the thalamus is also getting the the the inputs

from the outside world so so if the thalamus maybe the thalamus might be matching the actual inputs

from the predicted inputs but that's that's the most I could think of it doing

okay so um so so you were saying so the so the signals so Jeff the Hawking's idea was that uh

you have a neural column and uh it's two ideas one is that a neural column will be uh managing

all the properties of an object with a reference frame so you'll have part reference frame is like

you have part of the the neural signal will be very stable that would be like at a higher level

that might be the the v2 and then the the stuff in the v1 which be lower level will be changing

rapidly and and so the reference frame idea works like you have like um um I guess it's I guess it's

he described as like the relationship between like uh grid cells and place cells and um some of the

some of the cells only change um a little bit because they're about where you are in the grid

and some of them will change um uh rapidly because they're about the the changing context of

of the location where where you're at like what's changing while you're there so so I read so I did

my undergraduate senior thesis on predictive coding in visual cortex and my advisor had me read

on intelligence which I think I've read like chapters five or six or whatever the chapters

where he's actually describing the structure of feedback connections and predictive coding

so I'm familiar with that what's new to me right now what you're talking about is like

um I mean I I guess yeah what what what is new beyond that the on intelligence book I I know

is analogizing or making making columns sound similar to some sort of like place cell structure

or grid cell structure um and you're saying these are columns probably in like v1 or v2

well so I mean so so by neural so a neural column of course is um you know there's 150

neural columns large neural columns right and and they and they um uh they they represent

in a you know everything from uh from Layer 1 to Layer 6 it's like it's like the entire stack right

and so his in one of his papers he described how that entire stack of columns that might be um you

know is it like a is it like a millimeter or centimeter I forget the the neural column but

um so the you have like these like columns these big columns in some sensory areas like 400

microns yeah but there's these things called and those are only in some places but there's

these things called mini columns and they're predicted to be like everywhere and you can kind

of just sort of if you squint your eyes just right you can kind of see them in between the

blood vessels um and so that that idea of these mini columns or micro columns uh is that that

they're like everywhere in the whole brain is like structured into these sort of mini columns and I

think that's what you're talking about these and they're like 50 microns um wide and like yeah

there's a gazillion of them but yeah yeah so basically the one the one of the hypothesis

on that is that they're like sort of the functional unit of the brain like the way that the layer

you know layer four cells go to the layer two three cells and the layer two three cells go

into the layer five a cells and those go to the five b and six like that sort of uh motif is sort

of consistent throughout the brain and uh and so there one thought is that those mini columns are

the functional unit of the brain right right and um yeah so that was um there's a hundred by

150 those 150 thousand or 150 no i don't think there's anything like that i think maybe in yeah

maybe he gave an example of of like if you i don't know i i don't know that number no

let me look this up uh so there's about a hundred million cortical cortical mini columns in the

neocortex okay okay i got you so if the neocortex if a mini column is 50 microns wide and you divide

the total surface area by that i can imagine you're getting about 150 million okay got it and it's

also saying that um there's they each have 110 neurons each um giving uh one million to two

million cortical columns so i'm what i'm like i'm not like confused what is he talking about like 150

thousand i'm sort of confused what he was talking i need to look i need to compare this data um but

uh because because definitely there's a big difference between like 150 thousand and and uh

and two million cortical columns but no okay now that you said those things that you just read to me

that sounds right like did you say like a hundred like a thousand neurons per mini column or 150

neurons per mini column or something like that so 110 um neurons per mini column okay yeah yeah

that's that sounds yeah that sounds right okay so i get what you're talking about you are talking

about mini columns and yeah there's a bunch of them like uh a million million or millions

uh over the whole brain got it so so so so so Vernon Mount Castle in the um in the 40s 50s and

70s what was doing John Hopkins yeah he was the first person to describe columns he described

them in the somatosensory cortex yeah and it's it's always funny that kuhl and weisel got the

Nobel Prize for columns and visual cortex when Vernon Mount Castle like discovered it first

and and he discovered all this other stuff first and it's almost like everyone knows like that guy

like discovered so much stuff but he somehow didn't win the Nobel Prize and all these other people did

yeah that's just like that's uh that's very strange huh i didn't know this but um

yeah totally oh man um okay so the idea is that um so that you'll have a single neural column

will then uh you know will have like activity towards the top that is very stable and the

inputs at the bottom of the column will be very will be changing a lot and that's because the um

the column itself is maintaining the um either an object or uh or a word and and at the top

and that's the reference frame and the bottom is um is the references or the properties of that

reference frame so the reference frame can represent an object or or um or the idea of an idea

right and all the all the connecting all the multimodal connections to the idea of the idea

um so superficial layers are holding more contextual information about the thing and the

deep layers are deep by deep i mean like lower uh are are um holding more actual information about

the thing is everything yeah so so the no so the deeper layers would be like um uh would be

would be saying that okay this this thought the notion that uh this uh space is going to hold

is going to be the notion of a bottle and then it's almost like it's almost like the um maybe

maybe like an entity component system what i don't know if you're if you're familiar with

entity components systems but um it's like you have like um it's like um so i i guess this

won't be a good example um but it's it's it's it's like um it's like uh a way for the brain to track

objects um so you have like a space you have like a a bunch of different spaces each column

will be a space where a different object is tracked and um but that object has a lot of

properties and the properties are multi-sensory and like i said it's like how is the how close

is the object to you what does it sound like um you gotta what's it feel like what's it look like

what's it sound like yeah and and so well what i feel like those are gonna be a different air so

so each area might have you know however many mini columns so there's the visual area there's the

auditory area and so the visual areas just cares about vision the audit auditory area just cares

about auditory but then you have these higher so once you go past like v1 v2 v4 then you're

getting into all these like higher order areas they're multimodal so they mix sound with touch

with with vision and so so this is like in the parietal cortex or like you know areas that are

known for multimodal integration and so i feel like the context of this conversation might be

be more applicable if we're saying like maybe in the parietal cortex the mini columns there

are integrating all this information and maybe hold the are holding a concept of of an object

and yeah it's not known i don't think how how these different modalities like touch vision

etc get integrated in those areas that well you would know more right Julia like how they're

integrated in those areas do you know anything i wish but i don't feel like enough to contribute

to this beyond the fact that yes there are areas that are definitely responsive to some combination

of sensory features well like warnex warnex area you know it's it's it's it's many right many

different uh because language has a visual and and auditory components and they have to come

together somewhere right so maybe um um warnex area i only know it from like if there's an

issue where somebody has warnex aphasia which is damaged to that area they talk and talk and talk

but they don't make sense so they'll be like yeah go to the thing and like none of their sentences

actually mean anything um and and so like so they kind of don't know what they're saying whereas

brokes area maybe they do know what they're saying but they can't actually say anything they just say

the same word over and over or something so so uh i i wouldn't i mean i don't know enough about it

to say for sure but i kind of want to say that i wouldn't call those like language integration

areas but i do think they're probably there do exist premotor areas that probably do integrate

language and maybe they are like the warnex are involved in it maybe there's areas around it also

involved in it yeah that probably represent what you're talking about where like you're you have

some thought on the edge of your tongue and it involves this vision that you have or a sound

that you have you know like i can imagine that somewhere um yeah i mean i just realized that

the warnex area a damage to warnex area could could could be uh disrupting like um the oscillations

that allow the the coordination of of um of many different patterns that affects language most

most visit most visibly but it may not have anything to do with integrating language

yeah oscillations is a super contentious topic and that's right in the middle that's where my

project is dead on and uh you know i can there's not a lot known in a definitive sense about what

the hell oscillations are doing which is why like i've had old old advisors be like don't do it don't

go in that field that field has been studied for 30 years and it's still like nobody knows for sure

anything but but yeah there's a lot of theories about oscillations that's for sure um just not a

lot of uh consensus yet um okay so then so so in terms of how information travel like my whole

my whole question journey was like about how information travels through the brain so then

it comes in through the b1 and it comes in through the uh um you know the the a1 or the audio cortex

one and and this and the touch stuff comes in through the somato sensory cortex right yeah yeah

b1 and a1 and s1 the that's the primary court court disease and then um uh and and then what

happens is at some point um which you see here in touch uh come together and um and i am not exactly

sure what where they come together but um but maybe the where they come together is um i have to look

that up unless you know but but where it would be somewhere like the parietal cortex or the posterior

parietal cortex yes but in general just you can just refer to it as multimodal areas and just leave

it as unknown prida and post-pridal or just um multimodal areas yeah and that way you don't have

to be specific yeah multimodal area is really the keyword um so is it possible that um that there's

any traffic backwards to uh to the original the the primary um yeah there's probably recursive

like uh feedback yeah there's tons of it there's probably even more of it than there is before

it's just like yeah there there there's almost no place where there isn't there's also like these

dual pathways going through the fallowness so like you think of the traditional kind of hierarchy

going through the cortex where you have like okay the eye to the lgn the first order visual

limb nucleus and then primary visual cortex and then that's going to secondary visual cortex let's

say and then onwards from there but then you also have like these complementary loops through the

thalamus where it's going from primary visual cortex to like this higher order part of the

thalamus called the pulvanar and then that's also going to v2 so it's like for every cortical kind of

hierarchical jump you also have these um like parallel pathways through the thalamus yeah

difference copies um okay so then um i wanted to talk about okay so so when you said that there's

more um feedback than feed forward um are we talking about horizontal feedback there's all

sorts so like so v1 has all these projections to v2 but then v2 has a bunch of projections back to

feed one or back to v1 and sometimes there'll be more in number but like maybe each one will be weaker

you know what i mean so you can't so more is a very uh loose term there because it's like yeah

there's more axons but they make weaker connections so in a functional sense you know maybe they're

weaker maybe they're about the same but yeah they're basically there's just think of it as loops

everything it's just like nested loops i think is the best way to think about it okay um so so then

i was reading about you know um the proposal for short term short term memory a recent paper

they were saying that you know they were saying that i think i may have you may have heard me

explain this but they're they were saying that a neuron could might its activity might last um

for for 10 milliseconds it's total activity i guess is what you've clarified earlier but then

if a neuron could talk to another neuron it could remind they could remind each other and and um so

a neural circuit could carry a memory longer than a single neuron could um if if the if the the loops

between um you know neurons in in clusters or micro micro circuits or micro uh so the question

yeah micro shirt yeah so like basically if there's loops of individual neurons or small

sets of neurons they'll be able to maintain activity between each other and oftentimes that

activity uh will will result in some sort of oscillatory thing that you can read out on like a

EEG electrode and you'll see like an oscillation and stuff um are you familiar with that study um

do you know if um when they were talking about like um micro micro neural circuits were they

talking about micro columns is that sort of like different or is micro circuits okay so micro

columns is not a term that everyone uses but it it it's it's that term you're talking about

and uh micro circuits describes a a type of neuroscience so it's basically just describing

a scale so like if you're talking about EEG you're getting you're sticking a probe down in there

and you're getting a readout of like the net of like a hundred thousand neurons right if you're

getting an LFP recording you stick the probe down there and you're getting like a readout of like

the nearest maybe 300 neurons around that LFP recording um and then you know in imaging you

can zoom it you know you can image like the whole on a gross scale or you can zoom in and

actually see individual cells and I think micro circuit neuroscience basically just describes

getting really in there and looking at the the interactivity of individual cells and cell types

whereas um you know a more gross level neuroscience would be like yeah we scanned the brain and v1

lit up and v2 lit up and v3 lit up which says nothing about the individual cells in that area

yeah okay and do you know so um I read something that uh the the micro circuits or the clusters

or the micro columns were in in the mouse where we're range in it uh were spaced out in a hexagonal

pattern uh does that make does that ring a bell are you talking about grid cells which are placed

in a uh triangular pattern uh so so I so I guess I'm not because this is referring to the the

mouse I believe this is referring to the mouse neocortex um and but it really made me think of

grid cells because they were describing uh heck I have to maybe have to dig up the paper send it

to you after after after this but there I was wondering if if um if the hexagonal pattern of

so you've got clumps of cells and I I'm in there they're calling them neural circuits but it sounds

to me like you're describing these they they they take the shape of clusters and I thought

they're describing micro columns they're not using the language of micro columns and then

someone else is saying that these um micro columns are arranged in in hexagonal patterns and now I'm

thinking about grid cells in the neocortex of the mouse um and uh so this is all like this

this is actually two different papers and maybe I'll send them to you later but but have you

heard anything about this or maybe I'm just I'm looking at a paper right now talking about it but

it's not something I'm familiar with it it like sounds unfamiliar when you mentioned it but not

enough for me to comment on it so please do send those what sorry please do send those papers that

you're thinking of all right so I'll send those later and then maybe we can have another conversation

yeah and then um I wanted to ask um so so what about um so information also travels uh we've

talked about traveling you know vertically and and up and down and horizontally uh

from the primary to to the to the other areas of cortex and back and then um what about going

up from from from the bottom to the top and then back to the thalamus can you describe that pathway

uh I think that's the pathway we studied are you talking about the thalamic loops

yeah uh so yeah so um I'm just so have we already covered that so what I'm saying is like so

information comes from thalamus to the to v1 and then goes up to Layer 6 and then from Layer 6 back to the

thalamus is that right uh no think of it like this so it goes from thalamus to Layer 1 to Layer 2 to Layer 3

to Layer 4 to Layer 5 etc right except it's not just that Layer 5 or Layer 6 goes back to thalamus Layer 1 goes back to

thalamus Layer 2 goes back to thalamus Layer 3 goes back to thalamus Layer 4 so they all go back to thalamus

and it's a nested loop like that oh they're okay okay so they're all they're all in their own loop

yeah so so it's really interesting to sort of think think of the brain in terms of loops because

we were talking about um the the the neuro scientist who was on clubhouse was was uh

who's writing the rhythms of the brain in the brainstem uh he was he was uh he he he drew out

this picture I don't know if you were there for that top for his talk but yeah yeah yeah like David

or something yeah that's the same and and so he so he he he drew out this he said this is how I

imagine this works that there's there's a bunch of arrows and they're and the arrows are um all

arranged in uh you know they're all spaced apart from each other and they're all pointing different

directions and if they point inwards and that means that um that it's it's able to the it's able

to retain its its its shape and if they all start pointing outwards and then it falls apart and the

organism dies because it stops breathing and the arrows the direction of the arrows is represented

by a synaptic activity and um and they and they represent um you know like if you inject the mouse

with uh with an opioid or or I think an an opioid opioid simulator um some other drug that does

accomplish this the same effect but basically it causes the the synapse to malfunction then um

they're not able to make the mouse is not able to maintain its its its equilibrium uh at the

brainstem and then it sort of like loses control and then um but then but I you know I typed it

into google it just like I just typed out exactly what he said and I looked at it at the field of

arrows and and and and I and this is it was like this is exactly what um it's a it's a sort of

description of a dipole of an electrical dipole and so it's that's so amazing it's like this is

the description of a dipole and so here we have like the whole brain and you know is you know

has dipole activity and then it's like a dipole inside the brainstem maybe you know in sort of

like his description and then we've got all these loops and we've got small loops and loops inside

other loops and it's like this and this um this fractal of of loops and and um and maybe a fractal

of dipoles and it's just so so interesting and I don't know if we should leave it there for for

tonight but then yeah totally and and uh also these these neurons are being held at a specific

voltage because they're holding a net uh negative charge and then the so that means the extracellular

space is net you know to the neuron is 60 milliwatts more than them and so each of these neurons kind

of are like in a way a pole and then whenever there's current well I guess once there's currents

traveling through them then you have these poles and then they and since all these neurons are a

little all the least excitatory neurons which are most of them they're aligned in the same direction

so so these poles sort of summit and that's how you get these readouts from the EEG which is on

top of the skull you can think of it as like miles away from all the neurons that you have this giant

skull separating them but you're still being able to read out this electrical signal because

everything is aligned you know with each other so these these uh poles are sort of summating

wow um and um

okay so this is definitely there's definitely a lot more to talk about

about in the future but at some point we've got to uh we're gonna say that's uh that's enough for

one day yeah totally uh yeah I'd love to bug you about like other stuff anytime um yeah follow me

back I don't think I have a picture on my twitter but I'm the only scott prop maybe that followed you

yesterday or two days ago is it on your profile let me see if I can find oh so it's not so maybe

that's why I couldn't find you because it wasn't on your your um yeah yeah it's not on my stuff okay

let me look at that where and I'll see if I can find so you could probably just follow Julia first

and then I'll I'm on her small group of follows oh okay let me make sure I'm following Julia

there's a few profile I haven't logged in in a while so I haven't followed you yet but I will

cool um let me see if I can see followers followers no I need to look at following

um but I scott here's followed by scott so scott follows you okay I am as is scott s us i yep

so I am following you okay oh you are okay cool yeah and in fact in fact you're you're actually

um uh one of the people that I receive a hundred percent of all the notifications from so I like

don't ever post anything on there but yeah cool well if you ever do I'm guaranteed to see it

well I'll send you that article actually that I wanted to send you a couple days ago that was

because we were talking about neurolink and I was like kind of making the argument that they're a

little heavy on the engineering side and not caring as much about the neuro side as as possible

yeah I know they care about it some but like there was an article I felt like expressed it well that

I wanted to share with you but I'm definitely gonna look up uh those uh podcasts that you did uh oh

yeah and if you if you send me anything uh there was a couple things you said that'd be easier to

send me you should totally send uh direct message me on Twitter or whatever that's tough sounds good

um all right cool all right all right have a good night yeah this is really good thank you bye thank you

bye
