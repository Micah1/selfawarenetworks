Dendrites
My sense of balance...mmm...Are we allowed to just make up our own descriptions of senses or do we have to be consistent with the historical guidelines created by other people to describe the senses of a human being. I like my highest chakra, intimacy with the infinite mystery, and I like the sense of my brainwaves that I learned to recognize and consciously coordinate doing various combinations of neurofeedback and brainwave entrainment at the same time.

I really do like the sense of my own brainwaves. I like the sense of my cardio-physiology, my veins, my heart beat, my electromagnetic field. I like the senses from my lower chakras (am I allowed to say that hehe) there are so many good sensations. I like the sense of abstract ideas, programming concepts, mathematics with functions, category theory, I love the way category feels in my mind when I am programming with Haskell.

I love describing neuro-anatomy in differential calculus for all the ordinary people I meet everyday. I like the sense of other people, especially happiness, love, friendship, kindness, connection. I like the sense of words, concepts, concept maps, mind maps, uniting the flickering of dendrites firing action potentials and neurotransmitters backwards into a synapse, a massive expansion of complexity missed by the early Artifical Neural Network ie Artificial Intelligence oversimplification of what neurons do. I love the sense of discovery, especially discovering something new that changes my world view. I love the sense of gratitude and humility for all the wonderful people I am privileged to be connected to. :) I love the sense of participating, and sharing in a conversation or dialog, to appreciate an important part of what makes us human, our sense of the world from all of our senses :)
