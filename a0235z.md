Nick Burgraff, PhD is studying Ih and Rhythmogenesis
He had this idea about how to explain the brainstem rythmongenesis Oscillations failure

As
Arrows in a vector field, the arrows represent synaptic activity

maintain the equilibrium, meaning the 
, arrows facing outward meaning no longer synchronous bursting throughout the network

Rythmongenesis Oscillations are trying to stay in equilibrium

Nick sticks extracellular electrode

Cnqx to suppress neural activity

Another idea is that the excitation of individual synapses is going to change eeg dipole activity

Electric potential

Ion charges cause depolarizations
