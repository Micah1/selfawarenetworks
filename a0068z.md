(ATP) Neo Mind Cycle
Founder

I'm the founder of Neo Mind Cycle. A not for profit group dedicated to Brain Health, Nutrition, Fitness with Neurotechnology, Cognitive Nutrition, Cellular Nutrition, ATP Optimization, Energy, tCDS, fMRI, EEG Neurofeedback, Binaural Isochronic Brainwave Entrainment, AVS Mind Machines, Physical Exercise Discussion, Neuroscience in regards to Personality Types, Awareness Expansion Coaching, Artificial General Intelligence.  

I am interested in helping people, with dialog, coaching for awareness expansion, discussion about cognitive nutrition, neurotechnology, I love teaching people about neurology, and helping people to learn successful core strategies based on neurophysics & neuroplasticity.

Neo Mind Cycle group is the threshold of high velocity abstraction, where ideas are vehicles driving in the city of your brainwave optimized neocortex.

A center for bringing the best out of your mind with advanced neurotechnology, via the principles of brain plasticity.

Neo Mind Cycle is a combination of practices, technology, learning, and wisdom. Including Neurofeedback, Brainwave Entrainment, Mind Machines, and Cognitive Nutrition.

Neo Mind Cycle helps bring about increased personal creativity, intelligence, memory, and success, via new vehicles of expanded self understanding, including more connections between regions of the mind.

The results feel awesome, and may often include great new insights, intuiting means more connections between, well, everything. The results include greater meaning (connections between everything), and expanded awareness.

Specifically stimulating associations between brainwaves in visual areas, audio areas, motor control areas, enchancing all of those regions.

What we do together moves people toward greater happiness realistic sense, a happiness direction in your life that is firmly connected with all your goals.

Neo Mind Cycle features a brain optimization packages: these involves combinations of brainwave entrainment, neurofeedback, mind machines, and cognitive nutrition.

Certain packages include combinations of technology a person can experience in office.

These may allow a person to first notice connections between their thoughts & feelings, in association with corresponding changes to stimulating light and sound patterns.

Then later learn to control the light and sound by controlling one's own brainwaves with feelings and thoughts.

The result of this neurotechnology enabling practice is more internal connections between key areas of the mind, and more intelligence. 

Secondary results are numerous including more creativity, more great ideas, more successes, more mental flexibility, more performance under fire, more confidence, more happiness.

Including an acceleration of your eventual resolution of any subconscious psychological issues, from forgotten commitments, or inhereted subconsciously via family entanglements. 

This tech helps people with autism, ADHD, PTSD, addiction, and so much more.

It's great for people who have a therapist or life coach.

It's also great for people who want to have a competative mind for success in this world.

A session may involve sitting on the couch in my office with EEG hardward on your head, as well as head phones, and light emitting goggles.

The EEG measures brainwaves, sending that data into the computer where neurotechnology in the form of isochronic beats rides on your brainwaves back to you in the form of light and sound patterns that reflect the patterns of your brain waves back to you.
 
As your thinking, and moods change, so the lights and sound change,

If you think of a big prediction in the future, something really happy, the reverb or pitch might increase, and the light might get brighter or beat faster.

Unlike any brainwave entrainment you can buy on cd the brainwave entrainment I use is dynamic, as opposed to static, it rides on and changes in response to: your brainwaves.

Neo Mind Cycle's neurotechnology enabled practices engage your brain, and that's what makes it fun to use. If you are doing static brainwave entrainment and you are not enjoying it you should stop, because that means your mind is not engaged. With static brainwave entrainment (not driven by eeg) it's harder to engage your mind (find it interesting). That's part of my visiting the Neo Mind Cycle center is both a great way to learn about and actually do effective healthy whole brain optimization on your own mind.
