New, written on June 16th, 2022, an easier explanation of my Gravity Equation
'Gravity is time dilation'
"Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale." A mass like the earth heats up space time relative to outer space, expanding the number of directions around a particle temporally in addition to the spatial dimensions, because if a particle or atom moves in a random direction in space with no large masses nearby it has no particular reason to move one way or another, but if it has three times more opportunities to move south, because things in the south move three times faster, then the odds of it randomly moving south increase, thus gravity attracts particles by increasing the relative dimensions of time in the direction of mass and mass is the crunch point of an expanding wave on a macroscale.

The Quantum Physics of the Brain & Space

The Neurophysics of Self Aware Networks

Neurophysics, Quantum Physics, and Astrophysics

The whole universe is a fractal of oscillations

but its also a finite state system that is self learning and I will argue self aware

the number of possible states range from a single oscillation, between existence and non-existence, between 0 and 1

to maximum extropy (convergent information configuration) and maximum entropy (dissipative chaotic resonance)

in other words I am arguing that the end state of the universe has both maximum entropy and maximum extropy, as both are always increasing in oscillating areas.

which means the universe is always learning new configurations, but those saying those configurations of space are warping spacetime with em field lanes

imagine patterns ricochet across the brain
Christof Koch's work with tms and eeg

but imagine a football moving across your vision and at the same time a pattern is moving across your brain through space that represents the new neural correlates of that football in each interval of time that you are paying attention to it at.

Imagine its a 4D dimensional pointcloud like HypeVR, but rendered by your brain which creates internal patterns by modifying the phase field that other neurons can see, feel, taste, sense, and smell.

This phase field is spacetime, its made up of quantum particles, phase changes in time and space

the neurons excite or depress this phase field, and they read the changes, so it acts like a note pad, for the organisms mind to make notes and draw pictures on, the pictures are drawn from the data that comes in via sensor transmitter arrays, layers of them inside cortical columns in the neocortex

if two objects collide, but they were on different trajectories, and they collide at an angle, its like well now how do they move after the collision? What happens next?

so two electrons repel each other because they are like ice skaters tossing a ball at each other

same as two positively charged particles they repel because they are bouncing off each others signals on ice

but positive and negative attract because their signals are perpendicular to each other, they are in a splay state, which means they are pushing electricity either horizontally (negative) or vertically (positive),

with energy flowing towards the oscillator which is generating the expansion of time, while the dissipater (negative or high frequency space) expands perpendicularly

This would cause massless blackholes

or energy holes at the points in space that are most distant from any particles and from any lines between particles, the energy holes would be vast expanses of space around oscillating mass

but its just a slower oscillation

a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude

faster positive oscillation has 

it could be that a particle is the amount of time between each interval of oscillation from a negative charge 

Last night I worked out a novel new explanation for why opposite electrical charges attract, and same charges repel, but that led to new questions about fermions, bosons, lasers and superconductors.

Fermions are fractions of bosons?

So like the decoherence of a boson result in fermion pairs?

In a bose-einstein condensate: Bosons in a laser push on each other creating a linear excitement because of the narrowed configuration to a line, they accelerate spacetime on that line,

In a fermionic condensate the same principle is that oscillators are pushing each other apart because of their spatial confinement to a given direction

but I would argue that the fractional spin of a fermion means that the space that the fermion occupies has expanded, or has been pushed apart, it has diverged into components

this is because the different attractors in a particle oscillation have taken on different frequencies, which allows them to orbit each other into atoms 

but they are out of phase sync and so they cannot merge into bosons at that point, not until a fractional state meets a compatible fractional state, like neural receptors the fractional state can only accept mergers with particles that add up to a boson which is like an oscillator that has a balanced positive/negative state

w and z bosons can exist temporarily because their charge differences are dissipated by entropy

they would potentially decay into regular bosons or fermions

beta decay and LTD decoherence
equation for quantum gravity
everything is relative to everything else, in time space and oscillation phase, including in our brains.

the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators and its entropy and its repulsion and its the expansion of space amplitude, reduction of space frequence (time)

the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space amplitude (density), 

so the densities of the ionic gradients could also be thought of in the sense of fermionic condensates, 
resulting in gravity or spacetime waves in the electric field
soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.

electricity is gravity, magnetism is also gravity, magnetic waves, bosons, light, these are also gravity waves

the whole em spectrum consists of gravity waves

It seems that I have a co-inventor who independently arrived at a similar if not identical set of new ideas. (We don't know for sure yet because we have not shared the ideas in detail.) He arrived at a new equation for time before I did. He did not share his equation with me. He offered to write a forward for the book and I asked him to write a blind forward for my book, so we are not going to share notes ahead of time. He will be blind to what I am writing and I will be blind to what he is writing until we are both done writing & its time to publish. In essence we are betting on the idea that we are writing about the same idea.
