Self Aware Networks: Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography Whitepaper

(I'm adapting the napot wiki page into a white paper, so most of text from the wiki page will be integrated here, but this whitepaper will be expanded greatly, clarified, reorganized & rewritten in the format of a whitepaper on the future of neural networks.)

N.A.P.O.T. is the central thesis for how we can build Self Aware Networks or Conscious (Animal Level) Self Aware Artificial Neural Networks.

Memories have to scale up, from being stored in synaptic connections, to being something that your brain can be conscious of with multiple modalities representing different aspects of that memory. Touch, taste, smell, texture, feeling, emotion, visual & acoustic memories are all thought to be evoked from different places, but if these memories are stored in tiny synaptic connections, they have to scale up in order to connect together the different brain regions that are thought to represent the different aspects of these evoked memories.

The section on fractals, anatomical & functional fractals in neurophysics is intended to support the hypothesis I am sharing about how memories stored in synaptic connections scale up to whole brain activity.

N.A.P.O.T provides an explanation for how this happens and the fractal section of the book is meant to support the idea of memory scaling, or scale invariant memory recall.

The part about fractals in medical imaging also supports the idea that synaptic memories stored in individual neurons scale up to become conscious memories by creating alternating inhibitory excitatory waves that ripple across the brain in sharp waves.

Think of a neuron that is something that is both a pattern sensor & phase transmitter, a neuron also has thresholds to consider incoming sensory patterns, so the neuron is physically evaluating, based on it's connections & morphological configuration what kind of information to pass onwards, and what kind of information to disregard.

Understand also that neurons in the neural array defined by the exit terminal of one neuron are receiving information from many neurons, so while I ask people to consider that the front of a neuron, the dendrite, is like an eyeball, and the back of the neuron, it's exit terminal array is like an LED light in a tv screen for the next neural array, the next neural array isn't getting just one LED from one neuron, each of the neurons in the next neural array are seeing many LED light signals, or phase changes, from many neurons that are in their receptive field, so the output of one neuron is like one LED light for the next neural array but the next neural array is seeing many LED lights from many neurons all at once. 

Obviously there are no LED lights in the brain, you must substitute the visual of an LED light which is designed to help explain NAPOT with what is really being transmitted between neurons which is a phase change, in the oscillation of that neuron's cyclic activity, that the whole oscillating group of cells is sensing together.

We can adapt existing neural network architectures that exist today, such as Deep Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and others to become sentient and self aware neural networks.

Point: If an artificial neural network can do neural rendering and also 3D semantic segmentation and also gan synthesis of new images, then why can't your brain which is a much larger neural network in terms of it's connections than any existing computer architecture.

In your eyes, ears, nose, mouth, the first layer of sensory input neurons, ganglia neurons, are going to render information for the layer or the next array of neurons to perceive, and the process repeats with each neuron in each array or layer rendering some pattern for a subsequent or downstream array of neurons to perceive. No neuron array understands that it is not the first layer of neurons, because a neuron only perceives what is in it's receptive field, so in a sense all neuron arrays are sensory input neurons, and all neuron arrays are pattern output arrays.

To recap: The first neural array (in your eyes for example) is selectively reacting to sensory input signals from the environment, and then it's rendering a pattern (inception, the exit terminal, constituting the pre-synaptic branches, is the inceptive field) for the next neural array to perceive (reception, the receiving dendritics of the next array represent the receptive field of the next array.)

Imagine that the first array layer is like the input to a computer, like your keyboard, and what it sends out is like a computer screen, or your tv monitor. The next array perceives that picture, in a sense see's or hears or feels that picture, and then it creates it's own pattern representation for the array layer behind it, the process keeps repeating across the whole brain, from the sensory input neuropathways, and eventually out via the motor output neuropathways. If your brain & body is a fractal of a neuron, the sensory inputs are the dendrites, and the motor outputs are the phase changes, your bodies's movement is your computer screen output.

Imagine every neuron is an eyeball, or an ear, with an led light or a speaker. In effect the neuron sees, hears, or percieves the information pattern from the previous array, and then it transmits the information as a phase change to the next array.

Imagine that each neural array's output is like the pixels on your tv screen, and via temporal & spatial oscillatory synchrony your mind is rendered from this neural activity.

The tonic brainwave oscillation represents your the unconscious active canvas of phenominological conscious awareness that is tuned to expect, a process referred to as memory-prediction, and also as predictive coding, and these tonic brainwaves are oscillating memory-predictions that are driving your experiences, and driving your choices. It's the active memory program of you.

So when one neuron spikes faster, with a phasic or high phasic spike, it causes many of the neurons in it's exit terminal to become inhibited, creating a synchronized inhibitory pattern whose timing is set by the decay rate of the action potential which is set by the quantity of potassium in the neuron at the time the threshold for the action potential was triggered.

That activity is going to cause the whole oscillating group of cells to notice, and that comes down the physics of oscillation that connects to Steven Strogatz's work in the book Sync when he talks about fireflies & neurons & clocks.

Explain from Strogatz book with citations how two metronome clocks affect one another and synchronize.

The physics of oscillation allow your neuron's high phasic spikes to cause inhibitory effects to other neurons that the whole cell assembly will feel, as the energy is dissipating across the oscillating group over time, the energy which is also information in effect is a sharp wave rippling across the oscillator (a cortical column might be a good example of an oscillating group of cells) & between networked oscillators (networked cortical columns) across the whole brain.

I regard the hippocampus as like cortical column #1, it is a unique structure but in essence it embodies the key characteristics of an oscillating cortical column. The hippocampal-entorhinal loop might have a central role in your cognition, but essentially all of your oscillating cell assemblies are playing a role in sentient self awareness.

So the neuron that spikes causes inhibitory effects that the whole cell assembly & the brain will feel, via the principles of oscillatory sync, where oscillators essentially dissipate signals to one another, this process allows your cells to basically act as a single sensor, your body becomes an entified sensor array, that can bind together sensory information, on a collective scale, because the incoming signals are felt by the entire network, as signals are passed in phase changes, dissipating the information as energy across the collective cell assembly of your brain & body. So signals are dissipated everywhere.

Tomography from the collective entification of phase patterns transmitted between neural arrays - These phase changes, passed between neural arrays, become part of the tomography of the picture of the sensed, felt, smelled, touched, lived in experience of reality. A tomography that is an experience built from entified phase patterns passed between neural arrays rippling across the whole brain intersecting & defining the tonic oscillation pattern.

Each neuron in an oscillating group, such as a cortical column, takes a turn at firing to represent an activated memory, while other neurons become inhibited which magnifies that activated memory to a greater scale.
