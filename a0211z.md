(thalamus, perception, oscillate, cortex) imagine a skit

where one guy 

so the alterate states of mind with cannibus would be specific oscillator changes, 

could you scan part of the oscillating mind
and at the oscillation level discern a decodable pattern? What if each component of 1 oscillation was like a 3D pixel in space lighting up?

The pixels that light up are the pixels that represent 1 pattern, and the entire cube that isn't lit up is collectively listening to the pattern that the other cubes light up, and so the brain is listening to its own patterns

it would be like the holodeck is listening to itself

I'm experiencing mind alterates with cannibus as change is the large scale rotation of oscillations reacting to changes with other oscillations with oscillations pushing on each other but being unable to merge, like seat water colliding with freshwater and there being a separate of colors where you have a yellow sea up against a green sea, but they do not appear to be mixing.
So you have the data from one group oscillation maintaining a certain area that has a certain maximum sides and whos borders are defined by other oscillations. Because the direction of the oscillations change depending on which neurons have fired and that is I'

each pixel is like an action potential, from the Soma, but the small action potentials could also, they provide information from another sensory modality, because you see the brain is a 3D neural network where firing pixels are heard by listening pixels. The whole matrix becomes the input for the rest of the matrix, so that each neuron is learning its firing sequence, learning to predict its own explosive moments, because of the physical forces that accompany them. Neurons have like siezemeic activity that they are detecting, evoking a specific pattern in consciousness, which is the equivalent of saying evoking the whole pattern in consciousness.

a 4th dimensional pathway
a three dimensional grid like the borg cube, 13 functional layers (from Numenta)

each node takes its turn firing a radio frequency in a sequence as surges pass into them,

the way microtubules eject and refill themselves with neurotransmitters almost like a sort of cloud with a hydrolic liquid that is pushing between two points, as if winding a magnetic motor

as if all the signals large and small  that the neuron gets are widing a magnetic motor, and the current arrangement is the pattern that it makes when it fires, that becomes part of the global pattern

so now we have neurons that flash representing a red color that other neurons have the ability to perceive as red, because each one has a holodeck with a huge number of learned patterns, they can relate to it in a physical way to mark their own prediction marker to thrack how and when they are going to fire, in other words they study all the nearby neurons and learn their patterns
when all of the brain does this simultaneously we are conscious and woke and awake.

This is like cutting a worm in half, the right way, and you see it become two worms,

cutting the corpus collosum means that one person becomes two persons

like two different brains sharing the same skull
It would be interesting to know if the two brains could begin to get deep awareness of each other as two distinct personalities, because of the specializations that each has in the form of neural pattern presents that is the shape of an oscillation as definited by which of its 3D grid of neurons firing in this frame while the rest listened, and 

right now I just imagined that the brain was sticking its voice into my brain remotely, by telling which of my neurons to fire and when, thuse modifying my perception of reality

this would enable us to create AR and VR experiences through direct brain stimulation

if something else can manipulate the human you could manipulate their reality

with layers I could build a trapezoid around the player

and I could build layers to entrap in inside a cube, and then all I have to do is send a frame of video to each layer

basicallly its like streaming 6 different high resolution youtube streams representing each side of that perspective from that cube, each head movement results in a corresponding movement on that other server, 

so that one can have a six sided VR experience that is streamed from a cloud gpu

hacking artificial neurology

if we can control just the major input points, to the Neo Cortex, such as at the thalamus, we might change what is broadcast to the rest of the units, and thus change

This would mean that DMT works because its accelerating pattern changes, power oscillation changes and more activity than usual oscillations in the delta section

How to change yourself, how to change your mind, your thoughts your energy your motivation.

Imagine that you can become aware of how you are doing what you do and that means you can control it better,

If you focus on what you want, instead of what is being presented to you, you are switching from an automatic position to an intentional position.

It's a matter of thinking about the patterns that you want in order to create the corresponding actions that achieve them.
