Magnified by the internet (audio)

So, my conjecture in my book is that essentially dead things can be conscious.
Because what we're talking about is, the consciousness is, I'm calling it self-aware oscillators at the moment, because the dissipation of signals across the entire array of, we could say, of any oscillators, but we could say, you know, we can talk about fireflies, is basically, you know, in the sense of, like, abdominal habits allowing all of these nodes to act as a single sensor.

The fireflies are essentially collectively conscious, because they're all, so, oh, wow. That means that ants are collectively conscious in the sense, because the signals that each of them has are going to dissipate across the entire hive. So the hive's behavior is an aggregate of all the signals.
So for human beings, like, our collective intelligence is magnified by the internet, by our connection with the searcher, by the number of people, and by the rate of the connections between them, by the number of people, by the number of people, by the number of people, by the
