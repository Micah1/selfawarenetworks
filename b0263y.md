I think that I think that I should, I should I should say this while I'm remembering it which is that each frame of me will say, if I'm saying I'm a movie each frame of me is a a computation, right? And I don't really perceive that as the computation because you know with the computer like you print something, say hello world it prints and then it stays as hell a world.

00:32

So it's obvious that it's a computation, it went through a process, it did it, what I'm saying? Is that in each? If you could, if you could take 10 seconds of any moment that you're experiencing and make it intended to movie, but some movies from inside your eyes, but it's a movie, okay?

00:50

So, what I'm saying is like each frame of that movie, each moment of that movie list, you can capture it. 240 frames per second, you could capture it, 60 frames per second. Let's say, let's say captured at 10,000 frames per second, right? This is a really fast movie so fast.

01:08

You don't even know that the movie itself is made up of individual frames and that is, that's what I'm sort of proposing is that? I'm a computation. It means that my reality is slice into individual frames like a computer and that the cells are rendering each frame one at a time, right?

01:34

Like just like a three, like a display that you watch TV on, right? So it's like being a it's like being a monitor. It's like your brain is a monitor and its rendering age frame by changing the pixels. In that frame, it pixels in that frame are adding up to the visual representations.

02:03

You see the audio representations? You see, as part of it. But your whole it's not that your whole brain isn't just senses, right? There's a whole like internal internal operation happening. It doesn't connect to the outside world, that doesn't isn't connected to your senses. There's a whole bunch of processing going on in your brain.

02:24

It's not connected to what's in the what you're seeing and hearing. You have your your somatosensory cortex. You have your visual cortex, you have your audio cortex but these are this entry. These are the the cortical and the cortical input areas. These are the the particle. The sensory input, courtesies, sensory, info courtesies.

03:00

There's another. There's another area of the brain. That's not receiving input from your sensitivities and that is the prefrontal cortex. So here you have you have you know three three if you divide your brain if you divide your neocortex into four primary parts, you have the three sensory input areas the three main sensory input areas which are really the visual audio and the somatosensory.

03:33

So that's for touch and taste and it blends with it, like it's heavily matched with visual cortex, with the upper levels of the visual cortex. And then you have here. But then yeah. And, and so, we have part of a brain is rendering reality. Okay. The part of our brain is not not rendering reality, it's just thinking about the renderings of reality, right?

04:08

It's just receiving parts of reality that are rendered by other parts of the brain and then thinking about it because it doesn't have to think about it because it's not directly connected to anything. There's a part of our minds apart from mind that doesn't have anything input and it has to take the patterns that it receives and form a calculation from them.

04:38

Right? Has to say, okay well what is what it what? Basically, what is what am I predicting, right? It's sort of like I'm I'm predicting and predicting patterns that cause me to maintain my equilibrium the longest I'm predicting patterns that I think will cause me to maintain my equilibrium the longest right?

05:07

Mean stay alive longest and repindo things like, you know, reproduce that's that's part of one of the drives that I have to say, okay, well my my cells want to maintain their equilibrium but they also want to have offspring. They want to pass on life to another generation.

05:35

I think that is probably the best way to sum up. Like, I feel like, you know, it was interesting. My parents had me when they were young, right? So I grew up and I knew my parents, really, really well. Like, I talked to them every day. I even state at their house for months at a time after I, after I turned 18 after I moved out, I came ahead come back at various times as a, as a young adult.

06:05

In my early, I would say in my 30s and spent months at their house, just to sort of get through different different phases in my life. I guess. I, you know, I would, you know, maybe need a change. And so yeah, when I was a young adult, when I was in my 30s I would I had my own, I had my own place many times.

06:35

You know, moved out when I was 18 had my own place, I lived in, I lived I lived in May, I lived in different cities early on in the southern California area before the before. I lived in different cities and I had jobs in differences and I tried to get a lot of different.

07:07

I tried to get jobs. That would give me valuable work experience that I could take with me because the ultimate goal in my mind at each job was that okay? I want to I want to learn how to do something but ultimately I want to run my own company.

07:24

So I'm going to go and I'm going to get a job that lets me perform this role. And then my next job, I'm going to try to get a different role and in each subsequent job, I'm going to try to get a different role so that I know all the roles.

07:38

So that one day I could start my own business where, but I would already understand all the roles that everyone has in a company because I've worked at in all these different roles. And so and and so in a sense, I have this, there's a plan, okay? And as an organism, I have like, okay, well, I'm looking for, I'm trying to think about, okay, well, how do I the best chance is for survival?

08:13

What? I need a good plan, a good plan that is going to result in in me, being able to have the best life that I can. That can get based upon my, my, my intelligence, in my, willingness to work hard, and my ability to adapt to circumstances and my connections that and that I make with other people.

08:41

And, and the, the social contracts that I make with other people in the business contracts that I make for the people. And in order to to build a great reputation around the work that I do, so that I have long so that I've long term so I have. So I have in the long term like this optimistics scenario where life is like about moving towards the greatest number of the greatest optimistics scenarios that are possible.

09:14

So like you just like, what are the, what is the greatest optimistic scenario? That's possible for you. And then what is one thing you could do today to take a step towards that? Okay, but why am I doing this? It's because the organism is trying to predict what will be.

09:32

So will be so important from an emotional perspective. Like, if you're really tied into your emotions, they're very powerful. And so, if you can program, your emotions in your goals, to be an alignment in it together, in a useful way. So the emotions are basically driving you to keep focusing on how you can accomplish it and they're driving you to be focused on accomplishing what you focused on and the driving you to be focused on the right thing is but I'll striving you to be focused on.

10:07

Accomplishing your goals. And so you have this emotional desire to continue to do. Good work on your goals every single day and you get programs like that you get programmed to because it becomes tight in, with idea of happiness, and, and seeking happiness. Because we don't see happiness, it's not, it's it's because if you seek darkness, then you've been, you find your way to darkness.

10:34

And if you seek happiness to find a way to, but you have to do it in a way that where you realize you are you're not separate from the universe, you're one with, you're one with the fabric of reality because because yes you are a computer program but so is everything else around you.

10:57

So it starts. So is this planet? This planet is a computer program. Yes, the entire planet is computer program. It's doing some really fantastic things. There's like, there's life computer programs that have sprouted out of this planet computer program, right? But and these are all computer programs. All the plans are computer programs, they're 3D.

11:22

There are 3D, volumetric physical computer programs, right? Where where, if you break down what's happening at the cellular level? Is that cells are constantly, talking to each other. They're talking to each other in my brain and body and the human brain of body. But they're also a talk like cells inside plants are constantly talking and that talking is the constant transmission of signals.

11:52

These signals can be electric signals. They can be chemical signals, they can be brainwave signals. I but, but which particularly the interesting is that this is not only that the signals can transmit complex patterns such as you can have cells that are are remembering a problem and recognizing problem and managing a problem.

12:18

And and so they need a certain type of cell to go and and solve that problem, you know, in some cases, they have cells that commit that are sent to commit their, they basically, they, they self-terminate, they like, okay, we're gonna let go and this termination is going to help accomplish the goals of the computer program.

12:39

Like we're going to, it's kind of send a lot of signals, which cause a lot more of the computer program, a lot more this cell culture to pay attention. And to oh wow, something really is serious, it's happening because one of the because without all this like debris, from the cell that committed suicide.

13:03

And so like now we're all alert that shit needs to be recognized and like they're so greater cellular awareness of, you know, maybe maybe someone maybe someone they they've scratched themselves on a nail, okay, or poked themselves with the token themselves enough and toe with a nail or something.

13:25

It's a little bit of blood. Okay. So imagine you might have like this. That's you might have a cell that that is called.

13:42

Said I can find it.

14:03

Is called a carotino site, and the carotino site is a cell that

14:15

It can.

14:25


It can basically like recruit a lot of cells or I can stop the recruitment of traveling themselves. It can like I can like direct traffic. It's like, this is like carotenocytes are they're born from stem cells and the stem cells that come from, within the hairs, from within your hair your hair follicles.

14:51

So care sites are born from stem cells and they might be inside the hair follicle, or they might be like in between your hair and they move up from the deep to the top of the belly carotino sites, move through various layers of skin cells to the surface migration.

15:13

They undergo graduate maturation of the series of modifications and enable them to build more signals and receptors for complex decision, making

15:44

Okay. So what I'm imagining is that God damn it. I'm imagining that. So you've got your multiple frames out in a sequence. Okay. And okay. See. All right. But what happens is you also have fact that you can have oscillations like effect oscillations that are temporary that are temporarily distal.

16:34

So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?

17:07

Okay. So you have your distal pattern and it could represent a flower see, okay. But see, here's thing. Let's say that you are rotating. Okay, so let's say that you're rotating in a chair and when you look north, you see a yellow flower. Okay, but now you now you rotate many times.
17:37

Okay. So you've read, you're gonna rotate like a thousand times and you're gonna become, like, intensely aware of everything. That is graphically true about your environment. So you're gonna know like it, you're gonna be able to like when you closer when you close your eyes, you're gonna know like where the red flowers, were where the yellow flowers were how high the red flowers were from the ground.

18:08

You're gonna know you're gonna be able to just like see, like how many leaves were on that tree? How many petals were on each flower? Like you'd be here to see like the actual thing in your in your mind with your eyes closed because it's just been in spin and printed so deeply in your mind, right?

18:25

So, you're spinning around and then your eyes are closed, but you're still saying this image. Okay, so as you're spinning, there you go. Back to that. What was north of you was a yellow flower and so you say, okay, now you're now returning around facing north and what do you see above the fence if they yellow flower?

18:48

And then so you have a blue oscillation like that where they were your approaching like where something trick like a sequence begins and you know that at the end of the sequence, the yellow flower you can appear or you know that's the yellow flower might appear. Like so then what happens is the sequence begins.

19:10

But then the sequence and that has been triggered has a has, a temporal memory. So there's I contendable. Monitoring was having the frames. Something is keeping track of what stage that sequence is in. So that it knows when it's going to activate the yellow flower, like, oh, you're facing the yellow flower.

19:38

Now we're going to render it, the yellow flower, right? Oh, you're you're facing the tree now. So, now we're going to run to the tree. Oh, you're facing the ground. Now, we're going to the ground. Oh, you're facing a pole. Now, we're going to the pole, so I'm in a park.

19:51

Okay, I'm looking around and as I turn my brain knows to render the next area of the park, right? It knows in a general way. That because it is feeling in each moment with new information but that new information. Okay, is constructed from a lot of goods information and that means that like you know you have blood vessels across your across your all over your eyes that are actually blocking the light that goes to your brain.

20:28

Your eyes are covered with blood vessels that you never see because your brain it because your brain finds those blood vessels to be a irrelevant. They're not causing any, they're not causing any changes in your brain activity, right? They're not registered because they're not there there's no action that's happening with those blood vessels.

20:50

So, they're not stimulating any part of your brain at all. They're just, it's like the most boring thing and you're brain, just change it out. So you what you see though it however is is a computed image because that light that light you don't because you have to make up the image of a tree from a lots of bits and pieces of the tree because it's like you're looking through.

21:12

It's like the blood vessels in your eyes or like looking through a offense with a lot of holes in it. Okay. You you're like look you're like you're eyes are like looking through a fence with a lot of holes in it. It's like it's like it's like you're that be almost as if you had like the either that or it's like or it's like your eyes are a bunch of little cameras like millions of little cameras you can also think about that way.

21:42

But like it's because either way like you have to take bits of an image and you have to stitch them together. So when you look around in a park, you see this whole and complete park around you, you don't see the fence of blood vessels that's in front of your eyes, okay?

22:01

So it is a sort of like we want to say that oscillation is causing the past oscillations coming through future oscillation. It's not. Yes, but it's it's that you have the the pattern is is playing back a sequence or it is playing a sequence to playing a learned sequence.

22:23

But the sequence is always, is is going to attempt to fire. In the way that it remembers but then it's going to be sort of live altered by what happens this time. So it's like, oh I had this experience before. I'm gonna fire this particular way but what happens though is that you know like and you see if you ever play Tetris you play Tetris and the the more you play Tetris for 10 hours then you like start to see tetras in your brain and the the, you know tribe.

23:09

Yeah. Try playing Tetris for 10 hours and you're just like, you'll see tetras patterns and you close your eyes and try to sleep, you know, I don't know how many hours it takes to start seeing tetras but I just remember doing that one time and I've heard that story from other people as well, like it might be, it might be four hours or five hours or something.

23:25

But like, if you really play a game for a long, long time year, the gate, the industry from the game will start to, to permeate your conscience, like almost like your, your screen has a burn in effect. Like if the movie is still, it's like burned into the screen, just because you were because of the screen was holding that image for too long.

23:52

Like that's sort of like, you know, it's like the image of Tetris because burned to your brain because it is like a screen, okay? But,

24:16

Okay.

24:25

Yeah. And so, so

24:39

Guess we have to say that but you have this ability to not just track like not just render and a pattern. Like I think it a blade runner when they when he when the when the robot was saying was you know, he had to say this thing and interlink right?

24:59

Watch Blade Runner again. And when he, he's like, he has to be tested to make sure he's still a saying robot. And so he repeats repeated sprays and in between the phrases, he has to say, he has to say the words. Enter linked. Interlinked interlinked. Okay. And that's so interesting because that is almost like it.

25:30

It's difficult to like as a metaphor like if you are going to connect together to ideas that are spatially separated. Okay? So let's say I'm looking at a croissant at the grocery store. I'm looking at hot fudge and I'm looking at a croissant and I'm looking at hot fudge.

25:50

So now I'd like to enter link these two concepts that were spacially separated in the rendering stages at, which they were rendered in the fabric of my mind. So they were serious spatially separated. Then you're like okay well how do I take stuff that is rendered in spatially separated away and interlink them together.

26:12

Right. How do I? Yeah. How do I connect the the data of, you know, different like so like there's one thing. Like right now, we're seeing with deep learning, with volumetric understanding, volumetric representation that, or it's called 3D, semantics segmentation. When I know that all the pixels belong to a chip and all these pixels belong to a bag and all of these pixels belong to a box and all of these pixels was going to a price tag, it is, as this is three for $5, that's the club price.

27:00

Okay, I'm at the I'm at a grocery store and so we have to think about How the computer is doing now? It's saying, okay. Well, although everything like everything that comes in is it is a, how you see? We see you're seeing it one frame at a time, okay.

27:34

But then you able to connect multiple frames to together, like seeing something over time and in order to have like in order to gain like sort of a concept of of what those particles mean. So those particles could represent puffy smoke. They could represent water with particles. Represent represent liquid like syrup and are in a bottle and we need booked and you turn the bottle of syrup.

28:09

The particles of liquid syrup. They just move around inside the bottle. I just think of like half like Alex when you're like turning the bottle, right? But those particles like so your brain is it's like okay it's like your brain is able to reacting and extremely precise way to representing, what is around it based upon a deep analysis of the data coming through the internal signals, because it's like, it's like data is passing into and but you're it, but it thing assembled in a computational way which means you're only getting.

28:53

So, for example, you're only getting bits color of light of signals, but they're translated into into electric signals from right, almost right away. Like they the photons got to off your eyes and then electrical signals travel in forward, okay? So in almost immediately, like the computation is happening, right?

29:20

Computation has happened and what you're saying. Wish there's just like there's this conceptual awareness that's over and, and it's like how it's like, you know, I can learn one concept. Like, this is a tortilla. This is a tortilla in a bath. Okay. I can learn another concept and these are eggs, okay?

29:49

And there's a lot of information about eggs, all right, there's a lot of data to know about the properties of eggs. What they, what they, what are they where do they come from? How are they made with animals represents? That is the fact that they are from chickens. They're from an animal.

30:18

That's that's interesting. That's information. They're kind of round and you can, you're gonna hard boil them spherical. But you see there's a lot of like information concepts that have to be learned but they can range from like very simple. Like like this. Very simple concept is is you know like just mean if you're in the grocery store just lean towards any item on the show, okay?

30:49

And grab something. Like I just picked up a container and container has food in it, right? I'm glad it's very simple, but that's at the stage where deep learnings are with three semantics segmentation. Okay, the computer is saying that all these particles belong to the concept of a container and these part of the container.

31:23

But a fruit in it because it's what it's doing is saying that all this stuff that is Identified as being together. Like for example that the first food, there's writers first symbols on the top of this container I can see it's transparent so I can see the food. Okay, and this is 200 calories.

31:55

Actually I think like five minutes. I'm looking at southwestern seafoods southwestern style seafood salad. Okay. So, I think I might buy this food in 12 eggs. I,

32:26

My put the eggs back.

32:33

Some crapped it. This is 90 calories. I might know this perfect size That is just two in a calories per 1/2 cup of serving. So there's about three servings in it So it's actually this is actually 600 calories taking that's actually along.

32:57

This is a 250 calories but again that's actually 700. Yes, but that's boring and like I thought this was too many calories in a $600 and that's way less interesting. Hey, this true Amy like this. That's good. Crab closet. Two pieces is 70 calories?

33:46

This one has a per container 200 calories, all right? That is more alignment. What I'm interested in. So, let's spend 200 calories necessary.

34:06

And,

34:19

Sounds good to have like here, right? That sounds good. But then these end up being like, what 140 calories per tortilla, nothing just

34:36

All right, it's wild too. If there was an, if there was a
