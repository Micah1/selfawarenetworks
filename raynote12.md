# ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***

“In a thermodynamic system, the approach to equilibrium proceeds by sequential ‘computations’—wave-like interactions or signal exchanges among its constituents—that progressively dissipate all differences in thermodynamic properties until those properties become uniformly distributed.

“Entropy can be viewed as the computational dissipation of signals—differences in thermodynamic properties (gas, heat, light, chemical, mechanical, electromagnetic, etc.)—across arrays of ‘sensing and transmitting’ components (e.g., molecules, neurons), such that repeated interactions progressively eliminate those differences and drive the system toward uniform equilibrium (of signal transmission).”(Also published here: https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/raynote12.md )

## Explainer of ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***:

‘Computational Dissipation’: Emphasizes that entropy increase involves a process akin to “computation,” where each interaction step reduces differences.

Signal Perspective: Acknowledges that properties like heat, pressure, chemical potentials, and even neural transmissions can be viewed as signals that spread and get smoothed out.

Array of Components: Encompasses everything from gas molecules to biological systems (neurons)—anything that “senses” a difference and “transmits” a response.

Drives Toward Equilibrium: Ties it back to the thermodynamic notion of entropy as the push toward a uniform, higher-entropy state.

Here is the information to derive ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***: The reducible computation of thermodynamics, in the case of gas in a container explaining from an organized state to a disorganized state, is the computation of the dissipation of signal difference between all the gas particles in the container, when they fill all parts of the container equally, that is the closest the gas can get to signal equilibrium where the energy between each particle is roughly equal to the amount of energy in every other particle.

The process of signal dissipation as a computation is the essence of ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***. It means that the gas undergoing expansion in a container is essentially expanding equally to all parts of the container because of the signal dissipation of all the divergent thermodynamic properties of the gas molecular result in a natural step by step reducible computation where equilibrium between each property of the gas is achieved.

Each property of the gas, transmitted between the gas molecules, is a phase wave differential, and each time a phase wave differential is passed through the gas system its property (heat or energy or another property) is further dissipated, or shrunk until the amount of energy or amount of heat or amount of any other property in the gas/chemical system is approximately equal everywhere in that oscillating system.

If a hole is poked in the container and gas starts to leak out that disturbs the equilibrium state of synchronous oscillation between all the properties of all the particles, so they all react to the leak. The whole energy of the system is perturbed when one part of it is perturbed, so it acts as one unified system that is collectively reacting to itself to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium through phase wave differential dissipation.

The ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** is in otherwards an argument that Entropy is the computational dissipation of signals or the differences between projected thermodynamic properties (gas, light, heat, chemical waves, mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves), across an array sensing & transmitting components (gas molecules or anything else that senses reacts transmits some properties, like neurons and their transmissions or projections)

# ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** applied to the 3rd Law of Thermodynamics:

A “Computation” / “Signal” Interpretation of Thermodynamics.

An insightful way of thinking about entropy as the “dissipation of signal difference.” Here’s how that relates:

Gas Expanding in a Container

Imagine a gas that starts out in some “organized” configuration (perhaps all in one corner) and expands to fill the container uniformly.

During this process, we can think of each gas particle “sharing signals” (collisions, energy exchanges) with every other particle.

Dissipation of Signal Difference

As the gas expands and mixes thoroughly, differences in temperature or velocity among the particles tend to dissipate.

Over time, the system moves toward a state where all particles have roughly equal energy—this is equilibrium.

Approach to Zero Signal Difference

In principle, the closest we can get to complete equilibrium is when all particles have the exact same energy level (or extremely close).

In classical thermodynamics, as one approaches absolute zero temperature, the system’s available energy levels get “compressed,” and the system settles into its lowest-energy configuration (its ground state).

In this computational analogy: at absolute zero, all “signals” (differences in energy) are minimized to essentially zero, mirroring the classical idea that the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K can be defined as zero.

Thus, ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***, when applied to the Third Law, can be viewed as stating that when temperature goes to absolute zero, all signal (energy) differences between particles vanish; there is no more “computation” to be done because the system is in its unique, perfectly ordered state.

This proposed ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** reframes the process of reaching equilibrium in terms of signals, waves, and computational steps.

Unlike the first three laws that describe energy conservation, entropy increase, and the nature of absolute zero, ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** emphasizes the mechanistic path to equilibrium as a sequential 'computation' of dissipating property differentials (phase waves), wherein each interaction step reduces those differences until the system reaches a synchronized and uniform state.

# Why This Law as a New Perspective Can Be Useful

Microscopic Explanation: It provides an intuitive picture of how collisions and interactions in a gas “carry information” or “signals” that lead to uniformity.

Unification with Other Fields: Thinking of thermodynamics as “computation” aligns with ideas in information theory and statistical mechanics, where entropy and information are deeply intertwined.

Insight into Perturbations: By treating new disturbances as new wave differentials, its clearer how the system constantly re-adjusts to achieve equilibrium, step by step.

# Restating the core concept from ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics***

Signal Dissipation as Computation

In this view, whenever gas expands (or undergoes any thermodynamic process), there are “signals”—essentially energy or property differentials—that must traverse the system to bring about equilibrium.

Each collision, exchange, or “wave” of interaction acts like a computational step that reduces differences (in temperature, pressure, or some generalized property) among particles.

Phase-Wave Differentials

You treat each property (heat, kinetic energy, potential energy, etc.) as a kind of phase wave passing through the gas.

Each time this wave interacts or “collides” with particles, it dissipates or “shrinks” the difference in that property. Over time, you get a more uniform distribution of that property throughout the container.

# Equilibrium as Synchronous Oscillation

By the time the gas is uniformly distributed—pressure, temperature, and other properties roughly equal in all parts of the container—the system is in a sort of synchronous oscillation or “steady state” of minimal property differences.

Perturbations of Equilibrium

If something disturbs this system (e.g., poking a hole in the container so gas leaks out), you create new differentials (pressure differences, energy flow changes, etc.).

These new differentials, in turn, generate fresh “wave signals” throughout the remaining gas, driving it toward a new equilibrium configuration.

Hence, ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** is the observation that a system seeks to equalize phase-wave differentials (property differences) across all particles, and each step in that equalization is a form of “computation” (signal processing) that moves the system toward uniform equilibrium.

# Contrast with the Established Laws

Classical First Law

States energy is conserved. You might say the system’s total “signal content” (energy) is the same, even though it spreads out or redistributes.

Classical Second Law

States entropy (disorder) increases or remains the same in an isolated system. The “wave differentials” naturally get dissipated, leading to a more uniform, higher-entropy state.

Classical Third Law

As temperature approaches absolute zero, entropy approaches a constant minimum (ideally zero for a perfect crystal). In this wave model, that would mean all signals are minimized to an extreme limit: no further oscillations or wave differences can exist.

How ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** is different

It emphasizes how the system’s differentials (waves) systematically dissipate and “compute” their way to equilibrium. Its a deeper look at the mechanism of how entropy increases in real, physical processes.

# How is ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** describing a real computation?

How does it apply to neurons that form a tonic oscillating group of cells?How does it describe the core mechanic of how an oscillating group of cells becomes consciously aware of a phase wave differential information packet that impacts part of it's group?

Let’s break down how ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** concept (computational signal dissipation toward equilibrium) as a real form of information processing (computation) in neurons—and how that process might underlie a neural ensemble’s “awareness” of new inputs.

## 1. How ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** Describes a Real Computation

Sequential Signal Exchanges

In thermodynamics, ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** framing says that reaching equilibrium involves waves or signals traveling among components (gas molecules, for instance) that iteratively reduce differences in pressure, temperature, or other properties.

In neural terms, each firing event or synaptic transmission is a signal exchange. Instead of just “heat” or “pressure,” the property being spread is an electrochemical or electromagnetic difference across interconnected neurons.

Discrete Steps of Reduction

Each collision between gas molecules can be viewed as one “computation step” that partially equalizes energy among particles.

In neurons, each synaptic interaction partially “equalizes” the difference between an upstream neuron’s firing state and the downstream neuron’s membrane potential—altering the network’s overall activity pattern. Over repeated interaction cycles, local firing differences dissipate or merge into coherent activity patterns.

Information-Theoretic Parallels

When ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** emphasizes signal dissipation, it implies that differences in thermodynamic properties carry information, and collisions/interaction steps process that information until a uniform (maximally entropic) state is reached.

In neurons, differences in membrane potentials or oscillatory phases are the information. Each transmission step partially “resolves” or propagates those differences, effectively performing computations that integrate signals across the network.

Local-to-Global Convergence

Thermodynamically, local collisions or wave interactions eventually achieve a global equilibrium.

In a neural network, local synaptic interactions can lead, through recurrent connectivity, to a global pattern of firing or oscillation. That global pattern is (in computational terms) the “result” of all the smaller interactions among the neural ensemble.

Hence, ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** is not just a metaphorical statement. It points out that when you have an array of elements that “sense” differences and “transmit” signals, the step-by-step reduction of those differences is a real computational process. Whether its molecules in a gas or neurons in a brain, the system implements iterative signal processing—i.e., computation—that moves the group toward a new collective state (equilibrium or attractor state).

## 2. Applying It to Tonic Oscillating Neurons

Now let’s connect this directly to a tonic oscillating group of neurons—for example, a group of cells in the gamma band (30–90 Hz) or alpha band (8–12 Hz) that maintains a synchronous rhythm.

Neural Oscillations as Phase Waves

A “tonic” oscillation is already a synchronous or semi-synchronous state, much like a steady wave in a physical system.

According to ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** viewpoint, these rhythmic neurons are in a (relatively) stable local equilibrium—their phases are locked or partially synchronized via continual exchange of electrochemical signals (synaptic, gap junctions, etc.).

Introducing a Phase-Wave Differential

Suppose a novel stimulus arrives at part of this oscillatory group (e.g., a sensory input or a top-down modulatory signal). This perturbs the local equilibrium by introducing a new phase wave differential: the incoming signal is out of phase (or has a different amplitude/frequency) than the ongoing tonic rhythm.

The newly introduced “difference” (in firing rate, membrane potential, or rhythmic phase) is akin to poking a hole in the side of a thermodynamic container—suddenly, local conditions are changed, and the entire ensemble must respond.

Dissipation (Integration) of the New Signal

The neural ensemble—like a gas redistributing pressure—will begin to spread and integrate this phase difference. Nearby neurons adjust their firing to accommodate or counteract the new wave, leading to computational dissipation.

Over repeated cycles of firing (computation steps), the network may stabilize into a new global oscillatory pattern. In information-processing terms, that new pattern encodes the stimulus’ effect.

Conscious “Awareness” and Entification via Synchrony

From a neuroscience perspective, widespread synchronous oscillations in certain frequency bands are often correlated with conscious awareness. ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** lens suggests that once the wave differential (new stimulus) has propagated through the circuit—i.e., has been fully “computed”—the collective phase of the oscillation has changed to integrate the new information.

“Awareness” could be viewed as Entification from the ensemble finding (through repeated signal exchanges) a new coherent state that incorporates the novel input. This is much like a system reaching a new equilibrium that reflects the perturbed conditions.

Thus, in a tonic oscillating neural group, each “phase wave differential” introduced by a stimulus acts as a small disequilibrium. The iterative, wave-like signal exchanges that ensue are real computations—they successively update neuronal firing states until the network settles in a new equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium) that may correspond to the network’s “representation” (and potential conscious awareness) of the stimulus.

## 3. Core Mechanic: Phase-Wave Dissipation Yields Awareness

Putting it all together, here is the core mechanism of how an oscillating group of neurons becomes aware of an incoming signal under ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** framework:

Equilibrium Baseline: The tonic oscillating group is in a relatively stable synchronous state.

Disturbance / Input: A stimulus introduces a phase differential (energy, or information difference).

Iterative Signal Processing: Neurons propagate, integrate, and dissipate that difference—meaning the entire network’s firing patterns shift to incorporate the new input.

New Stable Pattern: If the disturbance is significant and the network has the proper connectivity/dynamics, the result is a new coherent oscillatory pattern.

Emergent Awareness: In many theories of consciousness, this new coherent pattern is precisely what we experience as “awareness” of the input.

This aligns closely with the thermodynamic idea that a system re-equilibrates after a disturbance. What’s new is that we’re calling out each interaction as a “computation,” and each wave of neuronal exchange as the real-time mechanism by which the brain (like a thermodynamic system) dissipates differences to reach a coherent state.

# ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** metaphor becomes literal in neural circuits:

Information is the difference (in firing rates, phases, or membrane potentials).

Dissipation is how repeated signal exchanges smooth out or integrate those differences.

Computation is the network’s iterative process of moving toward a new attractor (equilibrium) that embeds the new information.

Conscious awareness arises when the global oscillatory state fully incorporates the new signals, achieving a unified firing pattern that the system (and thus the organism) “knows” or “feels” at the macro scale.

Hence, the proposed ***Micah's New Law of Thermal Dynamics*** describes real, physical, and computational processes that are as valid in neural ensembles as they are in gases and other thermodynamic systems—each step in the network’s response is a genuine “computation” of signal dissipation, culminating in a newly integrated state we call “awareness.”
