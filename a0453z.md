How can we understand the human mind unless we have truly conquered it?

Micah Blumberg 
The metaphor of conquest really has nothing to do with the reality of what is going on in your mind. You might as well conquer the ocean while your at it.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
I hardly think conquest is a mere metaphor, Micah, to be isolated or compartmentalized as an isolated concept with no connection with the "reality" of what is going on in one's mind. If one were to conquer fear, for example, can one determine with certainty that the mind alone does it?

Ihapera Te Wake 
How do we know when we have truly conquered the mind?

Micah Blumberg 
Fear is a story like any belief, a sequence of tempo-spatial patterns that represents a remembered casual relationship now projected into the future as thought. The idea of conquering fear invokes the motor cortex and the amygdala together which has nothing to do with the eventual prescription. Teacher wants to help others conquer fear, but fear is a good emotion, with a positive intention. Teacher is spirit teaching spirit. Teacher is destructive by pushing change into minds she cannot understand. Change is not necessary. Learning about how change is done internally is useful. Conquering is the wrong metaphor for understanding the mind. We need not place new preferences into the minds of others. There is no need to conquer.

Ihapera Te Wake 
The mind takes in so much stimuli during one's waking hours and, depending on the individual, there may be a variety of factors that may act as stressors to one's ability to think clearly and logically. Calming the mind through yoga, meditation etc, could be a way of conquering or taming the mind to focus on what is happening in the moment.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
Ihapera, when you have fully conquered it, you have a deep inner satisfaction that you can by yourself cross all the hurdles life puts in front of you with an equanimity and inner recognition that is so powerful that you know exactly what you have do in life, and how to do it, and give your body, mind, heart and soul into doing it right to the very end--at all costs. You know who you are, why you are here, and what you have to do, to the best of your ability.

Samantha Atkins 
I mostly agree, Rimaa. And this side of fully conquering it I remember what my father said. "Choose and go for it 100%. If you are wrong you will figure it out. You will learn something and not spend so much time second guessing yourself in any case."

Samantha Atkins 
I don't think the conquering is actually necessary so much to deciding as it is to fully abiding by your decisions.

Ihapera Te Wake 
If something in the mind needs conquering, there must be a 'war' going on in there, then.

Ihapera Te Wake 
The 'war' could be doubts, fears, procrastinations, etc.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
Micah, your assertion that a teacher is destructive by pushing change into the minds of students she cannot understand is, I feel, based on your assumption that the individual cannot be influenced into changing himself/herself, as the brain does the work itself. At the same time, you describe fear as a "good emotion," and may I ask you how does the brain decide whether an emotion is ethically positive or negative? Which mechanism has been proven to decide this, if at all? If change is not necessary, why we do we see changes everywhere? If we do not have even the right or freedom to place new preferences into the minds of others, we can willingly live in a totalitarian state and imprison ourselves at home with computers, forgoing the role of education, the peer group, parents, and mentors. I can hardly acknowledge that with our level of human intelligence, we are static, changeless mammals moving around following the dictates of the all-superior brain machine. History was not changed with the machines of war (or with the mechanical machinations of the brain), but with the bloodshed of bodies and souls.

Micah replies: 
In reading your reply I realize you are arguing against a straw man, you are assuming that I am taking a position I am not taking. Perhaps you are familiar with the book called "the brain that changes itself" author Norman Doidge? I believe we must change, we are always changing, and each person is planning developing and growing their next actions, next thoughts and next reactions from the present and past actions, thoughts, and results of their own movements, the movements of others, and the causes of motion in the world. I believe there is no better guide to one's best next action than one's own self. Provided one is no longer a child.

Micah replies: 
Our neurons collect data systematically, democratically, when the evidence is accumulating in a clear direction they surge forth with energy, this is how the brain chooses what is moral.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"Which mechanism has been proven to decide this, if at all?"

Micah replies: If you want to go deeper into this topic review the work of Michael Shadlen http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/michael-n-shadlen

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"If change is not necessary, why we do we see changes everywhere?"

Micah replies: 
Change is inevitable. (that's why it's not necessary)

Micah replies: 
You invoke fears of a totalitarian state, and individual complacency as the driver you are moving away from. This kind of teaching is of Shiva nature.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"I can hardly acknowledge that with our level of human intelligence, we are static, changeless mammals moving around following the dictates of the all-superior brain machine."

Micah replies: 
It doesn't matter what you can acknowledge or not really since both this idea and its most obvious alternative are stories from beginning to end. Two different perspectives, and no right perspectives.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"History was not changed with the machines of war (or with the mechanical machinations of the brain), but with the bloodshed of bodies and souls."

Micah replies: 
Teacher is of Shiva nature, destroyer.

1. There is no empirical proof as of yet in neuroscience that the brain is capable of changing itself.

2. There is no empirical proof as of yet in neuroscience that the neurons of the brain use energy to make moral decisions--if there were evidence, we would be able to predict crimes Before they were committed.

3. By admitting that change is inevitable, you are contradicting your own assertion that change is not necessary, which you previously explicitly asserted. I asserted change is evident.

4. Kindly do not introduce religion into a predominantly scientific group by mentioning the name of Gods in arguments, as one cannot combine science with theology empirically--this is precisely why physics and philosophy have been isolated for so long, almost a century now. If you are that narrow-minded and conservative enough to feel a teacher is "destructive" to inculcate change in her/his students, you are equally capable of thinking that any kind of freedom is a threat to the passive individual who functions like a puppet in the hands of an omnipotent being. 

5. Since you are incapable of presenting a sound argument, you dump the blame on others, by claiming they are writing "stories," whereas in reality, your own suffocatingly dogmatic beliefs are perfect examples of fanciful illusions which have no relation to logical scientific analysis. Agreed we have different perspectives, but yours is not by any means the right one, that is for the audience or participants to judge, not yourself. 

6. In all wars, the destroyers were the men who created the war, not the innocent citizens who were sacrificed at its horrific altar, thus, as a pacifist, I am no "destroyer," but a supporter of human lives. And a repeated warning: kindly do not mention God's names here again, in allegorical comparison. 

Conclusively, it would behoove you to acknowledge that a bad carpenter always blames his tools--like you have clearly done, on account of your having a very weak argument indeed, pure hypothesis, without any supporting empirical evidence at all. Your enclosure, by the way, uses the word "'investigates" and for all the assumptions you presumptuously make, this word needs of necessity to be replaced by "proves." Thanks.

Micah replies: 
I never removed my comments. It only seemed that way because I temporarily blocked you and left the group. I was so offended by your reply. You have made several incorrect assumptions about my position, you've mis-characterized my statements, you've misunderstood somethings, you've made some irrelevant points, you don't know your place when you warn me not to use the names of deity, and you don't know your self. I'm was actually shocked by the viciousness of your rebuttal which feels like a character attack. It feels like trolling. However I'm not one to run away from an argument. I do like a difficult argument. I appreciate you for being so difficult, honestly, that's not sarcasm, it's genuine.  So here I am, arguing again. Hopefully we can clear up some misconception huh?

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"1. There is no empirical proof as of yet in neuroscience that the brain is capable of changing itself."

Micah replies: 
I don't agree. There are over 40 years of studies under the umbrella topic of neuroplasticity, via EEG, fmri, implanted electrodes, and other brain scanning technology. Not to mention studies in psychology, neuropsychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. My presumption is that perhaps you haven't taken your study very far in this direction. The brain is changing, and if it isn't changing itself then what do you think is changing it? I hope your answer is not a religious/spiritual answer, not after your (second to last) scathing comment.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "neurons of the brain use energy to make moral decisions"

Micah replies: 
That isn't what I said, and it's more complicated than what I said. Please consider reading a book called: The Neural Basis of Free Will: Criterial Causation. Also having the evidence that proves how neurons make decisions does not automatically give us the ability to predict crimes before they are committed. You seem to rule out the element of chance. There are odds involved that prevent us from predicting the weather two weeks out, and there are odds involved that prevent us from predicting what people will choose. The scale of the odds is perhaps too great to overcome with any current technology/tool.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "3. By admitting that change is inevitable, you are contradicting your own assertion that change is not necessary, which you previously explicitly asserted. I asserted change is evident."

Micah replies: 
This is like a word game, except with phrases, that teacher plays. Allow me to rephrase so you understand. I mean change isn't necessary to push on anyone, because change is inevitable anyways, it's the path of evolution.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "4. Kindly do not introduce religion into a predominantly scientific group"

Micah Blumberg 
Micah replies: You introduced religion in the original post, in the picture, in the quote, look where it's referenced from. Okay so if you don't want to talk about religion, don't mention it in the first place.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "If you are that narrow-minded and conservative enough to feel a teacher is "destructive" to inculcate change in her/his students"

Micah replies: 
Well the trivia is that I can be narrowly focused sometimes, but I'm also probably a lot more liberally minded from your future point of view, than you have presently estimated based on your experience communicating with me so far.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "you are equally capable of thinking that any kind of freedom is a threat to the passive individual who functions like a puppet in the hands of an omnipotent being."

Micah replies: 
That's an absurdly mistaken characterization of my argument. Your projecting on me from your past experiences arguing with others because you have so little information about me and my position. Your rushing to judge because you don't have enough information yet to make any judgment. Your so demanding it's childlike, and you don't have enough patience to sift via conversation for elaborations and clarifications before you rush to judge, accuse, and offend.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta 
says: "5. Since you are incapable of presenting a sound argument"

Micah replies: 
God damn it that's so offensive.  (That's why I love it.  )

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: "you dump the blame on others"

Micah replies: 
I haven't blamed anything or anyone (yet). Thank you for sharing your delusion.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"you dump the blame on others by claiming they are writing stories"

Micah replies: 
Wrong. We are all writing stories, that's not blaming, it's a fact. A sequence of neural expectations is a belief a sequence of beliefs is a story, have your read "On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins", or perhaps "How to create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil"?

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"whereas in reality, your own suffocatingly dogmatic beliefs are perfect examples of fanciful illusions"

Micah replies: 
These are your delusional projections from your subconscious developed from your life experiences. Your trolling at this point. You realize that right?

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"which have no relation to logical scientific analysis."

Micah replies: 
Sigh, God, your mean, really, sooooo mean. lol

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"Agreed we have different perspectives, but yours is not by any means the right one, that is for the audience or participants to judge, not yourself."

Micah replies: 
Whatever your agreeing to it has nothing to do with what I said.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"6. In all wars, the destroyers were the men who created the war, not the innocent citizens who were sacrificed at its horrific altar, thus, as a pacifist, I am no "destroyer," but a supporter of human lives. And a repeated warning:"

Micah replies: 
Why is a pacifist giving me a warning? Oh because you have disowned part of your self. Know thyself. There is much violence in words and ideas.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"kindly do not mention God's names here again, in allegorical comparison."

Micah replies: 
I do have a few more things to say about the destroyer nature. We all have it. We are all Shiva. If you deny that you are "destroyer" then you deny the truth, because we are all that. There is disowned "destroyer" and that's when people deny it, and because they deny it's disowned, unconscious, and immature. When you own that you are "destroyer" then it becomes conscious, and mature. Stop denying it and accept that teacher has destroyer nature. It's not your place to tell me what to say or do. Teacher is destroyer. She needs to know that because it's disowned.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says: 
"Conclusively, it would behoove you to acknowledge that a bad carpenter always blames his tools--like you have clearly done"

Micah replies: 
Thanks for sharing your delusion. We are all delusional. The nature of thought, movement, and words is all delusional. Every message has holes, every impulse is wrong from at least one perspective. I haven't blamed anything, nothing. That's your thinking project onto the external that you have disowned, so you hate it in others, because you think that blaming is a socially unacceptable behavior that makes you unworthy of love and acceptance. What you need to do is accept it in yourself, forgive it, forgive yourself for blaming external things, and then realize you are still worthy of love and acceptance.

Rimaa Vsbhatia Meta says:

Micah replies: 
It's not my job to do all your research for you, I don't provide empirical proof every time I make a statement. Why don't you google scholar some of what I said so you can read a lot of things before you just ignorantly claim that there is no evidence and no empirical data to support anything I have said. You haven't found it so your just assuming it doesn't exist, but your not even old enough to have investigated everything and you never will be, there's too much information. All I gave you was a lead, so you can investigate for yourself, if you want to find out more. I haven't done your research for you because that's your job not mine. Don't blame me for it.
