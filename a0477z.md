(category, theory, vector semantic)
Regarding Artificial Intuition by Monica Anderson, and Grok by Numenta: Is a semantic token the meaning of a word?

Is a semantic token a map of vectors between points above a certain threshold in various nodes?

Is a semantic token like a matrix, that can be understood as a spatial metaphor, or a description in category theory that defines or remembers a relationship between vectors that emerge in space?

Is model free intelligence about creating a model based on whatever emerges beyond the thresholds that filter significant patterns from noise?
I'm getting a new sense of the inner geometry of my mind.
and the geometry of my thoughts

See this video http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-fetal-neural-vision.html this does not look like single character bits fed one at a time triggering points converted into vector mapped based memories. it looks like a morphing vector pattern being going through several stages of memory reduction in the architecture. Essentially because the burst runs out of steam, and then it leaves its vector mapped imprint. A spatial representation imprinted in the fired connections.

I hope replies reflect the subject of this group: Categories & Geometry of the Mind. Do you think meaning for intelligent beings may imply an unconscious topographical map of nodes that are themselves semantic tokens reflecting maps between points of above threshold data associations in a multi level pattern learning machine?

Burst of fetal neural activity necessary for vision

(Medical Xpress)—A sudden and mysterious burst of activity originating in the retina of a developing fetus spurs brain connections that are essential to development of finely-tuned sight, Yale researchers report in the journal Nature. Interference with this spontaneous wave of activity could play .....

Micah Blumberg Just imagine that when you see something, this is happening in your brain. Imagine that your having waves of sight pass through your brain tissue. Flowing in almost like water with special properties

It's not like feeding binary bits into a learning machine one at a time, it's like pouring in a data stream, words, pictures, bits, all jumbled together, and letting the structure sort it all out.

Micah Blumberg The question I would have for Monica, and or Jeff Hawkins, would be, can you visualize the activity in your computer based connectome with graphics so that the activity looks like this. Would the activity look like this at all? Perhaps your visualized connectome would not have brainwaves?

Micah Blumberg Do your semantic tokens (vector maps of associations) really come from emergent patterns that are imprints in the memory created by synthesized brainwaves?

Micah Blumberg I like how in AN model, intuition is the emergent result from points plotted in a vector tree map that you can describe in category theory (the vector tree map not the emergent patterns). I think she describes it in C and or Java, but I think C and Java lack the fluidity that could happen in a functional language like Haskell. Where node memories can create vector memories and The model free nature means that the concept is the memory of the tree's reaction in a sense. With Haskell and an 80 core processor one could have each node in the tree creating emergent vector maps with the other activated nodes independent of a centralized process.

I like how in AN Model, the "concept" isn't pre-thought and pre-programmed, it's learned or built by the vector tree's memory system in response to the stream of data. 

Also in Haskel you could have the eighty core processor calculate each section of a massive category theory defined mind map representing a neocortical column completely out of order and still return the right result.
