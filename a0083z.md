What does the Neurofeedback Salon experience entail?

There is an down session (Inhibit) and an up session (Excite) and they are 35 minutes each. The short term effects are pleasant and can last up to a week, and I hope you will notice feeling extra good the next day at least. The long term effects after several sessions include brain optimization, more ability to focus, relax, greater creativity and problem solving, it equivalent in power to the kind of equipment other offices are using to treat autism, addiction, attention deficit disorder, post traumatic stress syndrome. This technology (Neurofeedback) is also used for athletic performance, top students, top marksmen, the executives of big corporations, and pro golfers are using neurofeedback technology to optimize their minds and mind-body states to get ahead doing what they do.

My Salon includes brainwave entrainment that is aligned with your brainwaves so you get a smooth stimulating surreal profound experience. While there are other types of sessions as well, the two I mentioned are inspired by the Len Ochs Protocol that he began having great success with in 1992 using equipment that then cost half a million dollars, and the other sessions are similarly backed up by credible research that will be listed on my website soon. While the equipment I use is commercial and medical grade, the cost is in the thousand of dollars, but it is actually a serious upgrade and improvement over what used to cost half a million dollars.

When you enter the Neurofeedback Salon you can take a seat. I will show you the equipment, the neurofeedback piece itself is a black, plastic, with fourteen sensors, and it sits on your head to scan for your electromagnetic brainwave patterns which are then transmitted to the computer wirelessly. The next pieces are the blue or white goggles, blue is less intense, but if you want the full benefit of the experience I recommend the goggles that blink white light reflecting your brainwaves combined with the entrainment signal. The blue goggles are less intense but technically they can create just as powerful as a session because more of the receptors in the human eye are able to capture blue light than any other kind of light in the spectrum. You can also view the goggles in a closed eye experience where I can cover the outside with special easy to remove goggle tape. The goggles are normally see through goggles so you can put them on, and put on the headset, and you will get a fresh pair of clean silicon earbuds which we will put on high quality headphones while you are there.

Next up I will show you the graphs that chart your brainwaves, giving you that additional feedback helps create useful associations inside the mind between regions. Then we check to see that all the sensors are lighting up green, and the I press start, and while you sit back and watch the screen I am also watching the screen to make sure the session is going correctly. After 35 minutes we start the second half of the program. 35 minutes later you are ready to take off the equipment.

At that point I encourage people to just sit quietly for up to fifteen minutes just to allow themselves to absorb the experience. I can email the graph of your session along with an electronic bill that you can pay with your online bank, or google checkout, or paypal, or any credit card.
 
Other types of Neurofeedback
Neurofeedback sessions come in two varieties.
1. The first type are those that you train your mind with to manipulate objects on the screen using your brainwaves, which involve decoding brainwaves and translating them into software movement according the rigid structure of programmed controls. The limitations of current software technology in translating your brainwaves into onscreen movement means that there is a sharp learning curve for most people. Sensors have to be aligned just right for ideal conditions, and if you have a bigger, smaller, or rather different brain its going to be harder to work with the rigid predefined software controls. Many people get frustrated with that type.

2. The second type of Neurofeedback experience (used as part of the Neo Mind Cycle Experience) is sending the brainwave patterns back to you after being converted to light and sound. It doesn't have to be translated by rigid software because its being sent back to you, to be decoded by your brain. Effectively we are creating a feedback loop from senses to brainwaves, to machine, to senses again, back into brainwaves, back into machine, on and on. This feedback loop is like expanded self awareness, its really cool!

3. I am hopeful that a new kind of predictive intelligent software from Numenta will be far more useful for decoding brainwaves and translating them into onscreen movement. While I have the ability to do both the first and second type of Neurofeedback experience in my Salon I am going to wait until software tech improves before employing the first method in the salon.

As you may know your neocortex when unfolded is like a large dinner napkin or a table placemat six layers deep, and the wiring is simply three dimensions, up, down, left, right, back, front, its not a mess, its not spagetti, its not chaos, but the problem with eeg signals is we need powerful chips to decode the geometry because that placemat is all squished up and wrinkled inside the tiny human skull. We also need to separate the eeg signal from ecg interference (your heart beat) and other sounds that your body makes that you don't usually hear, but for some reason are really loud when trying to measure brainwaves.

The result is that this high tech mirror on your brain, while being the best technology we have is still somewhat of a lower resolution camera (the leading rival fmri is also kind of a lower resolution camera, it measures bloodflow instead of brainwaves) and yet a slightly lower resolution camera is still great to use if nothing better exists yet. One day perhaps we will be able to give "the new ipad" resolution class Neurofeedback, but the technology we have today is still powerful, useful, a worthwhile tool to become aware of one's own brainwaves EVEN if its a low resolution look at one's own brainwaves.


Please keep a journal about your expectations and your results week in and week out. After the session do not turn of the headset. First we can discuss your brainwave patterns on the screen. We can also email you a graph of your brainwaves during the session. So you can compare it with future sessions.
