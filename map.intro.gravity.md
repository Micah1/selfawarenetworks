New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

Each map page is a time-stamped copy of a wikipage. The wiki pages ought to be time stamped but I have not yet discovered where it can be shown.

Gravity Map - A map to all the notes that mention Gravity.

[a0033z.md Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/76a5ab76ce79ed797fa5ebb0818e84f76900dd80/a0033z.md)

[a0113z.md Gravity is not electrical force, its a time wave in the electrical force that is the inverse of mass](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0113z.md)

[a0018z I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/9e9299b9894d0d1c4c289f883113cd16adcbab96/a0018z.md)

[a0070z Einstein's Gravitational Redshift](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0070z.md)

[a0397z Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0397z.md)

There could be another 70+ notes to reference here.
