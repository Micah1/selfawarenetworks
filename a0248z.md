self aware networks image, it could be like 3 pyramidal cells on top of 3 cortical columns interlinked representing the ability of large groups of neurons to take turns collaborating in musical

You need to be able to model any kind of signal that can excite or inhibit neural and glial activity

Special attention paid to major network junctions, pyramidal cells, large slow oscillators and fast small oscillators
