I was talking about the different kinds of signals that braincells detect, consider (consideration is a physical process determined by synaptic connections, sensitivity, and thresholds set by the cell or by nearby cells or by the oscillating network of cells in that nuclei cluster and it relates to sensitivity and thresholds varying by numbers of receptors, the state of the cell, other thresholds such as the quantity of ions inside or outside the dendrite, the cells charge displacement etc), and transmit, that includes chemical waves (phase changes), mechanical waves (phase changes), electric waves (phase changes), magnetic waves (phase changes)

So they're also chemical waves. And these are different from acoustic waves or mechanical waves.
