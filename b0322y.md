b0322y ctp&utg (audio) Simulation with Sky Nelson-Isaacs

00:00
We can meet so with nerds so an early you know we're talking about decoding potentially listening to your thoughts decoding neuro circuits decoding individual neuron activity, then trying to figure out you know, what what is the code for short-term visual information audio information short-term touch information and and looking for comparing, you know, looking for neuro correlates to between these low-level neuroscircuits and things that are happening in the world outside a person so you should be doing like a patio you're doing like a pattern matching between.

00:35
What a person how persons interacting in the world what they're looking at what they're touching what they're thinking about and you're in your your matching that to the the the neuro circuit activity inside their brain with an early link that you can't you can't measure this activity with with something that's like with with this like eCog or or EEG or MRI or or you just not you're just not close enough to to the to the neuron to neuron or the neuro circus to to measure their into individual firing fast enough at a high enough bandwidth.

01:10
And not even you can't even do this with DBS there's no other thing else that can can give you this capability but even then it it's just like, you know, it's. There, you know take if you compare ten thousand a nodes to the eighty six billion neurons huh in your brain, it's still it's all it's still a tall like if we're able to just decode like a small amount of the of the brain in terms of like, you know, reading some of your thoughts in our thoughts that that would just be profound and in changing changing the world and changing science and it would in that be bigger than stepping on the moon right, but but still it's it's still like, Um, you know, this is the this is the research will go on for for more than a hundred years in terms of you know, advancing to the point when we can do fantastic things like.02:05
brain Computer interface, so what nearly group actually managed to do was miniaturize their device so much so that they can localize their their implants on a particular part of the brain the other one is they're able to use you know, like some kind of a threading machine or like, That that's actually uses some kind of imaging to avoid the blood the blood vessels so the traditional method was that you have certain kind of arrays.

03:19
I think one of the most common one is called the Utah array it's like a hundred by hundred electrode that's actually jabbed into the brain so you would caught you would have the associated like some of these associated problems like for example having the brain. But what the neuralink does is that you're able to map out where the brain at least what the vessels are so they can implant their electrodes in a more careful manner and if you look at their electro design, they're actually designed to certain situate that they can minimize impedance so that's one of the bigger issues one of your design electrodes so if you minimize those I don't know if if there is anybody that has worked on neuroscience that you use these very fine fibers called tetrahodes and they have excellent resolution when it comes to decoding the single neuron input.

04:15
But the problem is that there there are very fine so that you have large impedance that would cause some kind of error correction and your classification algorithm so they use this bead like structure in the electrodes so that they can minimize impedance on a micro column level so I guess like the sampling rate is also unique.

04:38
I think like they sample at a high rate which means that they take more neurons to more neuron inputs to give you a clue like neurons would actually fire in about two to five. Milliseconds so the example at about like 14 times that of that of a single neuron fire so that will give you a clue that they're they're kind of like over sampling but it's it's fine because they're they're to process the whole data on board so they can do classification on the device itself instead of it, you know, the device transferring stated to a computer and do the classification over there the yeah, so these are some of the things that did stand out to me when they demonstrated the neural link and When they first talked about it, I'm really happy to see like where this thing goes but I think that will have wider importance and brain machine interface, especially in people with that have disabilities.

06:00
From from the local environment or like the constellation of neurons where it's implanted it's also stimulating at a certain rate so this kind of interaction might create. Certain kind of brain functionality that we're not aware but be sure that someone thinks that it's end up doing best on our website.

06:48
I just love to sort of post the question is that because the product isn't developing or moving forward or could it be because of culture or could it be because people are branching off to do their own things because they're excited about the progress it's just really, you know, it's sad being to hear and see so many new jobs being posted in so many of the key staff leaving what does that mean for the future of these developments and you know, Other steps really moving forward it's hard to kind of learn about the heart, you know, it's also me the ethical considerations the singing people sometimes because they don't like what they are seeing happening.

07:24
groundbreaking scientific research so if you have you know, substantial amount of staff that's that's that's kind of a point at like a custom to doing a research on a very prolonged basis like you know, if you're doing your graduate study through PhD or postdoc that you will take substantial time and doing research and publishing papers that if you're if you're Constrained with time I guess that that would create some kind of stress but that's that's my speculation.

09:30
Wow neural link we've discussed whether we are our own agents simulating our own existence here in this world or if there is a creator aspect that is. In charge or an alien species that is more intelligent than us so we've been talking about three hours. I think we've covered a lot but yeah anybody else have any comments the floor is okay, comment.

10:05
I put together an article in 2012 that tends to combine the holographic universe which you guys were here you eluding to when you talk about simulation it's basically it's cooperated by the holographic universe theory.

13:31
And some combined the holographic universe theory in addition to quantum mechanics in addition to we're taking a look at the brain and consciousness so I think I think you know, I think all four of them could indeed be related there's a lot of scientific work being done. 


That our consciousness is a consciousness is like in some sort of some of what the occasion records you've got ever heard together her education records before. It's basically this this field where where we tap into for a to retrieve information from and and and to also upload information to almost like a cloud of.

 I think the holographic universe theory seems to verify. That you guys could be onto something because it pixelated pixelization on your computer screen basically the same thing as assimilation each each and every pixel contains a small portion of the hole that you can take a single pixel you can duplicate the hole so so if the universe that we live in the reality that we live in is projection, then that pretty much says okay, it's the same thing that the projection that we're living in comes from somewhere else and each and every constituent part can be actually used to get get an idea what the hole would look like so each and every pick.

15:15
S on your computer screen each and every portion of our reality is a projection from somewhere else and the question becomes where is that somewhere else but yeah a lot of scientists have taken a look at the smallest of a tonic. Molecules in second space in between which means there is probably something that needs to be feeling that space which one more likely is information consisting of.

15:52
Reality so Monty that reminds me this discussion has come up a couple times on Clubhouse and. Opened a weather the universe is basically a giant computation unless a couple times it seems to come up on every single one of these talks. But one thought I had was. I think when people think of a multiverse I most people imagine this.

16:21
Undifferentiated foam of nearly identical universes such that you know, here we are in our universe and there's one universe over where everything is identical, except one little Adam was slightly moved out of place and just goes on infinite directions in every direction. And I think that's a pretty ludicrous way of looking at it.

16:43
I think that a better way of looking at it is if you imagine. The an organisms on our planet. And all the objects you have organisms that are. You know, purely evolved and you have artificial organisms cybernetic organisms, you know, you have machinery. And I wonder if the multiverse is much more differentiated than we give a credit for.

17:13
So I just have there may be some universes that are intentionally creative things what the intention is. I don't know but they're created to perform some sort of a purpose and there might be others that evolved from other universes. And everything in between they're you know, entirely likely be a spectrum.

17:37
I don't think we know yet which one of those our universe is but I'm just saying I think it pays to start thinking about. Rather than the multiverse being some sort of a. Foam, I guess. Think of it more like the cellular structure and organism are we that you know, are we the mitochondrion are we the cell wall you know, what are we what is the greater structure?

18:04
I have no clue but if we think in terms of a structure in this universe is some part of that structure that might go a long way to explain. What what this place is. Something I do like the the clarify for people when people bring up the multiverse or at least from the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that's not that new worlds are popping up all the time with with brand new degrees of freedom like the total number of degrees of freedom is fixed, it's just you this it's super position so the you can kind of think of the higher the higher order reality instead of being spacetime isn't helping space on but the number of degrees of freedom and I always spaces is always fixed the the degrees of freedom is never expanding and as you move forward.

18:53
How do we how do you define those degrees of freedom? To actually make a measurement of clearly distinguishing all those degrees of freedom.

19:13
I mean, we can talk about particles, but you know. It comes difficult to finding. Particles when things become entangled if you're talking about universal wave function or something like that, okay, you you you are saying is that the particles have rules is not like. Yeah, there is like, no.

19:42
Anything goes over there is that feel different over there, but they are just to certain rules and those rules are that are inside the freedom that you're referring to is like that yeah everything the university the quantum simulation. I mean, there's there exists the helper space which which has some degrees of freedom from there, that's the some some estate is to define this like a vector and that over space and then you have some sort of interactions.

20:17
That generate and transformations. But then that that space so. Moving forward in time interactions describe, you know, how this states of the universe transform with each. Passage of time. I mean, you can also talk about time being an emerging property to things can get quite complicated when you're saying that how does space time emerge from a more abstract?

20:50
Abstract degrees of freedom.

21:02
To respond to what Monty I think such as think about. Shelter X experiments. I found shelled like always a very interesting fellow not quite of the idea of the morphogenetic fields. I don't know what they are and many of the things that he describes to them for instance the regenerative abilities of organisms where basically cells to know which place they can go to have other explanations that are more possible or they formation of eyes and so on remember having read his book seven experiments that would change the world and one of these experiments he describes.

21:44
The possibility that for instance patrons could find the place where they're supposed to go without having a map even when this place is. On wheels and is moved and so he set out to perform the same experiment and then over a long period he basically tried to break pigeons and make experiments with them, but they always pay out because something happened to the pigeons and honestly describes these experiments and this particular part never worked.

22:16
I read about the dog, it was a single experiment that the dog that I'm aware of and it data were collected based on particular dog owner who claimed that her dog was able to sense advance. And she was coming somebody did as a data and analysis and claimed that they could show that this was the statistically significant and they could show that 80% of the cases the top was responding and this particular way and that they made controlled experiments were the time was varying the vehicle was varied and so on and then there's another people written by another auto who looked at the data that they collected and found the businesses don't and out so this that this experiment itself was not valid and you can.

23:06
Find this on the internet, the author is our resonance where he discusses this second pet and it seems to be that this is it's a sound discussion of the whole thing. I find occurrences of claim telepathy very interesting. I think we should pay great attention to them because if one of them turns out to be true, we have to rewrite large parts of physics, which I consider to be a good thing right would created tremendous advance in the sciences if you could find that there are.

23:41
Different ways to exchange information over distances and the known ones and it just seems to be that all the cases that I've looked in so far but yes statistical analysis and independent reports didn't really depend out but who knows maybe we find something maybe there are things which are under reported and so on so but I find this exciting and very enlightening for the structure of the universe like to remain skeptical at this point.

24:14
You. Go ahead. Daniel is that so far you haven't seen any. Study that definitely confirms the something like telepathy the singer you are still open to to to find that but so far you haven't find something that we can not contest you have any daughter evidence in my own life about telepathy that I don't know and which way this is statistically difficult because all the other times when the telepathy didn't work.

24:52
I didn't take a note right so I don't know whether I can explain this was random events that then the signs appear to be extremely significant. And then there's another thing I typically did not perform a controlled experiment where I took notes before and double-blind things, so I don't move it to which degree I edited my own memories.

25:15
I agree I have similar experiences to that and also some premonition but yeah, I totally agree with with the other but conditions that are not perfect and yeah, thank you.

25:35
So I did want to talk about the precognition and to love that they I myself have had. Many instances where there is no explanation, but what it does come in as is a. Almost a picture of an unknowing that comes from somewhere else that proves to be true so how can you scientifically study that it's it's kind of hard because you would have to have a condition right so there would be it you brought somebody in and you were able to pick up on names or situations from their past and in knowing that you should not know.

26:20
That is not consistent. I mean, it does happen but it's not something that's so consistent that it can be scientifically proven and. You know cognitive bias comes in as well where you can read body language where you're going to get a lot of people that claim to have that ability to not so it's a tricky subject but I I think that there are some people that have that ability but they're just really not going to come forward and talk about it because expect that telepathy while you are looking at the person is possible probably possible but when you get older we are able to infer.

27:07
What goes on in the mind of a person and that's because they think that can happen and they any given context in the mind of a person or someone limited and they're better be able to make models of things the more we can never this down and so we are in a very receptive state we can probably entangle ourselves with the states of another person sufficiently well to limit the so far down that we can often get the thoughts of another person, right?

27:38
It's just the curious thing would be what happens if this other person is at a distance and not in the same room. So you know, the thing on telepathy is. There's a number. There's a lot of things going on here. And one of them is. I I certainly am a believer in the concept of it and the idea that information can be exchanged for mechanisms we have in discovered yet.

28:05
I would say whatever those make us mechanisms are it's almost inevitable there will be other mechanisms that we discussed concerning how little we know about the universe. So if they're not sure. I mean, he knows if you have to stand up button. Their actions right to many decimal places.

28:24
Discovering a new kind of exchange of information that doesn't show on the lab and doesn't break known physics is going to be hard we cannot just say there's so it's sold as we know about the universe this doesn't work, you know so much about the universe already. Hi I would like to maybe I have a chance to to speak and and and sort of maybe I I want to throw a cold water on the idea, but but dude and being but make actually a good argument and so so my argument is that so so just to relate I I've had a lot of experiences too.

29:04
I want I once had the intuition that my grandmother was was dying and and she died. And that was a very um, that was a very powerful like, you know, sort of it felt like a very psychic premonition right but but I but so but the height and and and of course I've you know, I've had the you know, sort of like these any anyway so guys, so go back to anyway, so let me try to explain what I think that I think it could be happening is so you can have a situation.

29:35
I guess somebody brought up that there was a the guy with the Joker image he was he was he's bringing up the idea that a dog could be. Could know when when you're gonna come home that they could sort of like into it you're you're you're mind but but what if you're what what if a what if a dog so so so the idea is like if you come home it at five o'clock every day a dog could remember that and and expect you to come home with five five o'clock every day and if the dog is paying attention to your nonverbal behavior and if you if you're nonverbal behavior is somehow communicating without your awareness that you're you're gonna come home earlier, you're just you're you're setting your intention maybe even below your own conscious awareness, you're gonna come.

30:19
Home earlier than five and the dogs expectation changes and if if you know you're gonna come home later and that changes your behavior and such a subtle way that a dog can pick it up then dog will expect you later than five and and so so I would just say instead of like imagining that that there's something telepathy going on, so maybe whether there was a there was a message exchange at some point the set a long-term expectation and this is sort of like the idea that our brains are prediction making machines in the in that there's predictive coding which is a framework there's there's um the idea is here, so here we can all have a Sort of agreement conscious or unconscious that we're gonna we're gonna meet again at and and the the meeting will have certain tones and certain certain vibrations and if for some reason our.

31:11
The you know the this it doesn't it doesn't match our expectations, it will know something is is different something is off and so so maybe we so maybe I expected that eventually my grand my grandmother would pass away and and and maybe the the sign maybe the sort of like the the signs of of her passing would would like like worse were were it's it's like, you know, maybe I'm just sort of like paying attention to something at an unconscious level and my brain is making up a prediction based upon okay, if I hear a certain news if I certain events happen.

31:47
And then then my brain is gonna you know reach the tipping point where where that prediction sort of appears and I'm not maybe necessarily gonna have a conscious understanding of what of how my brain came to that conclusion because it was a bunch of low-level below conscious calculations that sort of like led me to what what I experienced as an intuitive or psychic prediction of of an event that happened and maybe in the case of like, you know, if you're if your friend suddenly needs you and and you realize it before they call you like you're thinking of your friend and then and then they call well, I mean, Maybe it has to do with with sort of like a temp temporal expectations that you made with your your friend and an unconscious love what some prior time and and and maybe the the the the different aspects of your environment you interact with are informative enough that they can communicate stuff about other people at a sort of like at a really coarse grained but extremely abstract and low level way that's just like not enough information to be clear enough for or but it's still there's like a trans and normal transmission of Of information from from point A to point B that's not that doesn't involve anything magical or anything unexplainable and and I think this I think to even to go to the steps to of saying well this has to be beyond science and beyond testability that that's just it's hand wavy that's that's a woo and I I won't accept that anything is beyond the reach of scientific explanation personally, but nothing to be on the reason assigned, okay explanation.

33:25
In the absolute many things are beyond the reach of a scientific explanation. At our current level. I mean, we can't even cure cancer we can't even get to Mars in a reasonable amount of time we so to have the hope that we can explain. You know, even the assistant phenomena are is that we've been looked after a year on covert yeah right like that's exactly the case if we're so backwards in his way.

33:56
If it's pretty hubris to think oh, you know anything we can't test now is this bogus so. Well where I do things interestingly on the psychic thing, that's so necessary man, by the way. I didn't make that argument. I don't think. But what you just say was the way you worded it said I don't accept anything.

34:20
I was having matter so the fact that matter is that. A lot of things are getting conflated into what's called ESPN your sidekick or telepathy. That they're probably on many different explanations like I don't know but anyone here but I've had a lot of experience where I can predict what songs on the radio.

34:39
I'll have them come to me. I'll turn the radio on and they'll be playing that song. I don't think that's magic. I think for instance our brains can probably pick up radio frequencies, it's on the electromagnetic spectrum, we're probably picking that up so that could well be. Like we could be receiving low-level electromagnetic signals in our nervous system somehow and that probably explains a lot of the the permissions we have but that's worth considering.

35:09
Another explanation maybe the one thing and the fact that it is so difficult to achieve would make it very random and difficult to invoke I mean to. By all really. Make sure you happens, maybe just happens from time to time people apply. I think most of the cases we are weird for sharing.

35:36
I know that they want to guys may have something to say about. What what specifically referring to?

35:48
The possibility of that to brains are able to and to go to to to relate to each other at some point and the fact that want to contentment is very hard to achieve in the lab the whole imitation of quantum computer right now, so we may be able to.

36:12
To make no it's not something we are able to make happen maybe that just happened under serve the certain conditions randomly or not that randomly but. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:32
Hard for me to first. And tangence chemical tricky to talk about and that aspect because you have to talk about what if you're talking about kind of is there anything between my brain and your brain. Yes, I got that makeup thing and the cell phone conditions that we cannot control in one case.

37:01
I can say almost absolutely yes just the fact that like you're gonna create entangment by any particles and it's interacting with each other but if we're talking about just my brain your brain, we're washing out the rest of the universe right and then then at any type of connection that's gonna be exponentially suppressed.

37:20
Given that many other factors is as you'll be like very careful about how you're framed that question. Yeah, but you agree that that may happen sometimes and we don't have much control on that it would be I mean, we know that want to end that way is is not easy to to make it happen we know for sure that so far so maybe difficult maybe is something kind of rare that where we are and that makes playing why this experiences are kind of random and not under or willingness to make that happen.

38:08
I mean, yeah, it's. I would have those connections form in the first place if the universe as a whole is determines, then thank you that there's no randomness there, but if I'm you can always have kind of. From from global determiners and you can have local randomness. Yeah again, it depends on how your person that question.

38:36
Has anyone are the where would go take a little left turn here, but the John Hopkins they do a lot of research was so simon and a lot of the the patients the trials, they all have very similar experiences. And I just wanted to throw that in there if that's it's a little difficult to explain why all these patients have such similar experiences.

39:08
I don't know if that's related to. Maybe the telepathy route that you were going with in the the conversation with Nathan would eat what can you describe what do you mean by they all have the same expo what what are the typical experiences that they that you're noticing? Well, you know, John Hopkins the patients were describing their experiences as if it was more more real than life and they were describing meeting these nothing neither and at what was what kind of patients with it.

39:51
You you have to excuse me. I'm not too familiar with the research but but you know, I just you know, just wanted to bring that through that wrench in there to you guys.

40:06
Everyone has probably some anecdotal support of telepathy or other examples and whether you and it's to what Joseph was saying before was you know, but when that's looked at scientifically, you can't you can't isolate it to the point that you can you can it. He can't find irrational explanation I have twins who were separated from each other one was with me and one was with their mother and they were there were somewhat distant from each other and one of them got encephalitis and the other one immediately knew that her twin sister was was ill and they were both three years old and we have no reason to understand how that transmission of information happened, but you can't start typically exclude that that there was some something else about that situation which triggered the the other twin and I think everyone has These examples but now and I'm still like Yoshia that there is a scientific explanation that lets us rewrite certain rules and understandings and after like three or four days they were we broke them home we put them in the same group and they started rotating at exactly the same plate so so they moved when they were in the same grief for I know a couple of hours with the hours exactly as the same rate so so they started with the head let's say, One thing's out and they little by little stereotating and they ended up with the head pointing north without I mean there was sleeping so so I I wanted to respond to both with David and Daniel were saying in that that and also to what Jay said so so so the first thing was was the radio rating the idea of radio waves interacting with the brain, you know, our brain waves emit emit waves, of course, but the we're talking 10 to 100 cycles per second and with.

42:11
The radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second it's not not close to the same frequency of what our what our brain is is detecting and and and and also like if you don't have a decoder then then that information means nothing it's like the it's like the the it's like the bumps on a CD CD on a record or the or the dots on a CD ROM, if you put your if you look at the dots on the CD ROM, it doesn't look like music to you if you pay your hand on our record, you don't hear.

42:46
From music it's just so you can have the radio waves enter your brain it doesn't mean you understand the the signals from the radio and and and your brain is certainly not not not tuned to to that a frequency and but but but but but anyway going back to what would David and and, You know in Daniel we're saying that the there there there is and I was trying to explain this earlier there is a very simple explanation and the explanation is that is that human beings can record patterns or rhythms you can remember a rhythm you can remember a rhythm that can be an expectation or a future prediction of when you're going to receive the a certain like a rhythm to be like well when does the the next node in the song happen and if that note doesn't come then you then you think all the well, there's something wrong with?

43:41
The. Long and so that by so in that sense and a grand and a grand way when you're paying attention to maybe like the rhythm of of of the wellness of your family that said an unconscious level that a parent is is a transmitting and as soon as that rhythm of wellness stops there might be some some sort of intuition that is transmitted to something that the the rhythm of wellness and everything being fine with your with your with with your sibling is is is an immediate is something that is immediately, you know, the the the organis.

44:17
M and the child is suddenly aware that something is not quite right because because that the the note didn't sound quite right and so maybe there's a very intuitive way that the brain is predicting is high level patterns we're paying attention to the the rhythms of the family or the or or or other nonverbal clues that that are supporting a prediction that is just very explainable yeah, what about babies that you know, when we call them start?

44:52
Turning at the same pace in the same end up in the same direction, so yeah that's again an example of of two or more people learning the same rhythm learning the same expectation and then their behavior matching the same sort of rhythmic pattern which is what you saw when they're facing the same direction but episode so my combined question is is that quantum entanglement, you know is that is there something going on that we don't understand well, obviously nobody has the answers and physics completely but we can all have theories.

45:27
So I think what I'm curious about personally is if somebody has an ability that's a psychic ability or a telepathy or knowing something that they should should not know you know, and in these things happen in the like a skip in time where you can see forward, maybe a day or two.

45:51
And that's repetitive and somebody's life. I mean is there something in science that we need to understand what had at work maybe so if you heard Carl Sagan's flatland, have you watched his little flatland video? I have. So the whole idea is that if you take a person who's a creature at a being that's two dimensional that lives on a plane.

46:17
If a three-dimensional being like yourself where to push that two-dimensional being out of the plane. Into the world of three dimensions, maybe able to look down on their former home two-dimensional plane and they could actually see like. You know, this map-like view of their world that they didn't even make was physically possible and would completely change their outlook what's the fact of matter is it's entirely possible that you're getting information from the fourth dimension of time, well we perceive this time.

46:49
Means we don't yet understand. So if you have information that can see through barriers, whether barriers of time or space. That you're gonna interpret that as a psychic or magic her ESPN is ESPN a sense but again it's all working within the laws of physics rather than some of the extra physical metaphysical.

47:12
I really I really love what you're saying Jay and I'd love to to respond I think that yeah, so what you what you framed in terms of like the if you're a one-dimensional character and and you you can't understand that the third dimension or something so every how the story goes but you just explained it very well.

47:30
Yeah, that's a good idea. So the fourth for the fourth dimension of time is, It exactly where I'm talking about what that organisms can learn rhythm patterns because the rhythm pattern is the fourth dimensional construct, right? You're making a prediction of the future based upon a learned rhythm that that your brain has encoded and then sort of multiplied it multiplied in order to predict future sample patterns.

47:55
A mistake on day on the flatland proposal in the sense that the 2D being cannot see 3D even if we leave that out of it to dimension what it will see is. Multiple to dimensions one after the other kind of a security experience doesn't it a lot of different kind of related but kind of superpose one after the other because there the senses the that this this being has are only for two dimensions not for three so no matter if you leave that it will only see to the I guess at the same time having with us.

48:39
That's right, we, That's great. It's actually not true It's surprisingly so basically your true flat blender would have a one dimensional retina right so it's basically it's a line on which it would scan the world and now if you lift it up, then this line would basically skin the universe similar way as a sensor in the camera would that leads out in the world line by line, right?

49:07
So if you adjust if you know how you're moving that line you can set put the lines together and understand what you're looking at what kind of structure you're looking at but of course. It's a requirement is that the computational structure behind us is able to discover this regularity correctly it returns out that our own brain can see import damage much more capacity that it has not obvious enough brain why not so maybe it's brain has only evolved through a certain capacity it is not author but imagine you have a very very smart plan that or one that is in the same niche as assets, so it's basically generally intelligent.

49:53
Brain that you can give it a principle. And now you visit access to data with a new structure. It's just the structure that we find in the data of the exhaustively we don't see anything in 40 because there are no particles that transmit information that are travelling in 40.

50:10
So they can sense. So if they take the 2D flatlanders brain can understand an unlimited number of 2D spaces, then then if you look at the basically the projection slice theorem or fourier projection slice theorem with that with it says is that a slice of of, A 2D slice of a 3D image represents the sort of mid intersection of that image and if you couldn't get a slice from it from multiple different perspectives around that image you can reconstruct a 3D object.

50:39
And so if a 2D flatlander could see the the object in 2D for multiple slices, it could reconstruct the 3D image with perfect accuracy. Yeah, that's how we do it doesn't seem to be not really 3D and operating composition 3D but we have a much more complex plane much more capacity.

51:03
Than being full half and that's for an economy of. Resources. I think we don't see the whole spectrum of light because what we see is enough for us we don't smell everything that there is because we but we as men and adult dogs we have we we can handle the world.

51:26
So so we go by what is more efficient. Okay at 3 being maybe able to experience as he will done usually that if we he does an extraordinary effort and has bring up some kind of brain augmentation in the same way that I think. To a degree we can experience higher dimensions already but they don't make much sense we don't have the the brain capacity the processing capacity to handle it all at once.

51:58
Okay, so it makes it sound it makes sense but we don't have the resources. Okay. Daniel could it could it be an anomaly though. Like could it be like you said, It's um, maybe a small percentage of people are able to do that. I I yes those who have more capacity better but even though I think.

52:27
Let's say let's talk in invite so I'm guessing a bites for for today and for for 3322 for actually the next thing you'll be 128 some may have been able to overclock the 32 but isn't over 12. The thing is not the real thing. Okay I just want to say that I don't know any neuroscientists in the world that's going to just describe the the the process of vision as as you know, to to these slices is it, you know part of a four-year transform that's not the current widely accepted.

53:08
I understand how vision works and and neither are the limitations you're suggesting and in terms of human cognition and this is not from what I what I've heard of from neuroscience, but I want to I wanted to also before you jumped in Daniel. I wanted to finish what I was saying about the about what Amy was saying about The quantum entanglement and and I prefer like David bombs he had this great hypothesis that that when you had an entanglement basically that atoms that one exactly one possibility is you could have a particles that that collided at some point and then they just sort of ricocheted off of each other in in a sort of symmetrical or an asymmetrical way a little bit basically they like wherever they collided and entangled they they.

54:04
They're passed from then onward we're sort of like reflecting that that point at which they connected and so you could read basically one of the particles and that would tell you the basically the the orientation and and and or other other information facts about the other particle because they basically had you you had but it wasn't it wasn't basically information being sent from one particle to another it was basically like an initial condition that both particles set together when they were together and then so that when they're apart you can.

54:39
Figure out what the initial condition was by reading one particle and that would tell you what it was true about the other particle. So there's different from the idea of like the teleportation of information. Yeah, but these people that the people who can only see with one guy, they cannot see that they kind of see today they don't see three girls, they don't see much space.

55:04
So it is actually possible to perceive space with one eye to image procedure to understand 3d with one eye. It's it's um, it's a little bit more more difficult actually. I in fact, I sort of lost my my death perception in one of my eyes. It's just the the my eyes super blurry, but I still I still I I still can't like if I put on my glasses like things seem more 3d but with with even with one eye closed, I can still understand the world in 3DS.

55:39
Still perceive the world in 3d and and and and I think that if you if you're if you dial down and into what the eye is I is not like a single camera it's not it's like there's millions of sensors in your eyes, so it is plausible that your eye couldn't it could by itself in for 3d objects it's between you know, the leftmost sensors in the rightmost scent the sensors just not as wide a range of depth perception as is two eyes would be.

56:07
Yes, he's no play the same and probably he's mostly because you already experienced what I missions, so so you bring knows about it it would be maybe the different if you were born with just one eye but the composition of death is made by the interaction of both eyes, you know brain that's the point not it's not exclusively the you know, yeah, not exclusively.

56:44
And as if I'm gonna turn on the raising hands, so if anybody is in the audience who wants to come up feel free. We haven't heard from Chris. And Kami welcome to the stage. I I'm. Are we leaving in a simulation so I had a question about that since I joined the state recently and it's not related to the recent thread.

57:13
It is is a can we go back to the topic or statistic to the image no thank you so I just had a quick question and I saw Jeffrey flashes Mike and I talk a couple days ago where no ball and some other people were talking about quantum computing and and Jeffrey actually got on stage and talked a little bit about quantum computing and the question came up are relating in a simulation and one of the rebuttals to to the idea that we are is that the computer?

57:47
To create the simulation would have to be as big or larger than the universe and I was just wondering if. We posit that that only the observable only the human observations of the universe are ever simulated at any given time so that then and actually have the like exist only observations of it would that make.

58:14
Chris so every question I put some thought into this actually because the funny thing is I think ever since I was about seven. I wanted are we living in a simulation but I was looking at it in the bad way like with the whole brain in the jar of things to me is kind of a crank theory and only in more recent years have I realized there's another alternative explanation that could basically allow for the entire university to be simulated in full and it's because we're not if we're going to simulation it's not a simulation on our own plane.

58:48
But think of it this way. Let's take you. Read a book like a fiction book. And it's a really good book it's engrossing. So you start getting absorbed into the therapy you start identifying with them you start to forget the world around you. In a sense you're generating a consciousness.

59:13
It's a sort of an artificial consciousness being placed into these characters the characters. Are capable of sustaining the consciousness by virtue that they have information. They're made of information. They're complex enough for you to be interested. And you can fill in the gaps and you can. Basically create this.

59:33
Soul if you want to call it that. With your brain. So if that's the case, if your brain is capable of generating consciousness, even if it's a weaker consciousness than your own. It's entirely possible and I would say likely that there's a being that's infinitely more powerful. Than we are more complex, maybe composed of more than three dimensions.

01:00:00
And it's effectively imagining us. So we're real on the sense that we're matter we're physical we exist. But there's something that exists outside the universe that is.

01:00:15
Injecting itself into us per se we we've as our you know, our human brains generate more than enough information for this higher level of intelligence. To see itself through our eyes the universe object would be experiencing itself hardly an idea. And, Therefore when it's personal when it does it opens up this the doors possibly that it's not just things of brains that have caught they could be silicone organisms, it could be networks of trees, it could be maybe a colony of ants but the idea is that.

01:00:51
By virtue of generating information. We receive consciousness. So the thing that's. Preceded the universe isn't a computer in the sense that we have computers but rather it's a computer on the level of a universe and it's contained in a much larger multiverse which to be inhabitants of that multiversity is the universe.

01:01:12
Does that make sense? You mentioned yeah somewhat you mentioned something about if you're reading a book. It's like another consciousness is kind of injected or beside your brain, right? And that but I was wondering like isn't what happens in that mute consciousness like that story that's happening in your brain just the product of visit goal atoms and, Particles that are composing the brain and that conscious new conscious thing is like an emergent kind of quality that's just based on the atoms in the brain like it's not something that exists outside the universe, right?

01:01:57
It's something that like you could imagine simulate actually creating a computer that matches the brain atoms that the intelligence is the mind you're talking to mind the thoughts the emotions all of that's happening in terms of you know, electromagnetic pulse. But the subjective experience of those electromagnetic pulses, that is your brain.

01:02:19
That's what I'm talking about. So, I think Christopher you were getting it more like the then we've made this distinction earlier between the. Brain and the vet type of simulation which was active feet feedback simulation were you your continued your brain has some sort of agency and then the environment is kind of like the matrix types emulation or it has to be kind of an active feedback between your what what the simulations feeding into your brain and what you put your.

01:02:57
Brain decides with actions you're making on the environment so this is the constant feedback custom type simulation is some initial state in the universe some degrees of freedom interaction between those degrees of freedom you can just hit the go button and let everything.

01:03:27
So there I mean. I think we also touch this a little bit earlier is I'm in from the perception of a human being how cow complex with the simulation need to be let's say like. For the legislative laws of physics to be consistent as we know them today. So I brief abroad the question of.

01:04:02
You at an upper bound on that simulation that is prefer the laws of physics as we know them so we can consistent for the rest of my life would be need at least the to include the degrees of freedom that would be contained in the light cone of where where I am right now.

01:04:25
And then weather whether that can be compressed down or how much that can be compressed depends upon the. The levels of measurements. I'm able to make in the universe to distinguish whether the laws of physics are behaving correctly. So if you put I think if you put.

01:04:50
Restrictions on what what measurements about the world. I'm able to make that that may give you a limit to how how well I can compress that simulation. If you allow me, you know, arbitrary precision arbitrary measurements to make to verify the laws of physics as we know them then I believe you may need to include at least every degree of freedom within my layout.

01:05:19
Therefore, you would need a. Computer that was the size of the universe so at least this size able to compute the light cone. That is my night naive interpretation. So okay, my assumptions that the computer that would generate the universe is. The containing multiverse So the universe itself is a computation of a higher containing universe which you can call the multiverse the multiverse could be potentially a product of an even higher university called a hybrid which it just seemed just to just declare for you but for one thing when you're referring to the multi-verse can you distinguish whether you're you're saying like from the many worlds interpretation or just like there are many universes out there and we just yeah in the way I see it.

01:06:12
I don't know who's theory like who's official hearing this most neatly slides into. But okay the way I see it every system of every level of let's put this. Of organization of a subdivision. Is there's one level of a hierarchy that's basically infinite in both directions. So, you know where the organism we're composed of cells the cells are composed of molecules and molecules of atoms atoms of electrons and subatomic particles and those are composite quarks and so on till you get down to plank particles or whatever the or called, But as far as I'm concerned, that's our limitation that it only goes that far that you could theoretically.

01:06:58
Break that level down further and further and further so that we being at the level of matter that we are aren't capable of perceiving that and if it goes in infinitely downward. I think it goes infinitely upwards such that here's our universe the universe itself is like an atom in a molecule that there's other.

01:07:17
Out of other universes in its local group. And then that little group. Is it's differentiated against an undifferentiated foam, but. Totally different looking universes elsewhere that behaved with totally different sense of physics and they have different purposes. So this the structure of the multiverse composed of many universes could look like the structure of an organism in which.

01:07:44
You have these differentiate component parts that aren't evenly distributed in some sort of matrix but. No form structures with different purposes different consistencies and textures. That's that's my definition. Yeah, can I explain why it's it's obvious that a computer doesn't need to be bigger than the universe to simulate the universe.

01:08:11
Okay, so so I mean if you look at basically it at video games today, they contain you know, Julia plays a lot of video games and I was just reminded of one that Julia was playing that you you either your character walks through these vast worlds that if you if you were in virtual reality, the the amount of of landscape is is experientially it's it's vastly bigger than your in your computer and and and there's one game in particular that I try to bring.

01:08:46
Your. Earlier no man's skywish is extremely vast in terms of the you know, the the amount of universe it has imagined but that's just it's it's it's it and and I am not making the argument that our universe is similar to no man's sky. I'm making the point that that there could be some sort of procedural that the there could be something that is you know, you know in terms of like you could have a computer the size of a laptop that has some sort of program that will that will generate the sort of.

01:09:21
Virtually generate the the experience of physics and the experience of atoms and experience of density but but do it all with in an in a sort of in a in a lower dimension or or encoded in such a way that's very compressed and it could fit in the computer the size of a laptop but it could represent the total amount of data that that we experienced as a cosmos and in perhaps much more there's no reason why the computer has to be bigger than a laptop.

01:09:56
Saying it depends on what what measurements. I'm able to make of the universe because if I'm able to make it. Any abstract, you know, if I have access to particle accelerators or whatever like in the top level and physics equipment if you put certain bounds in the precision of the measurements.

01:10:19
I'm able to make of the universe and that I think the compression bounds change for me to be able to distinguish you know, what let's simulated versus reality. That's an interesting idea. I think what I interpret you saying is like let's say the measurements that we can make of the universe have kind of a rough resolution like they're not super granular then that is in effect like a compression of the of the universe and you only need to simulate up to the level of resolution you can observe or measure right exactly.

01:10:56
Well that's fascinating and and interestingly you you kind of only need to render enough of the resolution of the universe and all of its modalities for the observer to have the experience that the universe is is there.

01:11:17
Consider. I'm just gonna say one thing this gives me confidence that hey maybe it is possible to simulate the universe given some assumptions with the computer and I could ask many follow up questions about this but I don't want to interrupt the the vibe that was currently going on in the room and also Connie might have a question but thank you all so much.

01:11:39
Yeah like that it's probably much easier to it if if you're not trying to look like you know to measure with whether. The world is being consistent with the physics or not if you you're just going about your normal day like that it's probably a much easier comparator you'll easier compression than if you're actively trying to verify whether the velocity physics are being consistent in your reality, so a vector probably goes back tomorrow if we know what your conscious state is and then, Whether you're actively trying to distinguish them too right exactly yeah, cool.

01:12:18
If you're the only conscious being cruise then the computer the computer's got to do is simulate the inputs for you. Sorry kid and that's like the solop system what's called solipsism or something where like a the idea that I'm the only one that exists and everything else doesn't really exist that's the simplest simulation of all I guess.

01:12:43
Yeah. Brandon the vet. Right? Has the discussion has it already been discussed whether.

01:12:59
If it were if we were living a simulation whether. The simulator was. Computing or quantum computing just curious if that anyone had discussed that I think it would have to be quantum. And as a corollary with this. Computing mechanism actually happens to be made a mechanical could it not be made of a different sub?

01:13:31
Um, I mean, I I brought up an example earlier just a random idea that I heard that that it's something something could be represented in two dimensions on the surface of a black hole and in three dimensions of this at the same time. That was just there's just one one example of how you could have you could have you know, I observer could explain something in in three dimensions, but someone else could could see that observer in two dimensions and and when I began to create web application well VR applications with web XR and air and air applications as well.

01:14:12
I a sort of like it it. Brought home the idea for me that my my two dimensional code was also manifesting as is as a three dimensional four dimensional experience at the same the same time. I don't I think I may have straight from your question a little bit and lost it so if you want to rephrase it you can.

01:14:38
Have has there been a discussion in the room about if we were limited we were living in a simulation was the simulator. John classical computing or quantum computing and then corollary to that is. Is and if you were living in simulating the simulation and it was computing. Has a better than the discussion whether that computing mechanism was of a different substrate, for example organic or different type of.

01:15:22
Clinical substance if you will. So to your black whole question, which I I find pretty interesting because you you had said see into the in the black hole, can you just explain what you mean by see? I meant that the the experience of entering a black hole for you or me the the personal one-to-one experience is is different from someone else's observation of of what's happening to us when we enter a black hole.

01:15:55
So someone else would see the spaghettification. Well, hang on. That thought.

01:16:11
And the fact that if I understand if I understand it's gravity such a weak force. In general because it doesn't have opposing force. So just trying to understand. If you're saying that that would have been influence.

01:16:34
So are you trying to clarify what's spaghettification means like what exactly that term is supposed to mean?

01:16:44
Oh, no. I was trying to understand Mike as analogy because at those enormously interesting but the part I didn't understand is to see. So are you talking about this and the scientific observer? The people I'm just trying to understand. Mike is analogy with the black hole bit better and just understand why it was a black hole example, is there any time with reputational force or something else?

01:17:17
There there is but I mean it's also about it's it's a gravitational force and in terms of you know, but also it's it ties into like general relativity how if you you're you're perspective is you're moving through space is going to be different from someone else's perspective and so so while someone else would perceive you my perceive you being basically yeah spaghettifying your experience this and I was while I while I paused I was actually trying to find the article that I read this from but um, maybe is what would happen if you found.

01:17:52
Two. Call from astronomy.com. Eventually you're going to be pulled apart by gravity right but they were just saying that you know, as you enter the horizon you are not going to like initially notice that your that you entered the the horizon of the black hole from your own perspective we because of the, I'm not I just like I read this and so I'm just actually ever this like years ago and so I'm sort of trying to find the the exact reference is sort of an answer question and maybe I can get I get get back to you.

01:18:32
I mean just do this screenshot of your. Address do you have any any insight into the black tools?

01:18:44
Being cured this idea that this is something I came to be mentioned and collapsed that we make 3 deal for legal apps into the into the I don't know much about it by first. I find it because of that they're going to interesting maybe somebody can talk about that.

01:19:07
Sorry Jeffrey but for that Daniel we're we're not a question reference to me or or not. He was to come here and Mika or we're talking about the how from some perspective is 3d and another three and something related to a black holes, yeah was a intersecting that with the idea of dimensionality collapse.

01:19:38
Well now I'm gonna have to read that because that is so interesting.

01:19:46
Sorry, sorry, you can go ahead Josh. I just meant before that Jeffrey. I thought that you had asked something about black holes before that. Oh I was that I'm not sure what your your background is like because I don't do any work really unpluggables if you just weren't saying so the black holes and anything that's context sure um, so cami about the whole like black hole thing so like because of the way that black holes were spacetime.

01:20:19
As you get closer to it and you there's an observer that stands far away from it that observer will essentially watch your infinite descent into a black hole because you'll never be able to actually observe you cross the event horizon but as you're falling to the black hole it will essentially take seconds for you to but more than seconds like a microseconds to to observe with actually happening to you but the the actual process of spaghettiification which is like this term that consists use to describe like what would happen if any.

01:20:55
Enter a king cos the black hole is that because of black hole warp space-time differently a different points what would essentially happen to your body is that it would get pulled they would get stretched, you know, some arbitrarily length long like imagine three miles long but it would be thinner than like a piece of paper or something like that and and the reason that this is happening is because, Gravity is acting differently at different points on your body, so you would experience completely different gravitational pulls and completely different micro densities at your body so but but the observer would not would not necessarily see this because you observing you in one particular inertial frame of reference as you're falling infinitely a closer towards the adventurizing without actually reaching it.

01:21:44
Well, that's a great explanation, thank you. Josh. And Jeffrey.

01:21:54
Oh that was all Josh there.

01:22:05
Okay, I thought I found I think I found what what I was thinking about earlier so there's this um article you can look up called black holes or like a hologram and this was a June 5th 2020 and so it this is a theory of relativity describes black holes as being spherical some smooth and simple and quantum theory describes the men's being extremely complex and full of information and new research proposes surprising solution to this duality.

01:22:34
And so the idea is so research scientists and Italy were saying that black hopes to be like a hologram all the information is amassed in a two-dimensional surface able to reproduce a three-dimensional image in this way cosmic bodies. Well, so it's um, They they are so basically the black hole could be like a heart sort of like a hard drive that that stores a representation of a three-dimensional reality in in two dimensions and and or at least or perhaps even just the you know, in in in codes a representation of that reality.

01:23:21
And but anyway, if you want to look up the whole paper, it's just just type in black holes are like a hologram and the article is data gene fifth. 2020.

01:23:38
Because the, That would kind of go online towards a. I wouldn't say supporting the simulation but just adds more entry intriguing thoughts to that so I love that thank you is dependent on string theory being the fundamental kind of model. Of theoretical physics because holography as a mathematical model or a whole logger fee as a principal only really comes out if string theory is true or not, but a holography has been a way of us we stop.

01:24:23
Ped thinking assuming that things were holograms, but most of those assumptions come from you know, that string theory is truly the the theory of everything. The unifies all the forces. Thank you so much for that Josh because that is a big gotcha. Actually led to my second. Which was.

01:24:46
We are all talking 2d 3d. But depending on. Which theoreticals is experienced subscribe to are we limiting this question to three dimensions only?

01:25:06
So in terms of dimensionality and physics but we tend to see is that regardless of how many dimensions you you're starting with but you know, there there are types of string theories where you have, you know, eating dimensional or eleven dimensional symmetry m theory, which is probably like the most popular version of this is based on eleven dimensional super gravity, but what tends to happen is that you know, these dimensions are really tiny and they tend to fold up so you iterate to.

01:25:35
Eventually on a macro scale what you have is four dimensions regardless of how many dimensions you start out with the only existing theory. I know of which there is fundamentally more, you know, theoretical representation of space time that that doesn't fold up that actually is more fundamental than before dimensions that we see is actually Eric Weinstein's newly released paper which posits that right now hang on that that cash cuz I was just about to mention when you mentioned that it tends to go.

01:26:10
Fold in the facto become poor dimensions it actually that geometric unity. Eric Weinstein's theory actually popped into my head saying aha interesting wonder if there's a connection so what a coincidence he was actually in the room earlier. I sent him an invite but he didn't come. Yeah, I I.

01:26:36
Have a question. Yeah so Eric's theory is really interesting because it actually doesn't pause it that dimensions fold up so I bet I found like I got a a copy of this working paper and I've kind of been working through it to try to understand his theory it's it's complicated through the website yes geometric unity.org yep, okay, thanks yeah, so it's available there but Eric's theory is really interesting because what essentially says that space time is not fundamental, it's actually a projection map of this 14 dimensional space where all these other different field theories are.

01:27:13
And that actions within those spaces project down to a four-dimensional space where gravity is a constant. So Eric's theory is actually the only here I know those so far which argues that spacetime is not a fundamental but rather a projection of a higher dimensional space. So, you know it Eric's theory right now is a work very much a work in progress.

01:27:35
There's a lot of formalization to be desired. In his theory, but it's it's it's certainly very intriguing best case scenario for Eric's theory in my mind is that he's going to fundamentally revolutionize the way that we think of. But geometry and higher dimensional spaces in fundamental and and theoretical physics that then we've ever done before.

01:27:56
It's certainly an intriguing promise or other theories that space-time being metric being emergent from one mechanics space-time as a series of spin networks, but generally what happens is that the same metric pops out the same. Metric that we used it to to to measure the to measure, you know the regular kind of time arrow and the the orthogonal like imaginary time arrow those same metrics generally pop out.

01:28:35
There are different types. I mean, if you if you consider like, you know, something like, you know, like a solid state model of the universe then sure you know, obviously like emergence based on as a result of that but as far as I'm aware the geometry of those theories have not really been worked has not really been worked out as well as ever experienced it does so I don't.

01:28:58
Just fairly know if I would put most of those theories on the same level. Do you really have something against something that comes after want to mechanics that comprehends more Donald was referring to something like that when he was discussing the collapse of time and the space last Sunday.

01:29:19
So I I would very much take a Donald Hoffman's area of space-time not being a fundamental with a grain of salt, so I've read his paper on it and I'll just put it this way. It's one thing when about medical physicists can prove using higher dimensional geometric spaces. That you know projection that spacetime is a projection It's another thing when a neuroscientist uses only like three pages of math and a markov chain that you know that that you know that that space time is not a fundamental so I would take his his theory with with a very large brain assault.

01:29:56
I don't necessarily think that you have to believe that spacetime or the fundamental but if Eric's theory is is more formalized and is you know, it is subjected to a lot of rigor and has been passes through the peer review process then we actually would have a a aetherium contention.

01:30:12
Against. String area and group quantum gravity that space time is not fundamental but I very much wary. Don Huffman's theories about space-time and physics. I do not think he I think he waxed the proper mathematical background and rigor in order to back up his theory. What about his mention of an another friend will be young when to mechanics to do we have to behave that?

01:30:38
I'm not sure what he means by that so he in his kind of paper about this complicated theory of perception, he basically argues that like the uses a bit of circular logic here and argues that any sort of understanding about space-time and quantum mechanics has to come from outside space time, but then within his own paper he makes an argument using barcode chains and like dynamical systems which are very much dependent on space-time and like the notion of time.

01:31:09
So, I I get like is arguments is not quite. Clearly considered. I I'm very wary of this argument. Yeah, but it's also I mean, there was something to put something already. Can you? Here is also. Best thing misinterpreting. Some of Nina's theories from what I can tell you is there are consistent with quantum mechanics and the opposite during its toxic.

01:31:46
I mean, it's hard to to. To understand and space is possible that that's something that can be fitting inside the quantum framework. That's it dependent on your interpretation of quantum mechanics, yes. That's very very interesting. I mean so I mean there are two kind of like the majority of the people working in theoretical physical and Jeffrey you here I would love for you to chime in this as well.

01:32:24
I don't know what the the the quantum like information or computational you guys are using the coconut interpretation because it would be somewhat useless for you guys to use an ever interpretation of quantum mechanics, but generally, they're kind of too interpretation of quantum mechanics are in contention here. One of which is the Copenhagen which is that when you observe some sort of quantum mechanical wave what you're actually doing.

01:32:49
Here is taking an observation of it and then sampling it from a certain distribution and plus you only see, you know a certain, you know position of that wave at that certain within a certain probability space versus the everussion interpretation which says that there's no such thing as a wave function collapse where you're actually seeing is one type of you know reality whereas in in another world whereas in another universe the the same action has occurred but at different outcomes when you when you when you observe that sampling.

01:33:23
So it's, Certainly pumped. Possible for you know for you to have you know away function collapses or they're not to be away function collapse but um, it's dependent on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that you're operating off of but for for most purposes most researchers in theory and I assume an experiment as well.

01:33:43
I mean, I do a fair amount of experimental physics as well and there it would be very useless for us to use the other Russian interpretation or the many worlds interpretation as it's kind of known but it's a the coconut interpretation is kind of ruled supreme for the longest time and that when that is, To depend on a probabilistic way function that is dependent on collapse when you observe it comment what well we use use the Copenhagen interpretation like we say we measure the system and things like that.

01:34:13
I would say most climate information there is don't actually believe and like objective collapse theories like we don't believe that there's you know, none linearities that are happening, you know, if you ask the clone information there is what happens during a measurement this is like, oh you're here in tangling your system with.

01:34:34
The environment and then you're you're you're throwing away those those degrees of freedom and just looking at the system are just focusing on the system which I guess you can call that like the decoherence program but at in my mind that this generally pretty compatible with the advertarian interpretation.

01:34:52
Interesting. I was not aware of that but are you guys think are you guys viewing it from a perspective of like purely on a mechanics or or like a like a information theory? I guess they're more information. I wouldn't say everyone's thinking about like the the philosophical interpretations of what's being talked about but I mean generally everything I mean, if you look at what's going on during a measurement right you have some apparatus is being entangled but the system is trying to measure measure and that that apparatus is also being exposed to a larger environment so you I mean, you can look at.

01:35:38
Xerox quantum quantum. Darwinism the emergence of like the pointer states and things like that so tries to derive the the the born rule from the rest of the postulas of quantum mechanics, can I ask you Jeffrey. I really think there's there's there's three main main types of theories there's the the decoherence interpretations like like many worlds interpretation there's the collapse theories like the Copenhagen interpretation and there's hidden variable theories that like the book.

01:36:13
Lomian mechanics like David Baum, so I I'm just like curious Jeffrey what what what people again would be people are subscribed to and with the. In your field and and what they dismiss and. If you want to continue so there's a cubism as well. I don't fully understand cubism yes, so like.

01:36:43
I think I think Copenhagen in many worlds are more proven not that people are actually thinking about interpretations but just from a practical way of thinking about point systems, you know, pilot wave they're probably bone is very. Beautiful like mathematics, but I mean they realize on these extra non-local hidden variables, so it's not something that's gonna come up like naturally when just doing quantum research unless you think specifically looking at interpretations the objective collapse there is do have the nice aspect that they could be falsifiable, at least the the ones that, It then if you have containment between math like massive things that the streets you know, if it's gravity that's causing the collapse if you're able to create into these entangled states between their containment and these mess massive enough states and you're not seeing collapse then that would refute those of object in the last theories.

01:37:56
Yeah and I think I think, I covered my shoes there, let me one else yeah. I'd uh the mathematics of deploy our foam pile wave theories, you wanna call that art or certainly very beautiful and it actually walks this very fine line between determinism and and you know probabilistic mechanics as well, which makes it like really nice but unfortunately, I think hidden variable theory it's subject to something called bells inequality which still hasn't been a disproven so there is an experiment conducted by this guy yeah a name.

01:38:31
D John Stewart Bell in I think 1964 which basically said that if you if you take a measurements performed independently on two halves of quantum like quantum entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes that depend on you know, hidden variables within each half implies that the the outcomes within the two halves are correlated, but unfortunately he had found that you know, when you take those independent measurements you essentially get these, you know inequalities because of the way that you know, you can't really sample from the observations as directly as you look.

01:39:06
Like see so we got this thing called bells inequality and bells inequality is this somewhat inane mathematical formula which you kind of if you want to prove hidden variables are local and not global which is what you know, deproyally, you know bone pilot wave theory is based on you would need to disprove bells inequality and so of our no experimental or theoretical observation has kind of managed to do that yet also if somebody wants to move the topic away from physics, please feel free to do so.

01:39:35
I think generally physics people tend to hijack rooms and I don't really want to do that right now. It's a yeah and just when that it doesn't just prove none local and variables is your own disputes local variables. I think to really bone with it with as a non-local and variable theory.

01:39:54
Yep. I agree that.

01:39:59
I had this kind of crazy thought. Um, what it we are living in a simulation and you know how everyone snow I will discover a more kind of fundamental particle as our accelerators get bigger and bigger and it always seems like when are we going to find that ultimate particle if ever what if the reason we make advancements with detecting particles and we don't make faster advancements is that the supercomputer that the simulation is built on?

01:40:35
Doesn't have the right memory yet and the right speed but as they upgrade the speed and the memory it thereby gives us stability to detect smaller and smaller particles because that gives us stability to have like finer and finer resolution just a crazy thought ahead of time, you know, kind of before is the the simulation have to contain all the degrees of freedom.

01:41:04
In the universe so Vegas the situation you bring up there would be you know compressed version that didn't didn't include that that that resolution to be able to reach that. I like that at some of anecdotal level Chris thinks this certainly the universe I live in seems far more complex in 2021 than it was in 1970, so I think it's something yeah, but we are able to describe it better doesn't it as we are able to describe it better we at quite more power to meet us the measurement of how we are actually moving if when we are not in the right direction is that as we understand more.

01:41:51
When we tell things more accurately we also came more power.

01:42:03
In this theory are sorry amigohead now you're fine, go ahead. In this theory Chris what the simulation also be restricting like our ability to create larger reactors as well to get to those energies. I was kind of thinking that maybe yes like maybe there's now I'm just totally like science fiction world because I'm not a physicist but I was thinking that maybe the supercomputer programmers had some constraints to the simulation where they don't allow the conscious beings in it to like develop more complex machinery to detect a smaller particles or something like that.

01:42:45
I. I think I have like a video game analogy here so like I think this is like kind of an intriguing theory um because like you know if if like if you're playing a lot of like mobile games or whatever if you're especially for trying to build like a build your own country type thing what the moment you're trying like upgrade your resources for a base sometimes your run into like a time wall where it basically says that you can't like get this particular resource you can't upgrade upgrade this particular resource on like until after like this this this timer has counted down so I think there's probably an analogy in there somewhere of like, you know, Until we're fine-tuning our like our our super quantum computer if you want to call it that to be able to make sure that you you believe the resolution that you get when you smash these two, you know hadrons together or whatever we are putting a time wall on your ability to to build a resources or structures of a certain kind or upgrade them to a sufficient level such that you can conduct experiments to to see those things in the first place.

01:43:49
I think. I mean from purpose perspective we don't have the resources we are the ones who don't have the resources but we are acquiring them, so if we theoretically inquantum is possible that space on time collapses. I I have a little mental exercise to see how we can see that happening.

01:44:13
If we achieve immortality, but for us to see a space and time collapsing. We need immortality and we're kind of getting there so.

01:44:32
So inside the simulation if we are in there, we may actually have a way out on machine the machine that is generating us and it seems we we have the opportunity to do so because we are imagining we are able to imagine ways for for for doing that so.

01:44:54
It has this other case the the program is allowing us to to imagine our way out. I think that generally the best problems we run into and we're talking about simulation periods, you know, if I think we there's a very human-centric framework to this right where we have to like kind of imagine things that a human scale but if you really think about it, if any if a civilization was advanced enough to simulate an entire universe then our ability to anticipate the type of technology, they would have would be the we just couldn't do it.

01:45:29
I mean the general analogy I make is that, you know, if if you told somebody who was only exposed to a technology, Like the abacus and then you showed them a laptop there'd be no deductive way that they'd be able to get from that at kiss to a laptop and so I think we're very much in a similar position where we like we we're we're at a very advocate stage of our technological development and if somebody but you know to to even consider a technology that would be able to simulate an entire universe there's no way that we could deductively make I think the leaps to get to to something at that advanced given our current level of technology.

01:46:12
Yeah, that's a great point. I was so we were you talking about where did he go nanotechnology, which is going to did he leave. I think he did. You know, living eternally, um is. Not sure I would want to but if we are living in a simulation we were discussing this a couple of hours ago and I'd like to kind of reset the room and make sure that everybody kind of has a chance to talk we do have a couple people on stage that I'd like to hear from oh it was Daniel right there.

01:46:54
Yeah, okay he came back so Daniel were you talking about nanotechnology for forgetting to the point where we? Will kind of bypass medicine and yes there is this big question of how can we download or conscious to the computer? I think that before we get to that point we may be able to get to the point where we transform or biological brain in with a some additions probably.

01:47:29
I know another technology based into kind of cyber things so we are able to to expand or bring replace parts of it. What the example I was giving is we can add a retina disabled to the code capture the whole range of light for processing that we will need more neurons in the area where we process vision that will require an expansion and as this is not most likely going to be organic based but silicon base of something that is more durable that may be the way we can achieve immortality and not having the problem.

01:48:16
Of cloning or current conscious that is biological biology biological phase into silicon or something else and just you will not hear what I was describing quickly how we can see time and space collapsing so just quickly I think after we get in mortality what we will like to do is make sure we actually are able to make sure that the mortality is for real that will make that will mean.

01:48:51
Expand or conscious all our around the universe and link difference in all these sensations to some kind of internet that I love us to be everywhere at the same time that will be actually mortality and at that point what else will happen time as space would collapse because there everywhere at the same time and that way time collapses is that we have all the time to reconstruct.

01:49:26
Read or passed and built or reminding of future. So for practical purposes, it will be the same thing. That's kind of how I can see that's happening and asking able to to explore. The quantum space the posts for the Internationality. I'm gonna add the bed but thank you everyone for the great conversation for the technology again.

01:50:00
Thanks for having me. Thank you.

01:50:12
Okay, do we want to hear from Christopher? Hi Christopher.

01:50:19
Hey, yeah, this this topic is always interesting to me. I am. I struggled to think about these things through all the stuff that everyone is skilled at like all the math stuff and physics all that jazz. And so, I respect that thinking all the computer science stuff. I respect that thinking.

01:50:37
Just how I struggle to. Explore. I don't know. I think this is an existential question in my opinion. So I just struggled to explore a way of existing a simulation. Through the lens of light certain disciplines because.

01:51:01
In letters and numbers and lines and zeros and ones I get I understand some of these things on a basic level but. I struggled to connect the dot between. Hard sciences. And a different way of existing or perceiving existence. I mean. So I've done a quite a bit of reading on these ideas of simulation theory and I've heard lots of people talk about if we're living in a stimulation.

01:51:30
We just struggle to wrap my head around it, so maybe somebody has some more context they could get. I think that was the purpose of the Rome Christopher. It was was exactly that same tension for for a lot of us here. Okay with us for the social experiments, we're just really discussing odds and I had a an idea it's like what if all of us talking about is actually a progression somehow in the simulation that allows us to have or gain more information, you know, like when we found the Higgs boson or you know, we dark matter if we figure out.

01:52:20
What the meaning for dark matter is in our universe and what it's purpose. Is you know, the event horizon black holes like you know, we keep going down into these. Deep thoughts on things and maybe all of us coming together collectively and sorting them out. Is what evolution really is.

01:52:50
Yeah just quickly going back to the idea of that one of our conscious being able to expand that to infinity and being able to to to see it to eliminate time as we see it or to collapse time and space for that conscious. What we perceive as reality will be kind of illusion.

01:53:19
So maybe the idea of simulation is the same equation that we had before with saying in the inner tradition that. The universities actually an illusion and there is one only one kind of unified and differentiated universal conscious so. Maybe this idea of assimilation is a metaphor for something else and maybe the previous medical we have that everything is an illusion may actually have been more accurate that happens doesn't it it's a possibility but Daniel before you were saying no you felt that maybe we could gain such capacity that we could actually outrun the simulation or out, you know, break out of it.

01:54:14
You contrasting you know, or you could use your latest thought somewhat contrasting with that yeah because if you send illusion if it's not accumulation but an illusion then there's no I mean that that does not allow us to escape if it's an illusion we can escape the solution which is to our work much more than escape this relationship and explain can we spend just a little bit more about this idea of an illusion like how for you could it be not not not real.

01:54:48
No no no, no, no, no. Not that is that we are not real is that our reality is different from what we talked it is, so if you are a conscious that is already everywhere at the same time and there's not passion of future.

01:55:11
You are unreachable. Communication is almost impossible it's not totally impossible but you will see us as living in evolution you will say hey guys, can you see that everything is just one thing that there is not really differentiation that the some point everything just become one at a time and space collapse.

01:55:38
Oh because I'm usually sure. But I mean there could be variability right to these these super creatures that you talking about. They could be a variability where they they could potentially be able to be everywhere and know everything but at the same time hone themselves down such that they they're able to you know, get back down to more, you know, less sophisticated them knowing right?

01:56:03
So that the be actually might be the parent contrast. Yes mirrors. That's why says we can we can collapse on our understanding and imagine flatliness. But it Is exponentially more more complex. Yes, but that would be possible. And the other way of thinking about this is maybe that's why we can't find intelligent life in the universe because if we are ready, we're that close if we achieve a mortality and then our conscious becomes universal and pass a space and time we will disappear of the you know, universe.

01:56:45
So yeah, maybe we just jump there. There is no more about us in and the universe will need another species to the develop and as if the same the same level where they just become one with the universe as we know. So, Yeah for me that is explaining now while we can find one more advanced civilization and more advancing will want to mess itself into infinity into yeah.

01:57:22
Every week just frame existence with the tools that we've developed, you know as the tool making species on the planet and with the rapid race of computational power to the point that we can create amazing simulations and examine them. It's probably a natural human response to design existence and creation.

01:57:44
And purpose with simulation as an example and you know, what may be maybe this is the the time that we crack that why we're here and and what existence is about and maybe it's not maybe it's the maybe it's just a continuation on the pathway to find the right tool to crack the question.

01:58:04
Yeah, but what happened when we really got it. At that point. We we are there's no more questions. There's not more. I'll say is association there's what more differentiation is, just one thing and. There's social there may be nothing but it's just illusion but you know it's funny I earlier on a few hours ago into this conversation.

01:58:32
Daniel I had come up with something like, you know, sort of tangentially related to what you're talking about. I I sort of suggested that maybe there was a limit to what we could know or if there you know, eventually we reach this limit where is this just like a hard limit and and we just sort of have all the information and then from there we can basically just have you know control over what you know, what what there's what there is around us and be able to manipulate.

01:58:57
Bit like what David was talking about just be able to constantly create simulations to our liking. I'd like to comment on that on the sky high of everything's for a great conversation. One thing that I think it's missed in conversations about the simulation idea is the the head versus the heart.

01:59:20
So I think a lot of what we talk about is, you know, the mental idea of being in a simulation and and what we would do if we learned everything about the universe and, You know, I think Daniel was saying something like you know, but there be we we'd be sort of done and we could disembodied or be spaceless in timeless but I also like what has been said about view the sense of illusion that I think we live in a in a disconnection from how the world really is.

01:59:55
So and it's our emotions that do that we have you know, we we think we perceive the world as it is but really we're perceiving this kind of testing ground for. How we're going to respond to people at certain times and how we're going to deal with our emotions.

02:00:09
And I think that we don't really interpret the world as it really is. So, you know, I think it's valuable to think about. That if we wake up to the sense of illusion that there is or wake up to the sense of there being a simulation we might actually just be more clear on what's really going on and and be able to live life more fully but it's not like we would be done or anything like that.

02:00:33
We would just really be more engaged at a deeper level with all of the things happening in life. Yeah that that that's another possibility. There is this fascinating person. I think idea that. We on purpose are not able to see as it is because we are so far here to perpetuate our species not to see things.

02:00:58
They are probably seen or evolutionary advantage not to see reality completely as it is for once again, we know that we only hear serves that certain spectrum of sound we only see certain spectrum of light but mesh of may have been a natural coolant give us more but. It is just a fish efficiency.

02:01:24
It naturally creep us. We. Exactly what we need no more. Because of resources are.

02:01:39
Happening when we are able to achieve a point of. Not limitation by resources. So let let's talk about let's talk about maybe the the possibility of simulation and illusion in that the universe could be a simulation but but you're interpretation of it could be an illusion and you get to have both.

02:02:08
Yeah, but. I can't depend.

02:03:07
Between the the the idea of if you have people people who argue that that existence is primary versus people who argue that consciousness is primary sounds like the the position for illusion is the and that I think in my favor is like that you're consciousness is a has a primary role and existence has a set has a secondary role as like it's like an illusion of your consciousness and and therefore you're like you're in the you're in the camp that I'm creating reality with my mind or something right and then the other position is that existence is primary and it consciousness is just creating.

02:03:42
A flood representation of of existence and that would be more of the simulation argument that that that's what I'm sort of interpreting and but but but but where I stand basically earlier with that I was saying that your mind that if you look at if you get outside your own mind and just look at how someone else's mind is making a flawed representation of reality when when you see someone who's has very a lot of delusions, why are there delusions not changing your reality for you it's and and I think at this point to a simple and obvious explanation, which is that a person's understanding.

02:04:17
Of reality is not primary over reality itself that that it's a it's secondary that the human being has allusion and that an illusion of the simulation, okay that universe but we can also create this stuff or universe to a degree the thing they putting a team in the universe seems to be possible.

02:04:50
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, thank you do you can you point to evidence it sounds like you or question there, are your framing of it is stating that there is an objective. Physical existing world out there outside of ourselves as observers and would you agree with that and what evidence would you say support or disproves the alternative view anything so so so so my art my argument was that you can see you can it's it's it's a if you're only considering yourself and what you know, then it then you may not be able to to make a deduction there, but if you consider the the delusions of of another person or the delu, Geans of an animal and in making an error and judgment then you can see that they're that that that the the the individual for brains perception can be flawed and that when that happens it doesn't overrule the reality of that there that they're in if you're mind was superior to the reality that you're in then then your delusions would not have errors right then you're delusions would would be truths but what about the, Diagnosis between that we are creation and we had creators.

02:06:28
So I'm you know, I if you like it sounds to me like you're sort of like it's not possible to believe in a an assimilation because you need because you need to because in your model of the world that that if there's a simulation that means you you can't be a creator of your life or something and and so you you are unable to say well a simulation could be primary because the only way I could be a greater my life is if my my cautiousness is is primary and the world is an, Illusion and and I'm not stuck on that sort of access like if if whether you're whether you're creating your life or whether it's deterministic, it could be a simulation and whether you're creating your life or whether it's deterministic, it could be an illusion that like does not it's not I don't believe that it's coupled that you have to have an and the universe being illusion to be a creator of your life and I don't believe that you have to have the universe not you know, the universe could also be a simulation.

02:07:38
And and potentially could be a creator of your life or in both situations, you know, it could could be that determinism is is is happening in that you're participation in co-creating universe with the universe is just feedback loop sort of mechanism that you're part of it, but you're really not separate from the cosmos and you're not really making a decisions that are separate from oneness with the physics of the cosmos and and so and the idea of you being a separate self that's making decisions that's creating your life that's separate from the Physics.

02:08:13
The cosmos itself is really just it's it's contradictory to to Buddhist thought simulation well maybe we should but because we end up simulation but just quickly so if we're in the evolution and this in which illusion is. Being curated by something else but I am also participant on that illusion and asthma I as I am participant of it.

02:08:47
I am also creative so you're mapping it your imagining a conflict between something else in yourself and and what I'm saying is there's not there's not too if not it's not there's not to it's not you versus something else it it the it's a co-creation between the the the oneself that is both to you and something else at the same time.

02:09:09
Like that we apply we had spoken about this before Michael were you we apply the language and the reasoning to the the the variables of the universe so as to be able to gain a relationship to be able to to put the relationships that it may itself may not be able to make for itself and then if we unify what we are able to through reason about it with it, then there may be there is that co-operation.

02:09:38
Like that are we leaving room for other folks to jump in here too, or the other folks will want to speak up?

02:09:49
Sorry I just wanted to find Michael did you you did that resonate with you Mike yeah totally I like that a lot. Jeremy that was that those yeah really good can you repeat that journey please that's a little bit it's three o'clock in the morning where I am here right now same here as you think.

02:10:08
I I don't know, you know, there might be a one time we'll see we'll see you it was you know, that's a long conversation. I mean me and Michael been in this room for a few hours, so we were sort of going back and forth about you know, and this sort of related a little.

02:10:24
Bit with with Don Hoffman with his talk a few days ago a week ago about this idea of conscious agents and whether or not he's trying to be able to make it. I know Josh had discussed why that theory actually has a lot of a lot of potential holes in it, but just regardless it was talking about this idea that there would be conscious agents that would sort of be a sort of foremost in the theory that and they would sort of go before time and space and time and space would be sort of a joining and sorry yeah anyway and So that that these agents might somehow carry metacognition.

02:11:04
I I've been on the stage and I'd ask them that he had suggested yes that they might you know, these agents might be able to have the sort of ability to connect particles and forces in the universe in such a way that the former almost a medical cognition that that allows them to gain some level of of knowledge of each other and I'm and then what we're talking about is a variation on that, which is that maybe it's it's actually the humans job or in any intelligent either life.

02:11:34
Or. Or whatever creatures that are in the universe it would be our job instead of Don Hoffman's cognitive agents or conscious agents who be our job to be able to discover all the relationships as opposed to some some other third party. And then yeah I've opened up the room, so if you want to come up and ask a question go ahead and raise your hand.

02:11:59
I have a comment around. I think that there's this underlying assumption when we talk about a simulation that there's a some other person creating the simulation and I've heard that mention a few times. And I think it's worth talking about that because I don't think that's a necessary piece of the puzzle.

02:12:20
I think that it's possible to have a world which behaves like a simulation but is not run by another. World which is running the simulation. Because that's that's like adding a whole level of meta existence that I don't think is actually necessary. The the way that it can work or could possibly work is much like a video game, you know, you're playing a video game with someone across the world you have separate worlds really you have your world on your computer that's being rendered for you and they have their world that's being rendered for them and the trick of the computer game is to make those worlds seem like the same world.

02:12:59
So the way it does this through techniques that something like optimistic implementation is one technique where each computer is guessing it's smartly optimistically guessing whether things is going to happen next and rendering that for you but then it's also sharing relevant information with the other computer so that you can actually you can actually find out what is happening, although there's a delay because they're far away from you.

02:13:22
So the computer works really hard to try and synchronize these two systems so that it creates a virtual world that's seamless and seems objective but in that same way I think that we can each be having our own. Subjective reality without postulating that there's an actual objective reality aside from the the stitched together mutual subject of realities that we have.

02:13:47
And as long as that seamless and consistent between our observations, we're never going to guess that there's actually nothing there. And so in my research on this I found that there's really no no underlying way to tell the difference at least that the surface level. I share simulation that we are all creating or an illusion that we are all creating and participating Yeah I think our lines with a lot of other parts said here from you Daniel and from other folks, I brought up a symbol idea earlier about there's again, if you look at how no man's sky was there's an article about how no man's sky was created.

02:14:25
It's a it's a similar to what with the idea to what Sky was saying but people can also there's a really cool idea that some I think is the called the holographic principle and if you you can also just you can look that up on a Wikipedia the holographic principle or You can look.

02:14:43
Up just basically the universe is a hologram and you'll find a whole bunch of articles that they talk about how you know, the idea is is that you know with an ordinary hologram you you have a 3d image that's encoded on a 2d surface but this time they're saying that maybe the entire universe is is actually encoded on a 2d surface and and and that's also interesting because we mentioned earlier that that people were saying that that that there there's there's an article about the ability for the horizon of a black hole.

02:15:18
To the the 2D surface to actually sore holographic information so there's an idea there's an idea it's it's about the universe being a hologram and there's an idea about holograms being able to be stored on the 2D surface of a black hole and and all the black holes. I mean, let's say that there's a black hole for every galaxy well, maybe there's a and and I don't know if that's true but but I mean, it's like maybe like every galaxy is a some sort of hologram invaded from the horizon of every black hole right and and We're all basically holograms on a black hole.

02:15:56
So this is a subject of my research and I'm pretty cool that you brought it up. I have a paper that just came out called space-time paths as a whole and it shows that it's an internet journal quantum reports if you want to check it out it shows that as we've formulated it quantum mechanics and the path integral of quantum field theory actually has these properties of holography and I think it's important to sort of back away from the idea that you need a surface like the surface of a black hole like a physical surface or like some people imagine that the edge of the Most is like this two-dimensional screen that's projecting us as holographic people there's actually just this relationship and the relationship underlying holograms is actually much deeper which is a relationship between the frequencies or the frequency representation of things and in the physical world and you can represent everything in the physical world and in terms of its frequency representation and in that sense the source of that hologram is really just all around us.

02:17:04
It's where immersed in it, it's not like it's out there projecting onto us but we're just immersed in this what you can say like a non-physical as Daniel is saying a timeless spaceless representation of the world, which is calculable in all the time, you know, it's just it's just a computation that we can do but the idea is that that is is very we're very much like a hologram and what what makes a hologram interesting is it's it encodes.

02:17:32
A physical reality just in terms of information you know and so you can think of like the the fact that in quantum experiments it's been shown conclusively that properties don't exist for objects before you measure them so there's not so there's in essence there is no such thing as a property of an object except in relationship like when we bump into something it has the property of bumping into us but before we do it it's there's nothing definite there and this just really aligns with the notion of simulation which is providing this information when we need it.

02:18:07
But it doesn't actually exist doesn't actually have a history of its own or that could also be like a procedurally generated universe that's procedurally generated around the the the observer or the interaction and I think that again the the way it's really interesting to think about no man's sky in particular as a procedurally generated universe inside a video game in not not in just sort of like as an as a vague analogy.

02:18:40
Structure of vision.

02:18:45
Power brain assimilates or assembles objects depths and color and the emotions of color. I'm currently working on a photography project. I'm an artist exploring blindness through photography processes, experimental photography processes and. What input data goes in through? You know, the photoreceptors can be flawed or marred or what you see.

02:19:16
I don't see or what you experience. I would never experience some of the images that I create people will say well what is this and I say what do you think it is and then they say oh it looks like a landscape with sea and ashore and I remember going to the beach as a kid went in reality some other that's not really what that object was when I photographed it but, Everybody comes from their own.

02:19:49
Like a memory database sensory database and I'm wondering. How much is that is created through?

02:20:01
Like a cellular level and how we can. See one another as we see each other in color in shape and and is it really just based on the structure of our vision and does all of this that we've been talking about I know what matters but if you're if you have low vision, you're legally blind and you bump into something or?

02:20:28
Where you're in a room and colors and objects. Don't really resemble a table or a chair or both cereal how we can get beyond that and. In a sense isn't everything input through our eyes. Really what we're talking about. I so I think and I'd like to I like to to bounce this to back to sky and in a second but I think it's it's empty any interaction any sensory interaction any sort of measurement whether it's your your eyes are or anything else that is is is.

02:21:06
Anyway, I'll let Skye finish up. Yeah, that's me. And I yeah, I really like the reference to vision I use the example I was gonna say metaphor or analogy, but it's not it's an example of images and vision because if you if you can picture a photograph, I'm not talking about a hologram right not just a regular old photograph like the screen that you're looking at.

02:21:36
And if you if you want to decompose that you would you could decompose it into pixels, right? You can picture where every single pixel is in one pixel is white another pixel is blue, and they're separate on the screen. That's a reductionist view of things. You're reducing the image down into its spatially separated components in every pixel, you can picture where it goes.

02:21:56
It has an XY coordinate on the screen. But you can also equivalently break down any kind of image into patterns and these patterns in in the basic case with the Fourier transform are just. What are called plane waves or just lines stripes across the screen and you can take these stripes and you just like as if they were on piece of points of data each stripe can be laid down and just the right way or set of stripes across the whole screen and they interfere when you lay one that's like a vertical stripes to have a high frequency and then horizontal stripes of a low frequency and then an angle of its medium frequency.

02:22:35
If you apply them in just the right way just like you're adding just the right ingredients to a cake and you mix them all together through this thing called a fourier transform you get out your original image. And you can create any scene that you want out of this procedure from from these basic patterns So it's what what's amazing about this is you're not breaking it down into pixels which are kind of reducing the space into the pieces for the sum of the parts that's just no more than the parts themselves.

02:23:04
You're actually breaking it down into patterns that extend across the whole screen. So this is the essence of holism where every part of the screen corresponds to every part of the of the frequent of the patterns that make up the screen. And if you want to change the whole image on the screen you have.

02:23:21
To change the pattern that extends across everything. And I think this is a really fundamental aspect of what we're talking about of how the graphic universe can work and how space and time are. Breakdown in a certain way It's been here from the UK sky I just wanted to say that what you just said, there's not enough purely theoretical that's exactly how JPEG image compression works.

02:23:44
If you have a lossless if you turn the compression off on a JPEG you're doing exactly that and you're storing the frequency space and then when you decide to compress your JPEG, you're just doing a little bit of quantization losing a bit of information in the frequency space, so that's that's pretty fascinating MP3 is as well, yeah audio is what do you do when I mean how these intersect would.

02:24:07
Be. Their facility that is built a 3d environment that represents this imagines that were discussing but with formulas behind with everywhere everything is mathematic on their background. Why I don't I don't think it's about building it. I think this is the way that the cosmos runs the propagation of of what I showed in my work is that the propagation of a wave function like which wave functions are what what determine you know, what a physical particle is like an electron the propagation of these things behaves according to the same mathematics, we're talking about with with images and,

02:24:54
So the world that we experience has I guess. I'm yeah, I'm getting I kind of get what you are saying but a pixel is a numeric representation on a map, but if we. Do drawing that is like we don't go to photoshop but we go to to do illustrator everything we doing illustrator or that 3d graphic program has formulas behind doesn't it how does interact are all if it interests at all with your mother or yeah yeah, yeah, that's that's good connection, um, you know, imagine you're in Photoshop that we photoshop and you want to blur everything in your photo.

02:25:46
Graph or you want to sharpen all the edges or you want to make some kind of overall change you what you would do is apply a filter in the frequency space so you to blur everything you could go to the outer edges of the frequency space and remove all the outer edges and that takes away all the high frequencies which means all the quickly varying portions of your of your picture, so all the all the edges go away and become blurry and so you can make these changes to the entire picture with a very localized or specific targeted change to the with a filter in the frequency domain.

02:26:21
And so what I imagined is is interesting about this in the physical world as if the physical world does behave according to the same principles which we know it does as band was saying, you know in image processing for instance in music processing if this applies to particles as well like the physical nature of things then there's a sense in which.

02:26:43
In space and time are our not relevant in this in this framework, it doesn't mean it can be bypassed doesn't mean we can travel fashion the speed of light but it does mean that our conception of what is far and what is near is it could be flawed and that the the size of the cosmos being you know, 13 billion light years across or whatever it is is it's just is one framework, but there's this other framework in which space the time don't even have any relevance.

02:27:16
And it's a lot of open questions. Sky's guy Skye you were talking before about you know, sort of there was a sort of information exchange between particles for instance or particles and forces, right? You want to elaborate as to what you like how you imagine them?

02:27:39
Um what I have I'll say maybe in response to that that we I think it does come down to interactions. Everything that there's this way of looking at things that is relational and quantum measurement and quantum. Quantum interpretations e quantum mechanics that are relational meaning that it's there's no objective that come back to what we're seeing earlier.

02:28:06
There's no objective world out there side from the mutual subject of world that we're each creating that are also interacting and I don't think it comes down to a conscious observers in this case, my personal stance is that it that all of interaction is is this way just the interaction between a pool cue and a pool ball is is.

02:28:31
We wouldn't say it's experiencing a reality because it's not conscious unable to describe that reality but the same mathematics and physics would apply to the subjectivity there as well. Scoria. Like it's like I've only been here for a minute but like that started making about like Luko with like other spaces, but if so regardless of if we're living a simulation or not if that is true, how could you just to like benefit your actual like living life?

02:29:04
You are that even as possible. You are whatever assimilation or not or I am whatever I am a simulation or not, that was what I what that is what I am. I think I think is possible to benefit from this unseen the world this way because.

02:29:30
In in this you know way we could say that the simulation is really about I think you know, what kinds of emotional experience are we having? How are we treating ourselves? How are we treating each other and not I'm not saying what the values should be but that there are values and that are we learn about our own values through experience and it's very much.

02:29:53
I mean, if I could just summarize it I would say, you know the law of karma from the Hinduism is maybe along these lines that if we if we start to see everything that shows up in our in our life as In the simulation as if there's some kind of underlying path or usefulness that we can we can glean from experiences.

02:30:13
I think it's it's a shift in mindset. That we can we can actually benefit from what's going on instead of feeling victimized by it. It's not to say we have control over life or experiences but I think that there is a shift and in mindset which might be relevant.

02:30:29
And I'll add to that that my research tries to put on the solid foundation the idea of synchronicity and synchronicities are coincidences which show up in life that are not necessarily positive. I want to make that point but that are useful and can be beneficial for growth. It's great.

02:30:46
It's great. Have you looked at the last technology for video conference? That Nvidia has. No, I haven't. Okay in order to maximize bandwidth and make a video conference in possible at low when we think everywhere Nvidia Generates a bit map of the person's talking same that the the image just one map to the person with a listening or receiving the the communication and then begins recreating the interaction by animation.

02:31:27
So by doing so, They can change the angle from where from where the camera is being. Representing the image in the receptor. So you may be having as we usually do we have the camera on the right and we are reading or looking at the monitor the other person on the left and or or eyesight is not level to the middle of the of the of the camera.

02:31:52
So this technique allows for the image the on the on the other side to to look at the other person over there to the eye. So it's like a deep a real time deep fake where only the the basic. Mapping of the movements are are transmitted not the whole deep map.

02:32:18
In the same way if we have a photochope a face a photograph of a face and we throw the same thing in illustrator or a 3D program. The vector base version is much more efficient by me, the the photo can be 24 megabytes or whatever and the, Better base can be one megabyte or less There is a is much more efficient that way how that maps with what you are doing.

02:33:01
If it maps are always that can you expand here from the UK if I can jump into two seconds just a little everybody know. I've just tweeted a very good two minute huge box a bit more than two minutes but a YouTube video about exactly that by the fire channel called two minute papers and it's fascinating and that method of not only straightening your face so you look like you're looking in the camera, but compressing the cool down to what is essential.

02:33:23
Just. The audio and neural net the other end reconstructs your face from the audio plus a small amount of other metadata, I think is huge reduction in bandwidth sent and really does make raise the question of what is what is reality if you're looking at this completely reconstructed version of somebody and these real stones awesome on the GPU yeah a deeper real time the deeper we can have more computers right now with an immediate video card yeah amazing yeah we did a link to that because I remember seeing that very good summary on on YouTube.

02:33:55
I'm using I've had about simulation at one point a couple of. You using one has been I post video game I was playing with my son the other day and when I pulled out the home if we were in a simulation then we as agents in that simulation wouldn't know if they hit became paused for any amount of time at any point in our lives that the simulation that we're on could be being caused and resumed and indeed the speed at which the simulation is being simulated could be increased or decreased provided it maintains the synchronicity that people were talking about earlier to maintain the illusion, so that's just that amusing without really, you know, just amusing and the other thing the other music.

02:34:29
I've had this quite interesting is if you sit down to say set up a space game on a computer. And you want to really ambitious game that goes from right answer that to the universe you realize you've got some fundamental constraints which is using numbers you've got a problem because you've got a limit on the smallest thing you can have you've got a limit on the biggest thing you can have and then the performance in the machine puts limits on your frame rates and it's fascinating within physics, we you know, you have these concepts of the smallest size, you can have a prime length and the and the smallest time you can have which seem to be very strong correlates to things like frame rates of the simulation the smallest meaningful time is the frame step and the smaller distance is the smallest distance that your number system represents.

02:35:08
That's another amusing and yeah just a couple thoughts there. And just wondering for any other voices have female voices a lot of men talking how yeah yeah.

02:35:26
We haven't heard from rush Daniel. I could add some value to with Ben said, um, I jumped on earlier because there was a lot of toxic about physics and I wanted to bring up this idea of maybe coming from an epismological lens where when we talked about, you know, the possibility that we're living in a simulation my the first thought that comes to mind is a what if there is a reality that we have an experience for can experience because I'll use this as an example, for example gravity and I'm pointing meters per square you're right or Square on earth and so we have a you know, billions and billions and billions of data points to prove that but and some far off universe somewhere or in some other person's experience gravity could we could actually have a repeatable data point that to actually disproves that right this is false about a falsification for science, so my thought is what if instead of you know, the simulation that we're quote unquote talking about is just something that actually exists outside of.

02:36:37
Around what we physically experience in what we can prove right now, so I just wanted to kind of get your guys thoughts on that especially those that are coming more from a scientific background.

02:36:55
Yeah. I appreciate that question. I'll jump in us to meals wants to I. I keep coming back to the emotional component here that we are. We are experiencers of emotion and that our emotions play this really big role in how we interpret our world so I guess you know, I was gonna connect that to your question about gravity like for instance gravity what we we do know that gravity is only 9.8 meters per second squared on the surface of the earth and it changes even if you go to the mountains and that that changes depending on the size of the plan that you're on so there's a verifiability there.

02:37:45
But it's only verifiable in the under those conditions if you go to different part of the university experience gravity according to general relativity and it would just be whatever is the gravity in that that particular region so I guess you're asking about replicability of. Some kind of measurement of being in the simulation.

02:38:07
We tell that and could be replicate the measurements or somehow share consistent measurements that indicate that. Maybe for clarity like you know let's take some type of constant maybe like this beat of life, right so if we you know or something like that if we assume that there's some constant what if there is a you know, a part of the universe that actually, you know flies in the face of that constant that we take for granted, right so you know, we can even say like, oh, you know entropy or something or you know, some love thrown a thermodynamics doesn't actually exist in this particular part of the universe so because you know in epistemology.

02:38:51
You can have like, you know a million or billion or trillion, you know data points that you know confirm some type of you know law of thrown up thermodynamics, but something that can be verified that actually face of that actually would disprove that and then you would have to go into a new direction so that's maybe hopefully more of the clarification that I wanted to add.

02:39:15
If I could jump in there a second I think we can learn a lot from extrapy forward from how we make simulations today we increasingly sophisticated simulations we make in video games and assuming that any other intelligent life might might might follow us in the park it might follow a very very different part, but in those games one of the things you do is you use parameters and it's a parameter on the world and you might you know in a naive game you would put in the jig that you're talking about as a parameter and a more complicated game you would put in a different G and it would allow for the things that sky's talking about by the different size and densities of the planets and all that.

02:39:51
Parameters the debate and any agents in the game if they ever developed any awareness would be the discover potentially those parameters and the likelihood is at that parameter is the same across the entire simulation because it's just a simpler argument than saying that the parameter varies in different places and the whole of cosmology is based on the idea that the rules of science are the same into parts of the universe and and in the simulation they would be so I think we just operate on that assumption that those those things are the same there's constants those parameters are the same and unless we find you could you probably make any progress in science unless you do.

02:40:26
To some in some regards certain things like astronomy where you're looking out there to see what is you assume that the the laws are the same and if they don't turn out to be you would see some discrepancies it's just as so far we've generally I think see that the laws are similar in all the places we look at which feels like parameters to me, so just to thought I don't know for help.

02:40:44
I'm getting right done speaking, oh. Sorry didn't mean that right but that's what I'm saying I think that assumption is actually really important to to not overlook it's, you know something that maybe we want to take into consideration that you know that you know, the unknown unknowns out there could be the representation of something that we are living in a simulation because you did mention Ben like for example, you know, like a computer systems and binary systems we have you know, certain numbers like for example in JavaScript, you can't go past a certain number and you're saying or like frame rates, you know, we can't go below certain frame rate and then you know, The way our computers work are like that so we have these constraints and my you know question again is more of a question or a thought is that there can be things that exist outside of the constraints of what we already know and I think that is definitely something that would be worth exploring especially from that lens.

02:41:44
Something that can be interesting to think about if you haven't really thought about physics in this way is you know, we we tend to think of the boundaries of things like the boundaries of what's the boundaries of the simulation most people would think about some spatial boundary like the edge of the known universe 13 billion light years away outside of this galaxy this other galaxies beyond those galaxies, maybe there's some edge but, If you really think about what's the what's the natural boundary of the universe it's a speed is the speed of light so we know that you can't go faster than speed of light and it could be possible that the universe itself is infinite in size but we know that it's finite or limited in it in the speed you can go and speed is just another it's actually more fundamental than position because speed takes it into consideration the relationship between position and time space and time.

02:42:38
So I think it's city he's been really fascinating to rethink, you know, my friend or framework about assuming that we live in a physical universe that's the limits are spatial and rather shifting to say well actually the the limitation that the the cosmos has is that you can't go faster than the certain speed and that's like the boundary the edge of the room is the speed.

02:43:02
Of life. So God has said that's a fascinating concept earlier somebody talks about things like no man's sky or procedurally generated games You can have a procedurally generated world which is continuously procedurally generated so that new stuffs being made up on the fly and the old stuff is being discarded where possible to save memory otherwise we just eventually run out of memory in that regime where there's a lot of agents running around in a procedurally generated world that is generated on the fly you it sounds very similar to that you have a situation in which information can't be transmitted beyond the certain rate across that space.

02:43:39
Because you've got memory limitations etc. So thinking of the universes as a procedural generation that's that's constantly expanding itself and perhaps discarding bits is that's the fascinating way looking at things going and then I'm done Skype you saying that the universe would be as large as as the speed of light has been able to basically reach in a particular direction.

02:44:05
Well, I think you have to go a little farther than that because I think that and this is the suspect that if okay, so but I think that I've never been fully convinced that we have the whole picture on the timeline of the cosmos to begin with, you know, there's a big bang is a decent and well well-established conclusion drawn from certain experimental data that we have but I've never been comfortable with this the idea that, This very physicalist notion the world exploded into being 13.8 billion years ago or whatever it is and then everything, you know space and time expanded into the void whatever that is and it is this might be illustrating my lack of knowledge of inflation theory but inflation happened in which space and time expanded fashions be the light and then somehow, you know, thirteen point eight million years later or whatever it is, the universe is power big because lights have time to travel and what's beyond that.

02:45:06
I think I think the model is lacking there. So, I think that that, Is why it's useful to think about you know, I was talking earlier about this you take about photography and Adobe Photoshop. What's what's true about Adobe Photoshop images is that the information that. Composes them is distributed throughout the picture.

02:45:24
That's what all those wave patterns do and that's way really what a hologram is about to look at a hologram and you can see. You mention you're seeing. Because the information about all the relationships of all the buildings say if you're looking at a hollow member of the city the information about the relationships between all those buildings is distributed throughout the picture.

02:45:43
So when you tell the picture you can see it from different angles. So this notion of information is distributed throughout the system is really what I think is. Possibly the nature of our physical space and time reality in which case the sense that the edge of the universe is somewhere out there and we're in the middle of it doesn't really make any sense or isn't in the best way to look at it.

02:46:09
Sky that reminds me of course there's a difference between the age of the universe and the size the egg, however, whenever we call the age thirty when eight whatever billion years old, it's of course much bigger, it's not getting nearer near 100 billion years in size definitely worth meditating on that maybe blowing up a balloon and watching the surface of it expand and trying to get one's head around the difference between the age and the size it puts her it does potentially suggest that the universe is size isn't limited by the speed of light if you think it true so that's pretty fascinating.

02:46:42
I'd like to say something. Okay. This is a this is pretty awesome so I'm definitely thought about this couple times. I think what I'm gonna mention is a little bit less scientific but if the universe is of this is the or a display however you want to say it basically would mean that it's not actually that big in fact space between the Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy, there would be no space if it's a simulation because it would just be a display.

02:47:21
And let's say you traveled in a spaceship from Milky Way to Andromeda you wouldn't actually be traveling anywhere it would just the display would just move towards you until you reach that galaxy, for example, if it's real if the universe is actually physically three dimensions and real that means that the space between the Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy is huge and if you took a spaceship there then you're actually moving towards it and so, I guess what I'm trying to say isn't necessarily that scientific it's just kind of a way to think about it or a way to kind of meditate on it so in other words if it's a display that means you never actually walk down the street the street just moves around you while you're walking if it's real then you're obviously walking down the street.

02:48:12


02:48:54
One more thing. I want to mention is that let me make sure I say the name of this correctly but it's called the. I'm sure some of you know how to explain this scientifically. I don't I don't understand it. Completely but it's the double slit experiment which basically sums up looking at an object so if you let's say that a tree behind you the particles in the tree have a certain pattern but if you turn around and look at that tree, the particles are aware that you're looking at it and the pattern changes and this is scientifically proven it's called the double slit experiment but that's pretty much all I have to say,

02:49:43
So we've definitely speak about the double split experiment and observation and waves and particles. Those are good points. So Ben did you want to say something on that? Thanks for just thought provoking the the first half of me saying is there engage in cheat all the time so if it's inconvenient to render a bush you put a billboard into the 2D transparent thing that looks like a person you turn it down, so they faces the player and you do that until they get too close to it and then you load in a real bush because otherwise they might kind of catch this that it's a little smoking mirrors all sorts of smoke and mirrors tricks in games to to try and maintain the illusion in a very artistic way whilst minimizing the resources on the simulation, you know.

02:50:32
The so the idea that you when you go to another galaxy you're just looking for a portal it's really interesting to always come from that perspective I think and so, you know, if this was a stimulation how would it cheat and then it can help you simplify? I mean, I think there are good astral nomical reasons why we consider it to be a real distance between galaxies.

02:50:51
There's a massive interstellar gas that you can probably measure there are now interstellar objects, but there's a whole bunch of connections between reasons to believe that the property is free space between galaxies, but the principle of saying, hey if this thing was a simulation, how would it? Heat. How would it try and short circuit things?

02:51:11
How would it try and simplify things? However to try and fold us. I think so pretty interesting limbs. So thanks for making me think of that. I'm done. I think Canada. I just want to I just want to say do you like and do you think like? So do you think they're actually is space between things and the universe?

02:51:30
Like do you actually physically like when you get an airplane are you actually physically traveling from LA to New York? I'd like to jump on that. But then do you want to answer first? Oh man Well so yes I do within the simulation but if we just if we were in a simulation this whole conversation is it's kind of funny.

02:51:49
It's kind of ironic and funny from the outside of course, but say, I mean, yes, I do from my standpoint of like if I want to make it prediction and actually go somewhere on earth or do something that affects my experience in a predictable way and yes, I'm personally used with it assume that there is space between my guess anyway, so it's quite good.

02:52:05
So, I don't think it's a either or I think that, As it's true that there is space in time in between events so the sun is eight light minutes away from us and it takes light eight minutes to get here from the sun. So if you look at the sun, you're seeing light that's traveled for eight minutes across I think what 96 million miles or something like that or what we call 8 light minutes because that's really the measure of space in astronomical terms.

02:52:34
But there's also a point that was made by first by Gilbert Lewis who is famous for the Lewis dot diagrams in chemistry originally, but he was also a physicist. And he studied light. He studied the photon he published a couple of papers and a couple in 1926 that came out where he pointed out this word virtual contact that light actually did the description of light is what we call a null interval where it's it's the only thing that travels along the travels of these at the speed of light and it's really what a null interval is it's a separation between two events such that the space travelled is equal to the time travelled.

02:53:18
But I'm not saying exactly right but the point being that when light travels it travels you subtract the time from the space that travels and you get zero for light. Whereas for you and I when we travel it's always a different number like a non-zero number and the the point being that the two events of light leaving the sun and light hitting our eyes are not actually separate events for the light because the time and the space are essentially shrink down to zero in special relativity and, And we have to think about the the actual connection between the emission of the light and the absorption of the light leaving the sun and hitting your eye.

02:54:01
So it there is a. Sense in which light doesn't actually experience time and space at all So light leaving the Andromeda galaxy and heading to the Milky Way galaxy it yes, it travels for from our point of view who are observing it but to light itself, it doesn't actually evolve along that journey at all.

02:54:20
There is no journey there is no time in space that's actually taken. So this just poses a huge throws a huge wrench in the idea of there's an objective world out there because even if you just consider light, which is like the most particle in the universe, it doesn't actually experience time and space at all.

02:54:37
And you, I use that word experience, which is in the morphic but it's not important too much about that at this stage. So they're both true it is isn't it is isn't kind of at the same time. I kind of like with like the question the way that I always like to think of that way even like I always talk about like metaphors or like the the parameters or like what are the cheat codes?

02:55:05
I'm just like funnel ways of like explaining understanding this stuff because like we were talking about like wavelengths like like there's like a wind like I've kind of like traveled through my life. Have I've been able to just like pick up on like you said like synchronicities not necessarily that they're always a good thing for them.

02:55:22
Some of the vocab that even if it's arbitrary, I've gotten from clubhouse. I'm as doing really helpful. I was wondering if there's like any metaphors that you guys kind of just like live I just feel like well even when we're talking on like the mindset kind of thing. It's just like a good way to you guys kind of view it even if it's not factual.

02:55:42
If I may I think and so of a certain may not go out but from the scientific background to answer your question. I think one of the most interesting sort of pieces for that relate to this that I sort of use as a lens a bit is is Plato's allegory of the case, so I think that maybe you might want to check that out.

02:56:03
I think my understanding of that of that story or that piece has as changed over time, but I and and maybe I should wait and ask my question but at some point what I, Was wondering and perhaps the violates the constructs of the conversation but I'd like to hear anyone's views on you know, how this relates to you know, you know did how does sort of spear trial and and religion relate to this and then also just in terms of you know life or death or an afterlife in those kinds of things with you know, I I just feel like they're sort of important but but I'd like to hear everyone's your use.

02:56:44
Decard also talked about that. I think it was when a meditations or something like that. I can't remember the exact title but you talked about that too and you know, even the matrix used a lot of his themes in there where you know some demon or something, you know violates your senses and you know ruins your perception of what reality actually is and then you know, how do we know you know and those kinds of things so really fascinating me?

02:57:10
In Judaism, it's called the takoon. It's something that follows you through your life here on this earth. It's a lesson that you have to learn and it continues to repeat itself until you learn that lesson.

02:57:26
Do you have all this?

02:57:30
Sorry, I didn't hear you, excuse me was the dear of multiple. And multiple to codes. Yeah. I think there's one main main theme through your life, but yeah Ben was trying to say something. I'm sorry. I interrupted. I didn't think I was if I was it was me someone.

02:57:52
I know. It's from assists. My name is Joseph my actual name. So I just just I'm just curious if anyone would want to simplify. Like, Is it is real as a universe in reality more likely to be a simulation or is it more likely to be actual actually real and are the simplified way?

02:58:16
My answer is yes. So yeah the short answer I think is yes the art the argument certain about first example was talking about is the is the first base reality argument So if you just imagine the universe grows whole bunch of intelligent life forms spring up at different places a different times and we're one of those right?

02:58:37
So the universe been around 14-ish billion years, we've we've not been around so long. One of the chances with the we're the first intelligence to create simulations because we have started crazy simulations, they're called the video games at the moment and then you can imagine those becoming more and more sophisticated to the point where they've come useful for if you can run a simulate.

02:58:54
The past then and it rolls forward to the present accurately then the simulation of the past might be quite accurate So if you wanted to know how cavemen live you could create a simulation of the world a very very high fidelity in those days running forward to today check it you go shit that's not how it turned out so you try again you try again and eventually it could fit today and therefore you could have some confidence instead of a lot of things that could go wrong but some confidence that your simulation of the caveman was right and learn something about our past.

02:59:19
So, I think intelligent being will simulate their past to learn to learn things about themselves and their Their where they came from their natural existence but the chances that we are the first intelligence civilization to create one of those simulations and the hence the simulation has a bunch of agencies just seems unlikely.

02:59:35
Why would we be the first base reality? Why would it not be that we are an agent in somebody else's simulation? That's that's a thought that a lot of people have had and it's quite just quite an interesting and simple one identification but Joseph but that's that pretty much furious saying so for example, like let's say heaven.

02:59:53
Like let's say heaven which we're all familiar with let's say that's a futuristic and advanced civilization, that's where God is. There it's there, you know God is obviously super intelligent so he created life. He decided to universe for example.

03:00:15
Yeah, and again ready player one, that would be the enthusiasm.

03:00:22
Okay thank you. The notion of reality I think is a word that we throw out there. I'm not sure. I've given the love thought and I don't know what it means. So I think it's useful to kind of wonder what we mean how we disturb distinguish between something that's real something that's what it what is not real it is a simulation creating something that's not real.

03:00:49
I mean, is it possible to live in a world which behaves like the simulation and yet have it be real and that's I think what the notion of the game. We're talking about earlier where I'm you know, we know that particles in in the real world don't actually have properties objective properties before we interact with them.

03:01:08
So we can't that deposit a question about real really is they are are they real? Yes, because when we interact with them, we get impacted by them, you know, we get hurt by them or we feel them or our devices measure them but they don't have a physical reality before we do that.

03:01:28
It's defined as well defined. So I think in short we should just really ask ourselves if we're gonna say, you know, are we living in simulation or is this world real? Well, we don't even know what that word really means. So, I don't think that that's a well-defined question.

03:01:45
Well to add value to that you know one thing we can do or through maybe a philosophical process is instead of asking what is real the eliminate what is not real so you ask yourself what is not real. I'm just do the process of elimination. This is kind of a mental of you know epistemology and everything like that where and obviously it's an arguous arguous thing, you know, there's so many data points that we have to basically disprove and that's what science has been doing for, you know, our entire you know history.

03:02:13
So we're on the process of eliminating all the possibilities of what isn't you know gonna be the fabric of a reality. Yeah, I don't think we'll be able to understand that because like we're not at the computing power with our brains like I think like we're never gonna be able to really.

03:02:34
It's those questions until we're like at that level. Well, I guess commute computers good but I just think it's like that's the whole reason because under like math stuff. I know it's very much 3M right now. I'm not gonna be giving any sophisticated answers. Thanks I was a good one.

03:02:51
You I'm really here on the Einstein's paper with IEPR paradox which some people might have heard of this this this is the paper that put forth the idea of entanglement originally and they defined they say every element that the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory.

03:03:11
But they don't actually really define element of physical reality. They need that sort of as an obvious thing but I guess what we would say in the simulation is a simulation is simulating this the feeling of physical reality whereas but it's not a real physical reality and I just don't think that there is a clear distinction between those two things.

03:03:31
Right, it's kind of like a Schrodinger's gap. Yeah, he's kind of like alive and dead at the same time until we open the box. That's an example of it, right? I think it's fascinating. Sorry Scott. Well, how would you know that it was real or not you would measure it and you get some result but that would happen in the simulation and it would also happen in the non-simulation.

03:03:55
Correct. I'm just curious like if. You know, again we're as we're under the assumption that the constraints of what we're observing and how we're observing it and how we're measuring is going to be constrained by what we know is reality. So, you know an inches, you know X amount of distance, you know, the color of the cat is this or that we're again assuming that there's some constraint that we can, you know, replicate and rectify over you know, time or whatever.

03:04:27
So I'm always curious about like again like you've mentioned speed of light, you know, is there a part of the universe where the speed of light behaves differently or to speed up light is actually covers a greater distance than but we know is that an observable can we, you know duplicate that and then again would it throw in a every thing that we know in assume into question if we were somehow able to duplicate that and observe that the speed of light is actually different than how we know it as as we know it now.

03:04:54
Brushing the absolutely wood and that would be super exciting and I'm sure there's a whole bunch of businesses scientists out there would be very scared but great excited for that to happen but just remember the basic scientific process is that you make the assumption about the northern physics being the same somewhere else but that's only the first step you then make some prediction quite carefully make some predictions about what you would see if you didn't experiment for example you point a telescope out to the sky and you look at the light from stars and you know, you look at the wavelengths and you put them on a chart but before you do any of that experiment you can predict what result you would get if you were right and more most often people aren't right and they have to adjust their prediction and adjust their assumptions.

03:05:29
So those assumptions are tested. I just want to put out there that is a it's a bit important just to understand that step that you make a prediction and you test it and you hear about the success is but a huge amount of the time people are tolling away making predictions that turn out not to be the case so remember those lines, you know, people are often trying to.

03:05:48
The the first line of attack for a lot of people on physics is to say well but maybe things can travel fashions be light, you know, maybe we can communicate instantaneously maybe entanglement means we can communicate to people in other galaxies and I think personally from my experience in the studying it that it's actually not very fruitful to try and you know tackled those fundamental laws because there's really no reason why we would think that they should fail and why we want them to fail theoretically like there's no real.

03:06:23
Motivation for the other than just saying well, we may not be right, you know, of course we may not be right but I think this really good reason why those laws can can remain what they are and we can still just cover a whole new realms of possibility like the question of whether we can quote unquote travel or communicate across galaxies.

03:06:45
Does not necessarily have to do with physically moving ourselves from here to there as fast as we can go or getting into the spaceship and you know, having generation upon generation passed by the time we get to the next star or the next galaxy. I think that there are other ways to think about it will open up to like we're learning more and more about information and what information is and so the more we can back away from the physical representation of the world in our in our cognitive map inside our heads to informational one.

03:07:17
I think the more options and flexibility. I have and that's where the idea of the simulation really becomes handy. Sure for clarity you know I'm not arguing that you know we should just ignore the laws of physics just because there may be an outlier that can disprove and like I'm not going to get my car and assume that you know, the laws of the physical, you know, physics is like don't apply to me just because some outlier I might experience them outlier event that disproves physics, you know horses still equal mass times acceleration, especially if I get the car in front of me if I don't stop I'm just saying, you know, again we're you know, talking about you know, the simulation theory and stuff like that, so I'm always curious how other people are approaching it maybe thinking outside of the lawsuit.

03:08:00
Physics as we know with the constraints as we know it, you know time and space as we know it currently and if we can actually, you know, maybe pause it something that would be outside of the realm of what we currently know yeah, yeah, I agree with that go ahead so then I guess that brings up like overarching like what are some of these new schools of thoughts that like, they don't have to be proven that just you guys generally find interesting all you find interesting yeah because like I feel like that's where innovation kind of really happens.

03:08:33
I like the dark forest theory you know I think then you may have brought up or somebody brought up you know statistically like you know that universe is so large and there's so many planets. I mean, how could we not have life how could we not have intelligent life actually if not you know over as long you know over long enough time like an intelligent speech is probably gonna come up with some type of simulation to simulate their past so I think it's called the dark horse theory where basically all these different civilizations, you know are actually an existence out there, they're just all afraid of each other because you know, we have the ability to flip.

03:09:08
The blower cells up low each other up so everybody's just kind of hiding from each other and you know with the technology that you would have them could destroy civilization and you know staff of the finger you also have the ability to have technology that could you know, cloud or disguise the civilization for other civilizations, so maybe we're not alone out there.

03:09:31
Wow interesting thoughts but before we move on to paint what's basically the thirty paradox which is why having you see aliens yet which is another fascinating topic I think is rubbing to their full discussion there is just one other thing is a romantic idea that sometimes somebody will come along and discover that physics is wrong well yes and no they will and it is everything we know about physics has the limits that we're not aware of yet, it's not that it's wrong if never equals MA there is no gravity gravity for Phantom course in the same way centrifugal forces doesn't exist but you can get on very well imagining that there is gravity.

03:10:02
You can get on really well just using a = m a and silly comments until you get into a situation where you need to you wants your argument and someone accuracy versus usefulness the reason, you know, people still think that you can yeah you can get some centigrade you found like doubling in adding 30 is that right no it's only right of one temperature is it useful as a pilot of an aircraft trying to quickly work out within a rain small range of temperatures found high to Celsius double and at 30 as a lot easier than doubling it taking the off 10 percent and adding 32, which is accurate and it's the same as the physical laws.

03:10:35
Newton's laws are wrong in also. Stands but when we learn more about them we learn the boundaries of the limitations so it's not as if it was you can come along say well numerous wrong yeah completely wrong about everything but still very very useful that the the enlightenment is when you realize the boundaries and the conditions in which it's not true so you say all the speed of lights are constant well.

03:10:55
I mean, it's not it's a lot slower in glass than it is in air it gives us right sticking a pencil in in a glass of water all you know, using a prism will show you that that's one of the reasons styling satellites can have nice low latency, it's actually quicker to send your internet signal through low Earth orbit through space and it is through.

03:11:13
It's quite a lot quicker the lighter is travels fast so you have to say the speed of light in a vacuum and then you qualify it and then until we realize the limitations of that you put on another qualifier, so if I've been saying, you know science failed it's a question of continually wrapping it for more and more qualifiers and understanding the limits of way what we currently have applied and also having the respect to realize that what you currently know will not apply somewhere like yeah, so that size just as a differentiation tank something yes, so yeah, it's like the same things like we have to vote count we have now with parameters we have now those are constantly changing.

03:11:48
Doesn't mean they're not useful now. Um, yeah, I want to try out there too just as a piece of thought the research that I'm interested in is understanding time. I think time is this maybe one of the final frontiers because. You know, we have theories which you use it pretty well but we actually don't understand it and it's such a personal thing we are all experiencing time so we sort of have the sense that we feel like we know what it is, but if you look at physical theories, it's been really the biggest headache for physicists over the years over the development of physics and our best theories of physics still are not really.

03:12:31
Complete on you know, how time really works so.

03:12:37
An example of this. May be thinking about cultures that have different notions of time like the apparitions in Australia, or I think so it's a Native American cultures that has seen time as circular or as spiral or in the aborigine case, they use the word the dreaming into emphasize it life is a dream where they experience life as a dream in which the past is not separate from the present but it's all a part of you we have this that like I have a visual of my head of the past being behind me the feature being in front of me and we sort of spatialize our Conception of time but that's simply a way of trying to understand it it's not actually true and I think that it's really interesting and fascinating places so personal to our understanding of the world.

03:13:30
Yeah, it's.

03:13:34
And Sunshine would you like to chime in and say anything? Amy? So I don't have a lot of background in this I come come at it more from a biophysics perspective. I guess really interested in is if we if we do assume that it is a simulation then what are the things we could do to optimize our health let's say knowing that it's a simulation and one of the mentors I have who is a medical doctor, but also looking at biophysics very closely things, for example that the sun is foundational to health and you know, if you think that that would be one of the inputs that give.

03:14:17
Me that. Input you know, these things that the simulation is is offering to you or that might be out there is really important to help. So, that's what kind of what I'm interested in.

03:14:32
Oh hi. My name is Sunshine and my background is in the study of consciousness and this is a really really cool discussion. Thank you for inviting me to speak. I actually was interested in a few things that were said earlier and forgive me. I forgot who said them. I think it was two different people.

03:14:54
One was about. My. Like it's simultaneous like sender receiver kind of thing and it occurred to me how I don't know how if any of you guys are familiar with the Buddhist concept of dependent originations but it's sort of like things arise and they pass away like just sort of like this flow and it and it kind of occurs to me that so much of what's going on with particles that can be into places at once and all these things that seem really trip.

03:15:37
S to our heads like if we meditate on that it's actually like it seems like it makes sense to me and this actually that ties into the overall theme of simulation and I was thinking that. Like it's just a metaphor like our brains need metaphors like everything's in metaphor like language and and even mass needs like do you point to something to describe something else and then it freaking me?

03:16:10
I know I'm going on lessons but it reminds me also of Don Hoffman's theory conscious agents theory, which. Is basically saying and apparently has enough to back it up but he's basically saying that like is a simulation and it's like, The concept of objective reality.

03:16:38
That you know.

03:16:43
Well, I think I think actually I think actually now started confused myself thinking about all this different things at once but this has been great discussions other people speak but like really think thanks so much. I really love this discussion and yeah I'm saying I'm done speaking for now thanks.

03:17:07
And I just see quick. I love that question, how can you use the idea to you in the simulation to make yourself more healthy, so it's just thinking through that, um, So I'm currently doing a very basic reinforcement learning thing a bit of fun which is getting little agents to win a flaky birds couldn't be any simpler but it's designed to you know the computer game of flaky birds and breeding thousands of little birds flying agents and most of them are crap at it and then some of them are good and the ones that are good you breed with the other ones that are good and eventually very quickly actually the computer learns to play the game at a superhuman level.

03:17:39
It's very very simple. So that is this chosen to be as simple as possible that's where I'm going to start teaching reinforcement learning. So you think a bunch of these birds you? You're just giving random parameters random behaviors most of them just depression died a few of them by luck do okay at the game of jumping through the hoops in slightly birds those ones are okay you breathe in quotes you combine with other ones that have done okay making them very similar to each other for changes and through a process of evolution within seconds as it happens on the body, you've got this thing doing better than I can ever play thank you for that many master in it the interesting thing about asking question if we're the little reinforcement agents in their game, what can we do to improve our health and by helping the chance that you don't do one of the birds of crashes and dies and the best thing.

03:18:21
I think that they could do. Unfortunately they've never had the mental capacity to see this for themselves but but let's imagine they did it's just copy their peers that are doing better than that so take the attributes of the peers that are doing better than them and copy it so somebody's healthier than you've better than you smarter than you faster than you whatever you want more than you with a big pinch of salt that if you take this property maybe you're not out of the properties of your life how to balance there's a lot to be said that just straight up R&B recently, you know, not researching development of rip off and duplicate something that somebody else has done take their take their weightings of their neural nets and implants.

03:18:58
Which is what you're doing conversations like this or by reading books or by studying other people's way of thinking you're kind of reconfiguring your neural net to be a bit more like that other person's feel better at least for the betterment in that direction, it may be worse somewhere else you sit down and based studying because you might get fat so this is always going to be a wider implication, but that's just a thought that's having something you specifically can do is just simply train yourself to learn stuff copy mimic rip off and shoot for hey, so just some thoughts.

03:19:25
I'm Ben I'm done. I'd like to add in there appreciation for the idea of dependent origination. I wish I had a look up but then once I looked up I was remembered that the idea which is really similar to what we talked about in science as well around the the non-existence of definite particle of different properties of things in the absence of actually doing the measurement and this actually ties into how I think we can make ourselves benefit from knowledge of being.

03:20:01
A simulation coming back again and this time may be more clearly in my explanation of the importance of our emotional sense of things that I think that we live in a. State of maybe confusion or delirium or we're convinced by our reality I'd say we're we tend to be convinced by our reality and part of what I mean by that is like our emotional sense of sense of self so if someone like I you could use example of someone giving you a compliment someone compliments your clothes do you say to yourself, you know, oh that's really nice yeah.

03:20:41
I guess my clothes are really nice or do you save yourself oh is it I didn't put on matching outfit today, you know, that's nice of them to compliment me, but they're just they're just trying to make me feel good, that's not really true. So we might have a way in which we identify a certain way and then somebody gives us a compliment and it doesn't really land on for us because we can't really hear it because we're already identifying with something different so I think that that it's a way in which we we have a cognitive map of ourselves and of the universe around us that doesn't reflect reality and that Don Hoffman probably agree that it's not our cognitive maps are not designed for reality, they're truth, they're designed for fitness, whatever makes us able to survive longer, but I think that we can benefit from aligning.

03:21:26
Our cognitive maps with reality and that's like Ben was saying to learn from it learn from other people's perceptions of you, you know, someone gives you feedback and you can really see through their eyes how you are being perceived that that can that can be not all the time but can be helpful to decompose some of our own self-perceptions that may not be accurate.

03:21:48
I'll stop there, thank you. And I would just say aiming for my perspective the way that like I think about how we could so so I kind of take it as this is sort of like a forgot conclusion that this is some sort of simulation. I don't know if that's the word I I tend to believe that you know, we've we've you know, we've we've consented to this experience and we're here for a reason to learn or to teach the observers.

03:22:14
I don't know but in terms of health I think of it in terms of embracing, you know, our natural reality and a natural foods and and and and just you know, Consuming, you know plants and and and it's we were to say animals about in their coolest form and in their pure sense.

03:22:36
I think that's good for health and I could I could mention a couple of medical doctors that are of a similar belief, but I'm certainly not qualified beyond what I've heard from them. Oh wonderful score you put you put my way of saying you know borrow other people's stuff would be carefully because not your life had a balance I really much more deeply by saying that basically manage the meaning you give me a kind of what I'm saying and you look at somebody else's observations either you observe something else or something else observes you but you can put a step in between which is choose the meaning you get to that thing so I think that's and then I don't really do believe we can do that.

03:23:09
I've had to do that. I've got you know mother that I love very much but she's a completely narcissist and comes up but all sorts of weird shit so I've had to put a meaning feel to him between think she says to me and and how I received them in order to.

03:23:20
To always hear you know I love you but basically I haven't got the the man of facility to to show it some of the time I literally can't you she could literally can't do it and that's fine when I understand that I got an ability to put a meaning filter in between it leads to much better relationships with my wife my kids really it's really cool to get a say okay, well that person is saying this for them it's about them how do I want to interpret that to do that rationally as well, you know to try and do it in a way that's balanced and rational so I think that's that's really that's really cool and when it comes to food yeah things are so.

03:23:53
So subjected depend on you depend on your genetics etc so I mean I can yesterday somebody was saying about some lady had lived 122 years old and she'd been smoking until she was a hundred and german she was just gonna live to 122 regardless and just have the genetics for it and so whether she had a blank diet or whether she's smoking drank what she did all life doesn't really matter.

03:24:12
I think you can probably shift the odds by by changing how you eat etc, but again provided it doesn't make you miserable if you stress the hell out of yourself by beating yourself up every time you eat something you shouldn't eat then. I think that could probably do more harm than eating just eat the shit that you want to eat.

03:24:28
Your full I mean it's just looking at it very holistically as for the whole how does your whole being adapt based on the decisions you make emotionally more than a more than anything else because I think emotional health is just just the the most important my mom right now she's got had a stroke she atrial fibrillation she does ups and downs like math but I've measured up pulse and measure upon all these different parameters.

03:24:48
I think her ups and downs are basically chronic horrible loneliness when she's on her own and got nobody to look forward to seeing she's miserable she's physically almost you know, half a week and when she's got something to do in some way to go she just miraculously jumps up and does it every time and it's becoming more and more evident it's nothing to.

03:25:03
Do with her pulse that by soft rolling up bloodstream or anything else it's just meaning and and and the desire to connect with other human beings it's so deeply important to her actual physical health it manifests in her blood pressure in her control regulation in other things, so yeah pretty fascinating thank you.

03:25:18
I wanted to ask maybe I could ask guy or been a question if so and by the way, I posted a link to many of the interesting articles including skies article about space-time passes a whole on my Twitter. I just posted actually it's a there's a there's a there's a whole bunch of links and they're all inside one link so the link to black holes.

03:25:38
Hologram is in there and if you fell into a black hole you what you might expect holograms within holograms the theory that the universe is hologram in five minutes, the our universe could emerge as a hologram and so in and then so this and then sky mentioned that you know, just talking about how multiplayer video game conserves an analogy of how the simulation might work for you to observer so that so that I linked a whole bunch of things to no man's sky, so you can see the idea of a procedurally generating universe that venom was talking about you there's a someone mentioned Josh mentioned.

03:26:13
A loop quantum gravity and geometric unity so put links there the simulation hypothesis is a link there the John John Baldridge on simulation and an illusion there's a link to that many worlds interpretation and the link to that bill stareman in quality link to that the debroad the broccoli and bone theory is linked to that this all it's all outside one link and if you look at my Twitter, you can get all these things so I'd save that for you guys but my question to Sky and or Ben is basically so it came up that um, you could have a 2D slice of you know, your perspective and that would contain what the whole universe or or.

03:26:48
The like I just reminded me of the basically the idea before your transform that I project or the of the projection slice theorem that essential slice or basically a two-dimensional slice for your slice theorem in two dimensions states that the results of the following to two calculations were equal like like basically the idea that a slice represents a 2d image represents a the 3d object or from it's like center point like I don't know if I'm explaining that correctly, but, Yeah, so I just wanted to bounce it to you guys and I'll just meet myself.

03:27:27
Thank you so much Micah so guys this room's been going for about seven hours and I am on the east coast and it's four in the morning so I'm gonna close the room. I'm going to do another one next Sunday because this is going really well. I have a lot of things I'd like to talk about as well, which I I love that.

03:27:45
I haven't been able to interject it's been awesome so if you guys want to come, you know, thank you so much if you guys want to come next Sunday, I'll do it at 9 o'clock again, we'll do a simulation too if they haven't tomorrow can I just invite people at 6 pm Pacific time and we're gonna do a Ruby on interpretations of quantum mechanics to y'all.

03:28:10
Thank you. Amy very much and everybody else thank you thank you thanks guys, okay, so I'm gonna close the room wake up the phone back before we close around. I'm in Tennessee East Coast. I mean, so so 6 am 6 pm. Pacific okay, thanks. All right, thank you everyone see you next week sky.

03:28:38
I'll see you thank you yeah bye.
