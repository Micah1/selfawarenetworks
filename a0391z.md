(emotion, observer, perception) perhaps every thought, notion, emotion, wish, byte of information, object, space, photon, molecule, atom, thrust, force, person, car, snail, cell, rock and sock is at once one with the true geometry of spacetime unfolding in time but manifesting outside time as a single shape more faceted and complex than our normal sensory perception will ever reveal, and perhaps we can know it through the understanding of physics, and perhaps we do know it, at least a part of it already.

Perhaps the geometry of spacetime is the explanation for why there are people wondering why people exist. Imagine that this geometry is so much more complicated than it appears to be, so much so that it seems to be increasing in complexity from one perspective, and at the same time increasing in entropy from another perspective, and y...et from a 4th dimensional perspective it appears to be not moving at all.

Is the observer reality?

Yes. Is it creating reality? Is it creating itself? I don't think so.

The geometry of spacetime is enough, and there is no need for anymore explanation because the geometry of spacetime is enough. Just as the geometry of water explains the ocean, and how the geometry of gravity explains why there are planets and stars and galaxies?

Imagine that most of the time space is seemingly empty, and everyonce in a while it seems like something is there, and in fact something is there temporarily when that matter and anti-matter splits apart, Then a certain anti-matter particle decays a slightly slower rate then it's matter opposite for a very long time, and the entire universe is gradually changed by this continuous event, complexity gradually increases according to a geometric pattern everywhere. At the same time entropy is increased by the increasing complexity in a viciously feeding circle of chaos and attraction.
