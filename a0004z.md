Introduction to Diffusion Models for Machine Learning

What is interesting is that an image is reduced to noise in steps, is the neural network learning the image at each step as it is reduced to noise? Is that how it is able to reconstruct images from noise.

It is thought that brainwaves are gaussian like pink noise, in sync, but essentially not containing information, so the action potentials I argue define the information from the incoming synapses, and the noise is actually attractors driving oscillatory neural activity.

The tonic oscillatory noise I argue provides for the ground of being, awareness, raw experiential conscious expectation that new information from our senses and the content or patterns inside our mind arise from.

In that sense Stable Diffusion is a better analogy for how our minds create representations of reality, how our minds are capable of hallucinations, dreams, out of body experiences, drug induced altered states of mind, spiritual experiences, visions, and experiences that we might call episodes of in the zone creativity, inspiration, and or imagination.
