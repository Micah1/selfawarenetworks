So the last puzzle piece of the human mind.
It's about how ideas relate to one another, its about the brain is sort of strobing through different pathways that light up different representations of what we could be doing that predict future consequences from our actions based on what we choose to do.

As I mentioned before our brains playback neural firing and this firing represents the patterns of information that the sequences of our conscious minds are made out of on the inside from our perspective.

The neuron is projecting its phase change, that represents the pattern that its network position + synaptic connections represent as they respond to incoming stimulations by changing the synaptic connection patterns and thus representing developing high dimensional patterns in the brain that other down stream neural arrays (the neural array is the set of neurons in the exit terminals inceptive field (like the reverse of a receptive field))

So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establishes a recurring oscilllation that allows long term memories to form.

One idea is that if neurons end up firing together, they will absorb each other, and from then onwards, unless their pattern is disrupted by other neurons, they will tend to fire together, like a repeating oscillation, so that even if they become disconnected they can maintain the appearance of cooperating as the same pattern at a distance, we see this with patterns in the left and right visual cortex that fire in synch with one another at great distances. Besides interneurons, these distance coupled oscillators are sending and receiving patterns with decoupled oscillators that have different scale and different speed, so patterns can be transferred from one oscillator to another, and a change in one distant oscillator would be felt by the other distant oscillator because the change would result in a change to the oscillators inbetween them. Every oscillator in the brain is an array that can sense the output of other oscillators in addition to tracking neural circuit firing within itself. This makes the whole brain aware of many different patterns each represented in different locations by different oscillators, sort of like a distributed graph of internal representations that make up the representations of everything you can sense and be aware of in your reality.
At this point the book "A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins" becomes useful in terms of its descriptions of what cortical columns might be doing in sort of encoding information in a way that is functionally isomorphic to the interplace between grid cells and place cells in the entorhinal cortex.
A cortical column might represent your hand on a coffee cup, tracking its orientation & position in space, it would anchor firing patterns that represented the properties associated with that cup, such as its heat, its texture, where your fingers are on the cup, how heavy it is, what the contents taste like, somehow that neural column would fire the slowest at its highest levels to maintain the concept of the cup along with its position & orientation in space, what changes rapidly in the lower levels of the cortical column are the things like the changes to the position/orientation of the cup, changes to your finger positions, changes to the cups weight, in other words the concept of the might be sitting in the top of the cortical column, and the particular properties of that cup might be tracked by the lower layers of the cortical column, this is like how grid cells might track which room you are in, but they do not change a lot, whereas places cells would track your movement, position, and orientation in that room, and they would change a lot, because they represent temporary patterns that are mostly driven by perception or your incoming sense, while the higher layer or grid cell maintains the map, and its firing is a lot more stable, this grid cell place cell interplay is something you can imagine as you walk about an outdoor location or an indoor location, the place changes slowly if you are walking, but your head position & orientation are sending much newer updates to the bottom of your cortex where the sensory input comes in. The idea is that each thing in your environment is represented by a cortical column, and you might also have multiple cortical columns across each region of the neo-cortex creating their own representation of whatever you are focused on. So cortical columns in the auditory cortex are going to model the acousitic representations of the object you are focusing on, the visual cortex will render or model visual representations of the object you are focused on, and the somatosensory cortex will model the mechanical vibrations of touch, taste, and what you can sense inside your body. All of these areas are fed information from thalamic nuclei that are connected to your sensor arrays in your eyes, ears, skin, tongue etc. The nose has its own special pathways, four of the five skip the thalamic nuclei, but none of the other senses do that.
At the top of each cortical column, in the fifth layer of six layers, the pyramidal cells extend to one another with interneuron inhibitory networks, the default mode network connects cortical columns across the brain together, the pathways for cortical connections include thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, and long interneurons. The cortex is also connected together and held together with glial cells, and the total pressure of the physical space of all these cells is stabilized by the skull the word for this is tensegrity.  

In short the brain acts as a series of arrays, that create a series of screens, out of phase changes in oscillating networks, they rendering consciousness in the oscillations and distribute the computation of those oscillations to other arrays of neurons, spreading patterns around the brain, so the whole brain learns to see all the patterns generated by all areas of the brain, and then based on its synaptic memory it creates new representations that evolve or develop our memory-predictions in to new renderings or predictions of the future that we react to, as if presented with choices. Here is orange juice, here is coffee, which one does the brain choose? The brain renders both futures, what sipping orange juice is like, what sipping coffee is like, the brain then reacts to one of those futures, probably the future that was the most stimulating, because energy flows where it is the most stimulating. So the best future you can imagine is what you will work towards, and the worse future you can imagine is what you are pushing away from. In a sense your fears are meant to help reorient you to what you want to be focused on, which is on using your action-perception cycle.
