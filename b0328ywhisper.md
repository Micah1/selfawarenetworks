Title: Parkinson's chat

Transcribed with OpenAI's Whisper

Welcome doctor, working the back end of medicine, learned a lot about what innovative and preventative care could do.

Started a company to help others provide preventative care using digital health technology.

Thank you for adding up.

Alright, and let's see, alright, and I guess Terry, Terry did step down or did you want to come back up? I see a hello message from Terry, hi.

You're always welcome, I'll send you an open invite, you can accept it anytime. So, I'm really optimistic, hello Terry.

I'll invite Ivy up here too.

Alright, well, I'm not sure, did you want to say, maybe introduce yourself a little bit Terry before we go on? I don't know if you have any audio issues or anything?

Yeah, it's true.

Okay, so I started a group on Facebook, it's called neurophysics and medical research, and I'm starting to share some stories there,

and basically news stories about, in general, research that in some cases is many years old about Parkinson's disease.

Go ahead Terry.

I don't know if you're having a technical difficulty with your audio system, Terry, but let me go ahead and change the situation here.

So I think that the protein folding situation with AlphaGo, with using a neural network to discover, to basically create a map between gene sequences and the 3D shapes that can be produced by proteins is a big step forward.

Obviously that has to continue to where we can understand what cellular communication sequences at the genetic level can lead to the formation of specific receptor shapes, specific cell types.

This is like massive future work that has to be, we're going to need even bigger computer systems than we have today to sort of get to the point where we can have a neural network basically discover point by point,

what are all the messages that cells need to communicate to go from basically taking the existing genetic code and building a person out of that code.

Because all of that has to do with basically unlocking these cellular functions through the communication between cells.

And when that goes wrong, we have all these diseases, which I think is what I've recently been focused on is all these links between these different major diseases that we have.

There are proteins that are being identified that link together cancer and neurodegenerative diseases and vascular diseases.

There could be some really profound discoveries ahead of us in the near term by using neural networks to accelerate research in biology so that the computer can look for basically patterns in a way that is just sort of tireless compared to,

you know, human researchers needing to try to figure out things because they're like automating the process of looking for patterns that help us to, you know,

because we see papers like this protein called FMNL2 and that has recently been linked to both Alzheimer's and vascular disease and cancer including colorectal and breast cancer.

And, you know, there's, there is, and the point of what I'm saying is like, yeah, so researchers identified this, but we can, but this took a long time and when we are using neural networks to help us identify proteins that are sort of broadly involved in a lot of different illnesses,

that's like the search for new treatments and new targets for therapy is being accelerated by computers and by advances in technology.

And so that is the reason to be optimistic. I'll just yield the floor if anyone wants to comment on that.

No, I think that that's very interesting. I have a question, because I tend to favor some kind of new research that's been building that it's that maybe the microbiome or and or low grade infection underlies a lot of conditions.

And I'm thinking it's not necessarily mutually exclusive with what you're talking about. But if you have stressors from this sort of low grade infection, or call it microbiome, dysbiosis if you want, whichever, I don't know,

that it could cause stress on the cells and, you know, cause different malfunctions. And I don't know what you think of the growing literature on on L form bacteria for one thing, or there's some research on both bacteria and fungi in the brain of some of these conditions.

Anyway, just some thoughts.

Let me think. Well, I think that in terms of causes, I think that that's right on target that basically anything that can get in there into the brain to stress out our cells might cause malfunctions, right?

So, so we could be talking about bacteria or fungi, or we could be talking about just inflammation resulting from a virus resulting from physical injury resulting from.

So, I mean, I generally agree that, you know, if you're putting a lot of mechanical stress on a cell from, you know, it's being attacked by bacteria or fungi or viruses specifically, including COVID that that might cause malfunctions.

Yeah, I agree. That is definitely a cause. Even I think some, some, when people can, you know, if someone consumes some sort of food or drug that is not good for their body, that might also be a contributing factor to diseases.

So, yeah, I think that's right on target.

Yeah, so you're probably familiar with the work of Rudy Tamzi. And then there's also somebody who put out a contest for called germ quest for Alzheimer's disease.

He was like a former CDC researcher and, and then they, they had a business they made a lot of money. So he put out a million dollar reward for someone who could find an Alzheimer's microbe, you know, as a cause.

But he ended up, I found out he ended up dividing it among six different people because no one really proved that it was any one thing, but they submitted proposals that were fairly convincing on the role of several different microbes.

And so then he compared Alzheimer's, maybe it's like pneumonia, you know, it has a lot of different causes.

So anyway, I'm done.

Sadiq, do you have thoughts on that one?

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

Oh, I was, I wanted to see if, if.

Unfortunately, this, the detail of that is not my expertise. So my brother is doing the biomedical engineering and my sister's doing the nanotechnology master.

So they could more talk about the cellular scientific level of that. But for myself, I am, I'm more of a know more of the care management of a holistic approach.

So not too much input on that. Sorry.

All right. I think I'm in agreement with Joyce that there's, there's potentially multiple things that can, that can cause disease.

And so yeah, I'm going to look up so germ quest and you said Rudy Tansy. How do you spell that?

Yeah, Tansy, T-A-N-Z-I, he's at Harvard. And I actually was lucky. I actually, through that germ quest thing, I heard about an NIH workshop.

No, it's a National Institute of Aging workshop online. And Rudy Tansy spoke and a number of other people.

And it was all focused on the role of infections in Alzheimer's or maybe it was just more general dementia in general.

And I actually was especially excited about this researcher, Dr. David Corey from Baylor.

And that research I don't think has been published yet, but I keep looking for it because he found using kind of novel methods, bacteria and fungi in the brain in a very unusual sort of arrangement.

He said, I don't know what he called it, something like Lycanosis. Is this the bacteria and fungi we're living in, you know, in mutualistic relationship, like in a lichen.

But he also referred to the work of Luis Carrasco, who was a Spanish microbiologist who's now retired. But he's written a lot of articles about his research finding fungi and bacteria that were quite different in the brains of various conditions of the brain mostly.

And he's so he referred to Dr. Carrasco's work and then I've heard of another researcher in Scotland who who's working along those lines.

And then there's a researcher at Oxford that I was kind of excited about hearing his research is progressing.

His name is Carl Morton, M-O-R-T-E-N. And he's having a collaboration now with this laboratory in Utah that's developed a an improved method of culturing L form bacteria.

And, you know, L form bacteria are, you know, there's sort of latent form, you know, if you give you give antibiotics that go after the cell wall, or there's other stressors that can do it too.

It caused bacteria to turn into L forms a lot of the time, and then they can come back and cause problems.

But anyway, this laboratory in Utah is collaborating with them and doing doing research in chronic fatigue syndrome and also some other conditions.

And anyway, I thought video that he that he put out recently, I guess it was in September where he was talking about their plans for their study and it should be going by now.

So I'm excited about that because I've been interested in L form bacteria for a long time.

There's a researcher who's no longer alive now. She did her work over decades.

And she wrote a book called Stealth Pathogens. Her name's Lida Matman.

And there's been a lot of work on it, but just not enough work, though, you know, been a lot of work, but, you know, just not enough focus on it because they're hard to culture.

Okay, so yeah, so that's, I think that's where I'm sort of optimistic is that we can accelerate the work of studying the functions and misfunctions of cells with neural networks.

And that would include studying how pathogens affect how fungi affect cells and so on.

Yeah, you know, Rudy Tanzi is doing work on Alzheimer's at kind of several different levels. This is kind of interesting.

He talks about like three different stages. The early stage where things are going bad is when the diet, he thinks, alters the microbiome.

And then the middle stage is where the plaque is developing. And he's working on drugs against that, too.

And the final stage is where the inflammation kind of takes over. And there's another drug that, but he's also interested in using those, I guess they call them organoids or something, where you make a little brain.

Yeah, I know about that.

Yeah, I think he uses that. And he originally made some important genetic discoveries, which I think sort of launched his career and that kind of research, but he's kind of branched out to, and he's also very interested in the role of infections.

But I think he's focusing a lot on the virus at the moment. Whereas I think, you know, I think there's, like you say, you know, I think there's multiple pathogens, but I tend to think the bacteria and the fungi may be more of a role.

And the viruses come along when the system's really weakened. But there should be all sorts of situations.

Well, so is the thought of how the fungi is sort of causing a disruption of the cell, do you think that's linked directly with the misfolded proteins, like the alpha-synuclein, do you think?

Yeah, I don't know the details of the molecular aspects of it, but Luis Carrasco, he may have done something in Parkinson's more in that level, but I know, well, you know that amyloid beta is thought to be an antimicrobial peptide.

So I don't know enough of the molecular level to know how that ties into the misfolded proteins. But is the amyloid beta misfolded? Or I can't remember. It's cleaved differently, as I recall.

The amyloid beta, okay, let me pull this up on my computer. I've also read a book by Dale Bredesen. I don't know if you've heard of him.

Let me pull up his, how do you spell his last name, Bredesen?

He was a long time researcher in Alzheimer's in the laboratory, but he happened to be married to a woman who was into like nutrition and functional medicine. And eventually he got very frustrated in trying to find a drug, you know, just failure after failure.

And so he started looking at it differently and decided that there were a lot of things that could be done to combat a lot of different things that go wrong in Alzheimer's.

And he even talks about something like there's 36 different problems. And if you just try it, you know, to come up with a drug and attack one of them, you're not going to get anywhere.

And so he came up with this comprehensive approach and he's published on it. And he's doing another trial because he had trouble with the IRB because they didn't want to do a study that had multiple interventions.

And he says, you know, but if you need the multiple interventions, then you have to do that. And that finally he got an IRB that he's he's published a lot of case reports of reversing Alzheimer's.

And you can you can find them if you if you look that he they finally he got them to allow him to do, you know, to get an IRB so he could do a regular study.

Yeah, I mean, I so I mean, I just started really digging into I was looking at I was I was looking at the brain in terms of trying to understand how how LTP and LTD, you know, long term memory and and forgetting

like work in a very precise way and and that sort of like led me to like looking at dementia and Alzheimer's and then and now Parkinson's and a lot of and now generally speaking neurodegenerative disorders and their causes and like the whole chain and the link and so like,

you know, the what what you're saying about like I didn't I didn't in terms of there being 31 different things going wrong. I haven't gotten that far on my research, but I have been like, yes, it's there's issues going going on with with with

misfolded proteins and with the receptors on the cells, malfunctioning and with the the the, you know, with neurons dying, the like, like the a neurons dopamine neurons dying in certain in very specific places in the brain.

And then and then, you know, there's like new research that that says that speculates that the reason DBS works is because it's it's there's a there's like a brainwave entrainment effect happening from the DBS machine and certain frequencies.

It's really causing the it seems to be like in training that the the neurons that weren't that weren't firing to sort of like fire again and and and so like I think of I think of I'm thinking of the disruptions that are that are happening to the

biology on the on the, you know, to the tissue, it's leading to it's it's like a it's like a it's like a receptor disease, it's that's, you know, it's also killing neurons.

And there's like all these different points of like, you know, it started with the misfolded protein and now the now the cells not firing correctly.

And now that is that is like why there's this, you know, these these problems that show up on the on the symptomatic side, because, you know, the patient is not able to function the way they used to function.

And they're not able to move their hands and arms the way they used to move them or, you know, in the case of dementia, they're they're not all they're not all there their memory is not all there.

And so, you know, it's like the differences between these different neurodegenerative diseases are sort of like which proteins are are misfolding and in collecting and becoming Louis bodies or or

you know, becoming basically protein deposits like like like amyloid beta protein deposits right and like and where it's happening it's like it's like which which proteins are and where they're which part of the brain is being affected.

And like why is this part of the brain being affected but then that's now like contributing to cellular miscommunication or or or specifically like timing issues and the firing of neurons that is treated with things like DBS and and also they there there's

been some experiments where they they can play music to people who have Alzheimer's and they can see that the patient can temporarily sort of come back a little bit from listening to the music and that would be similar to to the concept of brainwave

entrainment where you're getting those neurons sort of like fire in the right sequence timing sequence again. And that stores some functionality to the patient that they that they lost at least temporarily.

And so I'm sort of like really interested in and in John Leaf's work, you know, he wrote the book the secret language of cells, because he sort of like says well let's move move the focus on biology to basically the communication between neurons and and

I'm sorry the communication between cells, not neurons, but any cells. Because there is sort of like that's where like maybe the point of study to where we can we can we can bring in the the people from from from the artificial neural

network side of things that the computer engineers to sort of like do this biology work to to accelerate it by having a computer look for the things that we used to have neuroscientists and biologists looking for.

And but there's I think that that, you know, that's sort of like that conversation is beginning between, you know, between the folks who do, you know, artificial neural networks and the folks who study, you know, biology.

And it needs to keep keep continuing and that's sort of like what I wanted to sort of like maybe start a conversation around. So thanks for thanks for coming Joyce. And everybody else.

Yeah, you know, I think that's very interesting. I think, you know, interesting stuff will come out that is actually my perspective about the basic biology and understanding how it works.

My own perspective, though, is that, you know, that that I think we'll get more, we'll get farther in really getting to the root cause in other ways.

You know, we might come up with drugs that do something and maybe a some benefit, but I don't personally don't think they'll be the root cause they might help some.

Like you said, the deep brain stimulation, you know, it helps some that, you know, wasn't anything like a cure or something.

It was interesting about Dr. Corey, he came from a kind of respiratory illness background, and he discovered that at least in where he lives in Houston, Texas that fungi kind of basically a fungal infection

probably underlies a lot of asthma. And it's interesting that asthma is a big predisposition for Alzheimer's and having worse Alzheimer's.

But anyway, it turns out that the fungi are not being detected because, you know, he was able to detect them by altering the technique.

But he said he found out the mucus is very good at killing the fungi. And so when you sample the normal way, you're taking the fungi out with the mucus and you get, you don't get anything alive.

And so he figured out how to do it without killing them. And so then he could culture them.

But anyway, that's my own perspective. But I'm sure that these two lines of research will come together and it will all make so much sense someday.

Yeah, 100%. That's how fungi even like, so one interesting thought that I have is that, you know, we could sort of like, okay, let's say that I was reading this, I was looking at this paper that was about how

I think it was, I think it may have been ultrasound or how mechanical vibrations could basically cause nuclear deformations or basically they can impact the nucleus of a cell.

And that will trigger the cell to unlock a certain response, like the cell will respond based upon how you, on the signal you've given its nucleus.

And so it would be interesting to say, okay, well, if there's a fungi that basically can produce a certain response from a cell, because at some point a signal goes from the fungi to the nucleus of the cell and that produces a cell to have a certain response where it does a certain thing.

Maybe it creates a new protein and a new cell receptor, or maybe it misfolds a protein, so we'll find out what that is.

But if we could say, all right, well, this fungi affects the cell nucleus and it produces this result and this ultrasound vibration affects the nuclei and produces the same result.

And basically we can say that, you know, we can start to describe, okay, well, now there's a similar pattern between the emerging from the cell if you stimulate it with signals from the fungus or signals from ultrasound or signals from some chemical.

And that causes the cell to exhibit the same behavior because in some way, on the tissue level, there's an isomorphism between these different signals.

They're causing the cell to respond in a specific way that's the same way.

And so at that point, the treatment could be a chemical or it could be ultrasound or like a mechanical vibration or it could be, you know, maybe it's a message that's basically a piece of RNA or it could be just a T cell that has been configured

like the way they're configuring, you know, T cells with immunotherapy to basically the T cell identifies the cells that are problematic and then it transmits the particular message that the deep learning neural networks have identified that will trigger the cell to behave in the way we want the cell to behave in order to cure the illness.

And so that's sort of like what I'm looking for is, you know, to bring in the fungal research with all this other research, it might be a way to sort of like look for isomorphisms between different ways of communicating with the cell,

but also compare and contrast to find out which way of interacting with the cell is going to be the most fruitful for the outcome that we want, for the outcome in terms of like either telling this, either instructing the cell to exhibit the behavior that we want,

or to identify and destroy cells that are diseased beyond the point of fixing them if that's the approach that the doctor wants to go through for treatment.

Now, you know, and for one thing at this stage of things, if I'm not sure whether one could reverse the kind of infection, you know, assuming that Dr. Corey and Dr. Cross goes correct, that a very elderly person might not be able to withstand treatment to kill the microbes.

So they might be able to just use some method to kind of ameliorate the effects, you know, using something like you're talking about.

But I would really, you might really be interested in like reading Dr. Bredesen's book because it's fairly easy to understand, or if you don't want to read his book, he's actually on a lot of interviews and podcasts and stuff.

There's a kind of summary view of it because he talks about, you know, blood sugar, insulin is a big factor.

He talks about several different types. He calls them types of Alzheimer's based on their data they collect on people and their responses to treatment.

That's really interesting types of Alzheimer's. I'm looking that up. I wanted to ask you, Joyce, what, let me type this types of Alzheimer's real quick.

What, how do I spell Dr. Crisco's, Dr. Criscan's name?

Oh, Carrasco. It's C-A-R-R-A-S-C-O.

Okay, Lewis Carrasco.

I've actually corresponded with him and he's got actually a couple of books that he wrote after he retired that are available on Amazon that are fairly easy reads because they're meant more for non-specialists.

Oh, do you have maybe one of the names of the books just so I can make sure I got the right guy?

Um, you know, I might still have it in my bio. I had his...

Oh.

Let me see what I got in my bio right now.

Yeah, I've got Rudy Turnsey in the bio. Yeah, neurodegenerative diseases and the human microbiota.

Awesome. I see that in your bio. I'm looking at it right now.

Lewis Carrasco. Great. I just did a screenshot so I can look this up.

Great. So these are people you're very familiar with. So this is a topic that you like a lot. That's great.

Yeah, well, I'm interested in all sorts of diseases but I have a feeling that these hard to detect microbes could underlie a lot of diseases.

So I think they underlie chronic fatigue syndrome. You know, this research I was mentioning, Carl Morton.

Carl Morton.

Carl Morton, M-O-R-T-E-N.

Okay.

Is it Carl with a K?

Yeah, K-A-R-L.

I just watched this YouTube video that he, you know, in a few minutes I could get you the link to the YouTube video if you're interested,

but you might be able to find it if you Google it.

But I think I Googled L-form bacteria, Oxford, Carl Morton, and I think this YouTube video came up.

Okay.

I'm really excited about his research. I was so excited about it that I wrote to, I don't know if you know, the Open Medicine Foundation.

It's devoted to solving chronic fatigue syndrome and related conditions, and they've raised a lot of money.

And I've been in contact with the person who's in charge and some, and so I sent information to her and I said,

you know, would you be interested in helping fund them?

Because they were talking in the video about how they were struggling to get money.

And they even talked about the Open Medicine Foundation saying, yeah, they've raised so much money.

They have a full-time staff helping them.

So I'm hoping that they'll decide to help them.

And she replied to me, because she seemed interested.

Nice. Yeah, I'm interested. You said the name of a research group just now, and I was going to write it down, but I was...

Yeah, Carl Morton.

Yeah, I found his name and I found his crowdfunding campaign understanding the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalitis.

And I was talking about Open Medicine Foundation.

Open Medicine Foundation.

Yeah, Open Medicine Foundation.

It's headed, well, I don't know exactly who heads it, but the research effort is headed by Ron Davis,

who's actually a famous scientist.

He heads the Human Genome Institute at Stanford.

Oh.

And his son has a very severe case of ME-CFS.

Okay.

They're doing a lot.

And Linda Tannenbaum is the one I was mentioning.

She teamed up with him.

She was trying to raise money and was not having much success.

But then when she got him involved, it was able to bring in more money, I think,

because he knows all these Nobel Prize winners and he was able to help bring in a lot of money,

along with her help.

Okay.

So I have Linda Tannenbaum on my screen and I'm just...

She's the CEO and president of the Open Medicine Foundation.

Great.

Right.

She had her own laboratory and her daughter, I think, got chronic fatigue syndrome.

That's when she got involved.

Okay.

Have you heard...

So I've been using, on the topic of CFG,

chronic fatigue syndrome, or as we...

CFS.

I've been using deribos supplements for years and that's...

It's been helpful for me taking deribos.

I used to take a lot of supplements, but at a certain point,

I realized that I was just too sensitive to tolerate them.

They just made me worse because I reacted to them.

And so that's what led me eventually to have to go this totally different route

to try to figure out the source of the sensitivities,

which turned out to be good because I discover a lot of things

and I think I may be able to help a lot of people.

Do you want to talk about some of the things that you've discovered?

Because I'm totally curious.

Okay.

Well, there's this book I learned about a long time ago called The Pulse Test

by Dr. Arthur Koka, who was a prominent immunologist.

He was the head of a major medical laboratory for 17 years,

that later was part of Pfizer.

He founded the Journal of Immunology and so on.

But at a certain point, he actually had various health difficulties.

He and his wife discovered the fact that the heart rate was affected by reactions to foods.

And so he ended up doing research.

He wrote books, he wrote articles.

But I learned about a book that he wrote in the 1950s late in his career

when he found out that the scientific establishment wasn't going for it, you know,

even though other people verified what he found.

But anyway, he wrote a book called The Pulse Test that my mom brought home from the library.

She worked to the library.

Anyway, later on, I mean, I found that his test didn't work that well for me

because I just reacted to everything.

And so it didn't get very far.

But eventually I found out about another version of it that you could do,

that was a shortcut test.

So he had you test your heart rate 14 times a day.

And that really wasn't very helpful when you reacted to everything

and then there's delayed reactions and so on and so on.

So the shortcut test, I improved upon it,

learned a lot about cross reactions between different foods

and different foods and inhalants and everything.

And so eventually I learned ways of reducing the reactions.

And then this last year, I realized, actually, it was like a year and a half ago,

I got an Apple Watch because I'd heard that it was pretty accurate.

And so I thought, well, maybe I should, you know, I could learn something using the Apple Watch.

And so I started making observations with that and it was very helpful.

And I realized that a better way of figuring out the food reactions

was to actually just have it like on the activity tracker while you were eating

and that there was a fairly abrupt increase in the heart rate,

about 20 seconds after you ate the food, but it varied a lot.

If I didn't react, it would only go up a couple beats a minute.

But if I reacted more, it would go up like 10 or 15 beats a minute.

And so I looked into it and I realized that I could actually patent this method

and I could have an app that would help people identify food reactions.

And I think it could make what Dr. Koka realized much more accessible

and maybe even mainstream, I hope, because can you really argue with that data?

I mean, some people probably will. They'll say, oh, it's psychological or something, but I know it isn't.

So anyway, I'm doing this for humanitarian reasons.

I have to do it because I got better and I feel like it can help a lot of people,

so I have to figure out a way to do it.

Even though I'm not a business person, it's not really in my DNA,

but I'll do whatever I need to do to try to get this out to people

and then hopefully kind of leverage the app, which is, of course, easier to get out there

to develop my other method into a device.

You can do it manually, but I figured that having an automated way would be better,

especially for people who aren't as well.

So anyway, I'm not really a business-focused person either.

I'm more on the research side and interested in discovering new concepts

and sort of more on the researcher side of things.

But that sounds like a promising idea. I hope you pursue that.

Oh yeah, well, I have to pursue it. I don't have any choice in the matter.

That's the way I look upon it.

Very cool.

I'll tell you the other thing, that if you look at Dr. Koka's book,

how many different symptoms were helped, you'll be astonished.

And I'm sure he's reliable because I've confirmed it, plus it was confirmed by other people too.

But in addition to that, there are numerous many, many studies

and several meta-analyses showing that resting heart rate elevation is associated

with all-cause mortality, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and various other conditions.

And Koka was able to lower people's resting heart rate, and I have lowered my own resting heart rate.

So in the research studies with the meta-analyses and all, at least some of them controlled for exercise.

So it wasn't just fitness lowering the heart rate. That was the issue.

Yeah, so that's finding a match between heart rates and the different foods that people eat.

That's really a great study.

And if I could share some other ideas, it's any kind of sensor that you can put into a watch

that you can use to combine with the heart rate data to look for correlations

that basically have the computer create a log of observations that might have medical value.

So just to sort of brainstorm with you.

In my provisional patent, I tried to think of all the different possible kinds of measurements you could use.

And actually, I'm making measurements on myself.

And you actually said something very interesting one day that, see, I am using an EEG headband also, oftentimes during my meals.

But kind of on purpose, I decided not to really study much about them because, you know,

and I know people are always going to say, oh, it's psychological.

Like, I've affected my EEG, which I would have no idea how to affect it.

But I thought if I didn't know much about what it meant, then I couldn't really be accused of somehow affecting it.

But I have noticed changes with the EEG as my sensitivities have gone down.

I remember I overheard you saying something like the delta and theta waves were indication of like lower energy in your brain or something.

Something like that.

So we always have delta and theta waves happening, but if you have a predominance of delta and theta,

that's seen more often when people are depressed or low energy or chronic fatigue or sleeping.

So that's probably close to what I was saying.

Yeah, yeah, and then I remember I heard years ago that chronic fatigue syndrome was characterized by intrusions of delta waves during the daytime

and then intrusion of waves associated with wakefulness in the night.

But the thing that I've observed, one of the things with the EEG is that it used to be almost always when I was eating things,

especially when I reacted more to them, the delta waves would go up pretty high.

And now they don't typically.

Or if they do, maybe it's just a little bit or they go up and down or something like that.

So anyway, it's an interesting journey. I continue to watch my EEG and it's been changing over time.

And it'll be interesting to see how it ends up when I completely get over the reactions, which I hope to do.

I'm still not completely over them.

I really found so I did a lot of back in between 2012 and 2014. I did a lot of work with EEG and a lot of different experiments actually.

And I think of it as if you do neurofeedback, if you just sort of like find a way to either visualize or listen to your own brain signals

or other biofeedback signals, then it is a little bit like studying your facial expressions in the mirror

or just really listening to your voice as a singer or in terms of what a person can do from studying themselves in the mirror.

Like an actor studying their own face in the mirror has sort of become more aware of how what they're doing on the inside in their brain

is causing different facial expressions to emerge or different sounds to emerge from their voice if they're practicing singing or practicing acting.

And with EEG, what I found was that the more I sort of focused on how my brain waves were changing the light and sound effects,

the more I started to understand how I was changing my brain waves.

Because then I could actually sort of like with my thoughts and feelings sort of exert some significant influence over the light and sound that I was seeing.

And so that was what I was doing for a couple of years. It was just a lot of experimentation with EEG.

So that could be something to look forward to if you decided to go deeper into EEG in the future.

Yeah, well, you know, I hope that, I feel pretty confident that someday, you know, that all of this will be figured out.

And I think it will tie into the research on the microbes because I think that I think there's an interrelationship between the food reactions and the microbes.

You know, the microbes do upregulate the immune system for one thing.

And I think what I'm doing helps normalize the microbiota in your gut and maybe even in your tissues, you know, because if you're functioning better,

you're going to be able to control infections better.

And actually, that's another thing that Dr. Koka reported on is that he looked at a whole bunch of people that worked at the laboratory that he was the medical director of.

And he was able to correlate the tendency to get colds with the level of reactions to foods.

And I know I used to get a lot more infections than I have as I've gotten better.

I've gotten hardly, I think I've had two colds in the last 12 years as I've improved.

So I think the immune functioning is affected a lot by this sort of.

Nice.

Yeah.

No, I'm optimistic that, maybe optimistic is the wrong word.

I'm curious.

That's the right word.

I'm curious about whether the research on fungal pathogens in bacteria and viruses will end up leading us to some sort of like immunotherapy,

some sort of complex immunotherapy treatment that might address a multitude of cancers and neurodegenerative disorders and heart disease and aging all at once.

Like maybe it's going to come down to once this has been figured out and mapped out that there'll be some sort of like T cell therapy.

Possible.

One of the problems is I tend to think that from what I've been reading that it's probably a lot of different microbes.

And so if you try to do the antimicrobial route, it might be difficult because it may not be that all of them would respond.

And then there's also the problem.

I actually was on an antibacterial protocol and it did help.

But the problem was that every time you were killing bacteria, you felt lousy and it seemed like it was going to take forever.

And at a certain point I had this downturn and I just couldn't tolerate trying to do that anymore.

I just didn't tolerate the medications anymore.

So killing the microbes may be difficult.

But maybe, you know, I think ideally you might be able to combine antimicrobials with some kind of immune modulation to maybe do it.

But it's going to be difficult.

But anyway, whatever happens, I think that it could be that my approach will be helpful.

It may not be the best.

I've had to do it on my own without any help of any kind, without any medication, just feeling my way through it.

But, you know, I'm thinking that sometime I'm going to probably contact this Dr. Morton and tell him what I've been doing.

And I don't know if he knows about this other protocol that I did over the years that a number of people have done.

It was published, but I don't know if he would have heard about it.

What was the name of it?

It was called the Marshall Protocol.

And actually, I have a publication in PubMed because I was volunteering for this organization that was using this protocol.

And it used five different antibiotics, but they were all at low doses, and you pulsed them.

You didn't take them every day, and you didn't take them all at once.

You had a process you went through.

The thing was that if you started out with too high a dose, you got such a bad die-off reaction.

And so, yeah, so I have a publication in PubMed that I did that came out of that volunteering.

Because several of us, we went to a conference, and that was the conference.

We went to a conference in Portugal.

And it's called...

I can't remember.

Yeah, the conference focuses on autoimmunity in general.

And so anyway, there's some things about that protocol I have a critique of, but...

I just found something in PubMed, reversing bacteria-induced vitamin D receptor.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, I think that Dr. Marshall had some things wrong about vitamin D.

But that may be something for the right, I don't know.

But anyway, yeah, that's an article I wrote about the protocol.

Yeah, so he was against using vitamin D because he thought the receptors were blocked by the bacteria.

And that the vitamin D really didn't do any good.

But I don't think he was completely right about that.

Okay, so your pro vitamin D supplements.

Well, I'm kind of in between.

I mean, I actually don't really take... I have a multivitamin, so I get some vitamin D.

I try to give it a little bit of sun, but I'm not really big on taking a whole bunch of vitamin D.

I guess it's partly because of... I don't know.

I'm kind of torn between his viewpoint that it could be even immunosuppressive at times.

Well, I mean, they know that it can be immunosuppressive, and it's really high.

But...

So I mean, I've heard that some supplements...

So there's this... I guess it's sort of a new research area of studying gradients in cells,

where gradients can help cells to have sort of an awareness of the environment.

And I don't know if that's really the right way to frame it, but with gradients, cells can...

If you have this deposit of some...

My understanding of this is a little bit limited, but if you have a deposit of some chemical gradient,

for example, that was built up because the cell consumed a lot of vitamin A or a lot of vitamin B,

this chemical gradient might then cause the cell to grow its membrane,

or it might cause the membrane of a fat sac to increase in size or decrease in size

based upon how much of this gradient has accumulated from supplements that people are taking.

And so there's different...

Sort of like emerging research and emerging mysteries around how cell behavior is affected by a chemical gradient

and how chemical gradients are sort of important for cells to be able to communicate with other cells

in a spatial way to solve certain problems or just to conduct certain functions.

Like I said, I don't want to anthrop...

Sometimes I read researchers and it sounds like they're sort of anthropomorphizing the cells

and the behaviors that are observed to some degree.

Like the cell is aware of its environment. What does that mean exactly?

Well, the cells are just like little bacteria.

I think about when the immune system is fighting the microbes,

it's like we have our two little armies.

It's almost like they're little microbes fighting each other, you know, the immune cells fighting the bacteria.

Yeah, and cancer is...

The parallels between cancer and little armies, like they're very sophisticated behaviors coming from cancer

where they colonize other cells and they have strategies, like war strategies,

and they take cells over and make the cell act against the rest of the organism.

It is sort of like tempting to sort of like think of cancer as a very intelligent enemy.

It's very sophisticated.

Yeah, the power of evolution.

Yeah, but I think that my brain is very appreciative and very thankful and very full

because we've been able to talk about a lot of stuff tonight.

Yeah, interesting conversation.

So I guess I should try to schedule another one of these soon, maybe next week or something,

and maybe we'll come back and have more to say.

Yeah, okay.

All right.

Well, thank you Joyce and Elise, and we had a comment from Ivy that was...

Ivy said there's one paper from the Australian group using ultrasound to restore memory from Alzheimer's disease

and I think it was an animal study in 2016 or 2017.

So that was in the room chat, but...

Okay.

Cool.

All right.

Well, I'll say good night.

Good night.

Yeah, see you later.

Okay.

Bye.
