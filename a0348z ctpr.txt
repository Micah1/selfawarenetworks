imagine a stereographic camera, a 3-d camera, and imagine your brain has 1080p or really high resolution image sensors right, and now imagine that each sensor captures a different part, each pixel sends a different part of the image back, a sequence plays, and everything is captured, but there is statistical effect, all the similarities in all the sequences produce patterns between different layers of this stereo graphic camera, so it's basically like a 3d video camera which statistical connections between each pixel of each frame, and the more connections that exist the clearer the pictures becomes in your mind, and each new picture is match up with the current picture because of the new statistical connections, even small parts of patterns can become huge patterns, and even small parts of patterns can be connected to huge patterns, because what happens is a sort of inferential pattern recognition, our prediction is precisely the prediction of an incoming pattern and it's statistical connection to a previous pattern. and that describes the visual part of your mind, all the other senses are done in the same way basically, and all the patterns combine to form a multisensory picture that is constantly being updated

as your awareness expands
the matrix is the mind, the films are encoded with deep layers of meaning
remember there were three worlds, the matrix, the real world, and the machine city
the represent mind, body and the mind respectively
at the cellular level it's machine city
when you unravel the metaphors bit by bit, the extensive nature of that artwork becomes "exceedingly clear"
the real world is real yes
each film is like a complete perspective, but you need all three perspectives to appreciate the art in all it's glorious dimensions
the first film represents ethos, or know thyself
ethos is character
the second film represents pathos, understanding, empathy, listening, and the theme is "control thyself"
the third film represents the logos perspective, giving, satori, or "give thyself"
all three are important because all three are just perspectives on but all three are important because all three are just perspectives on one picture
so all three manifest at the same time
as one
the mind is a process creating a dream that tells itself it is you, and not a biological computer, your identity my identity is just a program our brains made in order to survive, reproduce, and prosper
we think we are friends, but really bunches of neurons have decided to be friends, because bunches of neurons are initiating this communication channel
because there is an exchange of ideas happening
what is true from one perspective may seem completely wrong from another perspective, this is why there are no right perspectives, just perspectives
to see yourself as a computer, is to see the art of your beingness
