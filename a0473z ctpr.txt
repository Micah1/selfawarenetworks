Micah Blumberg it means your self is an on the fly calculation and thus there is nothing to upload

Chris Hennick How does that follow from a study like this? And why not upload whatever function *generates* what you call my "selves", so that it can digitally generate more future selves for me?

Micah Blumberg look the neurons are like switches, adapting to any task, did you read the part about selection vectors and line attractors? It doesn't make sense to you after that? Here is a quote

"If question was about motion, the selection vector directed motion information to the line attractor, and the artificial neurons chose left or right."

see the neurons are just adapting themselves, lending themselves to any kind of calculation, they don't have identities, they take on representations, wearing representations, being the color, being the left or right motion, being the line attractor, or the selection vector

being you is just another line attractor, who you are in this decision right now is up to some selection vector, it's like a universal computer, able to calculate anything dynamically by being free of a static identity

I guess this can really be hard to accept if you have other reasons for why you need to have a self, why you need to be uploaded, fear perhaps?
