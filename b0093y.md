I just had the idea of like imposter cells or basically, they would appear to be a person, but they would really be like a monster sort of like the video game fray from 2017, where like his coffee mug, like turned into this like multi-dimensional monster that had like tentacles or something, but it was all made of smoke and it sort of like attacked him and tried to eat them.

00:25

And I just think that like I just imagined that the basically that there could be an alien that like looks like a person until it looks like close to. And you realize it's not a person. It's just like mimicry of someone and I was imagining. 

00:48

So locked in patients, you know, and locked in patients, like how can we help to raise patients? Who, you know, even people who've been diagnosed as brain dead and potentially are brought back with with the knowledge of how consciousness is really working. And you know, I'm since so what I'm suggesting is is that if repair can be done to whatever is inhibiting, the global brain activity and the oscillatory behavior of networks can be, could be stimulated to you back to activity again, then patience to have varying degrees of disability because of impaired.

01:50

Brain activity could potentially be restored and communicated to you and not so, not just walk-in patients, who are? But patients, who are, you know, injured and in a way that they may have have, it might be paralyzed after a spinal injury or something. And so the knowledge of the protocols of the network.

02:25

So, neurons and the nature of the have these oysters oscillating networks might might might yield some, some innovative treatments. I hope with, you know, we could get creative with combining AI with VR and AR and other biosensors. In order to create new clients, communication pathways for people who have varying degrees impaired of impaired functionality.

03:11

This can have medical value for for people whose you know, in situations where they're imperative is leading them to to have to be in and stressful situations where they were, they, they may have caused harm to themselves or to others in the past, understanding exactly how the brain produces for.

03:43

Not the phenomenal. It's so consciousness and and how to repair, it means a lot to people who are around the world, who are suffering from from a variety of different stuff. Cognitive illnesses. So it's it's not this is this book is a few. I see it is like a few extra links.

04:09

It's a proposal for how things might fit together. And in in some cases these are these are that a lot of the ideas need to work. A lot of ideas need to be developed further and we need to have basically some some additional facts established with years of potentially years of research, that's enhanced.

04:43

I want to say that we have centuries research ahead of us but with the advancements and artificial intelligence sensors, to research could be turned to could become really dressed really, it could become just a week of research. So so, let's, you know, that's a little bit. There's a little bit of humor and that, you know, obviously the, the physical component of research is significant.

05:22

A lot of studies involve a lot of highly coordinated movements. And that is sort of one of the bandwidth factors on on how fast medical innovation. Can advance is just there's a lot of logistics involved with studies but but there's a huge amount of like so studies cost a lot of money, scientific studies cost a lot of money.

05:54

And the studies that we really want to do involving millions of millions of people participating in a study, that is done in a very consistent way, in a very methodical way such as the child minus to like that. That study could be, could be expanded. Ideally, sorry, which way are you going that way?

06:19

Okay, go ahead. So, that's study, could be expanded. I mean that I would love to see like China, you know, sort of trying to has really this massively impressive operation in existence for, for, you know, that we saw at work. You know, in the post covid-19 era, with how they retire trying to react, or to covid-19, and its initial days and it's like massively coordinated way and they're able to do something huge in fantastic.

07:02

And then, of course, you know, everyone wants to to, it's not like it's not like people in China or not criticizing each other and, you know, it's not like for for the things. Like, for example, there's been an enormous amount of industrial mistakes. I in terms of, you know, building 10, I've heard that, you know, in terms of like building towns where there are no people, all right, because they're just, they estimates about the usage of these towns, they were building with, we're just incorrect in some cases.

07:45

There, there are giant companies that are gonna fall now, because they made very bad investments, that could take down, not just the not just the Chinese economy, but also the global economy. So, we are facing basically, potentially like a global economic crash, because of math, because of the mass of stale of China, and the decisions that are that are made there at high levels, not not necessarily always being the best decisions and what but it would be like if we could somehow like

08:34

Work with everyone in the world to sort of like to come up with ideas. About how, you know, what sort of like large-scale projects would actually be worth investing in that are going to help their global economy in the long-term and one of those is science. Okay, so I think I'm good here.

09:05

Impossible. The question is like, well, so these are these ideas, they're okay. But how can we how can we what is the evidence out there for or against these ideas? And what and what is what is the path for the evidence that hasn't been collected? What is the past going forward that can prove demonstrate improve what's going on with the brand?

09:30

You know for or against these ideas? I think we have to look at the advances in medical imaging technologies left. We have to look at sort of like, every scale of medical imaging from from, you know, from auto genetics to patch plant to putting a patch clamp on a cell to measure.

09:56

It's it's changes to its electric and electromagnetic properties, you know, how our how is the ion charge building up. How, what are the? I mean, there are studies. Like okay, so like let's focus on calcium, calcium receptors, calcium receptors, opening and closing in the dens, right? And people are sitting, okay, well, how do you microtubules move in and out of the synapse?

10:30

How do they move? Why do they move? What are they doing? Provide, you know, besides the idea that they provide some sort of structural support, there's the idea that they transport a sensible proteins in and out of the cell in and out of the spine, I'm sorry in and out of spine.

10:47

If they, that's the idea is they may transport essential proteins. They seem suited for that purpose, but they also seem to be, you know, you can argue. Well, that a microtubule is memory are many fold. I mean, they're in the synapse. First of all, and they synapses is, in my hypothesis domain memory system.

11:15

Right? So, so the microtubules and the active and the filaments, these are, these are all the mechanical components of the to get rides growing spine. That then that that may connect to other neurons that make connect to specifically that they become the path between neurons that fired together at the same time.

11:54

So like you have two neurons in there that continue to fire together at the same time and a patent like a path grows between them. What is excited by is, they're guided by like, how does in an? I mean, like it's like, imagine that it's like something somebody saying, okay, we need a road between the two points that the fired and arguably, the two points that fired are the ones that argued the road to be built between them, right.

12:27

But it's just like but what is like how does the because you know you with it with knowing how oscillations work we can argue that two neurons that the fire together are gonna the increasingly likely to fire together again. Simply put the fact that their oscillatory clocks last at least at least at one point because if they're close enough in time or space course or scale similarity or you know pattern similarity I guess across the space times.

13:16

And so it's possible that they have become linked through the that's even through the literal oscillation or the function or the indirect oscillation. These sort of like absorb each others. Oscillation they're oscillating is one unit. Why are there filaments and spines and synapses growing between them to like even if they're like benefits?

13:59

Like indirectly connected.

14:05

I think it's also I think it's also that it's like the principle of blood flows very treated what to resupply oxygen Can be recitalized energy and after today, after they fire and

15:22

That just activity in the first place that phasic activity. In the first place is an increase in excitement in an excitement, in a certain direction, that sort of like drives the direction of the plant growth or cell growth, or in this case, we're talking about spine growth energy.

18:37

Yes. Okay so yeah so I didn't. Okay so I'm recording. So they're fine. So they're firing at a phasic break so this is their firing much faster than the rest of the oscillation so they are both the source of where, where energy is going. So in a sense and but the other thing is that, you know, what else is true?

19:04

Is that the neurons that that fired are the neurons that are and are expressing energy and they're the neurons that. So when they're express energy, I want to grow towards things. So, likely to be growing towards something, or it is growing towards something at a fast rate because inspiring were often and it's gonna grow towards other neurons and fired within a similar proximity, because that's where an energy source seems to be coming from, right?

19:41

Or a stimulation source. So the stimulation sources drawing the neurons to wire together and the stimulus, the the source of the stimulation is coming with the energy to be drawing connections to, to the next energy source. And that could be a good explanation for how. And and spines developed connections, in a network of neurons across that distances.

20:15

Its. Yeah. So,

20:25

I mean that does explain why, you know, I guess, you know, said that. So, what's interesting is that, you know, people have used TACS simulation, during sleep in. It's claimed that it improves memories. Think that it's kind of interesting that idea that very sleep that you're that you are going to.

20:57

So my idea is that what we will do is we'll get that blue and gold, the dress. It's like, is it blue with gold, or is it gold and clay, right? Hit that dress. Now, what we do is we create like a background, that's like all blue dresses with gold shrimp, like, to sort of cartoons.

21:16

Just suggesting that idea. And then we'll look for like backgrounds. Have the sort of like same assumptions about the lighting of the room that in which, in which case, your eyes interpret, like the blue dress will have the same assumptions put into like the background like furniture colors and stuff for the rooms ever suggesting that it is a dark room and there's a blue dress and a and all the other examples of redresses and then but then we'll do like and we'll and we'll put the put the thing right in the middle and see if we can get everyone to see if we dress in it.

21:54

And then what we'll do is we'll get it the other one for the, we'll get a bunch of. We'll do a separate one. So it's now we're just going to do another, like, sort of like collage of of white dresses with gold trim. And then, we're going to put them all over the place like somewhere.

22:13

Like, you know, again, cartoons, some of them are like real white dresses with gold trim. This were suggesting that pattern over and over again to the brain and then work attending length of room is really like, while there or whatever the background and interpretation is in the photo in which a person.

22:30

So he's like the white dress with gold trim, like the interpretation of the color environment, whether you think it's like, you know, a dark environment sort of determines your eyes, interpretation of the color, and it's like, your sense of, of what that place is. Your assumption of what that that place is your expectation of what that environment is and how light and what you're estimating, the lighting of the environment.

22:54

And that's why it brings interpreting that color because it has to suggesting for the color in consideration of the lighting. So I can, it can render a color, it can render. It can identify the color by the by it's irrespective of the lighting conditions, so it's like taking into account that it's not recognizing the same color pattern but it's able to like make an estimate of what the so it's like it's like you're bringing it is like actually doing a shading and rendering the graphical shading and rendering of that chair to adjust its color.

23:36

So you know it's green and it makes it distinct for you when when you're, when you're thinking about the greenness of green, that, that greenness becomes very distinct. And, and you can just be in green greenness. All right, just enjoy the greenness. I just like that. In a virtual reality program when you're like you just you just wondering through wondering if you're like it's like Elsa Wonderland and Alice, just ran off after the white rabbit and then so now you're like wandering around and in this garden.

24:16

And it's just like this weird crazy garden and there's these guards that are cards and and and you can just be absorbed in the greenness. No, but so yeah. So, the sagas history was think that that would be a great way to like display, those with those costumes. So and we'll see if we can like, you know, put the next each other.

24:41

So we can have the gold the light version of the dress with that's evoked. We're gonna try to evoke it with patterns of white dresses and we're gonna try to revoke evil. Could be the blue dress with patterns of blue dresses. And we'll try to see if we can put them next to each other so that people can like, quickly go back and forth between the two different interpretations.

25:06

And and would just say it was have one image. I said okay, just cover half the image, just cover half the image and slide it like slide it over and click like slip it over. And so just cover half the image at a time. And we'll have all these like, blue dresses.

25:27

I tried trickier than singing a blue dress and then what. And then when you flip it over, then you have all these you'll see all these white dresses that are trying to trick you into seeing a white dress.
