b0075y (still editing & fixing this transcript. June 23, so six days past the 17th. I think fixing these transcripts is a bit more work per hour per day than I realized, ah hmm... I think I all the notes still need editing at this point. Some more than others. The transcripts might take two months, but the way I am beginning to make connections between documents is threading the book together so this process seems like the right one.)

Consciousness Neuron Representations (audio)

# Self Aware Networks: The Scope of the Book.

Self Aware Networks is about the neurophysics of consciousness. It's about math, physics, biology, evolution, computation, artificial intelligence, and specifically the biological functions involved in the human brains production of consciousness.

How it works.

Then we're going to talk about brain computer interfaces, the ones that I know about, and the ones that I am, imagining that we can build.

Then we're going to talk about our self aware networks or what some people are imaginging when they say the words: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

we're going to talk about how machines can be conscious, or how living conscious entities can exist in a computer.


We're gonna talk about how we can connect our brains together with machine brains. How we might interact with with AI. How we might bring our minds into the matrix to meet a sentient AI in a virtual form.

# Section about Brain Machine Interface Fiction (to be moved elsewhere)

You can see there's good illustrations of this idea with fictional stories such as Sword Art Online, Gun Gale Online, Accel World. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online Anime stories about Nerve Gear, Full Dive Technology, AmuSphere, Nervelink and Augma or Augmented Reality via direct brain stimulation no glasses required. https://accelworld.fandom.com/wiki/References_and_Connections_to_Sword_Art_Online

Or novels about implanted nano-robots that link brains together (The Nexus Trilogy) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nexus_Trilogy

I want to actually like, describe a little bit about what was so amazing about. Like, you know, the crew who's for example, like commander data. and the holodeck

Talk about David Brin's: the KILN people because that was just like one of the coolest things that I read

# Neurophysics and Brain Computer Interfaces Ultra high level Overview

The neurophysics of consciousness, and how we can read and write to this consciousness, how we can change thoughts, how we can create artificial representations like basically augmented reality and virtual reality through a combination of brain imaging with brain stimulation.

04:15

There's a process where you combine both it's called closed loop therapy. We combine brain imaging with stimulation so you are sort of monitoring what you're doing, step by step, and that allows for potentially a

04:38

A two-way signal transmission. So you can light the, you can basically link the brain to another brain. What you need to capture are phase changes.

You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

05:48

If you can monitor the neurons changing size because when fire they actually expand the size.

That's part of the process through which they're expelling like extra energy in a sense. They're dissipating extra energy. 

06:12

They're dissipating their energy along their branching exit terminal, and that transmits a neurons phase signal to the other nodes or neurons in a cell assembly. Each node is going to basically collect a sequence of knocks is going to collect some amount of energy, 

06:51

and then at some point it reaches a threshold and it's going to pass on energy from what it has been collecting, and that energy is dissipated in a distributed way along the branches of its exit terminal towards other neurons. 

Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

07:45

that happen end up defining the fabric of consciousness that makes up your experience of reality that you are seeing when you look around, when you look at a fence, a sidewalk, a brick wall, a tree, or at a car, everything you see, and every direction in which you see it, is rendered from the phase variations in the oscillating networks of your brain, which each neural array or oscillating group seeing what the previous group rendered. The oscillations carry the material, the paint, the representations of light, sound, touch, and feeling that make up all the things you know & see, all of those are your internal qualia representations.

08:19

Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.

All of those representations are learned patterns. Everything, you perceive is a learned pattern that arrays of cells learned (and passed to other arrays of cells (arrays or layers or synchronously oscillating groups of cells)). One array of cells created and then projected a representation of it's learned pattern (Memory Prediction) to other cells. Each subsequent group of neural arrays shows it's representation of what it sees to the next layer of cells and that next layer of cells makes a representation of what the previous layer represented and so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.

08:55

So these patterns, basically, they're different perspectives on the patterns that you encountered  in your life, and they are played back by different areas of your cortex.

I love Jack Gallants work when he talks about the semantic map

"UC Berkeley researchers create semantic map of brain"
https://www.dailycal.org/2016/04/29/uc-berkeley-researchers-create-semantic-map-of-brain/

His lab has brought public awareness through the use of MRI machines, and correlating to data that that was shown to a participant on video.

The participant would watch a video that would and several images would be played in the course of the video and the signals in their blood would be recorded by the computer. So today basically created the spatial map of blood flow changes in the brain and in the blood flow.

10:12

So every time a neuron fires, it's expelling energy it's using up oxygen and and to uses of oxygen to read sort of recatalize ATP, which is energy molecule of cells, and it uses that that energy and now it needs new energy and needs new oxygen. So, so the blood will will bring like de ribos and and I don't know if I'm getting this right.

10:41

But I actually haven't doubled, check it. But the blood will bring a new supply. The components of ATP, a dentist identicine triphosphate. And and the blood will bring oxygen in which we'll re catalyze the the ATP when it's needed. And this is so the movement of the neuron and the fact that that it is.

11:08

It's how it's it's, I don't know. It's, it's I have to look into this, exactly. But, but, but the basic principle is that blood flows where it's needed, right? Anywhere you need blood is gonna flow. So every time I sell uses energy, blood flows to it, right? So that means that every time I neuron fires, that is too much for me every time on your own fires, you're going to get into a situation where
