b0075y (still editing & fixing this transcript. June 23, so six days past the 17th. I think fixing these transcripts is a bit more work per hour per day than I realized, ah hmm... I think I all the notes still need editing at this point. Some more than others. The transcripts might take two months, but the way I am beginning to make connections between documents is threading the book together so this process seems like the right one.)

Consciousness Neuron Representations (audio)

# Self Aware Networks: The Scope of the Book.

Self Aware Networks is about the neurophysics of consciousness. It's about math, physics, biology, evolution, computation, artificial intelligence, and specifically the biological functions involved in the human brains production of consciousness.

How it works.

Then we're going to talk about brain computer interfaces, the ones that I know about, and the ones that I am, imagining that we can build.

Then we're going to talk about our self aware networks or what some people are imaginging when they say the words: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

we're going to talk about how machines can be conscious, or how living conscious entities can exist in a computer.


We're gonna talk about how we can connect our brains together with machine brains. How we might interact with with AI. How we might bring our minds into the matrix to meet a sentient AI in a virtual form.

# Section about Brain Machine Interface Fiction (to be moved elsewhere)

You can see there's good illustrations of this idea with fictional stories such as Sword Art Online, Gun Gale Online, Accel World. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online Anime stories about Nerve Gear, Full Dive Technology, AmuSphere, Nervelink and Augma or Augmented Reality via direct brain stimulation no glasses required. https://accelworld.fandom.com/wiki/References_and_Connections_to_Sword_Art_Online

Or novels about implanted nano-robots that link brains together (The Nexus Trilogy) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nexus_Trilogy

I want to actually like, describe a little bit about what was so amazing about. Like, you know, the crew who's for example, like commander data. and the holodeck

Talk about David Brin's: the KILN people because that was just like one of the coolest things that I read

# Neurophysics and Brain Computer Interfaces Ultra high level Overview

The neurophysics of consciousness, and then how we can read and write to this consciousness, and how we can change thoughts, how we can create artificial representations like basically augmented reality and virtual reality through a combination of brain imaging with brain stimulation.

04:15

There's a process where you combine both brain imaging with brain stimulation, it's called closed loop therapy. It enables the practitioner to monitor brain reactions to stimulus at each step, so the treatment can be tailored based on how that particular brain is responding to it. 

04:38

# Close Loop therapy opens the door to a two-way signal transmission,

because the computer is effectively listening to the brain, and the brains responds effect the stimulation, the brain could learn to manipulate the stimulus. It's the same idea in neurofeedback. What I was doing in 2012 with Neo Mind Cycle was closed loop therapy with EEG to drive changes to light and sound effects. After a while, using Neo Mind Cycle I could intuit how my thoughts and feelings were changing the light & sound effects, and that helped me to intuit how my thoughts and feelings were brainwaves that I could sense. Closed loop therapy, as an advanced descendent of neurofeedback could be combined with a sentient & self aware artificial neural network, so that your brain activity, via medical imaging, is sent to the computer, the computer takes it as input to the self-aware neural network, and the self aware network returns a stimulus, and so you have in effect attached an external brain to your brain with closed loop therapy

With closed loop therapy you can basically link the brain to another brain. What you need to capture are phase changes, or brain activity at some level.

You either need to capture the phase changes between brain cells (at the synaptic scale) or you need to create like a model of the phase field based upon your sensor data, or you could try to monitor phase changes basically by monitoring the size of the neurons with either electrical impedi tomography combined with deep learning or something like Open Water's Holographic Medical Imaging Reconstruction from Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

# You could also monitor vast quantities of cellular activity via implanted electrodes
(such as Neuralink's implanted electrodes) and combine that with EEG Source Localization technology or borrow the concept of

This video explains how class IV DA (Dopamine) Neurons are light sensitive, and it was interesting that the argument was put forth that these are all over the Drosaflies body, in an array configuration that enables any part of the fly's body to be sensitive to light.

Then he asks what about the other types of neurons, and he says that the other DA Neurons form another array that is Mechanosensitive (sensitive to touch/physical pressures) again it's a body spanning array of cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxQSqjtwaQ

Funny note *Then he dives into the specific of the cells that confers mechano-sensitivity. I was learning how mechano-sensitivity is conveyed to potassium channels in DA Neuron arrays, which are not normally mechno sensitive, and I had to look up this work Ankyrin, because the Ankryin repeats. Turns out Ankyrin Repeat is Anchoring (bonding) the cells together. My reaction: OMG LOL

That's interesting that could mean that mechanosensitivty is added by essentially gluing together smaller sensors. OR Essentially the potassium channel is too small to be responsive to pertubations of mechano-scale soliton waves, but it's surface area is essentially magnified by the Ankryin repeat, so it becomes large enough to be sensitive to touch, which means the potassium channel works by being physically knocked with neurotransmitters. This makes me wonder okay so why are class IV DA Neurons sensitive to light? 

# If you can monitor the neurons changing size because when fire they actually expand the size. The dendrites also inflate in size as they fill up with ions. (wait is that true? I'm looking up evidence for this, brb. I feel like I read this somewhere recently.)

That's part of the process through which they're expelling like extra energy in a sense. They're dissipating extra energy. 

06:12

They're dissipating their energy along their branching exit terminal, and that transmits a neurons phase signal to the other nodes or neurons in a cell assembly. Each node is going to basically collect a sequence of knocks is going to collect some amount of energy, 

06:51

and then at some point it reaches a threshold and it's going to pass on energy from what it has been collecting, and that energy is dissipated in a distributed way along the branches of its exit terminal towards other neurons. 

Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

07:45

that happen end up defining the fabric of consciousness that makes up your experience of reality that you are seeing when you look around, when you look at a fence, a sidewalk, a brick wall, a tree, or at a car, everything you see, and every direction in which you see it, is rendered from the phase variations in the oscillating networks of your brain, which each neural array or oscillating group seeing what the previous group rendered. The oscillations carry the material, the paint, the representations of light, sound, touch, and feeling that make up all the things you know & see, all of those are your internal qualia representations.

08:19

Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.

All of those representations are learned patterns. Everything, you perceive is a learned pattern that arrays of cells learned (and passed to other arrays of cells (arrays or layers or synchronously oscillating groups of cells)). One array of cells created and then projected a representation of it's learned pattern (Memory Prediction) to other cells. Each subsequent group of neural arrays shows it's representation of what it sees to the next layer of cells and that next layer of cells makes a representation of what the previous layer represented and so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.

08:55

So these patterns, basically, they're different perspectives on the patterns that you encountered  in your life, and they are played back by different areas of your cortex.

I love Jack Gallants work when he talks about the semantic map

"UC Berkeley researchers create semantic map of brain"
https://www.dailycal.org/2016/04/29/uc-berkeley-researchers-create-semantic-map-of-brain/

His lab has brought public awareness through the use of MRI machines, and correlating to data that that was shown to a participant on video.

The participant would watch a video that would and several images would be played in the course of the video and the signals in their blood would be recorded by the computer. So today basically created the spatial map of blood flow changes in the brain and in the blood flow.

10:12

So every time a neuron fires, it's expelling energy it's using up oxygen and and to uses of oxygen to read sort of recatalize ATP, which is energy molecule of cells, and it uses that that energy and now it needs new energy and needs new oxygen. So, so the blood will will bring like de ribos and and I don't know if I'm getting this right.

10:41

But I actually haven't doubled, check it. But the blood will bring a new supply. The components of ATP, a dentist identicine triphosphate. And and the blood will bring oxygen in which we'll re catalyze the the ATP when it's needed. And this is so the movement of the neuron and the fact that that it is.

11:08

It's how it's it's, I don't know. It's, it's I have to look into this, exactly. But, but, but the basic principle is that blood flows where it's needed, right? Anywhere you need blood is gonna flow. So every time I sell uses energy, blood flows to it, right? So that means that every time I neuron fires, that is too much for me every time on your own fires, you're going to get into a situation where
