Title: LTD Neurons Signals Pattern

b0067y this is a key note, very important concepts central to the book explained: fireflies sync, synchronized sensor/transmitter system, they will all notice faster when one of them falls out of sync, rippling happens, because the syncs are based on thresholds being reached on a regular basis, an inbited or excited bug will cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation that eventually gets absorbed and they all start synching again. Think of the group oscillation as magnified receptive field. All the fireflies are going to notice when any of their phases is disrupted, because each now will fire at a new interval. The reason machines can be conscious, the nature of oscillation is allowing a bunch of separate parts to be entified into a single entity. I compare thalamic modulation to the concept drop out, adding robustness to signals, this is the precursor to comparing thalamic modulation to the concept of noising in the diffusion model of artificial neural network. This note addresses how novel incoming sensory patterns oscillate as decaying oscillations, or resonating drums, the resonation will cause synaptic connections to grow, something thats growing is accelerating in relative time, it oscillates faster so relative to other things it grows faster
When one neuron fires it accelerates in time, but it inhibits its neighbors slowing them down in time, its synaptic pattern has evoked or magnified its synaptic pattern onto its inhibited neighbors, their slowdown, the slowdown affects the tonic oscillating field, because now all the neurons have to adjust their clocks again in reaction to the change in timing, until they are all in sync again. Group Short Term Depression concept: when groups cells are slightly out of sync with other groups of cells they get slightly unlinked. GSTD for Meso scale memory changes, however at the same time this effect will cause Group Short Term Potentiation GSTP because while they becoming unsynchronized with the larger oscillator they become synchronized with each other.
The direction of growth is encouraged by the acceleration of organic activity, and at a high level the decays of LTD represents a deceleration of organic activity. The Neural Physics of Memory. The inhibit area is like a brush of paint on the canvas of the oscillating array.

the the the one thing that I want to note that I am taking away from the

discussion of how fireflies sink in the book sink or yeah I guess there's

different ways the fireflies can sink and there's different different

species that can sink where they all fire in a sequence right after one

another but then they're all silent for a period of time and so it it looks

like synchronous firing or firing one after another and I'm kind of making the

argument that this this amplifies the receptive field of the organism or

allows a receptive field that includes all the parts of the organism to allow

the entire organism because they have a synchronized sensor system they're all

going to notice faster when one of them falls out of sync like that would cause

a change to the to the regularity of the entire pattern like some like something

that would normally that would cause a rippling basically yeah like a rippling

pattern because the sinks are based upon thresholds being reached and on a

regular basis and when that's interrupted by an inhibited bug or by an

excited bug then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire

oscillation that that that eventually balances out it eventually gets absorbed

and then they all start oscillating really and they all start sinking

normally again and so in that sense you could think of like the group

oscillation the group oscillating activities of of fireflies as sort of

like allowing the emergence of a higher-level receptive field that is like

a shared computation it allows it allows the the bugs to basically have a

collective mind that is not really a mind so much as it's a collective sensor

that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so each

of them can help create this sort of collective sensor just because and it

ends and so there so so the weird thing is that it's not actually just living

animals that can do this like sink happens with that with that with things

that are not organic right things that are just dead right but essentially you

could have robots that can send signals to each other to that that they to reach

a threshold that they dissipate to other robots or send other robots but in

increasingly smaller amounts like it gets us it gets a signal and then and then

it absorbs some of it and then it sends some of it onward so it's so or or or

it's stopped from from sending a normal signal so they would have so the key is

that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast and

that's their that's their synchronization rate like the alpha

frequency rate and disruptions to that are things that are events that all of

the cells are going to notice so any disruption is like a phase change or

coincidence pattern and so any of the fireflies in a group of fireflies they're

they're going to notice they're all going to notice when any when when any of

their phases is disrupted right and so they're in and because each of each of

them has to each each of them effectively now fliers at a slightly

different interval than they were firing before and that difference is going to

cause the cause of like a reaction or a change and the artificial structure or in

the organism of the book so this could also happen to a sort of machine that's

completely made of dead parts right and that's and that and that's a key

distinction is that the is that the reason that machines can be conscious is

that the the nature of the oscillation is taking a bunch of separate parts but

allowing them to affect one another like like like a bunch of it's like it's like

having a bunch of tuning forks or a bunch of drums that can that when you hit one

drum all the others start vibrating right and so what you have normally is

like they're all sort of like vibrating like one of them will you will hit and

then and they're all sort of like react to that one that got hit right there's

this reaction that happens in the brain what happens is one gets hit and there's

this there's this attention schema that this this effect that is described very

well with attention schema where one gets hit and that inhibits a lot of the

others in its own array and that one that that fire hits a it probably hits a lot

of others in its own array but then it's probably sending excitatory signals to

to the secondary cortex in the case of the gussetory cortex so I would imagine

that when a signal goes from the olfactory bulb to the to the temporal

loop that signal is going to be like it's gonna be an exciting signal right so

what so what would happen is one is you might have one at one of the the neurons

in the oscillator of the layer one of the occipital lobe is going to I'm sorry

of the not the occipital lobe it's the temporal lobe so like the it's like

imagine like what I'm thinking is like imagine like the first layer of cells

like they're all like sort of like sent up an excitatory pattern that bumps all

of them up a little bit but one of them fires first reaches its threshold before

the others and then it sends out an inhibitory signal to all of the other

ones that were were receiving the excitatory signal like those are the

same ones in the in that first layer and then what it then would pass is it's

gonna pass at some point a signal it's gonna pass signals in a couple of

different directions one of them is towards the thalamus and the other

direction is towards the and in the signals go from the thalamus and they

go towards the orbital frontal lobes but there's also signals that go from the

temporal lobes to the orbital frontal lobes so there's two paths that the

signals travel so there's like a circuit being created a source where the

information is divided up one one part of the information goes to the the

thalamus and then to the to the frontal lobes the orbital frontal lobes and

then the other part goes directly to skips the thalamus it goes directly to

the orbital frontal lobes and so that situation is one where as that's one

where you have you have signals that went through the thalamus which will

modulate the signals in some way it's not it's not it's not it's just a it's

not just gonna just pass signals through itself without modulating them it's not

just a you know like a Cisco router as was once imagined you know it's not a

no it's not a networking router that doesn't that passes things without

making changes to those things it changes the signals but then in like I'm

imagining like oh what if that's like what if that's sort of like what if that

adds the kind of robustness that to the signals to learning to learning those

signals by having them sort of like travel through one path get modulated

and then get sit back to rejoin it's the rest of the signals okay I'm not

exactly sure how the neural how the how the wiring is except that it's probably

different for every it's it's going to be different for every person's brain so

you might have so I'm not sure like I guess initial connectivity there's some

amount of randomness in the initial connectivity and then the changes to the

connectivity would reflect that that person's experiences would would be or

would be one kind of reflection of that person's experiences but the so the

changes in connectivity would sort of like encode a long-term

potentiation or long-term memory and then but the I would say the firing

sequences in terms of like you know in terms of like firing sequences are

going to oscillate they're gonna cycle and what's gonna set those firing

sequences are incoming sensory patterns novel novel incoming sensory patterns

and so you're gonna have novel incoming sensory patterns that are going to

oscillate in the brain they're gonna oscillate several times before they

because they're basically they're firing faster than the rest of the neurons

and the rest of the neurons are going to slow them down but they're gonna slow

them down slowly like because because the rest of the neurons are firing at a

slower rate so that neuron is like gradually calmed down so it's like a

decaying it's like a decaying oscillator or a resonator is another word for it so

it's like a drum that it's like you hit the drum and the sound is out like boom

but then it's like it's it's not just boom but it's like it's like boom and

then there's a smaller boom because it oscillates around and but as it's it's

it's energies being drained by the rat by the rest of the oscillator in one

sense because they're passing signals to it that are going to bring it back in

sync with the rest of the oscillation because that's what oscillators do

whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their

energy across other neurons but be but and so they'll dissipate their energy

across this neuron and so it's going to like repeat its its signal but so if it

does so there's like a high-facing signal like I recognize the pattern

that's going to fire right but then the recognition of that pattern is going to

fire again and it's going to loop so that phase sequence is going to loop in

time and gradually fade out it's like so it's like and that would be true for

anything that you can think of like if you are looking at something the pattern

of what you're looking at very intensely it's gonna be like this high-phasic burst

right of activity now you can look at anything else if you want but you're

probably still gonna be thinking about that one thing that you were looking at

intensely periodically for it for a little bit longer and I think of that as

short-term memory I think of that as like that's like it it's like an

imprint on your mind that is fading like a fading imprint like I guess if you

seem like you can press your hand into a material like a soft foam and then if you

let go the foam doesn't immediately turn to being flat return to being flat and

instead it's sort of like slow like for a while it represents your hand but that

representation becomes flatter and flatter and flatter until it fades away

right it's like a it's like it's like the foam representation now so that means

that the that the short-term memories are just gonna fade away into nothing

they're gonna sort of cease to exist but what happens though is that the short

term also the short-term oscillations they they're going to change the

synaptic connections they're gonna cause the they're gonna cause synaptic

connections to grow towards them and they're going to grow towards other

neurons that fired fast fast they're gonna grow towards the neurons that

fired the fastest in a sense at the same time because it's like if you have to if

you have to if you have like so because it because like like I think in one sense

like yeah so being so for a neuron to I'm trying so the argument that I

created before was that it's like a plant growing towards the Sun that something

that's growing is accelerating in and it's in it's growing that it's like

accelerating in its oscillation but it but like as a periodic strange attractor

or a chaotic strange attractor that that oscillates because it oscillates faster

in that and in a particular direction in it all it also it's faster so relative

to other things it grows faster so it grows spines when it fires and but it's

also going to be sort of like attracted to other spines and so so I mean there

is there is there's there's what's really interesting is in the by Richard

Feynman let me look this up that configuration space because it's the

idea that particles will sort of like the trajectory of the particle is going

to be like the shortest possible distance between between two hang on I

need to look this up and so so I was just going to say that while a neuron is

like is this so when a neuron fires it creates this it inhibits a lot of other

neurons that could have fired from firing in its own layer so that's like

the first neuron it's like it's like okay so imagine it's like the whole

oscillator oscillating the whole layer is oscillating together right the whole

layer is oscillating together and one of them fires and the rest of them are in

a lot of them are inhibited by the one that fires okay so that's like imagine

that's a it's a one bright light with a lot of darkness and I say that's a lot

it's like a lot of darkness because usually the oscillator it has this this

is one pattern that they're all light up at the same time they're all dark at the

same time and now this pattern has an interference pattern they're not they're

not in oscillation anymore now there is this there's a slowdown in some of them

and there's a speed up and a smaller number of them but it's interesting

there's so there's like a it's like a sparse and distributed representation in

one sense and that and that it's very efficient because the amount of energy to

represent is to represent a pattern is to represent part of a pattern is one

neuron plus that sped up bounced out by all the neurons that it slowed down by

inhibiting so there's like that one neuron simultaneously speeds up and the

rest of them get inhibited so it's like they the but then but then it passes its

own excitatory signals to the second layer so that sort of like creates the

one that fired first now is effectively transferring its synaptic pattern to the

next layer because it's synaptic pattern is the reason why it's it's cells filled

up first so the synaptic pattern oh shit this is really good okay let's try to go

over this one more time so you have so one neuron fires and it inhibits a whole

bunch of others but because there's a tonic field all of those neurons are

coordinated together so basically the the neuron signal is it looks like one

tiny noise but it's slowing down a whole bunch of neurons and so that is also the

so the ones that so the neurons that slow down it's kind of like that that

represents like so the neuron so a neurons so what I'm saying was that a

neurons memory is stored in its synaptic connections I didn't invent that

idea that's the prevailing idea okay that's where that that synaptic

connections are where the memory is restored and that's because the the

synaptic connections they form in response to cells firing at the same time

and they they unform in response to cells fire firing out of sync and so a cell

that is inhibited is going to be out of sync with a cell that fired and so the

link and so in some in some sense like so that means that if you look at the

off-siting group as a whole that neurons that were wired together before will

become sort of like they will I'm trying to like understand why like this

mechanism a little bit more precisely but so something in between when the

neurons fire out of sync they the the spines that were growing beneath them

will be sort of deconstructed that they'll they'll stop linking to each other

and that's that is okay so if you have like so that so I had this idea that

that you know it's sort of like it's like a splay state right splay state is now

that the oscillations are opposite and so they're gonna like so that means if

that one neuron keeps is the one that is gonna fire first then it's gonna

inhibit the others and so the I don't know I guess it's kind of like I guess

it's I'm just trying to imagine I'm just like trying to imagine the DK process

like is it is it analogous to cell wilting is it because nutrients are

being deprived from that spine to be shifted towards where the cell is growing

because that's sort of like saying that that the the it's like imagine that okay

so imagine that plant can grow in any direction and in any given time like but

because they're stimulus in one of the directions that is sort of like changing

the likelihood like that it's adding it's adding like it's speeding up that time

it's speeding up time in that direction so there are more possible paths in the

direction there are more possible paths in the direction of in which time is

accelerating faster it's like it's like if time is accelerating faster in one

direction then you have like one two paths for every one path it's like it's

like in one direction life is moving at 60 frames per second very fast and in

another direction it's moving at 30 frames per second so that means that you

have there's there are there are in a sense twice as many directions for that

particle to go towards and so if it's gonna random if it's gonna like if the

chances of that it going in any particular direction are like completely

random or Gaussian then it's more likely it's then it then it may grow and it may

go in any different direction but the chances chances are the chances that it

goes in the direction but if but if you have but if two of the three possible

directions are the same direction then the chances that it grows in one

direction are are two times the chance that it's growing in the other direction

and so that increased chance sort of like teases out a trajectory which is like

like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just

it's just the greater activity increases the the the or the greater

activity is is a greater interval of time happening which multiplies the number

of possible paths that that growth could go to that growth could happen and and

growth is happening faster because in cells that are firing and so because

growth is happening more slowly and cells that aren't firing then the the energy

of the plant sort of like holes like it's not it stops being sent to to the

spine is to the spines that are not being used right it's in and I think they

must be decaying like the way a plant decays when it doesn't receive nutrients

right and then because the nutrients are going in the direction of where it's

firing and that's why so that's so that would be LD LDT which is a long term

depression which is when the plant is not growing in a particular direction the

signals are going not going in a particular direction and so that's that

memory phase fades away or gets like etched away over time okay so what I

want to get at is that the the pattern of a neuron so the pattern but we know

that the neuron that fires is the one it is like so so it's like the neuron that

fires first so so a pattern that I think is going to resonate again a few

times because it resonates a few times there's time to stimulate the growth

cells and in between those patterns right it's like they can grow a little

and they need another stimulus to grow a little more and then another stimulus to

grow a little more right so so if it resonates a lot then the growth can be a

lot and so it's like energy it's like a lot of energy can flow in certain towards

certain patterns and those certain patterns in dense connect patterns that

have dense connections have a lot of attractive power

they're they're combined as a combined oscillator they're a more they're a more

powerful attractor to smaller oscillators and so they can so like as a memory it's

a memory like grows almost like a tumor right if something is like if you're

there's something that's really important to you then you'll like have all of these

like powerful connections will help you it's like how it's like how psychedelic

medication is like it excites your whole brain and and that causes a lot of cell

growth so you're so you're a lot of a lot of new connections between you know

so it causes your increase in your activity right

soon I'm saying basically I wanted to say that the that the LCD is creating a

pattern and it's helping a single cell to create a magnified pattern so that

patterns are being created in terms of by the total representation so the

special presentation is not just what fired but it's also what was inhibited

right those are just distinct from cells that are still far and tonically so

there's multiple layers of representation right and then because

there's like there's like gamma and high gamma like there's there's definitely a

I would say there's a range of pattern representation

there's a range of pattern representation that's four bits that's

basically inhibited tonic basically bright and brighter and and you could

also say it's like silent regular sounds and loud and louder right and so but

and then you could have for touch you can have different intensities of texture

right there's like a light touch there's a harder touch like an imacano kind of

receptor there's you know the tactile sensations there's heavy touch like hard

grips you know like you can have a hard handshake it's a hard grip and you know

you can have like basically different different levels of of sensitive

sensitivity detection that our senses can process you know we can have two

different sensory sensitivity but it's because so the patterns can have different

magnitude and that's important because it's like well how much does this pattern

one or do we want this pattern resonate some patterns should resonate more than

other patterns right because the idea is like well what are what are we gonna be

paying attention to that's that that's where the pattern that is resonating the

most is happening is what that's where our attention is I'm talking about

temporal resonation so it's like yeah so it's like patterns are resonating in

our heads right and over time and but they're but they they they like they peak

for a time and then they fade out and then they they come back because the

whole brain is oscillating so they come back again and they peak and then they

fade out again right and but then you know you just it's like a robot in a

loop but the loop changes just a little bit every time you know like you know

it's like if the loop is the loop is of consciousness it's like a loop it just

loops and loops and loops and loops but the thing is it's also like all of the all

of the move all of the changes to its movement are are sort of like causing

changes to ripple through it that adjust its movements and so it's it's

literally just reacting to physics right like human being is just literally a

bunch of particles that are reacting to physics human beings literally just a

bunch of particles that are reacting to physics that's what I'll say this this

allows the entire oscillation to represent a unique pattern code that

represents the synaptic arrangement of one neuron or the synaptic configuration

of one neuron because that's the only neuron like if that neuron fires whether

that it's going to create a pattern that is distinct that to its itself because

it's going to inhibit its neighbors it's going to cause basically a disruption to

the pattern that that is distinguished is distinguishes itself in a large way

by inhibiting other neurons from firing and by slowing them down so it speeds up

and it slows down a whole bunch and that magnified pattern that energy efficient

magnified pattern changes like that's like a paintbrush on a canvas and the

entire ray is that canvas so you can have maybe multiple firing patterns

simultaneously in different areas of that one ray and they each inhibit it

different area to magnify themselves and so you're gonna have like you're gonna

have a few light up and a lot of them are going to be dark but you're gonna

detect the dark ones as a difference from the tonic firing rate from the

regular it's like the growth it's like relativity so think of it this way the

growth relative to you is at the growth decline and it's like the growth

declines as you get older right and it's faster when you're younger
