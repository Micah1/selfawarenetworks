imagine that each new neuron phasic spike is like an intruding signal from another land, distinguished because of its high firing pattern disturbance rate relative to the home field tonic oscillation which might be confused as theta noise.

I've considered the possibility also that a low frequency gamma pattern in the range of around 40z could be the tonic firing pattern for super high phasic firing patterns, such as something that is 500hz or 600hz

with the idea being that the home tonic frequency pattern servers as a base line of expectations to decode the incoming signals with and then to put them into perspective by passing the signals and their reflections into the mind, letting patterns reflect into the mind's collective awareness of its own phase space through felt transmissions of phase patterns that can travel across the electric field, the charge of ions, and the magnetic field, including the effects of the magnetic field on flavins in the mitochondria, I hypothesize that this could be the mechanism for reward, if the neuron fires, it creates a vector of electrical energy, and that means that magnetic field is changed, and that could mean the mitonchria is stimulated to release ATP so the cell gets more energy, or reward, and the vibrational, acoustic, tactile, mechanical spectrum, that can travel with chemical signals,
