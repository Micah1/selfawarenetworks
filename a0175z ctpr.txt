(causation) response-able
In my reading of how the brain works, humans are response-able bodies of causation. We react at macro, micro, and meso scales to patterns at all scales including quantum scales and astronomical scales.

I think we are each reactive & response-able or able to respond to anything in any way that occurs to us. I respond to choices that are presented to me for example. For this reason I wish that everyone in the world can understand that we are all reactive, and that we should all imagine how good it can feel to not only forgive ourselves but also to forgive everyone else. Imagine how happy we could all be if everyone was able to forgive everyone else. Now imagine that you can do it alone in your mind, and you can know that some others out there are doing it also just like you. Just forgiving everyone who ever lived (including themselves) because we are all each reactive & response-able humans.
