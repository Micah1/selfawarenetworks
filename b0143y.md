(audio) Neuron Memory Oscillation

00:00
So, I guess I can share my thoughts on uploading, but I should talk about the time that I had that dream that we could go to a cafe and the computer would filister played a lucid dream through a connection. We'd connect AI to our belt or to our our shoulders or something.

00:22
And the thing is,

00:29
Yeah, with virtual reality, virtually shows us that which is changes to what we're seeing and hearing we can have the feeling in the belief that we're in another place so it isn't. It's not the case really that we have to recital thalamus in order to trick the brain into experiencing something that's not there.

01:01
Any part of the nervous system that has efficient bandwidth to receive sensory information on the scale of vision hearing and touch.

01:19
That could be used as a pipeline so you can just connect with the nervous system and over in overwhelm the signals that are there. Inhibit the signal set, the brain is receiving to other areas. It could be, you know, combination of a blindfold or you could tell part of the brain to basically turn off or sleep, or become inhibited, you could use anesthesia a local anesthesia to just inhibit certain areas of the brain, like, just maybe the visual cortex.

01:48
I don't know. That's possible. Essentially essentially like temporary blindness, temporary inability to hear and record. It sort of creating a sensory deprivation tank on the one hand. But on the other hand, you're sending in a new sensory stimulus that contains audio visual and in touch patterns. So you're able to give the put the brain into like sword art online or like the matrix.

03:51
But perhaps, you know, interfaces by placing interfaces around the brain to study the brain, signals the regional brain signals like actually having multiple neural links all over the brain for example, or the open water all over. We want to basically predict the temple and spatial activations that will allow us to reverse engineer.

04:31
Like reversing the refraction of light. How long could you reverse sort of like, engineer the memory structure? And I do believe I I think perhaps long-term memory is like a structural change to a neuron that affects its resonant. Properties across multiple modalities for in terms of like the discharge of electric solutions.
