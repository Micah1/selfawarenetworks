New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

Each map page is a time-stamped copy of a wikipage. The wiki pages ought to be time stamped but I have not yet discovered where it can be shown.

# Fractals

Fractals.Networks Entropy & Fractals : Fractals in Medical Imaging: Functional Isomorphisms at Multiple Scales: Brain Activity Fractal, EEG MEG, & MRI, Waves. The activity of a single cell might be a fractal of multi-cell neural circuit pattern eeg, meg, mri, anatomy, functional anatomy

Fractals.Physics 1/F Magnitude/Frequency EEG to Spacetime to life to atoms

Fractals.Morphology (Retina/Greymatter, Dendrite/hand, SensorThresholds/Transmitters)
3D structure of biology fractal- consider the brain a fractal of modules
The Universe is a Fractal of Jeff Hawkins, hippocampus as a cortical column

Fractals.Phases tonic, phasic, inhibited, a multi-scale pattern **_fractal_**

Fractals.Focusing A pattern recorded from a small portion of the cortex looks like a pattern recorded from the whole. the lens of the mind, from a memory stored in a synapse, to the whole brain focusing on that memory, that one detail, a multi-level graph network

Fractal Vortices

Chaos fractals

A fractal is a self repeating pattern, in a sense the universe is a functional fractal, with broad functional similarities at different scales such as a galaxy being a vortex, a planet being a vortex or dissipative system, life being a vortex or a dissipative system in a functional way, every particle

Fractal Concept of Cosmos as a neural network including the brain

Neo Mind Cycle, Scaling Fractal, The Fractal Dissipating Cosmos


The universe is a fractal of clocks, a fractal of computation, a fractal of neural networks, or basically like each unit of the cosmos at each scale is self similar in that it's cyclical progression over time includes state changes at each interval of time that increase the information complexity in some area, and increase the overall entropy in another area.

I saw the beginning of spacetime, or spacetime as a fractal of an ever present beginning, we are forever in the beginning of spacetime, trapped within a single moment, as a fraction or derivative of that moment, with the dimensionality of spacetime having a non-linear chaotic distribution for that inbetween moment.

We are oscillating fractal folds of spacetime

Space at full speed has no space & no time it just exists stateless, perhaps as two frames, , but inside or inbetween a non-linear chaotic formation of spacetime that learns forms like inbetween some concept of nothing there is an undecidable chaotic something which makes up everything we can know, see, experience, or conceptualize. The breakdown of holism.

A planet could be consider to be a fractal of an expanding wave pattern, one end of it, or the point where the wave converges is the point where mass emerges

Space as a fractal tree of functions that are isomorphic oscillations or dissipative systems or dipoles literally or dipoles functionally, the whole universe is more simply a fractal of oscillations, every vortex, every dissipative system, every particle is oscillating, like a clock there is some cyclical process, like a cpu some linear progressions or changes emerg & like a neural network interaction of multiple processing nodes some non-linear progressions emerge, but ultimately even non-linear chaos has some linear boundary, random beta decay at short time scales becomes predictable at larger time scales, the unpredictability of radioactive decay at short time scales might mirror how time seems to have a non-linear chaotic

I think the universe exists only in time as an interval between moments, everything that has form is moving more slowly than light, including spacetime as we perceive it, and this is possible because if you sped everything up to light-speed, if you combined all matter & antimatter space would take up no space and no time, and we only have spacetime as some fractional representation in-between the frames of time, with the frame of time being static, unchanging, fixed, the ever present now moment. So in order to exist, we have to have everything in the cosmos occur in-between the frames of time, sort of like there is no time, and no space in totality but in-between the totality of non-spacetime there are divisions that pop up where spacetime can exist almost like a hologram with weight & physics or a gradient of fractal interactions that exist like a mirage in the desert, here one moment, but not here in a permanent way, the nature of physical reality is impermanent

Society as a fractal of connectivity between neurons "social connections predict brain structure in a multidimensional free-ranging primate society"

The retina, the cortical column, the entorhinal-hippocampus, and the gray matter are each functional fractals of the same pattern at different scales, with jeff hawkins building slow changing reference frames at high levels for sorting fast changing sensory inputs

Virus's & RNA behaving like fractal Antennas

hand is a fractal of a dendrite

every part of the brain and the cosmos is a fractal of a dipole, a fractal of a vortex, a fractal dissipative system, a fractal of a magnet, fractal loops, fractal brain activity loops

cancer could be considered to be a fractal of fascism

the synapse as a fractal of the neuron, the neuron as a fractal of the cortical column, and the cortical column as a fractal of whole brain activity, and the brain as a fractal of the person

In a thousand brains theory you have many self similar copies of the same brain activity distributed in many areas, this idea is supported in link to study about memories "A SIngle memory is stored across many connected brain regions " paper "Brain-wide mapping reveals that engrams for a single memory are distributed across multiple brain regions"

The brain as a series of fractal sensor arrays to magnify their inceptive fields onto other sensor arrays that de-magnify the incoming signal to focus -attention schema fractal

A person is a fractal of a neuron, or even a tcell can grow arms & legs to crawl or swim inside the body to its destination, neurons, in time lapse photograph to me look a little bit more Octopus like than human like.

A tcell could be considered a fractal of a public servant like a cop, a soldier, a medic, with abilities to attack or heal

Vladimir Putin is a fractal of cancer. Meaning fascist colonialism is what cancer does, actually & literally.

Neurons oscillate, but so do quantum particles, the fabric of space itself oscillates, the oscillation seems to be connected to the existence of time, as change that happens everywhere because of universal oscillation at all scales. perhaps time isn't a linear thing but instead a transformation that results from a fundamental interaction between 2 or more states that cannot be in balance as some axiomatic property which I prefer to think of as the undecidability of exis/tence, or the impossibility of nothing.

The person: Fractal functional isomorphisms, eye to neuron, neuron to hand
