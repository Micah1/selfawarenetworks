Okay, go back to the news. So when we think about neural activity in terms of like, you know, the conversion of of, you know, from from real neural activity to artificial neurons. There's a I think there's a lot of thought about, you know, what is the, what is the firing rate?

00:23

What is what possible meaning can we have in the firing rate of, you know, action, potentials, right? So the action potential, maybe it maybe if in order to encode meeting and has to fire faster, so that's the firing rate change. But there's this other there's just whole other like focus which is called phase procession or basically it's like the timing of firing, which it's this article says it's very well documented in the in the brains of rats but probably understudied in the, in the brains of other mammals.

01:08

And it's it's kind of exciting to see this article because I just finished well actually it's not finished. I'm still working my way through the book rhythms of the brain, but there's a lot that that book has sort of like expanded spending the horizon on my focus on the importance of of oscillations, local and global oscillations.

01:42

I mean, what is a global oscillation? Right? I mean, it's I'm, I just mean like large scale. Brain oscillations brainwave patterns. And you know so I think where the book is going is it is I think it's making an argument that small scale. Brain activity affects large-scale like brain activity, but the large scale brain activity.

02:07

Also affects the small scale project and I sort of feedback loop between the macroscale and the microscope which is very interesting and go ahead.

02:28

And welcome to Netika.

02:41

I will. So I went to I, so I started this faceobok group called self-aware networks. And that is a way that you can find the two articles that, I'm, that that were talking about. So, the IR, what's actually not just too articles but it's just about to talking about, the latest science news.

03:04

So one of the topics that I brought up is called social, mitochondria whispering between cells and the other topic is called well, its fate, it's about phase procession. But the articles is called neurons unexpectedly encode information in the timing of their fire which is different from the rate trying to decode information from the rate of the timing versus the.

03:35

I'm sorry from the rate from the rate of the firing versus the timing of the firing. So it's like the idea is that if you, if you walk like like what what you know to so timing is everything right with language, I have to have the last word of this sentence, at the end of this sentence, you have the time things, right?

03:59

And so, but this is been like, really well studied in in small mammals and rats, but not not very well. Studied in in larger, mammals like humans and the idea is that, you know, maybe there's a lot more information in timing and and and where that connects to the other article is interesting.

04:20

Because okay, so I'm reading this book and it's called, it's, it's called, it's called a John leaves cells. Oh, let me just look at it because that will help my memory here. By the way, I'm gonna go ahead and mute myself for a second and I'm gonna invite more people up and I think Lisa asked a question but I forgot we just had again.

05:02

Yeah. Wow, that's perfect. So the cerebral symphony, let me go ahead and write that down. Now meet myself. Welcome also Jimmy. Do you want to say something? All right. Or is it not up there?

05:22

Oh, right on. Okay, so let me just meet myself for a second and what was the name of that book again that you recommended? Yeah.

05:42

Okay, here, by the way. Is it feel free to invite anyone up here? Who comes in? I am currently looking down at my computer so I mean I see them.

05:59

Oh yeah, I had to do it. Okay, let me just invite. I'm just gonna send invites out to everybody even before they ask, you don't have to speak right away if you don't want to just so I can make sure that I don't miss because if I if I sometimes I go to like a clubhouse room and if nobody invites me up obviously, I'll leave that, all right.

06:37

Yeah, there's a lot to say about that. So I have to read this book. Oh I think I have read this book. Yeah, but it's back like 10 years ago. Wow. This is a whole book. Yeah. No, I think I read this book in 2012. 2008 book. Yeah, this was a yeah this is a this was a yeah, this would be.

07:05

Yeah, I forgot about this book but it was. Hm, I wonder if I stop a copy somewhere, but it's very relevant.

07:20

Okay.

07:24

Yep. I'm inviting everyone up. And if that what you just did to me was perfect,

07:45

Out. So I think there's like there's a couple big news articles today, but I'm also open to hearing other people share news that they would like to discuss if anyone wants to.

08:14

What I, the only understood part of what you're saying.

08:30

Oh yeah, yeah it's a little bit different. I think that, that, that tech if that is the one that I'm thinking of, let me see. I I'm not sure it's the big one. Yeah, so yeah. So I mean yeah they haven't different. They have a different sort of focus for sure.

08:52

I really like to get into the science in the news and really talk more about ideas. I think, I think of their tech news thing is more about products and less about ideas, but I could be, I mean, it could go their conversation, really goes every possible direction like all clubhouse talks do, right?

09:18

But I still feel it's more product focused overall.

11:26

11:52

I don't know. But but she does. Hi. Okay.

12:16

And so, so folks to want to do folks want to talk about the dragon man that that was very interesting science news. All right, let's see. I'm like I'm looking on my tablet dragon, man, and more understand the ancient world here, nine images. And fortunately, I don't know, well, I guess it could do nine images on clubhouse.

12:41

One of the time, but doing pulse refresh. Right? But I don't know that, I see anything that particularly

12:57

No, I don't. It's yeah, of course. It's art gallery. Nothing is new right. It's I just see bones, right? I'm looking at.

13:19

So, it's

13:26

Interesting. So what if folks think about the hypothesis that it that this species is actually didn't dentist ovian? Or I don't know how they say. Genovian De Soviet. Dennis. Oh, is okay. Yeah, that one. I've actually never heard it at pronounced that loud and never even tried to pronounce it before today.

13:49

But but you said Denise, again.

14:27

I'm very cool. Oh, okay, cool. So what else? Tell me, I think the enthusiasm came from Jimmy but and then these are also really likes this topic. What else is really new? And exciting. That the that we've been the society has been learning from the dragon man and the ancient world recently.

15:17

Wow, so we are really in the like a renaissance for archeology right now we're in the middle of it.

15:36

Right.

15:52

Just there's a whoop sound that whales are making sounds awesome.

16:03

Okay. Whereas I'm just like, literally typing that into my tablet.

16:20

We're opens.

16:26

Very cool, thanks. Thank you.

16:33

Yeah, I have to maybe watch that later.

16:42

Did we want to? So, do we want to go back over the, the other news items and okay, sweet. And let me go there. Okay, so let's go and it's visit Lisa's Twitter. Oh, I'm already following these not good. I I have such a when it comes to names like first of all, I know about 50 visas so I apologize.

17:14

Which Lisa is this? That about 3,000 people I think.

17:27

Right. Okay, okay.

17:39

Yep.

17:49

Hmm, okay, so that's I'm just looking. There's a pin tweet about squids and other research heading to don't mention squids. No. Okay, does anyone want to hear about sweets just

18:22

What's the story? Somebody tell me.

18:27

So, as quick as an octopus right? Doesn't it have a distributed brain in its limbs and like in all and all of its lands.

19:13

Okay, well I mean before we get too far, I mean like I should point out that each of the human, he said the hemispheres in the human brain can operate independently of the other one. And that the there's also, yeah, that would, we're not that cool. And we only like swimming things are not as cool as squids in terms of, we can't change our skin color, right?

19:37

That'd be cool. But

19:47

When did we?

19:57

But when you say we just learned to edit our RNA, you mean in the laboratory but but it hasn't really been confirmed that human came in things do not do any self-editing of RNA on it, cellular level

20:16

But so, it hasn't been confirmed that humans don't do that, they just haven't seen him in due to that, right? Because,

20:28

It's no, I mean not not not consciously it just it just seems like it's such an ordinary thing for cells to be able to do. I'm current like I'm currently looking at the this I mean really put my Kindle and tell you about this book. See, kindle is located here.

20:58

Have too many icons. Do you remember that? The issue gets to me icons.

21:06

I don't know that the later.

21:23

Throw away, six icons. I only need one.

21:32

I said icons icons as as an apps apps I was I was using. I I had and I was looking for the Kindle application but it's a little square icon and it's it was sort of like hidden amongst all the other icons and all of

21:58

Yeah, that that is another thing but I did find it. So this book that is really excellent that I that I think is worth mentioning in, you know and then in something about news it's a new book so it's news the secret language of cells by John leaf. MD, this book is excellent and this book, you know, right from the beginning, right from the get-go he talks about.

22:25

Why can't I'm just like I'm trying to go back to the about this book to the cover. I'm trying to go back to recovery. Yeah. Navigating Kindle is, is sometimes a little bit more complex than you might think. All right, let's go back. The it's actually not that complex.

22:46

I'm seven trying to do it while doing clubhouse. Just the weird thing. Yeah. So he basically like right from the get-go, he says, okay. Basically, this book is that is about the fact that that life is about the communication that's happening between cells. And by describing the life he says, in the book, I'm just quoting by describing the lifestyle of each cell.

23:16

Quoting a reading secret language makes advanced biology understandable. So he's as whether you speak jargon or not, secret language of cells, will make clear the extent and significance of this pervasive communication and perhaps like me, you'll gain a greater sense of about the nature of cell signaling, which we are just beginning to tap into and how it influences every organism on the planet.

23:42

The overwhelming conclusion of the very best current research is that all processes in the human body in all animals and plants and in microbes communities as well. Are based on conversations and group decision. Making among cells By understanding, how determinations are made among a wide range of cells from the immune system.

24:03

Blood vessels barriers of the gut in skin brand issue, in my herbs, it becomes clear, how cellular communication determines health and disease. In fact, understanding cellular communication will allow you to keep up with the latest and most advanced modern medical treatments, such as new immunotherapies for cancer experimental treatments using microbes and immune cells against any number of cancers that take advantage of natural conversations among these cells and elaborate discussions in the gut.

24:35

Determine how microbes might affect treatments related to metabolism weight loss anxiety, gut disease food, allergies and brain diseases, and the results of cellular conversations between immune cells and brain cells gut. Yeah, it's it is not

25:02

I I've seen I have probably read, you know, I don't know, I if I've read it, I might have read it but I've like I've studied so much of John Lipton to know exactly what John lived in very slipped in. Yeah. Sorry, Bruce lifted. Yes, I know, I know.

25:29

I think I think this is you. I think the situation is reversed from what, from what you might think it is, I think that Bruce lived in is is like, is the what is it called charlatan? And the real scientist is John but I had come to a different conclusion.

25:53

I believe that the real science book is is this one from John Leaf and is it's not a ripoff.

26:06

Okay. But in any case it doesn't have to be a competition. If people want to read a new book that is not a ripoff. It's a really excellent science book because this is by a guy who I've been fought this. I've been following John leaves work for years. In addition to I'm I've been aware of Bruce Lipton's work for many years and so, I'm very familiar with both of these authors, but but if you look up John leave, he has look up his blog.

26:37

He has a long history of posting like hard science articles. They never go into.

26:59

And what are you, what are you referring to? Because he, there's nothing in here. Here's the main point. There's nothing in here in the secret language themselves that has anything through with mysticism or self-improvement and that is kind of brutal thing. He's these like, you know, the self-help guy, he's these, you know, human potential movement.

27:28

He's he's, you can better yourself kind of person. It's, it's about your life philosophy.

27:52

Well I I'm like I don't know because I can't seem to like absorb anything. It. Is there any content for Bruce from First Lift and that doesn't sort of lean towards my system? That doesn't lean towards Mississippi or

28:13

So I I probably read his book, I just don't remember because but I

28:25

Now like I am I'm not I don't need someone else like I decided for myself, but here's a shout and I just know other. No other human beings opinion can ever influence me. Yeah.

28:52

All right. Well, no, no problem. I mean, I just like, you know, I I I just wanted to recommend that this book but if you don't want to read it, that's fine. I think it's a good book and I don't think he's I like I trust this guy, John Lee.

29:15

He's been a blogger of for a long time and he's not trying to rip off and anybody, I don't believe that. I mean yeah. And I don't know why. Why? Why? That idea came out. Why can't you buy both books? You know, if you're if you want this too good books out, there's not not it's not where to take all.

29:39

It's not like one has to die if you or is it I don't know. How does, how does capitalism work? Maybe maybe someone has to ask to die, but Yeah.

30:45

It's just an error psychologist. Well, so I mean, so there's a there's a book, a really good book.

31:01

Yeah.

31:06

Have you checked out this book called the brand from inside, out by Jordi Duergi? Who says last name? I don't know how to say his first name or last name, but his initiate, but the book is caught. It's really excellent book and it's the same author who wrote rhythms of the brain.

31:27

And this is our page, 2018. But do you want to go to the page 130 yet? So the let's connect the news articles. I guess if people if there's anybody still in the room or connect, today's news articles, let's see. Is anybody still here? Yeah. Oh yeah, there's a bunch of people.

31:50

Okay. So I just was away from the phone for a while, so sometimes people take off. But listen, okay. So one of the news articles was about neurons, firing neurons unexpectedly encode information in the timing of the primary. So that, that sort of like is asking us to think about, you know, the brain is a symphony again and it became it became a new article because there was a new study associated with it.

32:16

So I think that you know, the way the way this this news magazine always manages to feel like clickbait but it's like really interesting stuff. Be. It's it's, it's it's it's because they're like, they're like, okay, what can, what is new here that we can just like, put into the headline.

32:38

It's not a complete lie and they're like for the like like for the first time Jacobs and two co-authors they they spied neurons in human brain encoding, spatial information through the timing rather than the rate of the firing. And but that's not like I mean I feel like that's not that can't be new, is it new?

33:01

I don't know. But maybe, maybe they're just saying that. Instead of doing this documentation in the in the rat, they just shifted it over the human beings and there isn't it another study. So maybe they just replicated a study from from rats and did it in days? There was oh there was another, there's another great news article that they came out to said that researchers have a new technique of combining MRI with the EG with a news.

33:32

I'm actually not sure if that is actually a new technique, but I just saw the news for it and it looked exciting and I was gonna post that and me to see this still. Oh, my clipboard and I post it real quick. Nope, that's delete that Yeah. So,

34:09

Oh, you're so you're posting that on Twitter, right? Was at least a were you posting that on Twitter or was it something else?

34:25

And I'm I've been talking on you. So did you say you posted that on Lisa? You posted on Twitter?

34:40

Okay, let's see. Novel calibration procedure for super resolution brain imaging, huh? Okay, light and always can bend around the corners of obstacles found along its path. But because of this phenomenon called diffraction is impossible to focus light on a spot that is smaller than half of its wavelength. And other words, the highest resolution one can theoretically achieve using an optical microscope as approximately, 250 nanometers, right?

35:15

Yeah. And it's not, it's not enough. So yeah, I think I've read so much for everything, but let's go into this more. So there's a powerful approach developed in the 1990s called stimulated emission, depletion or instead microscopy microscopy, This technique requires the target sample to contain fluorophobes for floors which are compounds that absorb light at one wavelength.

35:47

And then remitted at a longer. One simplest version. The floor floor of force are excited in this circular spot by radiation with a diffraction limited focused. Laser. So I going into the weeds a little bit, but trying to skip because they don't want to saying the weeds. Let's see if I can skim through this story a little bit.

36:28

Now I'm really into I'm really into a. So this is, this is actually a different article from the one I saw by the way. But this is also very interesting. I yes, I'm super into medical imaging including, you know, different using lights and don't know. It's it's all advancing so fast.

36:53

I can't like every week. I see something new. I'm like what you need about three years study this. And I have about two weeks was like all these different ways of imaging with infrared light, have their own names and okay. So I knew one today, so it's not always, you know, think the one I knew about first was functional, they have a risk by cross camping and then today.

37:25

Let's see if I can find that article. There was a new one and I've heard of another one called HD DOT, which is another method of imaging. With infrared light, there's start the way I find it. I guess I need to go to let me just search, go back to the tablet and do the search on science videos.

37:58

There was another imaging modality that I learned about, from someone, called Doppler radar Doppler Effner's radar. And there was one that I looked at called Afneir's laser laser avenues. The idea is that a regular affairs is slower than EEG. In terms of sent, like the sampling rate. It's like so, but they can't increase the speed of it and they can increase the taking increase the speed of the sampling rate with like, so laser effneres can be as fast as EG then, and then, and then you can combine it with with electron sequagram.

38:42

And you can combine it with, you know, MEG and you could combine it with, you know, MRI and but you know, as you know, so a neuroscientist is Frank, was was explaining that you have to change your, you have to modify your your assumptions then. So yeah. So it is really interesting that the research is happening.

39:04

Sort of like I guess, I guess the broader topic of the news is that this is like yeah. So we have this, you know, we have this like explosion of new technology which is kind I guess it's this. Here's the interesting thing between agriculture and neuroscience. The the advances in science are not that.

39:29

I say agriculture. I meant anthropology anthropology. So we have light art is, is basically the technology that's driving. Lighter technology is striving innovation in, and

39:47

In anthropology, but in its, in a sense, I think that that light our technology, or where the concepts involved part are sort of driving the innovation and in multi-level medical imaging it to a small extent. What it and what I mean is that like like the basic, the basic concepts of to have, you know, creating creating an image from like time of flight sensor or another, there's different ways to use wide art right but creating images right.

40:24

It's this is about advancement in imaging technologies and imaging concepts. And, and so, that's why there's a link, I think between like this renaissance and archeology and a renaissance and medical imaging is is, you know, there's there's, there's many different sort of branches of. I think of them as branches of demography, branches of democracy or image, sort of like, I mean, I guess, I guess maybe one of the oldest oldest ideas, that's still one of the most powerful ideas is for your transform.

41:05

And, you know, I think that if you look at the sort of that four-year projection slice, theorem which is where like one slice of a 3D image short of represents the whole image, from that perspective, from the midsection, I might be, I might be stating that incorrectly but it's something like that.

41:39

It's something like I actually looked that up, but but the but it is something that the fact that like if you if you take images like photos from around an object, then you could reconstruct the original image as a 3D is a 3D model. But the same time you could take any like you, you could also take any 3D model and then you could compress it down into flat 2D images.

42:11

And then you could read, you could decompress it back into a hole 3 image. And and but that means that if you are so that so I think of the principles of the four-year slice theorem they like they pervade everything that that they pervade like electrical Impedance tomography and they and also tracktography and diffusion tensor imaging.

42:49

Like it's all, we're all we're like. We're taking like an image from from one side from one slice and then from another slice and then where are these images? Intersect helps the computer to reconstruct 3d, 3D image or in some cases, construct, a 3D image for the first time and so that's what to me is exciting about.

43:15

Sort of like, the the multimodal direction of this research is is yes, there are many different concepts. You know, that you have to like there's different, it's a different way to sort of think about what your modeling, you know, you're with EG and you know, dipole activity and and how long does it, how, you know, what is the what's interesting that I don't understand is yet is the sort of how long does it take for?

43:49

Because you know with with each source imaging, there's this ability to figure out the source of of a brain wave what what your measuring at the level at the skin outside. The skull is sort of like it's it's like the dipole fire. The dipole is like the big electrical electromagnetic activity, that happened that you're sort of that that's really what what my understanding is that you're you're getting this big way of when you need to.

44:25

And it takes a lot of smaller ways to, to trigger the big wave. That's my understanding. I could be wrong but I but but any correct. Please correct me if I'm wrong. If anyone knows, but the idea is, is that, you know, at some point you're gonna have, you know, there'll be some sequence of of neurons firing in a micro circuit that leads to another sequence of neurons, At least to another sequence fire.

44:52

And then eventually that results in the dipole firing and then your sensors, your EG sensors fire. And then you use EG source localization to figure out the source of that brain wave, right? And that brain wave gets traced back to. You, may have originated from from the thousands and eat with EG source, localization.

45:13

Not only can they trace the source back to its general location of where it came from like which where the neurosurgeon was at fire? That triggered that brainwave, they can do that. They can they've proven that. They're they can do it accurately with by combining that the EG with with DDS with deep brain stimulation.

45:37

And that I think that was 2019 with that article came out, but what you get with by combining multiple modalities with you. So you have you have a DBS, has has it. Not only does it stimulate the brain, the core of the brain, but it also has a sensor so you can, you can do readouts.

46:00

So you can figure out what's what's happening and what area is happening to some extent. There's there's a sense around the DBS and the invasive DBS, electrode system. I don't know what. It's not just an electrode but it's a pretty big thing apparently. And but what you can get is if you take one modality and you get these measurements and you do it take another modality or another sensor device, and you get these other managements and you can cross correlate these measurements.

46:33

And this, this is back to like the basic concept of before your site stand. When you have EG energy, afneers and FMRI all together and you're collecting all these different. All these different incoming streams of sensor data at the same rate, you know, at some point at some point, you know, we, this was not something that was done with MRI.

46:58

MRI was like 200 times slower than EG, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it was a lot because because blood flow and electrical activity are are two different domains of measurement. So I don't know if they've if they've managed to speed up MRI and what, what that would mean?

47:21

Exactly. I'm not sure, but I know that they've been able to speed up ethanols and so this interesting because f news MRI, they both measure blood flow. But any other case, even if you have a delay, if you, as long as you can account for that delay, you could say, okay, well, we're getting 250 samples of EEG per one sample of of MRI data, but we can sort of like say that we can we can look at this and we can, we can create a correlation or in our data between the EG data and and in the slower frequency MRI dear and they were doing that with afternoons and some people still do that with avengers because regular affairs is slower than EG.

48:10

But but the, but there is, you know, like the laser doppler system was using light at samples of blood flow as at the same frequencies as easy so that it has happened. But it's like, yes. So it's like if you imagine so you have multiple sets of signals and you have to figure out how to relate into it through each other.

48:40

And I think that's by, you know, creating a time like sort of like this is where it's sort of like aligning them. Time-wise and so that's like yeah. So it's like time-wise is like yeah so it's like if you're if you have a heartbeat at the same time that you have an alpha wave peaking and you put them both in a timesheet and you can just track the heartbeats and the halfway waves and correlate them through time that you have a map, you have that is like one example of how you can take one set of I guess unstructured data in compared to another set of unstructured data.

49:23

And yeah. So there's a time series and the end that and so actually there's there's there's a really cool tool by this neuroscientist from UCSD called his name is, his name is Tim Mullen and he created this, his company is called Intheology created. This some really cool open source tool and a number of closed source, tools, software tools that you can get.

49:50

If you're, if you want to do multimodal medical imaging. But, but it's exciting because just like that, the principle of demography. Is anyone still in the room? I went. Did everyone leave? Let me just check. Oh, so have people left. But yeah, the really cool thing about this is that is that it's like,

50:20

Anyway, so it has to be what side?

51:13

Yeah, it's yeah. It definitely like I want to see all that like, but this, let's link all the tomorrow, all these tomography articles, maybe we should have a group about just like about demography related articles. I mean, this is so much so much happening. So much news happening in that area imaging and to see how do you do you see, like do you agree that there is sort of like a link between the innovations and and medical imaging and and innovations?

51:42

And and and answer biological imaging and other and and other areas of the other areas where, well, there just being sort of like accelerated. Now are we seeing lots of tech advancements because of advancements in imaging generally speaking.

52:40

Got that there was just one connection, but they found 19 other connections that they could not understand how to approximate and why this connections really happened. So this is what they're trying to research on. And I think this in case they are able to understand that that would lead to some kind of breakthrough in your science.

53:03

So we think that we know everything but actually we still have a lot to know. So it affects all sciences, including biology. Of course, and and Layer 6 and other scientists. So this, why we are now going into a field of, you know, bringing on multi-disciplinary teams in order to understand a particular concept or on what we study about.

53:33

So imaging is very important and because I am just, I just recall, this is just about gravitational waves that, you know, it took us a hundred years to be able to hear the gravitational waves and that's because of technology but with the exponential technologies that are happening now and especially about imaging, there are going to be more breakthroughs.

53:58

So I agree with you sweet and what are some other like news items that I saw a couple things that you posted in self-aware networks? That were really interesting that I was talking about earlier. But what else you what? Other maybe news transfer. You seeing Cecile, sorry, sorry. I got this.

54:23

Come again. Oh, I was because I was saying, so you've been posting some really good articles recently on faceobok and I was looking at some of them and some of them from quantum magazine and so forth. But I maybe I could just ask you what, what are some of the most interesting news stories that you've been seeing lately?

54:42

I don't know if you've you have, if are you still driving? Maybe it's not convenient for you to look. I don't know, and I'm still driving but well there's it's not new but maybe it was last month or yeah. Last month there was an article last month about which is popular actually, but it's about they tried to this is a work of Michael Levine and the another's.

55:13

Other scientists. Actually, Michael Ivine is involved in complexity science. Send a books. They were to additions the first edition was that they got the skin of the frog and combined it with the heart muscle, and then they tried to put it in a petri dish and engineered it up down.

55:37

So they tried to develop stem cells out of it and they turned up that into send abouts based upon the design of an AI. So actually the second edition, which was the one which I'm talking about was that they also get this muscles a cells from the muscles and they just left them emerged.

56:03

Put it in a petri dish and try to let the organism emerge. But before that they asked an AI to design the kind of cell that they would like to have and then they found the one which emerged there, something that is never been seen.

56:27

Section which allows a lot and they are finding some kind of hope that it could be used in the future for brain surgery for heart, surgery to deliver drugs and to the ching or studies about the human body and other applications, they feel that since AI did not have same kind of bias that humans had AI was able to design something which they call coat and gold efficient system for this cell so that they would be able to have some use case in the future.

57:13

So we usually say that, you know, we try to put bias in AI. But in this case in the design, they said that, you know, sometimes a humans of course of limitations based upon their imagination of or based on what they had been thought. What to think that how do things so sometimes because this AI have no limits in a way since they have no conditioned, experience based upon culture or them be they have more imagination in that case.

57:47

So, I'm just

57:52

This time, they really had an experiment using this to life cells. Awesome. Also, I want to welcome, Lauren and Mohammed. If you, if you each like to say something you may. Hi. Hey guys, I was just okay by you to the group. So I was kind of like, you know, what's going on there?

58:43

I can't remember. And so if to see if you ever want to make a list of all the groups that you post, and I'll make sure to join them short. So must popular recent news about science.

59:06

Do you want to take that one to see? Okay, if you want it you guys because science is not a part, unless it's just space technology because I you know, my knowledge about the expertise is just international security, sort of things. So I am kind of like eager not ignorant about other science fields like you know like biology or all these kind of stuff.

59:31

So, you can just hear about those areas that I'm, you know, like I'm kind of like ignorant about. Okay, so I'll do that. Let's see, we can go ahead and so there's a group on faceobok that I'm going to reference. You don't have to visit it but I'm just that's where these articles are.

59:52

So there's an article called social mitochondria whispering between cells influence health. It's from quantum magazine, and there's another article from quantum magazine is called neurons unexpectedly, encoded information in the timing of their firing. And I saw a new article today, that was about a new technique that some researchers are experimenting with where they combine MRI with EEG electroencephalogram and functional necessary out.

01:00:26

But what is EEG? Oh, EEG is short for electroencephalogram and it's what it would would it would typically what people mean when they say EG it is, it's a little bit apart from the definition, but they mean, basically sensors, you put sensors on, on someone's scalp on their skin and you're just measuring voltage that's coming from the skin.

01:00:53

But that voltage when you take the noise out of it and you and you plotted it out on a time series. It it represents brainwave activity brainwave activity. That's that's that is passing outside your school in the go ahead. Oh yeah, like kind of like sort of technology such as neurolink.

01:01:21

I it's it's the ants. It's the ancestor of nearly so easy is really really old. But it is, it is the ancestor. It's the grandfather. Basically, I would say they so EG on the, on the skin would be like the grandfather technology and then EG inside the skull or ECOG would be the sun technology.

01:01:47

And then neuralink is kind of like because you're inserting. So I mean, so it's it's weird to say that this is like to say like that because there are there's also you know electrode arrays like the Utah array that are in a sense. Also, the grant like the grandparents of of nearly link.

01:02:13

So nearly has multiple branches of medical imaging, that sort of branch into it. So there's implanted electrodes and implanted electrode arrays, which are part of, which are also like grandparents. And then there's EG and ECOG which are also like grandparents and and basically you know anytime you're trying to measure voltage with a sensor that is sort of like that is electroencephalography which is the short word for EEG in tech and I think you know you could make an argument that the technically neuralink is the EG you could you could make that argument but that's not usually what people mean when they say EJ, they specifically mean like the scalp electrodes.

01:03:02

But I think nearly is also easy. It's just, it's just as specific kindness inside your brain and it's implanted with little pairs. So it's a specific technology specific techniques. It's much more advanced than and in many ways lead, frogs the previous generation by far and it not only that it also incorporates like, you know, I believe.

01:03:30

And actually this means this may not be accurate but I believe it incorporates, you know, technology from like tetras to neural dust like a lot of different technology concepts. And I think most people haven't heard of many of these, you know, neural dose, what is neural dust? Well, it's like when they injected magnetic stuff into cells in order to make them fire one at a time, you know, that was.

01:03:53

And then we had opto genetics, right? And these are still very relevant technologies. I didn't mean to use optogenetics in the past sense. But but yeah. So that answer your question. Yeah. What? Thanks, I'm learning, right? Welcome. So, and then, so the news today, let me look back the highlights of it, was we?

01:04:25

There was a social mitochondria, which was an article about, you know, basically if we could figure out, you know, how mitochondria. So it, mitochondria are, they're bacteria that are inside human cells and we have a sort of symbiotic relationship with these bacteria called mitochondria. They help the human beings to digest food, and produce energy.

01:04:51

And without them, we wouldn't be as efficient at I processing food and producing energy and, but they're really smaller inside ourselves and ourselves are really small. So that's pretty small. And then there's other great news article. That's about phase procession that socio posted. It's neuron. So, the title is neurons unexpectedly and code information, the timing of the firing.

01:05:18

So that's like that's asking us to think, again, about the analogy of the brain, the brain firing as like our brain inspiring as like, it's like a piano or it's like a symphony where the timing really matters, a timing of when the note comes out of my mouth, really matters to the human brain.

01:05:36

And so, when you think so what you typically, when you have these conversations, where people are comparing, we're comparing something like, artificial neural networks, you know, deep learning. We're comparing that to real neurons and real brains. And in these comparisons, what, what sort of becomes like the focus is what, how can we encode and extract information from firing patterns from firing rates at the, at the neuron level and or higher.

01:06:13

I really, I mean, really the focus for a lot of for basically, the entire field of, of I, yeah, I say it's kind of like, basically the entire field of deep learning kind of like, the focus is like, really what can we learn about information? That is above the single neurons threshold information.

01:06:34

That is encoded in the firing rate between, you know, in spike trains at the neuron level and multi neuron level and in terms of their firing rates and what's kind of? Like, not really looked at is the phase procession or the timing of of, you know, when when a neuron fires, when you, when the organism is in a room, like, if the we have a play cells and these play cells become active when you're in a certain place, but they also become active when you're well, I mean, we have our grid cells become active when you're in a certain place, but a place else become active when you're in a certain part of that place.

01:07:19

So, as you move through a space, there is there are play cells lighting up that that are correlated with the organisms knowledge. I say organism because most of these studies were done on rats but it applies to to people as well. It's the concept that these play cells are helping you to these with the neural correlates of you, knowing where you are in a room relative to the room, like which part of the room, you're in and which, which way you're facing, these are place cells are the neural correlates of that knowledge.

01:07:57

And that we spy to so far. So there could be other neural correlates that that are not haven't been spotted yet which is really interesting but but place cells are important and and that much we know that much I think people know I don't know I'm saying we know that one some scientists.

01:08:17

Now, what was the plan? Oh yeah. Okay. So what's really great interesting? Like, comment. They don't expect you several hours ago in another room.

01:08:34

Yeah. Actually, we were talking about the same topic about connecting the computer and brain and taking infants from the brain for developing new artificial intelligence more of nature intelligence, but made out ofitially. But what's interesting about most most of the artificial intelligence attempts to where you finished muhammad. I'm not sure where you, I don't know.

01:09:05

Oh, yeah. You were talking about the brain imaging. I read one article last year, using three photo microscope along with the fluorescent protein. But on my question here is even if you want to use the electrode arrays. I guess the neural link achieved. 10500 electrodes in the array? I'm not sure.

01:09:31

So those will tell that this region is getting a fired. I mean, some some neurons in this region is getting fired since you did something and based on that inference, I'm telling my mission to change that signal to a command that he's moving his hand. But what if I want to move my exact finger muscle to write a word?

01:09:56

So my finger should be in such position that hold my pin and writes, the exact word with my handwriting. I'm talking about the neural prostate processes. So if I want to send the single to the processes to the, it made in a way that replicates the actual hand. So it wired in a way that games, the muscle moment so far that I should know, the new neuron level relationship between each.

01:10:32

Neuron that fires for each movement in the muscle. While writing since we are predicting the region which is getting fired while doing some work also, I read one article. It's world. I guess with chimpanzees, if they want to move their hand and from the brain signal, we can predict the angle of movement.

01:11:00

Like from one place it grabs one object and place it to another or trying to get the object from someone and how the brain I mean neurons are working to booking based on the input from the eyes and input from the muscle and angle of moment. So, is it possible to know the neuron level relationship between each neuron that leads to these each unit of movement in the muscle muscular level or even the inhibition level?

01:11:37

Like even the thought level. So what we're at the point, where with the instruments that exist scientists can underage scientists with, you know, with unlimited budget and unlimited resources and unlimited access to technology. Could could we could read single neurons firing. And if you can read us, if you can plant electrodes next to a neuron and listen to it firing and you can also use what was a, you know, triangulation there's a sensor called tetras and they use that was the first time that they used triangulation to sort of determine where sort of created like a 3D map of where signals were coming from and and what they what they were coming from and the work, I mean I think that there's there's there might be a plenty of work for the next 200 to 500 years of neuroscience.

01:12:49

Just this and this new stuff to uncover, new studies to be done as just just a gigantic amount of work. But but eventually, yeah, eventually, we'll get to a point where with today's technology and a ton of work and a ton of resources and a massive amassive. Yeah, undertaking.

01:13:15

Yeah. You could you could eventually not only sort of like, you know, recon. Well, so, so the curious case about how your hand movement works is that, it also involves trio set prior exception. So, like your hand. Like, if you put your hand out in front of you and you want to move it to grab anything in your environment, I don't know what's in your environment.

01:13:49

So I'll just say, if you, if there's something in front of you that you can grab, or maybe the floor, you can touch the floor, right? When you move your hand down to the floor, to the object. There's a constant feedback between where your hand. Is it, lets you brain know where your hand is and where your hand needs to move next.

01:14:08

It's not like you are executing one command in your hand drops to the item that you that you want. It is a constant feedback. It's, it's like. Where are you? I'm here. Okay, go there. Where are you? I'm here. Okay, go there and this is like this back and forth between your hand and your brain.

01:14:27

So, imagine if you have this two-way conversation between cells happening but you're only listening to what the brain is doing because the hand is no longer there and you're only listening to the brain. Well, you're only listening to half of the conversation, right? So there's pop, there's things like that.

01:14:44

They need to be resolved but eventually you could build some sort of bioceptive. You you could what I'm saying, is that, like, you could eventually figure it out if the person didn't have a hand, you could eventually figure out what the hand was doing by, you know, first of all, you know, training training your, your neural networks, your program.

01:15:08

So learn how this, how those signaling happens in the first place. And then to identify the signs of of this signaling happening just on the brain side and then to identify what, you know, how to encourage and develop and grow those signs. So that there's a sort of privacy of relationship that farms between the cells or the whatever is representing.

01:15:35

The cell signals in the artificial hand or artificial limb and learning to, I guess the word I would think of is wean them onto wean them, into a relationship with with the with the brain and all of the stuff could be figured out. I don't know if it's gonna be figured out in two years or 300 years.

01:15:56

That's my, that's your guess is my guess. I don't know. So here comes a portion so many comes to the VA I think and they're learning maybe it could be matched to you know intelligence quotient about what about like you know EQ how could we like you know like connected a computer to humans or connected humans to computer and make them together on this?

01:16:25

You know, like emotional portion in terms of like they're going to work as a human being. So again, this might be a 300 year problem but does it take a crack at it? I'm I think of, I think of like, there's a lot of ideas about what emotions are I am favorable to the idea that emotions are And I say this that that emotions are sample spatial and phasic patterns.

01:17:08

And basically that the faceobok patterns both basically what I'm saying is like I think that, you know, I've heard so I've heard scientists say okay well basically you know we can describe it. So audio memory stored in the brain along with the incident that happened. That's how if you want to think about something bad happened in your lifetime, it might be a visual thing or audibles thing a brain first pick up the the strongest memory that stored.

01:17:46

Like it may be a visual one. It may be audible one and along with the feeling that stored along with the visual that comes into your, like, whatever. I say, a consciousness and then you feel that emotion in that way. So if you would say like if we want to remain the emotion into the artificial intelligence.

01:18:12

So the people we are trying to recreate the brain process, the brain wiring into the mission. So you feel can figure out the wiring that is being made a day by day even from the birth to till they end. From each process, from trying to learn how to talk the language or trying to walk or put our first walk or trying to take our first step learning to drive God and everything being wired based on the practice.

01:18:48

So that's how a based on those wirings if we could find the basic building block of the brain language the wiring pattern there are other. There are topics called neural dynamics that I read from the Stanford professors they made with their colleagues the neurons or behaves and certain way they made some certain weird patterns.

01:19:14

I'm not sure whether they found out any general motives with that patterns, but they are. Those are creating patterns in time also in space. So if we could find that a general motive on the basic brain language that is being communicated between each neurons. We can program that the wiring's in the artificial intelligence to if you're planning to recreate the whole brain experience in the artificial systems.

01:19:51

I mean, I also started, you know, political psychology and I also studied data science in terms of data statistics. So for, you know, this social science researchers, but problem is that emotions could be measurable in some part. But, you know, all this emotional variances, depending on like a personal emotional reaction cannot be really measurable and it could be very vulnerable.

01:20:15

So hard to solve the problem when it comes to AI. Okay, so I guess, you know, so I have like a different. Maybe I might my map of my internal reality might be a little bit different and so I want to try to describe what I think by like but sort of like with it with like a thought experiment.

01:20:38

Like imagine that and then I'm an emotion and we'll talk about emotions and smells at the same time because there's a two different modalities. But basically I'm saying like imagine and also let's imagine like a 3D computer program and so a 3D completely like a video game is an example.

01:20:58

So you have imagine people oh no man or a little woman and this is the player character that you embody. So it could be the terminator, I don't know, but, and you're in a 3D environment. You move it around. Okay? Now, for this example, what I'm trying to what I'm trying to say is that there's a correlation between this 3D environment which is like, you know, there's an x axis, there's y axis which is up and down, and there's z axis which is gives you your depth and x axis is your, is your, you know, what's to your left and what's your right?

01:21:28

And so, you're covering all the directions with x, y and z. And so what I'm saying is like, imagine the xyz is now like, it's the the axis to your left into your right and the z is in front of you and behind you. And so, what's behind? You is like negative z or in it.

01:21:52

Oh actually, what's kind of is like a positive z because and, and what's in front of you is negativity because if you, Hi, it doesn't matter why actually. But we'll just like, imagine that this, this three different acts, three axis, or maybe it's a six axis because you have positive z.

01:22:13

Negative, z, positive x, negative x positive, y, negative y. So, what to b is like a positive y. What's below you? As a negative one. And that when you so imagine that when you have an emotion you just have this three degree grid, okay? And when you have an emotion this emotion has a peak, has a moment when the submotion feels great or big or significant or it's here.

01:22:38

It's rising, it's at saturation. And then when after reaches its peak, like it, like away, but sort of decreases, it decreases spatially decreases like it's smaller. It's lesser, it's less than tense. It's, and you hear people describe their emotions this way all the time. Like, like chat with temporal and also spatial characters just where you feeling emotion, my heart hurts, my I'm feeling the emotion in my chest, I'm feeling the emotion all around me.

01:23:12

I'm in this really lovely cloud of happy cannabis, cloud, pink climate cannabis, it feels really comfy. Reals feel really my my vibes are good. I've got these good vibes or everywhere. Where is it spaciously? Oh, it's it's, it's, I'm feeling this in this intensity in my finger. I don't know.

01:23:35

It could be, it could be. When you thinking about the past is, where is the passes it behind you? Is it this is there a timeline? Does it run to your is a timeline if you're passing president in future, does it run from your left or to your right?

01:23:48

Or does it run from like in front of you to behind you? Or does it go from a bubble you to below you or or something else? Right? And and so I just like maybe try for yourself and think about all the different emotions that you have. And if they have any spatial characteristics that you can identify in terms of where the emotions are and do the same thing for smells, where is the smell?

01:24:13

Is it if you smell a rose? You know, like where, like what's this sort of like, how what is the texture of the smell? What is the sort of, the layout of the perfume? What is the Roma like, people describe aromas with, like they're swinging, their hands through the air and big circles, for no reason.

01:24:34

It's like, oh, like I it's like this. I'm trying to describe this spatial concept to smell this and maybe it's this. Maybe it's an emotion too. And and so they have like we have these it's really hard to describe what an emotion is or what a smell means because we're trying to describe something that that I think is like it has temporal and spatial characteristics, but but language does not really have temporal.

01:25:00

And we can. Yeah, we can add temporal and spatial characteristics. I can describe a 3D picture, right? But but that's what I'm saying is it's what I think is that basically like you are, we're all of our emotions are can be described as patterns and we're describing patterns. When we describe describe my emotions to you, you know, you describe your emotions to your friend, your friends describes their emotions, to the other friend and, and and so on.

01:25:33

But we're describing patterns like at the root of it, everything is is a pattern. You've got a pattern for smell like that. You're detecting that you describing, you've got a pattern for emotions. You're detecting describing. And it's and I, my conjecture. Is that as a four dimensional pattern? There's an x y and z in time and that I'm not the only one.

01:25:52

I think that has that conjecture. But what I'm saying is that you can, if you have a four dimension, if you can describe emotions in four dimensions then probably we can find neural, correlates in four dimensions as well, and then we can. And again, I don't know if it's going to take two years or 300 years but at some point we can identify the neural correlates of emotions and reproduce them in a machine and then send them back into another human being just a test to see if we got it, right.

01:26:33

You're so in it comes to like this kind of like you know I added viable identifiable emotions. I actually kind of wonder like then just near scientists have tried a period into XYZ but in fact the emotions can be, you know, variable like a from a to z in fact.

01:26:56

And I don't know if you have read this by Michael, was it just came out like a couple years ago or something. And the book, the title of the book is the ongoing project. So it's basically saying about like this, you know, the huge emotional variances actually go out.

01:27:15

So basically says like emotions, cannot be just a, you know, just identified in a certain pattern. So it's just a the author describes all the stories about Daniel Canaman in Alma's Tarot, Ski Rescue beer, the gray scholars were, you know, this and psychology. So I actually have have read the book and I really struggle agree.

01:27:45

Yeah. With their stories and then argument wishes cannot be really, I didn't identify based on certain patterns, so I, I don't know. So what do you think? Well, I mean I have to read his book. I've read I pulled up this. This the undoing project. A friendship that changed our minds.

01:28:05

Is that what is that? What it is? You're actually project actually it's the stories about you know this doctor diversity and then doctor cannot, they worked on like different projects for years and then they finally just idified that the emotions cannot be really measurable. Well, I mean, I again, I have to read the book first before I can comment on the book I think.

01:28:32

But it's really, but I just wanted to hear about your comments about, you know, this basic notion. Yeah. From the book. Well, I mean, can you say can you say from the book? Why? What's the reason why? They're saying that that emotions can't be coming identifiable pattern. Yeah. I mean, some basic emotions, like a happiness and anger, these kind of stuff or anxiety could be measurable for sure, but it's kind of like, you know, it's just a, just a layer.

01:29:06

It's just a, it's just a superficial because the people, a human being has, like, all different emotions that can also differ depending on their personality and also situation. Because, you know, every human being for reactions to a same situation. That's why is that the reason why, okay? All right, Well, okay.

01:29:38

So what I think, and what I think is true is that with every human brain, there's going to be very significant differences in terms of how that brain has learned each modality, each concept. And what order that concept was learned in. There's going to be difference in how people see the world and and if you've ever done psychedelic medication

01:30:11

But but the you could see that there's there are alternate states of mind, is it? Maybe, maybe drinking is is the best example, I guess a person can drink and they can discover that. If they drink too much, there's an alternate experience of of consciousness that they can have and that and that warps there.

01:30:38

Their reality from from what is normal for them. And their behavior might be different because of it and just many examples of people driving drunken incorrectly. So we can see, like the point was, we can see that under under drugs, that that altered mental experiences are possible. And in that closes into the idea that wait a second.

01:31:05

This other person that their mind might not be identical to my princess, a difficult idea for some folks and just that's kind of a joke but it is it's like the this is the sophist joke. Like everyone's minds exactly like my mind tonight. That's some people actually think that.

01:31:28

I think they like if I, you know, like how can I like that other people don't think differently, what we're all the same? Like that's that's a that's really funny but it's not true. People do think differently and people do have, you know, greatly diverging, emotional spectrum and emotional experiences, you know, that the whole another good example, it of emotional, divergences is just different in testosterone and estrogen, in terms of what it does to be human mind in terms of the emotional spectrum, right?

01:32:10

That did you are going to have people describe dramatically different experiences when they, when they when you know a good example is when they're when they're taking testosterone or estrogen for, for one reason or another that they're emotional experiences change, and there's lots of interesting descriptions. I'm not going to go into what those descriptions are, but but it's like, but what I, what, what I'm getting at though, is that, is that despite the differences in how brains make up their own construction of reality, not just from one moment to the next but over lifetimes, right?

01:32:55

Who, how you see yourself? Might have changed very dramatically since since high school or since you know, some earlier stage in your life, right? And you're easier, mental state may have changed, you may, you may have, you know, some of the person that what what's likely is you have most of the person that you were before.

01:33:18

But you also have you operate now at a higher level of operational, success. Hopefully, I guess I mean, for some people are on the decline. You know, some people are declining in terms of their mental capabilities, but some people are, you know, increasing in their mental capabilities. And and I guess if you're over 30 here on the, on the decline, right?

01:33:43

Something? Okay. So I guess I'm one of the big decliners now because I'm anyway, but the point is that that you is that I think that despite the difference is in brains that there is a way to to find a sort of common core for communication purposes. So and what that means is that like I know what broccoli is and you know what broccoli is and it's a seal notes of broccoli is and everyone knows what broccoli is and we all know basically like if we were all wearing blindfolds and we all tasted broccoli, we could we could distinguish it from something that was significantly different enough.

01:34:29

Every time. Like if it's ice cream you could distinguish broccoli from ice cream pretty much. Every time with high accuracy I would bet and not everyone can't like I said, the brains are different. Some people can't tell the difference between broccoli and, and ice cream, but I mean, most people can.

01:34:47

And, and, and so, the point is that, let's say that broccoli has patterns. It has patterns for your taste buds, that you can detect as patterns for it's texture. When you crunch the broccoli and your teeth, it has patterns in terms of, you know, light patterns, it refracts light to, to, to look at this.

01:35:12

It's a green tree. Like, fractal thing that's crunchy and tasty. And and it has nutrients in it and has all these properties that I can identify and you can identify your emotional spectrum might be dramatically different from mine and probably is because I probably have a lot more testosterone, just guessing.

01:35:37

But I could be wrong. You never know. But I think they that even though our minds are probably very different that we can talk about the same thing because you're and in that point because we're because you're taking whatever information you've got in your in your sort of like convert your automatic, you're automatically gonna convert that to let's say you're to make a funny analogy, just say your brain is running mac and mine is running windows.

01:36:10

Well, you're gonna convert whatever information you get to to your operating system. That's that's what I'm saying. And because that is, because that is the that I actually shouldn't say. Because if that is correct, that's what I say, if that, if that's correct, it basically like you'll, our brands are different, but we're processing.

01:36:34

But the basic things that were processing are the same. Our brands are different, but the words that were processing are the same and the concepts that were processing are the same, like, we're like the representation of broccoli is cluster of concepts from my visual cortex, my audio cortex, my smatter sensory cortex, including my taste buds and the tight, the feel and texture of broccoli and and the feeling texture of ice cream.

01:37:04

And because there's enough common properties to this cluster of concepts and the different sensory cortices that are linked together. Then we can talk about it. And and what I mean is like we like we as in all of us, everyone can talk about broccoli and ice cream as concepts that we can unpack.

01:37:29

And like, when I describe the properties, you're like, that's not the properties of broccoli. Broccoli makes a chicken sound. Yeah. I mean, I understand that, you know, emotional common ground of his human being what I'm hearing about. There's how can we just capture the all of this human emotional variance like and and just, you know, the concealed, this AI system.

01:37:53

I know like a wind killing a tuba. Oh okay. Well I mean so in terms of when I mean I could be two years or 300 years it's that's my go-to answer today later. Yeah yeah. Could be a thousand years later but I think that that we can think about it at least.

01:38:16

And I think that we I I favor the idea, the hypothesis and which is what I'm talking about that that yeah we that every person's emotional spectrum is going to be different. Every we're going to have a different construction of reality, but but what we want to do, we'll be able to achieve, which is basically, to sort of maybe find a way to relate the emotional impact.

01:38:48

And in creating emotional representation, that one person is having and convey that emotionally impact to convey, at least, some sort of representation of, of what that impact is to, basically to understand it computationally. But then to sort of convert it to a representation that is more useful than just dialogue.

01:39:19

Right now. I think maybe for intern in terms of emotions, it's really nice to just do dialogue with somebody where you can talk about how you're feeling. I think that any yeah. I mean, because, you know, I'm sorry to cut out, but to be honest with you as a person who knows all this, you know, in a national security matters and in political psychology, I always think that if we could average you that the part and I put that into the deep learning system, then, you know, be actually could achieve the world without war and we can achieve word peace.

01:40:04

That's a good thoughts. I have to think more out to think I'd put acne about that for a week, at least maybe if not a few years.

01:40:19

And how does it get that?

01:40:24

I mean I think more short-term things that might impact world peace would be like really accurate, light detectors, but yet like so if we yet building it in a sort of useful represent useful and accurate, not as here's the thing, it's it's it's not.

01:40:48

What I think is that because I think because it's probably a fact that my the way my brain is is representing, reality is probably very different from the next person's brain. That that even if you could accurately capture the full emotion in four dimensions, like in accurately reproduce it, you then stuck with like a translation problem because it's not like you got to somehow translate that back to another person so emotional system.

01:41:31

So it's really about building a useful representation that bridges the the different people involved and that would be a third representation which is not the original representation and so and that's sense. It's kind it, it's sort of like I think that, you know, with language, we are describing our emotions, about certain things that we care about in the world, like our borders and our our countries needs that were whatever, whatever people at the national security level care about.

01:42:15

But but, but yeah, so it's it's not about accuracy. I think it's, it's about, I think they're always be like an art to it because you have to sort of like, maybe I don't. Maybe there's a maybe it's, maybe there's gonna be a math to it. Like how do I like convert one person's?

01:42:38

What do these because it's here's what I'm trying to say. It's like what these emotions mean to this person. Okay. Is a difference, it's sort of a different story from what they, these neural from. What these emotions would mean, if you put the exact same emotion into someone else is what I'm thinking.

01:43:00

And so there has to be sort of a storytelling happening the sort of like sort of like creates a context for how this person has constructed their reality, and what it means to them. And I think that that is part of the difficulty of language translation. Also, that I think you're ready to talk.

01:43:21

I could go ahead. I was just listening and I was kind of like clapping because I was agreeing with you. Oh, there was copying. Okay, awesome. Yeah, yeah. Emotional that emotional questions. And, you know, all these emotional, you know, variances just could be interpreted through the way, but actually the behavior patterns and then the behaviors as a response is to the emotion could be different.

01:43:51

That's yeah, that all this dynamics, just like it cannot be just, you know, kind of like cage it into certain mathematical concepts or sort of things. But yeah it's so whole huge dynamics and I kind of like wonder what kind of comments and Muhammad would want to make.

01:44:17

Um, yeah, I the mathematical concept can be used to differentiate that each vectors. If one person have a threshold to have a emotional breakdown, while other person might be very strong to handle that situation, that is based on the the way they grew up the the things that they have experienced in their lifetime, that's how each person already.

01:44:46

First like all people are coming out of the room by crying and looking for food, fair of the new things and then from from now on they will be looking for learning to use a learning new stuff languages. And the behaviors. They will be trying to be like their father, their mother.

01:45:14

And that's where we all the starting to differ from one another. And the things we see while doing up the things we learn that differs. So these will be complaining factors like preparing our brain, while thinking these turbs and reacting to it, how we are going to handle, and how the brain handles one stuff, and why all are not having the same emotional behavior for the things, they, they experience.

01:45:52

So I would say, yeah, everyone can face the same things, but based on these criteria, everything will differ. I'm going to go ahead and leave the room to Cecile and Lauren and Muhammad and everyone else is you can invite them to the thing. It's set is 2am, so I would be irresponsible if I stayed a minute longer, but I I think the conversation's going great and I would love for it to continue.

01:46:20

So good night, everybody. Oh, all right, Micah, good night, here is a toy room too. I guess you're in the best coast. Yeah, yeah. And I mean the northwest side again. Oh, you think that? Yeah, we had more, you know, scientific to have conversation by freely. Yeah, I love science conversations, but let me, I really feel like it's my duty to to go to sleep.

01:46:52

Now it's very silly, right? My cup, actually, isn't this? Just like a papa, which is not a regular schedule. So maybe you can plant something along that and make something more organized in the near future. So that we will have a good discussion because actually that the questions which we may not have answers cow and it's a very important thing because that's what science is.

01:47:29

So it is a good element for any kind of education and discussion. But of course, look at the studies or, you know, the opinion of other people who have been trained in the academic to look at this. And plus those people who are out box thinkers to make a good discussion, just like what we did about your questions and about the point of view of all of Muhammad about the different kinds of emotions that people should be able to feel based that their biology based upon the culture that they were raised on and based upon then you're a diversity of which person.

01:48:11

What's up different kinds of excitability? This actually. So, very lot of permutations and how to define this emotions and it's a good discussion. So my classes, you started this room, the baskets of new to probably think and how to organize this and maybe we'll make a another good discussion at the later times sometimes soon.

01:48:36

Yeah. That's what I was thinking to because it's such a great conversation to involve all a lot more people in our later regular times like during the weekend and afternoon, it'll be. Yeah. So much greater and why did you just a plan? Something. Okay now I just want to ask is the conversation that that was really interesting.

01:49:00

Was that also the one that sort of like about emotions and relating emotions and politics together or just it's just general science news discussion. Yeah. I mean it could involved in every aspect you know of the science. Because I don't really think that social science in the science, you know, separated, they always go together in terms of just, you know, in a national security order things.

01:49:25

So I mean, you know, we can just throw out a conversation and we can let it go and we will see what's happening. Well, I I'm willing to make this also about sort of like a national security conversation as long as we can get a national security expert to show up.

01:49:45

So maybe I can message you with the an orca seal. I'll message everybody and we'll we'll post a schedule to invite people, but I I wouldn't be able to maintain a national security conversation by myself. It's not my monotony. Yes, sure, you understand that it was just just my personal perspective.

01:50:06

Yes, since the, you know, field of my expertise, just lying there, and I just want to apologize. It interested disturbed a conversation in the room. So, I just wanted to say that, I really enjoyed this conversation with everybody. And I really liked going into the national security topic. But I just, I'd like I said, I don't know anything, it's not my focus, but I but I would like to have more discussions about it in the future so all and all the coordinate with you with, with everyone and post, I guess, I guess the, let me take a screenshot so I remember.

01:50:44

Okay. So we've got Lauren Kim and as a CEO and Mohammed and I'll just send out a post on Twitter or something inviting people and what will create a schedule and and maybe like if a few times a week or something and and just, you know, see who's around.

01:51:12

And I like this sort of casual pop-up style. But yeah, I guess I guess we would a schedule and some structure would work for some people so we'll we'll do that. Okay, good night. Good night. Minecraft tonight.
