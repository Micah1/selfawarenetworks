Note: I don't agree with parts of the Summary, and parts of the Key Points. It's a rough summary, not exactly correct, but enough to help me remember the general content of this note.

# Summary by AI (LLM, SciSummary with ChatGPT 4):
The article discusses how the brain processes and recognizes patterns as sequences or coincidences in both temporal and spatial dimensions. It suggests that the brain functions like a neural network, with each neuron capable of representing a specific pattern in a 3D space. The brain continually predicts firing patterns, and when several neurons fire together, they start to receive energy and activate. The brain detects unexpected occurrences, incorporating them into a sequence of coincidences. The article compares the brain's function to a four-dimensional movie or a holographic room, where every point can represent a 3D space. In conclusion, the brain constantly predicts firing patterns and recognizes patterns to process and understand information.

# Key Points by AI (LLM, SciSummary with ChatGPT 4):
The article focuses on the Neurohaxor 2.0 technology, which utilizes sensors to detect blood flow changes based on an individual's direction of gaze. An upgraded version will feature sensors throughout the body, expanding its capabilities. The article also alludes to a volcano island and ancient civilizations. 

The article delves into how neurons work and how they have buttons that only fire when specific information is received. Human memory is reliant on learned sequences that are represented by firing.

The brain is capable of recognizing and representing patterns and shapes in a 3D volume, with different neurons representing different parts of an object or letter. The entire brain can be triggered to consciousness when a particular pattern of neurons fires. 

The article also mentions how the firing of neurons can be re-entrained and how they can represent specific patterns or nothing at all. Throughout the article, there are references to sequences, both in the context of neurons and patterns of firing."

The Neurohexor 2.0, Neurohexor 2.0, that's better.

Um, yeah, so, it's a quick night, we have two F-nears, sensors, one on the left and one on the right, because people can modify the blood flow between loves and right, you know, which way they're looking.

Um, and then upgrade versions will have sensors all over the place, you know, like the kernel, that's it.

Very hotness, tautelush, green, hurt valley, very hot right now.

Um.

Okay, so here is the volcano island, and the ancient civilizations, and to try the walks through the canyon, also the volcanoes that wiped out our civilizations, right?

How different?

Uh.

Okay, so imagine, we may have, what's in here?

It's a disaster.

It brings a sense of disaster.

Okay, so imagine, uh, a sense of disaster.

Um.

Okay, so imagine.

It's like, each neuron is, uh, is, uh, a button, each neuron has a button, okay?

And it only fires if it gets specific information.

Okay, because it's like a computer that you can, it gets programmed to, to recognize something very specific, like a specific part of the sequence.

Okay.

Human memory is learned sequences.

Human memory is learned sequences.

Okay, so, um.

The neuron is fired.

Okay.

We've got our neurons.

Now, they had to fire for the most part of the day, as, like, it's like a computer that they could be trying to only fire with it and do that side of the day, as I guess.

Okay, so then, uh.

Only part of the sequence was to make musical notes, for example, as they had to do with a temple or a shrine.

It could be a temple or a shrine.

It could be a temple or a shrine.

Okay.

The idea is that, um, it's just like, it's just remembering a very specific, it's remembering a previous pattern, right?

That previous pattern is just learning what it's going to fire again.

I mean, it's learning what it's going to fire for, what sequence it's going to fire for.

So, the sequence is learning to sequence what it's going to fire.

It's like, wait, if it receives the information from a certain pattern, like, if it receives the R pattern, it's going to fire.

But below that, the downstream rounds, they're receiving, you know, is it dark, is it light, is it dark, is it light?

Or if it's a color, what color is it?

What color is it?

So neurons, so the dendrite of a neuron is learning a sequence, and then it's putting back a sequence, like a piano sequence, sorry, a piano sequence.

And so, you know, I'm deciding the sequence of temporal spatial patterns, right, that's able to remember sequence because each neuron, the downstream in that sequence is only going to fire.

Dendrite is only going to fire if it sees a certain pattern.

If it sees a certain pattern, it's only going to be killed if you just take a temporary impact, a dissipating impact. It's like a pattern that beats a few times.

It changes its oscillation. I mean, it acts as a potential for change in neurons. The amount of information that a neuron receives is changes. It changes whether and when it's going to fire.

Is that a neuron going to fire if it receives a certain pattern? A certain pattern is like a number in one sense.

It's an abstract pattern, a temporal spatial pattern. So it's either all stuff stored by dendritic recognition, spikes on the dendrite, spikes on the synapses, spikes on the tongue.

Are those spikes from the store? Are those spikes from the store? I guess they are synaptic terminals.

Are there spikes in the dendrite? Are there hairs in the dendrite? Are there spikes in the dendrite that are not connected to the neurons, I think?

I'm not sure. Are there spikes that are just hairs, kind of, that are not part of the bouton? I think there are. But now it's used, so I guess I'll start again.

Okay, so what I mean to say is that, but anyway, hairs, they can connect or do connect.

Those spikes, they can connect very, very rapidly. What that means is that they're looking for a specific pattern.

So you have a pattern, okay, so you could have a network of neurons, a neural network of pattern detectors.

And so if there's a sequence that's being played, the sequence would be played by the step of the sequence would be passed to different neurons, because each neuron will take a timeout after it fires, or an iteration.

And so it fires, and so if another step in a sequence comes in, it passes from where the first neuron was and the second one, and that fires, and then it passes from the second one to the third one, and that fires, and so on.

So each neuron takes a self-out and becomes a neighborhood after firing, and so if they fire in like 10 milliseconds, if they fire, like if you don't fire in 10 milliseconds, then the signal keeps passing, so now the signal is traveling, right?

And so maybe at some point, yeah, that's another circuit firing, and that's how power's being detected, but to never be spontaneous, we'd be wiring.

So remember how if you're playing the game Tetris, you're playing the game Tetris, okay? And so it's like you remember after you're playing the game for like five hours, you start to see Tetris patterns in your head.

If you play the game Tetris for eight hours and then try to sleep, you might be seeing like pictures of Tetris blocks in your vision, because your brain has modified itself to be thinking about Tetris, Tetris blocks, right?

And that means that your brain is able to modify what patterns it looks for and what patterns it detects. So your brain is like looking really looking for Tetris blocks is why you're seeing them.

And your brain likes it thinking, so it's like, imagine that same neuron, imagine that neuron fires in that sequence, okay? Imagine a new sequence at the start that uses sequences from the first sequence, set in sequences from the second sequence.

So now what's firing is, let's say that you have the same neuron as a pattern detector. If a person sees a certain pattern, but that certain pattern can come from any direction, which means that it's going to fire to learn sequences like in a sense like you can have sequences that are asymmetric to other sequences.

And so in that case you would have the same pattern, but it would light up like somewhere else.

But for the other pattern, remember that the second sequence would remember the first sequence because when that sequence fires, it's transmitting a signal to every other neuron in the brain.

It's like broadcasting. It works exactly the way electrical impedance tomography works. When a neuron fires, it's just like electrical impedance tomography and that signal is being sent everywhere without bias.

It's going to go out through all of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions. So the neurotransmitters are just going to fire from the neuron in all directions.

But it does matter with the amplitude of the firing as it's based upon the reception of the K. So the amplitude means that I think it means that an neuron can recognize different patterns.

Yeah, I think this is part of the programming thing, like tetris blocks, getting a custom red light or certain signals, getting a custom anti-smell.

It suggests that when maybe a neuron is, it was changed.

Or, oh, wait a second. The pattern that it recognizes may be different from the pattern that it transmits, you know what I'm saying?

So it can look for a certain pattern because it kind of needs to know two steps. It kind of needs to know the previous pattern, the incoming pattern, and it's kind of a transitive pattern.

But it could work like a regular neural network where it can learn to, so it's doing pattern recognition.

Or one neuron is looking for one specific pattern, but actually it could recognize multiple patterns.

And those multiple patterns would each want to be like a packet of vesicles because that's all it can transmit, is 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicles.

So vesicles are like going to reach more neurons.

So it can only transmit the amplitude, which is 1, 2, or 3, 0, which is over 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, or 3.

So it's going to be firing normally anyways. And so what happens is, it's going to have fire with a normal rhythm, but anyways.

And this is why it has the ability to, the normal rhythm is when it's not reporting anything.

But this is like the basis of temporary memory, like it's like when you see something, you are...

When you see something, your neuron is going to ignore the signals of neurons that are firing.

And each neuron in that sequence, which is exactly 1 millisecond.

Each neuron in the sequence, and the sequence is exactly 1 millisecond for each neuron.

It's going to learn a pattern. It's going to transmit a slightly different pattern.

It's going to learn a pattern. It's like, okay, that pattern could be...

I guess the pattern could be a 1, 2, 3, or it could be a 0, 1, 2, or 3.

In a sense.

Well the neuron is only going to recognize it's 0, 1, 2, or 3, let's say.

I got a 1, because it's going to say I got a 1, or I got a 0, I got a 0, I got a 1, 2, or I got 3.

So, and this sort of like represents like quantity, so it could be like that's like a pixel.

The representation is like it's transparent, or it's gray, or it's like light gray, or it's dark gray, or it's black.

0, 1, 2, and 3. So 3 is black, and 0 is transparent.

Anyway, you have like a 4 digits. Like every neuron represents 4 digits. 0, 1, but it's not binary.

It's not binary, it's like there's 4 digits, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

But all you need is the sparse representation.

Okay, so potentially the C of 4 digits, right? So potentially how many patterns can you have?

1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3.

It means that I could record any pattern that had 4 digits, 4 bits. I could record 4 bit patterns with multiple 4 bit patterns.

I have a neural network and I can encode 4, I can record any pattern that can be converted to 4 bits.

But here's the thing, if I could fire like a 4, because it's like 1, 2, 3, 4.

You know it's 0. It's like 0, 2, 3, it's like 0, 1, 2, 3.

I know it's a pixel and brightness, right? Or it could represent the volume of sound.

Is it 0, 1, 2, 3, 4? It's like a 4 degree resolution, right?

What happens is 4 is 4 and then you have like, you could have 40, right? So we're up for the 1, 2, 3, 4.

It could represent 4 numbers, 0, 1, 2, or 3.

You have 30, yeah. You have 33, right? You have 33, 33. So it's like a base 4, so base 2.

Ok, so here's that, it's like 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5.

Let me see if it's a sequence of 5, it's like, this sequence is anything, right? But it's a sequence.

So you could be 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 across the board.

negative sequences because okay so this thing is like it's lining a sequence right so like

it'll flash to 3, 5, 3, 6, 6, 9 right but you can have another sequence to 3, 5, 3, 7, 7, 9 right

now the thing is like could it be that each could be that you have the same amount of time for 4 sequences

okay like what if you need to play a sequence right but um there aren't that much part of the sequences in here but there aren't other sequences in here but

so like let's say there's sequences right there and normally you'd have this neuron part after that one but it's inhibited because it fired after

because that neuron is part of a different sequence that comes in a different direction so it looks like the sequence over here and that's the second one so that's the third one like that

so you have like you have sequence A, B, C and sequence T, B, S and because they intersect with B right so A, B, C and T, B, S they cross over at B right they both have to be at T, B, S, A, B, C because there's a B

B is an intersection between both laser organizations right broadcast so A, B, C and T, B, S so they cross at the B that's where they intersect and that's the crossroad again so they um

so that's like imagine each one is a vector right our line in 3D space and so there's the line from A to B to C a straight line that's one vector and then you have another line

it's like T, B and S and the two lines are crossing each other like forming an X right so they're perpendicular but um but it looks like an X pattern I think it's like the two lines have so it was A, C and one is T, B, S

and a lot of them are stretched out and I stretched really far and the idea is that you have those are five points okay so the B is one point right and then um but let's say that you constantly hear the A, B, S pattern, A, B, S

and then you have T, B, S, A, B, S, A, B, C, A, C, D, B, S, A, C, D, B, S, A, C, D, B, S, A, B, C, D, B, S, A, C, D, B, S, A, C, D, B, S, A, C, D, B, S because that's where I said A, B, S

It's like a water focus inhibitor, so my brain switches to AVS or TBC, if you bring cross-circuits, TBC, TBC, TBS.

But the idea is that it's like, sometimes it's like the neuron is switching,

but it's kind of used to being switched onto, so T, so if B fires, then S fires, right?

So ABC is A fires and B fires and C fires. TBS is T fires and B fires and S fires.

And so if you go back to ABC, you were saying ABS, because Sega used to find one B fires, right?

So I was getting right into a B, I was right into an S and wasn't going to a C.

I was like, oh wait a second, so that to me indicates that, yeah, so what indicates one is

you can have multiple neurons that respond to the letter S, okay?

And that way the ones inhibited the neural sequence control did different.

Oh, I recognized S, right? So you can have a whole bunch of guys, I recognized S, I recognized S, I recognized S, I recognized S.

It's a huge rather representing an oscillation, I recognized S.

And so it says yeah, it's like they're all affirming the same thing, like they're all recognizing the same thing.

So a sequence isn't learned by one neuron, it's learned by a group.

So what happens is a neural fires and then its oscillation begins to match the group's oscillation.

But that's not entirely correct, entirely correct.

Because it looks like the first is merging into the second one perfectly, but actually there's a math equation happening.

Because the first one, they're both merging into each other, so like the overall mass is increasing, right?

Because one thing merged into something else, so overall mass is increasing.

Two, it's kind of like, it changes the pace of the overall oscillation just a tiny amount, right?

So if you have a lot of inhibition, the signal can get weaker, the collective signal, it's like slowing the signal down, right?

Or it could be changing the pace of what if I could be like, yeah, it could be slowing the signal down, it could be changing the pace.

Like, let's say that it's going to fire, so the idea is it fires every five milliseconds, wait, it fires?

It fires every five milliseconds, okay?

So it's going to fire anyways.

Because it's going to fire anyways, it has the ability to just throw out the pattern by not responding.

Firing at the regular time is the zero that's being transmitted.

But then, like, if it fires, and if it fires faster, say if it fires in one zero, if it fires faster, then...

So normally they just don't say zero, it's like, okay, it's in zero state, and it's going to go to a one state, or two state, or three state, right?

So what happens is if it fires out of sequence, I mean, this is making a difference in sequence.

I mean, if it fires out of sequence, right?

You get the same amount of overlap again, there's no information.

Because it's just like, yeah, it's the same pattern, so you don't write it, so it's transparent, okay?

It's transparent.

What happens is, so you have a transparent field.

Oh, shit.

And so those are, like, the pixels of the transparent display.

And what happens is, when you see something, a transparent field, you see, like, words of pride as...

You see, those are the numbers that I...

I feel like, okay, the whole people find the talk.

And if you see, like, where the screen is, like, super bright, okay?

But those are areas where there are 3D neurons that are firing, and they're firing on the previous numbers with lightest fires.

To create the brightness effect.

And then there's other shapes, right?

But it's like, you have this canvas, 3D canvas, and neurons are firing to represent all the patterns in the room.

Because the patterns are just sequences.

So the patterns that you see are of neurons that are firing.

And so there's two things.

One is, it's the path of the sequence where the neurons' sequence recognizes.

Any four-digit sequence.

It could also recognize a sequence of four-digit sequences.

Yeah, okay, recognize entire sequences.

Right, each sequence is four sequences.

So it can recognize an unlimited number of sequences.

But only, but only, like, what the four-digit sequence is.

It's the limit of how many different sequences it can...

Okay, so it's a four-bit sequence.

So each sequence in the sequence is four-bits.

So each plate is not in the stack of plates.

Each plate is four-bits.

But it can remember the whole stack of plates.

So we're going to remember a complex pattern.

Several patterns with the hairs in the drain.

But increasing those hairs, whether they're synapses or just hairs.

I mean, yeah, are the spikes the blue tones?

Or are they just hair, just spikes?

But anyway, like, they're going to increase or decrease constantly.

So they appear and disappear.

They're connected, disconnected constantly.

And that's short-term.

That's where the different patterns become encoded by what's that?

So it's the number it's looking for.

It's adjusting in real time to learn short-term patterns.

Learning short-term patterns.

So, like, it learns a pattern,

and then it gets reliable about repeating that pattern in the correct sequence.

But let's say you move.

Say you're looking west, and then now you're looking right.

So now, for the patterns at each of these fires,

these create a different sequence.

And so the idea is that, like, a pixel.

It's like a pixel.

A pixel is, like, representing an image, a color, an image.

So you have, like, this is four bits.

But it's a sequence of four bits.

So it's a sequence of four bits.

Which means that it's a sequence memory.

But the sequences are handled by neurons firing in succession.

With different amplifiers.

You can have one look for a sequence.

And then fire to be part of a sequence.

And then, you see that's changing the oscillation.

So it's like, you have all these, they give people neurons,

and they're all firing together in a pattern, like a whale.

All to understand the exact thing.

And they're firing in regular intervals.

So they're all representing the same exact thing.

But they could all be looking for different things.

So, like, detectors.

They're detecting specific patterns.

And they're each capable of changing what they're detecting.

So that means that they can, so that each one,

so it's like, each node is a neural network.

And it's doing, like, a detection of patterns, of sequences of it.

And then it's transmitting a part of a sequence.

A part of a sequence that represents a learned sequence.

Oh, damn.

So it has to compress a learned sequence into a symbol.

Or...

Wow, a neuron has to compress a whole sequence down into a smaller sequence.

So if it's like, yeah, it's like, if I can learn a four-dimensional sequence,

zero, one, two, or three.

And then I can learn to sequence the four-dimensional sequences.

So, zero, one, two, three.

Or three, two, one, zero.

Or two, three, two, three.

Zero, one, two, three, three, two, one, zero.

Or two, three, two, three.

Oh, one, two, two.

One, two, two.

All right.

So if you have all those sequences, zero, one, two, three, three, two, one.

Two, three, two, three.

Zero, one, two, two.

So if you have all those sequences, right?

And the idea is that...

you can have and detect any combination of any sequence for...

I represent it.

And with four bits.

And I'm going to fire zero, one, two, or three.

And then fire zero, one, two, three.

So the default is fire zero.

So in a second, in a way, it's kind of like three bits,

but it's like, okay, I'm not going to be invisible.

So like imagine that, like, if you have...

if you look, if you see a fan, okay, where the fan is,

where, like, the color in your eyes are different.

Where's the background?

The background is lighter, the fan area is darker.

I know that there's a fan there, because it's a darker area.

It's a darker area.

And you can see the shape of the fan and the sequence of darker areas.

The sequence is from the wall that it's contrast from.

Right?

And like imagine that darker area is a pixel

that's lighting up in a 3D volume, okay?

And imagine that's just a transparent area between here,

between where my nose is at, and the fan.

Okay, this is like a transparent area.

And imagine that space was not empty,

but in fact it was filled with stars.

Now, it was filled with neurons, right?

And they're all managing to be invisible,

because they're firing nothing.

And I think that's firing.

There are the neurons that represent that dark area that's the fan

and the wall behind it.

But everything in between, everything in between the wall,

all the empty space, those are where neurons are not firing.

But actually, they are firing.

So when they're not firing, they're firing at the regular tonic rate,

which makes them invisible.

If they're firing at the normal rate, they're invisible.

It's like, yeah, they're going to fire every 10 milliseconds.

Okay, let's say it's tonic fire.

I don't know how often.

It's just going to fire at a regular interval.

Because it's a regular interval, it's invisible.

Now, what happens is, if certain patterns,

if certain sequences are recognized,

a certain sequence of neurons are going to fire,

and they're going to fire 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, okay?

You're going to have neurons that recognize parts of that sequence.

So I don't know what the limit is,

but I guess it could be any, I guess each neuron could detect

any part of a sequence that's 4 bits per interval.

So, yeah, so a neuron could fire.

So if I'm an observer neuron, right,

I could fire if I see a 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I could fire if I see a 3, a 2, a 1, or a 0.

I know it's a possibility.

I feel like I'm saying it doesn't have to be specific.

Okay, the downstream neuron, like the downstream neuron,

is doing like a volumetric pixel, right?

How transparent is it transparent?

How do you use it?

Imagine all the noise in between.

Imagine they have a lot of noise.

So you just stare for a long time at the ceiling,

and now you eventually start to see noise everywhere,

where the fan becomes invisible,

and you just stare at the ceiling.

So imagine the noise, like you begin to see noise everywhere,

and the fan becomes invisible.

You start to see, like, you sort of trip out, like,

oh, and the fan's invisible, right?

It's because the reason the fan's becoming invisible

is because it's, um, the neurons are represented

are becoming inhibited, because they're firing,

they're becoming inhibited.

So it's like, it's like, the idea is that,

and then it starts, and nothing new is happening,

it's going to become invisible.

It's like, you forget about it.

Anything that is firing at a regular atomic rate,

if it's firing at a regular rate,

it's going to become invisible to you.

But because what happens is,

what you're seeing is the difference.

What you're seeing is, like,

what you're seeing is, like,

you're seeing, like, the, uh,

you're seeing a change in the firing rate,

and the change deviates from zero,

so it's, like, okay, you're seeing a change in the amount of,

of, uh, one, two, or three.

And I was like, yeah, let's see,

let's, oh, I registered a three.

So that's, like, a three.

Okay, so my three is, like, affects more neurons.

So more neurons, see a pattern,

see a part of a pattern.

See, like, they aren't detected part of a pattern.

Okay?

Oh, I detected something.

Right?

And, uh, see, yeah, so it's like,

whoa, detected something.

I got a three.

So, like, there's a lot of activity happening.

Right?

And let's see, where's this, okay,

imagine that.

Imagine each neuron is, like, an eye, okay?

What happens if you see a lot, if you see a lot?

It's like, what happens this?

Let's see, imagine every neuron is, like, an eye.

Every neuron network is, like, an eye, okay?

Okay, and then what that means is, like, imagine that,

uh, when everything lights up and everything lights up,

let's say that, like, you have a whole bunch of activations at the same time.

Okay?

You can fire at the regular rate,

and just ignore that pattern.

Okay?

Or, that pattern can cause you to fire a one,

a two, or a three magnitude response.

That's like, okay, it's like, what's the magnitude response?

Like, oh, or whoa, oh, whoa!

Like, yeah, it's the magnitude of response, right?

One, two, three, different levels, or nothing.

Okay?

And what happens is, so you have, like,

a whole bunch of downstream neurons, like a tree.

Downstream ranches, they're all connected to different things.

So, it's kind of like each one is, like, an eye.

It's only going to say, like, a different thing,

that sort of expression.

Like, whoa, like, whoa, like, whoa!

Okay, so, yeah, it's only going to say a different expression

based upon what it's seeing, played out, lined up.

Okay?

And, G, so it's only going to line up.

Yeah, or see it's like a certain, like, kind of pattern.

So how am I imagining? Like a movie screen, right?

It's like, there's four, it's either completely dark,

or it's like, yeah, it's like gradient of, you know, ones.

It's a little, it's dark, but a little lighter,

and two is much lighter,

and then three is like a much much lighter.

And it could be either, it could be either contrast,

or it could be either conflict,

it could be going from light to dark or dark to light.

It doesn't matter, so it's like it can represent

the shades of gray,

or different colors in the spectrum,

or different sound amplitudes.

It's a four dimensional pattern.

Okay, so it's like a line in there,

it's like a line detector, it's like an edge detector,

or a color detector,

and yeah, if you have, um,

but that's that lower, that's something okay.

But high levels,

those lower, those lower level edge detectors

become a picture at a high level,

that at a high level you have neurons representing features.

And what happens, what happens is that the complexity of the future

is represented by the lower level neurons,

and recognized, and reduced to a higher level.

Okay.

Oh, I got the ball.

This neuron is only going to fire

when certain high level features are detected.

High level sequence patterns are detected.

That's how like, okay,

the lower level is doing simple stuff.

It's like you have the hierarchy of detected patterns,

and the patterns can happen to any part of the image,

so you can have light and dark happen anywhere.

It's literally rendering what you're seeing.

So in terms of different neurons

by representing different parts of your life.

First move your head, you can see that

with fire, it's totally different.

It's totally like,

imagine if your whole brain is processing your whole scene.

Your whole visual cortex is processing everything you're seeing

at this moment, in a second.

And as this moment changes,

it's processing something else instead.

And all of the patterns are just predicted,

and they're not updated unless there's some sort of change.

A change happens only when you move your head.

A change only happens over time.

So that's how you can see this in another way,

see what's going to be like over time,

is that the internal patterns of the brain are changing over time.

As you move your head around.

So as you move your head around, you're moving more.

And the corresponding neurons are changing.

So as you move your head,

something that wasn't in your vision,

or not in your vision,

something to your left,

or something to your right.

Something to your left could be a box.

Let's say you see a box,

and the box is only in your vision if you're looking to the left.

You don't see the box on your left,

you don't see the box on your right.

So the box is on your left, right?

After you have the neurons in a 3D space

that are representing that box,

what it looks like.

All the properties of the box,

what it's made out of.

Is it plastic? Is it metal?

Is it paper?

What kind of box is it?

And so you have neurons representing those materials.

Those are individual cortex.

So then you've got the sensory neuron system,

and you've got the prefrontal cortex.

The primary sensory input cortices,

and then the prefrontal cortex.

So I think it's brain is just like four areas.

There's the audio cortex, the visual cortex,

the somatosensory cortex,

and then the prefrontal cortex.

So the three primary sensory areas,

and then the prefrontal cortex.

The prefrontal cortex is every area that is an interneuron area

is not directly connected to incoming senses.

And so it's all like interneuron.

It's all like a nebitorial area.

What's interesting is that there is

a similarity in all areas of cortices,

but information only travels to the bottom layers

of the primary sensory cortex.

The visual cortex, the audio cortex,

and the somatosensory cortex,

and the visual cortex, and the audio cortex,

visual cortex.

That's right.

So what is going to the bottom of the prefrontal cortex?

What's the primary thing that goes there?

Because if it's not going...

Is it still connected to the thalamus?

Because even if there's no...

Yeah, so that would be interesting.

So I need to know that.

Because the primary sensory cortices

are all connected to the thalamus.

The thalamus is where the information comes from.

So it goes from your incoming senses,

from your eyes to the thalamus,

before it goes to your visual cortex.

It travels a certain path from the eyes

along the optic nerve to the thalamus,

and then see the back of your head

to your occipal lobes,

and then up the parietal lobes.

That's how vision comes in

from your eyes, through the thalamus.

Now, supposedly nose comes in,

and the gussetori comes in through five parts,

and the fifth part goes to the thalamus.

So the eyes go to the thalamus,

and the fifth part of gussetori, or smell,

goes to the thalamus.

The other four go to different parts of your brain directly.

And then the audio cortex comes in

and hits your old brain first,

and then travels up.

It goes through the thalamus first,

before hitting the neocortex.

And I'm not sure where the lowest point of sound comes in at.

I'm pretty curious again.

So it comes into the old brain,

but it comes in through that thalamus specifically

before going to the cortex.

To the audio cortex.

It would sound as like registered layers,

but the strongest sounds at the neocortex

are like different frequencies.

And so, yeah, it's this idea of the brain is

like all these different frequencies,

detecting different frequencies,

and playing back different frequencies.

On a macroscale,

different summations of information

is different frequency patterns.

So I pass on different frequency patterns

to other people.

The fact of speaking,

different frequency patterns are being transmitted

in each stage of a word being spoken,

in each step of a word being spoken,

in each pronunciation of any word to be spoken.

Those are sequences that are represented

by different...

different neurons firing.

So one of the firing...

one of the neuron firing,

you could have any A,

like any neuron could represent A.

Part of A.

Any neuron could represent part of A.

Or part of A.

It's like pixels.

They're so small that any neuron could represent A.

Or B.

Or C.

Or B.

Or C.

It could be represented anywhere in the cortex.

It could be represented on your far left.

It could be in A.

It could be in B and far right.

It could have the pattern of A.

It could be anywhere in your mind.

So any part of your brain could recognize A.

All parts of your mind could recognize A.

You could imagine that all your whole reality

is just made out of A's.

You could imagine your whole reality

is just made out of B's.

You could imagine B's everywhere.

You could imagine C's everywhere.

A-B-C's.

You could imagine T's everywhere.

You could imagine B's everywhere.

You could imagine C's.

S is everywhere.

There was wor-

B is where to C for a second.

And then you could change um...

S is everywhere.

C's everywhere, S is everywhere.

You could have A-B-S.

You could have T-B-S.

A, B, C, C everywhere, T everywhere, B everywhere, S everywhere, A everywhere, B everywhere, C

everywhere.

So you can recognize like um wires everywhere, it's basically it's like it's like imagine

like every part of your visual cortex is imagining a letter A, every part of your cortex is imagining

a letter B, you're just imagining that letter B is everywhere, okay like little letter B's,

you get up large letter B's also, you have a mixture of little and big and you get up

with letter B's every size, so now you're filling up every your entire space with letter

B's of different sizes and then moving at different speeds, some are fast, some are

slow, so you have every speed everywhere, you have fast B's everywhere and you have

slow large B's everywhere and so the fast B's are whizzing by like wind and the slow

B's are like giant statues but they're moving and then when they're moving slowly but they're

giant and they're overlapping, see there's like the foot of a statue is in every in

every place where there's an A, so you have like a thousand overlapping statues and they're

all massive but there's just as many statues as there are microscopic A's because every

A is that's where the foot of a new statue is beginning, that's where the toe of a new

statue is beginning, wherever A is, you have overlapping images, so your entire space filled

up with giant statues, they're overlapping as to have like one each space has some toe

that represents an entire, private, entire statue that's overlapping with other statues.

So, that's where the foot of a new statue is going to be, that's where the foot of a new

statue is going to be.

So, it's kind of like, okay, so we've got a way to represent visual stuff but also audio

sequences, temple and spatial audio sequences and specifically it's going to be temple relative

to temple, like a place style, like a reference train that's like a temple place style representation,

it's also possible to have like abstract pattern representation, but the abstract pattern representation

would still have a four dimensional representation, it would still make use of the visual cortex

and that would be that there's the same tissue, like, yeah, because you could have any part

of your brain could represent what that pattern means, okay?

So it's like, so you could have like a one, two, three pattern here in the visual cortex

and that one, two, three pattern or it might be zero, one, two, three and it might be,

it's not just that, it's like, it might be like that one, two, three pattern could represent,

there could be 10, one, two, three patterns, it could be a million, one, two, three patterns

and they could, they could be like recognized, they could be recognized by enough upstream

neurons of those patterns that would like each, each upstream neuron would recognize

the same patterns as occurring in different places, right?

And so like those patterns could represent a texture, right, like a texture, it could

be like a consistent pattern over a, over a space and you'd have many different neurons

would be representing like the same image and so you'd have something at a higher level

that recognizes a pattern among patterns and then you have a higher level, you have a pattern

among patterns, among patterns, as you have patterns of patterns and patterns of patterns

and levels and levels of patterns, right, to infinity and so you could have higher level

patterns that are isomorphic in the visual cortex to a high level pattern in the audio

cortex and by isomorphic I mean that there's, there could be high level similarities that

are that don't exist at the low level and high level similarities are when you find

a concept, the concept isn't, is like the concept of a sequence, it's a high level

concept that doesn't exist at the lowest level because it's a sequence of concepts

and so you could have, you could have sequences detected at the lowest level and they are

but in the sense there are pieces of sequences that are detected and so the brain is putting

together pieces of sequences of content in order to make larger sequences of content.

You could have, you could have a sound of a horn and you could have the sound of a rhinoceros

and they could happen in a sequence, a horn and then an animal, a horn sound and then

an animal sound, like a rhinoceros, you could have a horn sound and an animal sound and

an animal sound and it's a sequence of sounds and they're represented, they're sequences

of content and they're represented by groups of neurons, groups of neurons that are all

detecting, they're all detecting the same pattern, they're all firing at the same pattern

because they're all firing the same pattern, there's a high level pattern detection that

happens and it's a, and so what happens is the recognition of a pattern is the rendering

of that pattern because that pattern exists to the mind, the second is recognized.

Because recognition involves a physical transformation, like recognition is like oh, I'm firing at

a different rate than a radar's firing, I was invisible before because I was firing at

a different rate, my radar firing changed and now I'm invisible and I'm just visible

at different rates, I'm visible a lot, I'm visible a little, I'm visible at the maximum.

So it could be like a grayscale I guess, but the reason it's like a color scale is because

a high level pattern detection is the association of lower level pattern detections.

So a high level pattern detection becomes, becomes defined as a factor, becomes encoded

in a factor of 0, 1, 2, or 3 and that could represent a high level pattern, that could

represent a sequence that's fired of other vectors, that could represent a learned sequence

of other vectors.

So those other vectors could represent a more complex image because the first, well the

first factor is one image, that one image represents all those images have been seen.

So it's like okay what has been seen is stored in images in the neurons I haven't seen, I've

seen it.

And the reduction of what that is, is a neuron that represents all those other neurons.

So it could be that one neuron is representing to every upstream neuron, I mean every downstream

neuron.

It could be that, okay so the incoming sensory neuron and there's the interneuron, the incoming

sensory neuron is the downstream neuron and the inter sensory neuron is the upstream neuron.

So it goes from outside the brain to the downstream neuron first, which is the sensory input neuron

and it goes to the internal neuron, which doesn't actually connect to the sensory input, okay.

And the sensory input is going to be inhibiting a lot, or it's going to be exciting.

So the internal neuron is going to be either inhibiting or exciting, but most of it is

inhibiting inhibition.

So we'll have all sending signals and it will fire to inhibit those oscillations.

So they're not going to be cascading around the whole brain with endless noise.

It's kind of like they'll be firing at a rate in which the brain is able to make sense of

space.

So the tonic firing rate will be invisible, but the rest of the firing will provide all

of the substance of space, all the colors, all the sounds, all the lights, all the positions,

all the properties that you can visualize.

But more to the point, because the cortex is acting today and we have all the parts

of information that you can hear will be rendered by the audio cortex, but they're correlated

with concepts, high level of patterns, high level concepts, so the concept is a high level

pattern, basically, the concept is a high level pattern, but it represents something

that was seen at lower levels.

So you could have lower levels, like the lowest levels, okay, they're recognizing just parts

of the pattern.

And it's only a high level and the cortex represents a much larger pattern, but patterns

could be really complex, and so with two layers you could have the most high level patterns

could be detected.

But not just patterns, but sequences, so movies of patterns could all be detected, so like

objects could be detected in the, actually, so they would be detected first in just the

first layer of neurons if I had a response to the light, that's the first detection.

And then if you go back, the connecting neurons would represent larger detectors, and the larger

you go back in layers, the visual one cortex, the visual two cortex, the visual six cortex,

in theory that's supposed to be, each layer is supposed to be representing much larger

detections, much larger image detections and sequences of image detections, sequences of

image detections.

Okay, so that's the idea, but maybe like once you get to about two layers, then, you know,

you pretty much want to get the layer too, so there's like, there's the, there's the

detection layers in the eye, and then there's the visual cortex, and then there's the thalamus,

and then there's the visual cortex, right, but it's like, okay, but it's like what if

the first two layers, the four images are like, you actually come through four layers,

you come through the ganglia, you come through the phobia, you come through the redness,

you come through different layers of the eye, you've gone along the optic areas, you've

gone through the thalamus, and you've gone along the, the connections from the thalamus

all the way to the opposite of the lobes, and then you're traveling to, the different

layer you're traveling to from Layer 1 to Layer 2 to Layer 3 to Layer 4 to Layer 5 or Layer 6, and in some cases those

patterns are traveling all over the brain just like electric, like EEG, electric, I

mean just like, EIG, EIT, EIT is electrical impedance tomography, so the thing is like,

when you fire electrode, you can't direct it, so it's just gonna go everywhere, for the

timing of when the rest of the neurons receive that signal, it is in, is an image, it's like

an image, right, so a neuron could fire, and the signal's gonna travel to all neurons

at different rates, it's being slowed down by the tissue, it travels through different

tissue at different rates, so you could have neurons that are just detecting internal patterns,

so you have, yeah, you have sequences of brain waves firing, and then, so internal, so internal

space could consist of like, there's regular brain waves, and because of firing regularly,

they become usable, but when a brain wave is disrupted, when it actually fires out a

sequence, that is going to be a signal to all of the neurons, wait a second, something

changed, so it becomes a pixel for the entire brain though, because it actually travels

everywhere, but it can help, it travels everywhere, but it gets inhibited, right, so it's like

neurons are gonna be tuning out stuff that they're not interested in, right, so we're

gonna do 5-0 a bunch of times, we're not gonna change the firing parameter, right, but if

they detect something that's unusual, that's not expected, so they're firing at a regular

one or a regular two, oops, let's say a neuron is firing at a two regularly, that two's gonna

be invisible, it's only if, only if it stops recognizing two, or, okay, let's say it's

invisible in the context of that, it's visible as soon as it fires something different, what

happens is this visibility changes because this oscillation is gonna match the neurons

that it's firing with, but it's going to subtly change those mass neurons, you won't really

see a change with the one neuron, because it's gonna be like, but if you have like 100

billion neurons, they're all triggered into firing in a way that causes the whole brain

to notice because they were all sort of, and that the whole brain doesn't recognize it,

so it's not conscious, it's like the pattern may happen and the brain doesn't recognize,

because the brain is choosing not to react, it might be recognized, so it's like, it's

only recognizing, it's only being set up to recognize certain patterns, and the way it

manages not recognizing is by firing in a talk, in a talk, in a talk way, but if it

changes its firing rate, then it has to recognize something, but as soon as it recognizes something,

it's gonna be drawn back into not recognizing things, so by its nature, it's gonna reach

back on oscillation by nature, it's like if it's an edge of sketch, it is being shaken,

so you can like draw a line on an edge of sketch, if you shake it, the sketch disappears,

and so it's like, it recognizes something, but what it recognizes begins to fade right

away, first of all, the sequence begins to fade right away, and so it begins to clear

out, and it's clearing up because it's making space for the next thing to be recognized,

so you can have a mind over time, where your mind is, it's recognizing sequences over time,

and each sequence is like a frame of time, and sequences like, there's like at least

1,000 frames per sequence of time, 1,000 frames per sequence of time, 1,000 frames per sequence

of time, 1,000 frames per second, 1,000 frames per second, so it's like at that each frame

was a millisecond, but that might just be represented by, so I guess it could compress

information by representing different information as being part of a different scale of information,

so it's like when the number 4 represents 4 million people, let's do 40 million people,

let's imagine 400 billion people, let's imagine 4 trillion people, let's imagine 4 desitalian

people, let's imagine 4 billion desitalian, 4 billion desitalian people, let's imagine

a trillion, trillion people, are they on the planet earth, let's imagine that there's

over a trillion, trillion people, and they're all in this space with you right now overlapping,

just separate the tiny and not by each of their toes, so they're not exactly the same

space, they're just slightly apart, and there's a trillion, trillion of them, and you're not

going to imagine the literal visualization of a trillion, you could, but the idea is

that any magnitude of information could be represented by having representations behind

other representations, so any representation could be represented by any part of the brain

anywhere, but what's going to happen is that if you get a high level representation that

could happen anywhere in the brain, that's maybe represented by interneurons, well the

high level representation, if you play it in the audio cortex, it's going to sound like

music, and if you play the high level representation in the visual cortex, it's going to be made

out of a pattern of light, if you play a high level presentation in the booster cortex.

If it's going to sound like music, if you play it at the high level of representation

in the visual cortex, it's going to feel like a pattern that you're feeling, or smell like

a pattern you're smelling, so it could be even like a visual representation of emotion,

but the idea is that the lower parts of your brain are also representing, so imagine that

the whole neocortex was like a screen for the thalamus, just like a whole bunch of downstream

neurons are the screen for upstream neurons, but they're each the screen for a different

upstream neuron, so it looks like there's many upstream neurons, but each one is its

own pyramid, that's summing up its own information, detecting its own information from all the

downstream neurons that it's connected to, so each one is a pyramid.

So that means each one is connected to each one as far as it can reach, they're all connected

to each other, as many as they can reach, so there's physical connections, I'm going

to try to reach as many as I can, and it's like yeah, let me send all my senses out,

so the idea is that it's just going to sense pattern from everything that it's connected

to, just trying to connect as much as possible, and then it's going to transmit stuff sometimes,

and transmit stuff, so that means neurotransmitters, neurotransmitters, neurotransmitters sometimes.

But the the key idea is that it's not just going to transmit, it doesn't transmit a

in terms of like, it doesn't have a symbol to transmit, what it has is how much, how

many upstream neurons is going to affect, is it going to affect one downstream neuron,

two downstream neurons, three downstream neurons, or four?

Or it's more like maybe it's going to affect 30, or 60, or 90, or 120 neurons, maybe it's

like a huge multiple, okay, but it doesn't have, okay, but it's going to be transmitting

that that signal, which is going to become part of a sequence, it's changed a sequence,

and a sequence of symbols, so it's like if you're playing a piano song, and one note

is off, do do do do do, because that one sequence changed, and changed the piano sequence, and

normally do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, it's like that one note

is messed up, and so that represents that one note that's changed, so you have the notes

and then it's like if it's do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, like I imagine like

maybe if you heard the same beat over and over again, it would become kind of like transparent

or less noticeable, or you just sort of tune it out, you tune it out, you stop hearing

after a while, and just fade to the background depending on how disruptive it was, your

mind would focus on some, on other stuff, and maybe you'd remember it, but the more consistent

is in your environment, right, like what we're seeing is there's a whole bunch of blood vessels

in front of eyes, and the idea is because they're so, they're there consistently, they're

always there, then they're rendered as transparent, because they're such a consistent pattern,

the only patterns that are rendered that are not transparent are the ones that are firing

at unexpected rates, because it's unexpected, it becomes a, it becomes detected by a network,

it's an unexpected coincidence, an unexpected, it's not a coincidence, it's an incidence,

it's an unexpected incidence, it's an incidence detector, incidence, incidence detector,

instance, coincidence, coincidence, this is interesting because coincidence is when you

have a lot of things firing at the same time, a coincidence begets an instance, so a coincidence

is represented by an instance, okay, and then the new instance becomes part of another coincidence,

so you have sequences of incidences that are coincidences, sequences of instances are coincidences,

sequences of instances are sequences of incidences are songs, but the songs are, the songs are

at the root coincidences, but they're also patterns in the coincidences, so coincidences

of patterns become sequences, coincidences of patterns become sequences, and sequences

become coincidences patterns become sequences. Yeah coincidences of patterns. So the pattern

is the coincidence. Patterns meet up of coincidences. Detected coincidences. Detected coincidences.

Patterns meet up of detected coincidences. So all types of patterns are made up of detected

coincidences. But those coincidences can be simultaneous or they can be sequential.

Right? Simultaneous or sequential patterns. And so you can have a pattern that's recognized

that's that is temple and spatial. So that means you could have a different temporal pattern

like a texture. Also come with a spatial pattern. So temple and spatial patterns. So it's like

a four dimensional movie. It's like where you see a character and you can tell it's the same

character even though it's a different temporal pattern in each frame. It's a different character.

But it's a different character. It's a different shape in each frame. But you connect all the

shapes together and you know like all these all these pixels belong together. They're all part

of the same character that's changing over time. So you're tracking the body and all the

neurons. They all have there's all similarities and there's all like they're all part of the

same sequence. Right. They're being recognized as part of the same sequence. Because there's a

high level neuron that's recognizing that all these lower neural neurons are actually

representing the same object. Right. So where is the self representation. Well the self

representation is like is in two places. In essence. It's it's actually in two places but

it's like when when all it's like when both places fire at the same time. It's like when

the the neuron that represents the pattern that was detected is firing at the same time that

the neurons that detect the pattern are firing. Well in a sense it should be slightly right after.

But it's like yeah this was a cat. So this is something that so this is the cat was represented

by the low level neurons and a higher upstream higher upstream neurons also recognize the cat.

Several of them recognize the cat. Right. And maybe they recognized the cat from slightly

different perspectives. Right. Each one of them represented a different perspective on that cat.

Sort of like the perspective that you see is the perspective that has the most votes. So it's

like your perspective is made of individual perspectives and they're voting on which ones are

right. So yeah so it's like every it's like we added to practice so it's like saying the whole

factor room is also made of like factor rooms. It's like saying the whole holographic room is made

of holographic rooms. Okay so let's say that we have a holodeck. Every point in a holodeck is a pixel.

A volumetric pixel. So every point in the holodeck is capable of representing a 3D space.

A volumetric pixel. Every point in the holodeck is capable of representing a 3D space.

So every point in the brain is capable of representing a 3D space. And all the parts of

the brain are capable of representing 3D space. Every neuron is capable of representing a 3D space.

That represents other neurons. So every neuron is capable of representing other neurons. The

word of thing is like a neural network. Like a neuron can represent the main neurons of fired,

a specific pattern of neurons of fired, or can represent nothing. No, nothing fired. So either

a neuron can represent a specific pattern or not represent a specific pattern. And many,

because a neuron, because a neuron's specific pattern could be very complex.

We're still talking like lines and edges. There's a definite, there's a definition,

right, lines and edges. It's just getting represented, you know, something at a high

level can be reduced to a 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each neuron. We have many neurons

measuring the 0, 1, 2, or 3s.

And they all get, like they all, like the lower level representation was the detection

and the rendering. Because they all want to know if they're going to fire again, right?

And so maybe if several of them fire, and you have a whole bunch of neurons that fired when

they all fired, that start to get, they start to get received energy. So they start to get turned on.

And they're predicting, all areas predicting that the whole thing is going to fire. Like you

know a whole bunch of neurons that fire when the whole thing fires, and they're predicting that

they're about to fire. Say everything else is predicting that it's about to fire. Say those

things on every neuron. So every neuron is predicting it's about to fire. Like oh all these

fires, oh we've got the sequence that goes through here, where we're going to have like

at every stage, where we have like oh we're all going to predict that firing is going to happen soon.

And then at some level that like sequence is reduced, a sequence of you know 0, 1, 2, 3 is

reduced to a 0, 1, 2, or 3 in terms of like something else interpreting it. So maybe if we have like

something fires, but then nothing fires, right? Well what happens? Maybe it continues to pass down.

This fire continues to pass down and travels through the entire, through the whole brain.

Right? And it will fire, it will pass through transparently.

Well in this case of, the case of neurons that it's also anyway,

they actually re-entrain it. So maybe they're all receiving the signal that it's receiving,

and it's causing them to respond.

So they're sending some, maybe they're sending something back,

and they say that it's an electrical response, and it's causing it, that one neuron that's not

oscillating at the same rate, too oscillated at the same rate, and eventually becoming visible.
