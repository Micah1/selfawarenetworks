Eyeballs brains tempo-spatial-phasic Nerves

Talk about how eyeballs are part of the brain and that researchers were surprised that eyeballs grew out of the brain. The thing is, they wouldn't be surprised if they realized in the first place. That eyeball is part of the brain. Like, you have going from going between the thalamus and the eyes, there's an optic nerve, right?

00:26

That optic nerve ends at the eyeballs. And and and and it connects to the thousands. You see them saying like if you have any model of the brain, a picture of the brain. That doesn't include the eyeballs. You are. You are like, you're sending the optic nerve often to nothing.

00:49

So what? So if you don't have eyeballs, what do you, what is your optic nerve? Connect to in the brain, okay? How many pictures of brains have you seen with no eyeballs? Okay. But these researchers are surprised that eyeballs appeared because there has been a sort of like, it's like, it's like the map as left something off and left that off and left office.

01:21

Okay. This is human brain. Here's the thalamus. Here's primary sensor recorded sees, here's the typical logs prior to lobes the frontal. Loads the prefrontal cortex and the the

01:41

The different parts of the brain. The brain can't, the brain cannot be fully formed without the eyeballs. I have also not in accessory. It's part of the brain. If you don't have eyeballs, then you have an optic nerve. That's connecting to nothing. That's like a freight. It's like, it's like, I don't know.

02:08

That's like drawing. It's like drawing a person without hands. You just you need to have you just like you know what happens if a person doesn't have hands they're blood falls out of them, their blood fall falls out. It's just gonna spill out if they don't have hands. Where's the blood gonna stop?

02:30

You can't have a brain without eyeballs and this has been overlooked. Something else is in, in books, like computational neuroscience books, you know, you can talk about on intelligence, it's a great book. It's wonderful book. Okay. And they talk about how the brain has temples patient patterns but specifically specifically it's temple.

02:58

Spatial and basic patterns. It's not temple. It's not only temple and spatial. It's it's not spatial temporal, it's temporal space. It's spatial temporal and pays it. It's all three. If you leave out basic, it's like, leaving out eyeballs temple. Spatial what? Basic patterns, temple, spatial and phasing patterns. The physic patterns are frequencies hurts to hurts.

03:36

600 hertz temple. Spatial phase brains with eyeballs. Because it's part of the brain. You cannot have a brain. It doesn't have. But and in fact, you can you can have you could have a mouth formed brain that has no eyeball, okay. If you have a person born without hands too, you know, but you're not considering the whole system and understanding the whole system.

04:14

If you're not including eyeballs, because eyeballs have nerve cells in have brain cells in they, have ganglia neurons. And and other kinds of other types of neurons and glial cells. It is a serious part of the brain. It should not be a surprise to any neuroscientist at all That.

04:40

And that with that, when you grow a brain in a laboratory eyeballs are gonna appear on
