(field, cortex)
When I am around many other people I often feel tall, when I'm alone I sometimes feel short. All this contrasting of forms is a generalizing delusion, sparse distributed representations formed from the brainwave output of hundreds of thousands of pyramidal cells fired in a highly complex hierarchical sequence, minus the inhibition generated by basket cell activity. This is applish (from the pyramid cells) it's not apple sauce (from the basket cells) it's slices of apples (activity resulting from a unity of higher sector activity in cortex turning inhibitions and excitations on and off until the causal of most interest is clearly in focus as a sentitional object in the loop field of awareness.)
