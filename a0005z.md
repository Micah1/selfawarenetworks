Start the book with electricity, gravity, quantum physics
Then the debate about the granularity of pattern recognition ie the resolution of consciousness (Phi)

rethinking electricity & gravity, Bose-Einstein Condensates & Fermionic Condensates

Create a picture of the cortical columns as like the Hal's cartridges in 2001 A space Odyssey

And west world maze as the mind's recognition of its own self model as the self

The large scale dipole reflects the horizontal activity of whole cortical column oscillations in partial whole brain oscillations that have 3 phases inhibition, excitation, and tonic.

Sections of the brains cortical activity are at a global level repeating the same pattern to
Resulting in whole brain awareness

Sleep is my inhibitory phase, then I have a listening phase, then a speaking phase

I skimmed the article a little bit. Confidentially what I am writing about in my book is how the brains molecular structure creates conscious maps of reality with frequencies, the frequencies interact with each other, but the same molecular structure that produced these frequencies is required to experience these frequencies. I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence

SYNC
Sync happens because stronger signals are disbursed more widely, pushing more components to react simultaneously

The brightest flash of the firefly, or the strongest pulse of the action potential going to cause the most number of fireflies or upstream cells to react at the same time. Sync is a coincident oscillator reaction to broadly distributed high amp low freq signals of any modality type

To have the global sync oscillation altered by the collective action of a neural circuit with different size oscillators might result in a global pattern generation like turning small signals into a flashing image on a screen that down stream neurons receive as an image or a sound or tactile sensation or a feeling which is then observed by another layer

As if the brain is replicating the images it sees outside and the sounds of what it hears outside in the collective signal generated by the oscillator reacting to 

Registering an observation to other layers of the network and an observation to the thalamus, the neocortex can function as a tv for the thalamus, like a 32k or human retina display for a virtual reality experience. With the thalamic bridges running its signals to the neocortex and receiving the output of the neocortex on the other side of the cortical columns allowing it to observe, learn from, and coordinate activity pattern learning on each column of neocortex, allowing the whole brain to be in spacetime holistically aware of every part of itself. As frequency patterns in the brain play out across time, space, at at multiple scales. 

The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above 

The pyramidal cells are the retina of the thalamus

Columns are reading columns like a mind cycle
