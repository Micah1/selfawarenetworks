Does Neo Mind Cycle Measure Oscillating Brain Waves?

about an hour agoMicah Blumberg
yes
that's not the purpose of my system, so what I mean is that it can

I Like To Know The Quantitative Part Of A Process Even If That Part Is Not Predominant In The Goal Of Your System. I Felt It Was.

I'm not in the practice of making and storing records of brainwave activity, unless someone asks for that

I Would Ask Just For My Personal Knowledge.

if someone wants a chart of their brainwaves "for any reason" after a session its okay, its no problem

I Guess It Is The SciencE Behind The Process. Thanks

I prefer to think that its merely a small part of the process. 1. measuring the brainwaves 2. converting them into sounds 3. using them to drive isochronic beats 4. a mind machine turning the isochronic beats into light and sound pulses. 5. Your ears and eyes recieve the light and sound pulses generating a new wave of brainwaves. 6 the new wave of brainwaves is collected by the machine that measures brainwaves. 7. this results in a new light and sound pattern. 8. you begin to recognize how your thoughts feelings, emotions, big picture predictions or visions are effecting the light and sound 9. you begin to control the light and sound consciously, and through doing that you begin to create a map of associations, neurons firing together wiring together regions of your mind involved in choosing your innerstate, your feelings, your emotions, what you focus on, your big picture predictions, you are realizing how everything you feel and think about is connected to your neurophysiology, you are becoming conscious of your brainwaves, brain self-awareness is increasing, and all the new connections mean more self coordination, improved neuroplasticity, which is your ability to flexibly react to whatever happens in life, more creativity, more great ideas, more great success's, more long term happiness increases! 10. So measuring your brainwaves is a small but important part of the process, its a key part of what makes this a "mind cycle" or "mind loop"

its different from other forms of neurofeedback and other forms of brainwave entrainment like equisync, because of the inclusion of EEG driven isochronic beats, the beats are stimulating your neurons to fire, releasing healthy brain chemicals, but unlike equisync which is a one way conversation, these bits are actually informed by your brainwaves, so its like a two way conversation. regular brainwave entrainment is like television, its one way, the tv screen actually broadcasts alpha waves, so does the monitor you use to connect to the internet, but the internet is two way back and forth dynamic conversation, thats what neo mind cycle gives, a more interesting and thus more effective brainwave entrainment. Because in the science of brain plasticity, it is mission critical that your exercise or treatment is interesting, engaging, novel, and fun, otherwise your brain activity is not being engaged, and it won't be as fun.
