Self-Aware Networks use Neural Array-Projection Tomography:

Multi-layer phase field pattern representation (in brain wave oscillations), tomography with synapses & dendrites that detect coincident patterns of learned criteria (criterial causation Peter Tse), and phase changes transmitted out to the network via the exit terminal branches.

Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and our actions, and ourselves to help us navigate life, and respond to novel incidences. Humans are response able system, and in a sense the liability of a human being is similar to the liability that a self-driving vehicle with a self-aware network will be required to have
