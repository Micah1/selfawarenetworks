a0308z Consciousness Not Explained: Thoughts on Daniel Dennet's Illusion, and the Hard Problem.

My criticism of Daniel Dennet's Consciousness Explained, other topics include emotion, emotion, internal representations, and synaptic rendering, 

In chapter 8 of consciousness explained Daniel Dennet mentions the concept "rendering in the brain" but he doesn't take it in the direction that I took it. I argue that the brain is literally doing computational rendering, oscillating the signals projected to the inceptive fields of the exit terminals of neural arrays.

Imagine that a neuron, in a very abstract way, was making a drawing, like the controller on an etch in sketch, and its inceptive field, that defines its synaptic connections to downstream neurons, is its display. Then imagine that the brain is like many frames, or many displays, of many etch & sketches (synaptic configurations) with many trillions of controllers (neurons).

Dennet seems to use color for all of his examples of qualia being something that seems to be vs something that substantially is, a distinction he never makes clear, evoking in my mind the phrase "sweeping it under the rug" he cites a philosopher who treats color as something different from shapes, and in the early part of the book. Tragically all of his descriptions of Qualia are dismissed as illusions of color, but at the same time he treats color as something different from geometry, and avoids making an argument that dismisses the Qualia of geometry, leaning instead on the crutch of color as an illusion.

Dennet seems to argue that there is no color that can be found in the brain, and when we are asked to imagine two different types of color patterns our brain is not recalling color, recalling a stored memory of color, it is just seeming to recall color again he makes distinctions that are not really distinct except for the concept of "seem." His argument seems to be that because a surgeon cutting into the brain doesn't see any colors representing qualia in the brain tissue that color is not literally rendered on a literal screen of the mind. I argue that color is a phase wave differential in space, and it's a phase wave differential in the brain, but that what we have in the brain is a coarse grained or high level rendering of color that exists as a phase wave differential that is different from the tonic oscillation pattern, and is different or distinct from other phase wave differentials representing other colors and it is different from phase wave differentials that represent geometries, people, objects, places, concepts, feelings, tastes, smells, anything and everything.

Daniel Dennet's consciousness explained is a book that seems to have meaning, but in totality his argument is ironically also an illusion, because as far as I can tell he does not offer a real distinction, in terms of neural correlates, between substance and illusion. He does not bother to describe the difference between the neural correlates of substantially seeing & known and the neural correlates of seeming or thinking we see & know something. Without a clear difference between real qualia and seeming qualia Dennet is not really saying anything, but his work is still worth thinking about, in the sense that the contemplation of the abstraction of imaginary numbers provides a useful contrast for thinking about numbers, and it has a mathematical value in calculating certain equations.

Dennet's distinction without a real distinction is as useful as imaginary numbers are to math, which is to say that it's useful for wrapping your mind around what the mind is, even if in the end you have to back away from his descriptions, because if there is no real, then how is illusion any different from real knowing? If illusion has no real difference from real knowing, in terms of neural correlates, then whatever neural correlates apply to Dennet's illusion actually also simply apply to what real knowing is.

The Self Aware Networks theory is different however because I am arguing that while the visual rendering of reality is a coarse grained computationally generated graphical representation of reality, not an exact representation of reality, it does exist, at least at some time step, as some sequences of brain states looping inside active memory for some duration, as a rendered representation from the brain unto the brain. 

I argue that redness is a phase wave differential, uncoupled from the frequencies of the light spectrum only to the degree that perception is a calculated rendering. The phase wave differentials that define red are many, but they are distinct from phase wave differentials that define other patterns, and they are different from the baseline tonic oscillation of brainwave activity.

I argue that the perception of color has no special slipperiness that makes it more of an illusion compared to the perception of shapes & the geometry of the world. both the shapes of the world and the color of the world must share the same status of representation in the brain both are phase wave differentials, and what applies to the illusions of color in human perception must also apply to shapes and to every other perception

What applies to the rendering of reality as qualia also applies to the seeming of the rendering of qualia

Dennet argues that we are not perceiving the qualia of redness but instead it just seems like we are, and yet he provides no neural correlate of distinction between an actual experience and the seemingly subjective illusion of experience, instead he makes distinctions with words that are groundless, insubstantive, hollow, meta, like putting an asterisk around an internal representation to mean 'it seems to be' rather or instead of saying that 'it simply is', but there is no reason for it that I can see, it's a distinction without purpose, no purpose except to try to tease apart what phenomenological consciousness is from what it isn't.

I argue that color & shapes as organisms perceive them are distinct differences defined by the phase wave differentials from the tonic oscillations and also from other phase wave differentials, and in the way I describe the brain there is no difference between recalling a memory of yellow and seeming to recall a memory of yellow, no meaningful difference anyways, just an asterisk, a note that has no meaning except to say this rendering is just seeming to be a memory.

Dennet's core argument paraphrase: Either this memory is a just memory, or this memory is just seeming to be a memory. If the first conjecture is false, and second is true we need to write a book about this.

I am arguing that the distinction between 1 & 2 is irrelevant as 2 is just 1 with different words.

That Dennet seems to have no consciousness of this is puzzling to me. Dennet argues that for instance the brain is not storing a picture but instead a partial similar difference, but he does not consider that a picture is a partial similar difference. What is a picture if not a series of partial similar differences?

Dennet says that his work takes after Wittgenstein. "Wittgenstein doesn't regard consciousness to be the essence of mind or mental phenomena. He criticizes the Cartesian theory of consciousness, which regards consciousness to be a private inner essence."

It's sort of like how Daniel Dennet argues that consciousness is an illusion or something that just seems to be, as in you can report that you think you know something or that you think you experienced something but the facts of your situation might be very different from the reality of your situation. In the case of Dennet I argue that there is no real distinction between experiencing reality, and seeming to have an experience, because both are flawed computational renderings rendered by tissue experienced by brain tissue. Experience is a cascading loop of detected renderings. Existing in space & time over such a duration that your mind can report on its own experiences to others, to itself, and it can act on or change its actions in response to conclusions.

On Emotion
Imagine the hypothalamus as an input controller (for emotion) to the brain similar to how the visual cortex might be considered an input controller (for visual information) to the brain. This means that changes to, including destruction of areas in the hypothalami can trigger dramatic emotional experiences, while changes to including destruction of areas in the visual cortex can trigger dramatic visual changes. 

This doesn't mean that all visual information is calculated in the Visual Cortex, and it doesn't mean that all emotional information is calculated in the Hypothalamus, but because the information related to visual experiences move through the visual cortex at some point your vision is affected by changes to that area, and because emotional signals move through the Hypothalamus at some point your emotional experience is affected by changes to the Hypothalamus.

Emotional processing & Visual Processing, I argue, are both processed by the whole brain, but not processed in equal amounts in every location. Every oscillating group of cells is going to react differently to emotional signals and to visual signals relative to every other group of cells. Some groups of cells will barely register responses to certain types of signals, and some groups of cells will be hyper responsive to certain types of signals, and this is because the dendritic & synaptic morphologies inside every oscillating group of cells, grow & decay to customize their own responsiveness to very specific types of signals.

It is as if the brain areas were each akin to stained glass windows. I pick stain glass windows as an analogy for synaptic frequencies, dendritic, and somatic frequencies states, because they sit there and wait for incoming signals to change their frequency patterns, and like color stained glass, when signals arrive their configuration response uniquely in terms of what it passes onward to the room.

The stained glass analogy breaks down of course because stain glass doesn't update. In that case we could consider a different analogy for the synaptic configuration filtering incoming signals as more similar to Quantum Dot LCD Liquid Crystal Displays, where the synaptic frequency represents a color filter that modulates the information from the sensory input signal for the next neural array.

The synapses, dendrites, and soma's are filtering the incoming sensory signals, to the subsequent array,  represented by light in this analogy to the whole brain

This is a great analogy because then we can discuss how damage to Wernicke's or Broca's areas which are far from sensory input areas but received signals from many areas can result in specific issues with regard to speech, or understanding words, a stained glass window is a window that has many different pieces of colored glass that when combined produce a pattern.

What I am imagining is closer to a virtual stained glass window (or Quantum Dot LCD panels), one that is defined by synaptic frequency states which are like stained glass reporting the change or modulation of a signal to the next synaptic frequency state.

The Hard Problem:
"David Chalmers 1995: The easy problem of consciousness is concerned with mechanistic analysis of neural processes: EG Visual information is sent to the primary visual cortex, how does it happen mechanistically?
Solving the easy problem results in identifying the Neural Correlates of Consciousness
The Hard Problem: Why do things feel the way they do? Is what one person feels the same as another? If the mechanisms are the same, why can things feel different to different people?
The Hard problem is the experiential dimension of consciousness (phenomenological, subjective)." Quoting or paraphrasing a slide from this presentation titled "Paper presentation on "Theories of consciousness" by Anil Seth & Tim Bayne 2022 Nat Rev Neuroscience" https://youtu.be/AQHm1AtaMBU?t=156 

Self Aware Networks address the Hard Problem directly and fill in the explanatory gap between the easy problem & hard problem.

Is consciousness a hard problem or is it a meta problem? I think if one thinks of illusion as a persistent pattern in spacetime that renders the felt description of being someone, then Dennet's illusionist theory is close to Self Aware Networks: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) Theory. I say the solution to the Hard Problem is that it feels like being someone because that feeling is computationally generated as something that is distinct from everything else. Computers do not process feelings, and they don't do non-linear calculations, to build sensory representations of reality, but they could.

Feelings are a non-linear volumetric calculation, that a four dimensional system with biological neurons, or simulated biological neurons could compute, and feel, because the structure enables this kind of calculation to exist, what is require is either physics, or a simulation of physics for this kind of calculation that allows the rendering & the detection of feelings in a feedback loop, and then a robot is someone. What observes the feelings generated by this machine? The very same machine, but could a machine feel simulated feelings? Of course. The point is that if the simulated structure is able to react the exact same way as a real structure, then the frequencies of rendered information will become distinct in all the abstract ways that make rendering information inside human phenomenologically conscious experience distinct. Artificial computers will compute the abstractions of qualia, following an understanding of how human brains compute the abstractions of qualia. What does it mean to feel like someone? However you describe, that feeling of being someone is a calculated abstraction that is different from some other state, and it has all the properties that you can identify, with all of them being, in the sense that Daniel Dennet means it, an illusion, or as I would like to say a temporary and distributed rendering from phase wave differentials between cells bound by oscillations.
