I imagine that the tensegrity of molecules, cells, and organisms allow for mechanical vibrational acoustic wave interactions, chemical wave interactions, and rippling wave reverbations on a larger scale

the macroscopic chemical tensegrity network structure can encode memory predictions that become the ink of higher scale patterns in the brain that can reverberate across the tensegrity chemical/vibrational brain

oscillations, in space like atoms or stars their structure, spin, charge, etc can encode information in a sense, as they react to changes in the oscillating emfield and their reaction ripples through the same field

that is like memory storage and playback in a sense but its not long term memory, its not a long sequence of complex patterns remembered for a long time,

its not organized sensation & playback

that would be like the wind carrying a thought with no one to to hear it, decode it, receive, or translate it into meaning

its like simpe data patterns without a complex decoder to observe those patterns with any complex frame of reference

if the oscillations in a body that is a rock can sense the world and record memories as changes to the rocks structure there is no network constructing complex information patterns in the rock that affect its function

its like saying the observer is just a sensor, encoder, and transmitter without the receiver, decoder, and the reorganization of mental information patterns. There is no mechanism to consider complex information criteria in a rock. So panpsychism is reducing consciousness to a sensor/pattern encoder/transmitter, I think every oscillation is at least a sensor/pattern encoder/transmitter,

but the consciousness is more like an oscillation of contexts and the contexts are information configurations, the information configurations are learned patterns stored in synaptic coupling, and decoupling, its an expert data structure, a network

so the pace and complexity of the communication of signals in brain network altering its network structure over time is what produces the complex information encoded.

in other words a rock is like a body of randomly fused together sensors, that store mechanical changes, and transmit new properties when interacted with but, but compared to a brain a rock is missing pattern collecting sensor arrays that pass information patterns virtually along specific paths in a conscious entity

in other words consciousness is not from bundles of sensors, memory storing data, and transmitters, but instead its a high level configuration of phase space that reacts to and drives brain activity like a new sequence of strange attractors giving us information patterns that model reality and react to it.

a rock doesn't have any amount consciousness just like a sensor transmitter doesn't have any amount of perception, consciousness, self-awareness, or beingness

it does not collect or contain or replay meaningful information patterns like a brain

it does not learn to coordinate its movement
it does not learn from its own movement

a rock has no method to notice an association between two or more movements

no memory that can persist in time

a change in its structure can refract signals of light for example but not specific information patterns

the signals that a rock might sense, remember, and transmit are chaotic, without order, random configuration not information configuration

oscillating bodies such as rocks can mechanically sense, store physical transformation, and refract signals in new ways after but a rock in nature collects random signals, its changes are not from a conscious mind playing back novel new complex information patterns but from unconscious particle collisions

its not the complexity of the physical configuration that is at issue for consciousness its the representation of information in phase space that a brain reads and writes.

The brain reads and writes information patterns that accelerate the extropy or the development of ideas.

Whereas a rock does not read or write to phase space, it does not take notes on its own movements, and its own interactions. Any data that a rock collects is not by its own intention, it doesn't have the ability to replay learned knowledge even if it could learn the link between two events the rock is only in a sense sensing and storing chaotic signals that are not information patterns, chaotic signals that have no real meaning to anyone or anything.

So consciousness is the internal play back, reading , writing and develop of information patterns that are useful to the organism, substrate invariant or virtual or non-physical information patterns react to reality.

The information patterns of consciousness need to be close enough together in space time or phase i  order to be coherent to consciousness, which is a sequence of oscillating arrays representing, modifying, cycling & dissipating information patterns.

So consciousness as a non-physical configuration of the receptive & inceptive fields of networked oscillators is the result complex reactive patterns moving through sequences of sensory transmitter arrays

Cosciousness is emerging not because of the complexity of information, networks, or integration

but because of the evolution of natural computation in a strange feedback loop

in other words it processes reality, models reality, predicts reality, and reviews its own predictions in a cyclic way

to summarize so don't argue that rocks are conscious, because its like arguing that sensors are conscious, or that changes to a rocks structure constute memories that have meaning vs changes that have no meaning and are just the result of chaotic collisons

consciousness separates information from noise, or it identifies salient, relevant, pertinant, and meaningful information from nonsense and noise

a rock does not notice anything interesting
consciousness notices novelties because its chemical structure is geared to react to certain patterns and to discriminate against other patterns

the oscillating configuration of atoms in a rock might allow them to act as a sensory array of sorts for molecular transformations but consciousness is different because as an object a brain does discriminately react with coordinated movement to information configurations

but basically a human is like a rock monster on some level, with our neurotransmitters being analogous to rocks, or molecules with properties like force, momentum, frequence, magnitude, velocity and other physics properties that rocks or molecules in space might have

the fabric of consciousness is not oscillation, not memory, not sensors, not transmitters, but an internal representation made up of sequences of patterns that learn and materially cause reacts that lead to movements that lead to consequences, consequences themselves that are strange attractors for dissipative systems like people

but consciousness might be, in the most simple way, two (or more) oscillations detecting, modulating, or diffusing a new information pattern, so that there is a pattern for another part of the brain to watch and develop

also information patterns are on some level coincidence detections

so a rock or a molecule is not conscious and it is not at least able to detect information as coincident signals, and these not learned signal paths can't be played back in a strange learning feedback loop.

a rock doesn't have an information learning feedback loop, or a strange loop as Douglas Hofstadter describes with some frequency.

It doesn't have the network configuration pattern to model and playpack its learned models to associate them with new sensory or muscle data and to react

even if a rock had the same internal representations as a human being somehow, there is no feedback loop that is updating these internal patterns and no way for the rock to detect and then internally react to its own encoded information patterns 

Consciousness is a system of patterns that represent learned consequences (predictions of movements or paths) cycling through sequences of arrays, reproducing and evolving its oscillatory configurations with natural selection

It emergences because its a special spacetime configuration, just like how water is a special spacetime configuration, but ocean water behaves differently from land, which is different from cats, dogs, cars which are each molecular configurations in a sense.

The pansychist integrated information theories would have to argue why the sophisticated complexity of a car does not result in at least bug level intelligence or cat level common sense in a self driving car for navigation.

Because our brains are special consciousness machines, and space is not conscious because its information configuration is doing something else.

Space & Rocks are not thinking sequences of thoughts (patterns), discriminating against incoming signals, separating meaning from noise, or making decisions

Space, Rocks, and Water can all detect, react to, become changed by, and transmit wave patterns, but not in a harmonic tonic feedback loop

I mean I guess rock, water, and all of space is technically a harmonic feedback loop but 

but these each transmit patterns without modulating, observation modulates and changes patterns and the harmonic oscillation field of spacetime

but in ways that also inhibit incorrect pattern development, with selective attention to patterns, the ability to ignore, 

so consciousness is not just a resonating multiscale learned pattern sequence in a harmonic oscillation field, in a feedback loop

but its also a causal body that selects, inhibits, predicts, and moves

so consciousness itself is a specific information configuration pattern, for processing information within certain bounds, just like how the gravitational energy effect of earth is reduced with the amount of distance from the center of earths mass.

There is a certain area of spacetime that becomes configured by natural selection to consciousness configuration or rendering internal reality inside an organisms head

so the limited gravitational area effect of planets is an example 

and example that the properties of objects have upper and lower bounds on their environmental behaviors,

they can only conduct such consciousness creating behavior when certain molecular configurations exist

because the behaviors of molecules in the cosmos depends on their molecular configuration which is also an information configuration or the pattern of orbiting phase differentials

In other worlds the conscious brain is the result of special configurations of molecules in a sense

but consciousness is an information configuration pattern in each time interval that exists at certain scales with certain ranges for receptive fields, patterns for inceptive fields, and changes to the physical receptive/inceptive fields between neurons to encode and transmit whole array patterns to other arrays

patterns to be represented from multiple viewponts, scales, modalities, in multiple areas many times, so that pattern learning in the brain is virtual, the whole brain learns all the patterns at their own scale/freq/&amp

memories become attractors to join with new patterns

the patterns in the brain represent changes to the receptive and inceptive fields of each array and also each arrays activation pattern at each time interval.

consciousness is the learning playback loop of signal activity plus its a strange feedback loop of information pattern development, or modeling of self and environment, being played back continously which defines a path for actions, or navigation decisions

spacetime in general, including rocks & water, does not have a resonating chaotic decaying neural path forming apparatus

the specific signalling patterns in a brains behavior have the specific properties of consciousness, that are specific to that object, 

which circles back to consciousness being an emergent property of inside some objects that have certain mechanical/molecular configurations

its not about integrated information or complexity 
its about the configuration of the brains computational process (reactionary oscillating energy dissipative process) 

integrated information theory has attempted to measure the delta or quantity of total consciousness in a brain as a number, called Phi, that is supposedly about the sum of total brain activity and the complexity of the inhibitory interneuron network to learn and represent more patterns

I think that Phi measurements with present and future brain computer interfaces could tell us something about the resolution of conscious patterns in the brain and perhaps provide hints as to the scale of what is being focused on and possibly its location and orientation

insect or rat mouse cat dog pig or cow brains they might have lower resolution consciousness with simpler models of the world, of interactions, of themselves and of language. I like the idea that Phi might help us analyze the resolution of patterns in their consciousness, and the resolution of their model of reality

but because their brains are strange learning loops like humans they have self aware embodied consciousness with simplified models of reality compared to humans

but when you understand that consciousness is an array of information signals shaping a network structure, and is shaped by that structure, or that structure is also shaping itself via a specific frequency range of phase coincidence and inhibitory coincidences and alternating decoherences.

Its clear that not everything in the cosmos is conscious and that human consciousness is not just different from a rock because of the complexity and volume of activity

but because its learning configuration inside its feedback loop is a long signal transmission pipeline, neural paths, neural paths that define the configuration of space for signals to travel

like the path integral formation but now the paths available in spacetime are defined at greater scales such as the molecular properties scale

consciousness is a path creating and path determining configuration of spacetime to examine the quantum field only at astronomical scales

its a type of vortex pattern, just as how a hurrican and a rock are types of vortex patterns

consciousness is like a virtual phase field network  pattern defined by the shapes of receptive fields which represent sparse representations of spatial pattern transformations over time 

consciousness is a phase pattern that is detecting (also modifying, also transmitting modified coincidences) which cause memory cohesion (LTP), and difference patterns which cause memory decoherence (LTD) 

The sculpting of reality in our minds is accomplished with streams of coherence (memories) and decoherence (forgetting), and as multiple variations of the patterns are rendered. the internal memory of the particulars of a model grow more accurate, coincidences between renderings by different arrays construct a natural back propogation system or modelling error correction that is accomplished by decoherence or alternating oscillators in a splay state or something close to it.

The vertical & horizontal coincidences detections between 3d neural network layer arrays, cortical columns and across the whole brain provide connectivity between features that results in models and between model transformations that result in the connection of model properties to objects. Or the associations between a person and a car. These learned memories are coherence patterns that are refined by new data and by decoherence patterns.

Playback of memories is associative
memories are attractors, but focusing on what you want is a critical lesson, for impacting the future redevelopment of your memories which will impact your future choices

coincidence coherence patterns unit low level feature detections into object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation, and learning the multi-modal properties of objects with 3D semantic segmentation and then connecting the properties of objects to objects with more coincidence detections

This is also a new explanation for how deep neural networks work, with layers as pattern enlargement for multi scale coincident detection, and back prop as a sort of incident cleanup or a decoherence detector that readjusts all notes so that the final product matches the first product and then its clear that the network has learned the best representation it can

you can argue that a deep learning neural network is like a feed forward network with an artificial decoherence pattern

I think Jeff Hawkins might describe this process as voting in neural network, where multiple instances of patterns across the network can vote on the features, properities, scale, position, and orientation of all objects.

One paper described creating an imaginary variation of the pattern and then comparing the two

simply put, the comparison of two or more patterns to improve learned models and fix modelling errors is 

a kind of tomography, because the coincidences between two variations are more likely, and the decoherence between two similar models are less likely

and so the correct learned properties are connected to the correct learned objects and the incorrect learned properties are disconnected from objects with decoherence

all of spacetime basically learns and communicates, but slowly on a vast temporal scale

and the natural selection of spacetime is also about coherence and decoherence patterns emerging and dissipating in harmonic oscillator

and so spacetime oscillatory tomography is why we have planets with people orbiting stars, and not a perfectly even distribution of positive and negative particles

disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy

but in my calculations, in part because of energy conservation, to have space seemingly increasing or decreasing in energy is a relative experience

spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.

This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators

so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

In neuroscience the freq amp relation is called the 1/f frequency.

but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets

provided they have enough contact with others before they die (decoherence)

so life is a coherence state, atoms are a coherence state,

the decoherence of atoms or people or galaxies or hurricane or animals or LTD is like a decay

This is leading to longevity as being about renewing, protecting, and preserving the coherence mechanisms perpetuating the bodies oscillatory continuation.

It also means that resurrections, astonishing feats of healing, walking on water, and defying gravity are each slightly more plausible.

its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 

floating on an airplane is about pushing horizontal lines beneath you with force

but if the electromagnetic field lanes could be disrupted or shaped there would be no gravitational effect

The Pyramid of Giza probably is a gravity defying warp capable spaceship that can cross between galaxies and between solar systems by manipulating spacetime around it.

It's Noah's Ark

which explains the connections between ancient eqypt and christianity

its interesting to think that humans and animals came from another planet to earth via the Pyramid of Giza.

but then the religion of Eqypt separated and splintered over time into Christianity and many other religions.

The idea is that, oh shit, the pyramid focuses electromagnetic energy in a way that is perpendicular to earths gravity, its reflection of electromagnetism with its tetrahedronsurface sends a fermion condensate beam through its center down into the earth

earths gravity is not just sending out lanes from fermion condensates, its sending them out radially

but the limestone tetrahedron is perhaps also reflecting em waves in a radial inverse pattern

walking on water would be about disrupting earths magnetic field reversing the radial lanes of particle emissions for a minute

a repelling oscillation
two positive charges repelling

earths field is positive/emitting relative to humans and molecules

but if I could change my electromangetic dipole displacement to one that matches earth I would float

the expansion of space time is like amplification of space through the slowing frequency of time

the density of mass is like the contraction of space through the increase in time frequency

earths gravitational effect on space is like dense space exciting slow space to expand, attracting other nearby dense objects (by increasing time in a certain direction that points toward the center of the earth)

and decreasing time in the opposite direction

in essence the radial dispursion of increasing or decreasing emissions on earth

is heating up which means more interactions per interval relative to slower space so its hot space

but that heat is relative to the expansion of time and the expansion of space

so the dolomite em reflective pyramid, plus electricity, and the inverse radial projection, lets say it warps space like a battery

with a north pole and a south pole, except the pyramid has multiple dipoles

so a surfaces of the pyramid reflecting electricity are going to create a dipole through the center creating fermionic condensate

the concentration of em energy creates, the fermionic condensate, it causes dipoles to burst out of every surface of the pyramid, all 5 sides

the idea that I have about floating is that if the particle field is rotated faster with artificial dipoles we float because it is just like vertical thrust condensed into a rotation

but the direction of the thrust is weird

the bottom and the sides are the directions of thrust from the dipoles, or electromagnets

the radioactive dust

oscillators that are dipoles that are driven by electricity and focused into fermionic condensates are going to increase temporal oscillation in their center like a planet,

hmm

so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?

so its interesting that the moon may have collided into earth and separated again or that galaxies can collide and separate

in one sense earth and the moon pushed each other apart but in another sense their attraction phase was decoupled

the space between two oscillators was mutually repulsive, as long as both were positive or both were negative

but instead of pushing on space they are changing the direction of the flow of space to either go around them in a way that expands or heats space between them

or the direction of the flow is contracting space between them.

So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth

or falling at escape velocity

except that it does not need horizontal thrust because its redirecting the curvature of space with 

two particles cannot converge into the same space when their phases are different

because their phase is in a sense the direction of their relative velocity

the frequency of time is the inversion of the frequency of space

so an elevator flying straight up causes gravity in that elevator, but a rotating planet has the same effect without directional thrust because it is shaping or curving space to mimic directional thrust

so earths rotating dipole or quadrupoles are more accurately the emission lines and lanes of quantum gravity and earths electromagnetic field

the center of the dipoles could be where the collision of electrons is greatest and the main points of fermioc condensation being projected into space causing the chaotic dispursion of  gravitational lanes that can pull objects toward earth or direct them away like the moon falling toward earth but in orbit so its also always falling slightly away

its like earth and the moon are two dots in the double slit experiment

but instead of escape velocity from directional thrust its possible to warp space instead
so that the spaceship is out of phase with the gravity of earth, and that is like its orbiting earth inside of falling to earth, its fall is in a different direction so long as it has positive energy to sustain the direction of its flight

oscillators attract particles that are in a complementary phase and they reject particles in a different phase

because a different phase means that general relatively speaking a particle is moving in a different direction, event if it does not appear to be moving relative to other objects that are nearby

this means that changing the phase pattern by changing the electromagnetic field by creating artificial dipoles will change the relative direction something is falling in space.

the pyramid is small at the top and broad at the bottom

the major dipole activity is created like a laser and emitted into the base,

this potentially reverses or interferes with the local em field of the earth creating anti gravity

now instead of the pyramid moving down it moves side ways or up depending on how much positive charge exists and how much its counteracting the magnetic dipole of earth. more energy would mean more lift off

but I imagine that to power it we would need a fusion reactor which is why its interesting to hear that the pyramid has slightly radioactive material as well, and that scientists are experimenting with lasers to create nuclear fusion

and fermionic condensates are like lasers
