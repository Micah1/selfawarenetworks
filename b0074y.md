Web Browser Meetups Patterns

00:00
So what I would wanted to sort of bring up before was that 

(some tech corporation)

should look at my my idea for for how the manifests could be accomplished or basically my my my pet in my plan's were to basically use Exo kit, good community in there. So that and we could create a situation where the my idea was we could use actual kit and we could we could browse inside the browser, the execute is like 3d frames three browser frames and that means that you can basically visit the website that has all your stuff like your your shirt, your avatar, your your watch.

00:58
You're all your digital items that you wear and when you're VRA are the other people can see that you can pick up and use on your virtual body. It's like if you're playing the game with the zombies you can have a backpack. You can have an act attached to your backpack.

01:15
You can have a shotgun attached to it backpack and you can stick things in your backpack like medicine and different different things that you can add to your backpack. And so when you're so if with execute web, what I was planning to build was basically like a menu system that you could that you could travel with like it'd be on your watch and you just click your watching you put a menu and any kind of function could be that menu but that website.

01:44
That is your own personal, like sort of like web browser. And then you use that web browser to browse other web XR websites. And so, it is like having a web browser inside a web browser or this could be actually a browser plugin or a browser standard where future web browsers basically have the layer that is connected to it's basically going to carry your personal items with you so you can bring your items into any web VR web or web AR space that you enter.

02:28
It's like you can you can visit a brand new person webisode experience and but you can bring in the the items that you use purchased from another game for example, because they're your personal items, you can bring your personal stuff with you anywhere you want. It's like walking into Disneyland and bringing your backpack with your own personal items, right?

02:53
It's like having a phone on your pocket as you is you walk through the world and you're bringing your personal data with you on your phone that you can act as and communicate with other people using your personal data to also write down notes and stuff. Take photos. It's your personal data and store your mp3 music.

03:12
And and this is like, yeah, it's like having. So when you have webics are it's like to use this, you're in a completely different. When you're the website, you're gonna completely different website. But all your stuff is still with you because you're actually always in your initial either, there's two layers, there's the layer, very layer one, which is about your stuff and you all your programs, just like your personal computer and you're bringing your personal computer with you.

03:43
When you visit other websites, experiences created by other people. It's like being able to visit the zoo that's made by someone else, but bringing your camera near me. So there's you Roblox right? Trying to take into? That's the kind, that's the concept here. And so, that's my proposal for a web XR based member.

04:02
And we basically initially use executive web, and that, that will create like a space for that's just represents the user's home. Yeah. So like you know and then they use that and it will space to load the canvases of other spaces so they can begin to move through other web browsing space meetings with their stuff and in principle there is there's no there's nothing hanging out that there's no there's nothing they can't be done with web star, there's nothing that can be done by any other any other to hitting platform that can't also be done with weather.

04:47
Like right virtual room, you can do anything any kind of graphics that you are seeing and any game engine in any game that theoretically can also happen in websites there? There might be something that are. He's like, where is he? Is basically the future of the Metiverse as I see it, right?

05:22
And, you know, they created web XR, they were. So you could do VRFs.

05:34
So,

05:39
Right now. So you can see if you're trying to like necessary, you could, you could have times basically like sort of like sort of like the way neurons communicate is. You could just have like each like each person outputs would be processed by an array by a neural network and and a reduced representation of their of their actions would be created for like an like a level of detail type of way.

06:24
Like a not like when you do basically, you do some people close up and they have a high level detail. But people who are far away, they need to lower level of detail. And so you just send a reduced representation that is basically, you just, you just render a lower resolution version of someone who's farther away.

06:46
This is not as much data, there's not as much need to to have like a higher resolution render. So that's going to take up less compute space than the rendering that you're that's being devoted to someone who's close up to you and taking up a larger amount of your perceptive field or the or the area your field of view, right?

07:08
So someone is like dominating your field of view. Like they're gonna be dominating your mental processing power. In terms of what you're bringing is focused on or rendering at that moment, especially if you can smell that okay, use every time about right now to actually. And so that's how to think of like, how your spatial map works is that everything you're focused on is taking up some percentage of your, of your brains and brains computations.

07:38
And so, if you were to expand your brand's computations, if you're to double them somehow with an external brain, then it'd be like being able to pay attention to twice as much stuff at the same time. So like imagine in if you're like if so if you're just outside like looking around the processing twice as much stuff means that your resolution of reality is a lot sharper at that moment.

08:06
So basically I'm proposing that we're putting our own neck networks between people to do neural rendering and so the the neural rendering will be many layers of it'll be doing many layers of basically reducing that person's details to the sparse as possible pattern the most complication efficient pattern. And it will do that by like creating a canvas that's this, essentially shaped with inhibitions and excitations teachers or for different arrays to see.

08:50
And then read in render the patterns in there from there interpretation their modulating the pattern to match. Their interpretation based on the memories of that, part of the brain has specialized in. And so I really based on my experiences and then it passes, a whole, a collectively passes a pattern to another right access, which has the same thing on.

09:16
And so I realized that weeks ah, that part of that, I realized that I want to talk about all of my work in the book, all of all of my great experiences, you know. And let's talk about like every week, what it was like to share some detail of what it was like.

09:39
So I'll just say like, you know, hey I I would host this meetup every Friday and it was, it was, I was two meetups but they're on two different media pages. One was San Francisco virtual reality and the other one was on narrow attack Naruto SF which was part of Naruto acts which is like this global meetup group but we I was just doing the San Francisco ones.

10:03
And so I would host these every Friday at noisebridge and almost most of the weeks in 2018 and every week I would I would share it be almost a completely new group of people every single week. And I would share the idea that I had that this project that I started where the goal was to bring to bring EEG into VR.

10:27
And we talked about a lot of things, we talked about combining an HC vibe with a, with the needs, with the open BCI kit, with 3D printed parts. So that we could do something like like what had, but we couldn't buy a normal and we couldn't get them to send us one for free.

10:53
So we're like okay. Let's was adapt. The open BCI and to the HTC by with three different parts and then like we couldn't get the three printer to to print the open BCI net and the print, I think it the printer, could only print a part of it at one time, and in each time, we, we tried to print a piece of it.

11:23
It it fails and we didn't really have any experts that were there on staff. Because, you know, it's it's like every single week. It was different people. I mean, I was there but for the most part, it was different people. So sometimes people came back but but the majority folks were new each time, and they came one time.

11:44
And I was about it mostly. And, but week after week, the, the we'd work, you know, for a couple hours on Friday sometimes, sometimes into the night sometimes five or six hours and, and then I'd have something to share with with the group to following week, which is what everything we did the previous week with a different group.

12:06
Everything I did with a different group of able to share with the new group and the new group helped do some work on on that project. And then I took and brought the work that the group did that Friday to the next Friday and met new people. And with the new people we worked on developing the project even more.

12:24
So this was like this huge thing that was developed by a ton of people who like came and they they tip turns sort of contributing little pieces to to the project. And it was through the help of all these volunteers that we we, we collectively managed to have a working program, that emerged a.

12:59
And so, you know, my my experience because I got to be there and be part of every single step was I learned how to program, I learned how to do cool stuff and that was through like a ton of people to just helping me on, you know, through it a couple hours on Friday and a couple hours on there was newers another.

13:26
There's another group of folks who primarily met up on Wednesday and we I started working with them about halfway through the year and I would sure I was show up. It was because they purchased a, I go to the meetups but they would they purchased a a brand, we know EEG device in like jeera.

13:47
I think it was in June or July. And when I saw it as to, hey, can can we, can we also use this on our Friday? Meetups and can we like build stuff for EG? Because I'm gonna bring easy into VR. And this is like this really cool. The new EG device that you have and they said, yes, which was wonderful of them to say.

14:06
Yes. And so I so on I at around the middle of the year I was able to bring Friday's projects to the group on Wednesday because now we had this this plan to collaborate together and so they did the most magical work in constructing a server. And, and they did a tremendous amount of help of helping me to, to understand what it means to to create a server.

14:38
And to pull fold it to pull data from the EV device into into our computer, and then create a local host to or a web host, so that we could send out it basically, we could broadcast a web page. And so the you could go in the Oculus go and you could go to the web page and you could basically so if we put a neural network between everyone, then they're on network can and it functions the way, the human brain functions, then, what would happen is that every part of the neural network would be able to be aware of everything else because basically every part of the neural network would be creating its own version of patterns that are that are represented elsewhere.

15:31
So patterns are flow across the brain. Physic firing patterns travel, through different reasons of the brain, like large scale macroscopics are mesoscopic and like, patterns move through the brain. I mean, it's, I don't, I don't know what to tell you about. Like, you know, microscopic patterns? That's just neurons firing, right?

15:55
That's just synapses changing synaptic connections changing. But but those are those, this is the micro patterns. But there's there's magic scale patterns and macroscale patterns and so all every level, every scale of pattern from small scale to large scale is, is in locks. They're in lockstep in some sense, like, even the chaotic oscillators are in our court.

16:32
They're in a coordinated pattern that, you know, while being at a sync there, you know? Like there is some sort of yeah, thanks for that. I mean, I like to think of I like to think of the brain as having, you know, It, I guess it resembles a strange.

16:54
Attractor on the whole is a difference in Brazil's resonates, something that like it's it's definitely like a like a it's a chaotic pattern by even, you know. Like, but it but it contains ordered patterns. So, let's say that overall there's a chaotic pattern but it contains organized patterns. And so there is there's like a mathematical structure to the whole process and even chaos has embedded within it.

17:44
Some sort of pattern that is basically it's chaos within a certain boundary but there is there's a pattern outside that got rained just like how you know you there's and a local short time scale, we have random sort of decade, decay rates and radioactive materials but then on the longer time scale, the half life can and can be predicted a pretty reliably, the basic half life of radio.

18:25
Every radioactive decay over a long-term and we can't is predictable, even though on the short term, it's, it's like random chaotic. So, with my solution that I'm proposing is like, basically, we're putting a neural network, where with everybody and everybody would be able to be aware of everything else inside this room network, but also this would function like a mind like like human mind.

18:47
And so we're basically creating an interface to bring all of humanity inside a single artificial intelligence mind like almost like them almost, like if the matrix was the conscious mind, that's it. Just imagine that I've been so enthusiastic about
