Clustering Intuition Action Perception

00:00

Okay, we have the action in perception cycle. This and we have the concept of grit, the concept of persistence. We have Steven Strogatz, he talked about the think there is a topic in EDIT

00:40

It's like okay so it's like there's Isaac Newton and

00:50

Yeah, that's positive. Leaving its with the idea here that I want to revisit is that there's a connect, there's a connection between

01:10

Apps.

01:16

The intuition, what Steven Strogatz calls intuition and really needing to have time to think about math on your own, 

teachers are teachers are great. School is great, we're learning new things

but the great intuition that's Steven Strogatz had with math was something that

01:56

It, how do I say this? It's, it's rooted in neuroscience.

It's rooted in the action in perception cycle.

Like, he literally, like sits with math problems, and you could see that when he was talking to the guy who does the YouTube channel, three blue one brown that, you know, there was a resonance, I think in that, in order to understand math you sort of have to play with it mentally

02:31

you have to sort of play mentally.

What that means is it's not really play. It is play, but it's not child's place. It's this is like it's adult play. It's, it's, you really want to think about the granularity of the numbers.

02:56

It's I that's I'm talking about creating a representation of numbers and in different modalities and different sort of like and different experiential modalities. So that because you have because I think that there is some conceptual intuition that is multimodal and that you the action to perception cycle. It's kind of like, I think the call to, to be to gain math.

03:41

Intuition is is almost like it's it. Maybe it's what, maybe it's a little bit like the the call to meditate like a Buddhist and that is someone's not. If someone is doesn't have time now, they're not gonna from meditation or for math that they're they may not take that time, okay?

04:00

But the people who are succeeding and in matter like Stephen Strogan and succeeding in his way of of doing that he is you know, he's he's having success as a teacher in a bookseller but he written he really like even I feel like my mind has been expanded after after the book sink.

04:34

And but what is yeah, what's interesting here is the action perception. Cycle is relevant for turning concepts into.

04:59

And to something usable. And so I kind of think that, you know, one of the reasons this, my book hasn't been published already by someone else has, you know, in part to do with the fact that our are collective, think on a whole range of subjects, sort of like directed at a high level and, and in some chat, in some senses misdirected at a high level.

05:27

Not by not by intention, I think, but by oh, by our own in attention to, to the details it's almost like this is a topic that is expanding in terms of like, people paying attention to it. I think so, we had this, I would say the, the internet has been this like, explosion of all this stuff and

06:09

So that would be interesting if we could if if if there was a sort of like clustering that happened to all the information on the internet, right?

06:28

And so, all that information could be like because right now it's it's yeah. It's like every individual person is creating their own sort of like cluster of the internet.

07:03

That's possible. But yeah but but you're you're the cluster of your mind is highly variable. It's about what you focus on and how much time you spend focusing on it and how many different ways you think about it? And how many? Like and how many different ways you try to transform that information?

07:25

Like okay, so if you could quantify the information somehow say, well, it's a thought that I had for a minute and then right down the key points of that thought and then, you know, maybe we have a list of list of those points and then go through them one at a time and say, okay, trying to transform this point.

07:51

What would happen and when you sort of play with like every single point like it's a, you know, like it's a 3D object and with the property and unity, but we're talking about concept, then your action potential cycle is going to sort of like build on that and I just now I'm thinking about my match.

08:19

Now again, in a new way. So what I'm about to do is I'm doing, like, sort of like drawing clustering. I'm gonna be like trying words and and I'm gonna be like, all of these are all the titles of the proposed. Chapter outlines the book outlines and write down all the words from from that.

08:43
And then I'm going to, I'm going to do clustering in ordering, I thinking about the high level and the low level of the book. And that that's the sort of like objective for the next stage of the book is just sort of like, clustering and organizing.
