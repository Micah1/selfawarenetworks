Rephrased with my points by ChatGPT o1:

I've been contemplating the action-perception cycle and its connection to grit and persistence in learning, especially in mathematics. Stephen Strogatz, a renowned mathematician, emphasizes the importance of intuition in math and the necessity of spending personal time pondering mathematical problems beyond formal education.

While teachers and schools are excellent for acquiring new knowledge, developing deep intuition requires individual engagement with the material. Strogatz's approach is rooted in neuroscience and the action-perception cycle; he immerses himself in mathematical problems. This dedication is evident in his conversations with Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown, where their resonance highlights the value of mentally "playing" with math—not as child's play, but as a profound, exploratory practice.

Understanding math at this level involves thinking about the granularity of numbers and creating representations in different modalities and experiences. There's a conceptual intuition that's multimodal, requiring us to engage with concepts in various ways. The action-perception cycle here is akin to the practice of meditation in Buddhism: if someone doesn't allocate time for meditation or math, they may not develop this deep intuition.

Those who succeed in math, like Stephen Strogatz, dedicate time to delve deeply into concepts. The action-perception cycle is crucial for transforming ideas into something useful. I believe one reason my book hasn't been published yet is due to a collective misdirection in our thinking at high levels, caused by inattention to details. However, this topic is gaining traction as more people begin to pay attention to it.

The internet has unleashed an explosion of information. It would be fascinating if we could cluster all this information effectively. Currently, each individual creates their own "cluster" based on focus, time spent, and the ways they process and transform information. If we could quantify this information—writing down key points, examining them one by one, and transforming them—we could enhance our understanding. This process is like playing with each concept as if it were a 3D object, allowing the action-perception cycle to build upon itself.

I'm now rethinking my book with this perspective. My plan is to engage in drawing and clustering: listing all the words, titles, and chapter outlines, then organizing them. By considering both the high-level and low-level aspects, my objective for the next stage is to focus on effectively clustering and organizing the content.

Original Whisper Transcription:

okay we have the action to perception cycle this and we have the concept of
grit the concept of persistence we have Stephen Strogatz, he he talked about
the I think there is a topic in talking about like this sort of like elitist
sort of like white European idea that you know you're better you're better it's

like okay so this like there's Isaac Newton and leave in its but the idea
here that I want to revisit is that there's a connect there's a connection
between the intuition what Stephen Strogass calls intuition and really
needing to like have time to think about math on your own out like beyond like
so yeah so teachers are teachers are great school is great for learning new
things but the great intuition that Stephen Strogass had with math was
something that it it's how do I say this it's it's rooted in neuroscience it's
rooted in the action to perception cycle like he literally like sits with math
problems and you could see that when you was talking to the guy who does the
YouTube channel three three blue one brown that you know there was a resonance
I think and that you just really like in order to understand math you sort of
have to play with it mentally you have to sort of play play mentally and what
that means is is you is it's not really play it is kind of it is playing but it's not child's play this is like it's adult play it's it's you really want to think about the granularity of numbers it's I that's I'm talking about creating a representation of numbers and different modalities and different sort of like different experiential modalities so that because you have because I think that there is some conceptual intuition that is multimodal and that you the action to perception cycle it's kind of like I think the call to to be to gain math intuition is it's almost like it maybe it's maybe it's a little bit like the the call to meditate like a Buddhist and that if someone's not if someone
doesn't have time now they're not gonna for meditation or for math that they're
they may not take that time okay but the people who are succeeding in in math
like Stephen Storgas and see succeeding in his way of doing math that he is you
know he's having success as a teacher in a bookseller
but he really like even I feel like my mind has been expanded after after the
book sink and but what is yeah what's interesting here is the action perception
cycle is relevant for turning concepts into
into something useful and so I kind of think that you know one of the reasons
this my book hasn't been published already by someone else has in part to
do with the fact that our our collective think on a whole range of subjects
sort of like directed at a high level and in some cases misdirected at a high
level not by make practice not by an intention I think but by by our own
inattention to to the details it's almost like this is a topic that is
expanding in terms of like people paying attention to it I think so we had this
I was at the the internet has been this like explosion of all this stuff and so
that would be interesting if we could if if there was a sort of like clustering
that happened to all the information on the internet right
and so all that information could be like
because right now it's it's it's yeah it's like every individual person is
creating their own sort of like cluster of the internet but yeah but but you're
you're the cluster of your mind is highly variable it's about what you focus
on how much time he's been focusing on it how many different ways you think
about it and how many like and how many different ways you try to transform that
information like okay so if you could quantify the information somehow say
well it's a thought that I had for a minute and then write down the key
points of that thought and then you know maybe maybe have a list list of those
points and then go through them one at a time and say okay can I transform this
point what would happen and when you sort of play with like every single point
like it's it you know like it's a 3d object and with the property and duty but
we're talking about a concept then your action pretension cycle is going to sort
of like build on that and I know I'm thinking about my match now again in a
new way so what I'm about to do is I'm doing like sort of like drawing clustering
I'm gonna be like drawing words and I'm gonna be like all these are all the
titles all the post chapter outlines book outline and write down all the words
from that and then I'm gonna do I'm gonna do clustering and ordering and
thinking about the high level and the low level of the book and that that's the
sort of like objective for the next stage of the book as it's just sort of
like clustering and organizing
