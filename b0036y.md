the quick: This note is about the importance of thought experiments, clustering ideas, and I propose that sentient neural networks can help cluster information on the internet to advance science. Beyond that you can skip this note really.

(audio not shared because of because of an odd direction I took the audio at the beginning that I would rather not amplify, here are some notes extracted from it.)

Clustering Intuition Action Perception

00:00

Okay, we have the action in perception cycle. This and we have the concept of grit, the concept of persistence. We have Steven Strogatz, he talked about the think there is a topic in EDIT

00:40

It's like okay so it's like there's Isaac Newton and

00:50

Yeah, that's positive. Leaving its with the idea here that I want to revisit is that there's a connect, there's a connection between

01:10

Apps.

01:16

The intuition, what Steven Strogatz calls intuition and really needing to have time to think about math on your own, 

teachers are teachers are great. School is great, we're learning new things

but the great intuition that's Steven Strogatz had with math was something that

01:56

It, how do I say this? It's, it's rooted in neuroscience.

It's rooted in the action in perception cycle.

He literally like sits with math problems, and you could see that when he was talking to the guy who does the YouTube channel, three blue one brown that, you know, there was a resonance, I think in that, in order to understand math you sort of have to play with it mentally

(I'm not sure what this reference to three blue one brown is about in hindsight, I must have seen one of his videos before I made the note, I have forgotten which video it was)

02:31

# you have to sort of play with ideas, math, neuroscience, AI concepts mentally to advance.


you really want to think about the granularity of numbers.

02:56

I'm talking about creating a representation of numbers, and in different experiential modalities.

I think that there is some conceptual intuition that is multimodal and the action to perception cycle. I think the call to gain math intuition

03:41

maybe it's a little bit like the the call to meditate like a Buddhist

and that is someone's not.

If someone is doesn't have time now, for meditation or for math,

then they may not ever take that time, okay?

# (I think this note is about the importance of thought experiments,
such as Einstein did, to play with ideas, math, in your mind, so that you can reach new conclusions through deliberation, consideration, and mental play)

04:00

But the people who are succeeding and in math like Stephen Strogatz and succeeding in his way of doing math, 

he's having success as a teacher and as a bookseller

I feel like my mind has been expanded after after the book Sync.

What's interesting here is the action perception cycle is relevant for turning concepts into

04:59

something usable. so I kind of think that one of the reasons my book hasn't been published already by someone else has,

has in part to do with the fact that 'our collective think on a whole range of subjects' is sort of like directed at a high level in some sense is misdirected at a high level.

05:27

Not by not by intention, I think, but by oh, by our own in-attention to the details

it's almost like this is a topic that is expanding in terms of like, people paying attention to it. I think so, we had this, I would say the internet has been this like, explosion of all this stuff and

06:09

So that would be interesting if there was a sort of like clustering that happened to all the information on the internet, right?

06:28

# And so, all that information could be (auto clustered by sentient AI, in otherwords all the information on the internet could be reorganized & integrated to advanced collective knowledge faster)

like because right now it's it's yeah. It's like

every individual person is creating their own sort of like cluster of the internet.

07:03

The cluster of your mind is highly variable. It's about what you focus on and how much time you spend focusing on it, and how many different ways you think about it? And how many? and how many different ways you try to transform that information?

07:25

If you could quantify the information (in your brain, and or on the internet?) somehow say, well, it's a thought that I had for a minute and then write down the key points of that thought and then, you know, maybe we have a list of those points and then go through them one at a time and say, okay, trying to transform this point and

07:51

what would happen and when you sort of play with like every single point like it's a 3D object with the property in unity/blender/webxr, but we're talking about concept, then your action to perception cycle is going to sort of like build on that and I just now I'm thinking about my match.

08:19

Now again, in a new way. So what I'm about to do is I'm doing, like, sort of like drawing clustering. I'm gonna be like trying words and and I'm gonna be like, all of these are all the titles of the proposed. Chapter outlines the book outlines and write down all the words from from that.

08:43

And then I'm going to, I'm going to do clustering in ordering, I thinking about the high level and the low level of the book. And that that's the sort of like objective for the next stage of the book is just sort of like, clustering and organizing.
