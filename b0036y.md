Okay, we have the action to perception cycle, this and we have the concept of grit, the concept of persistence. We have Stephen Strogatz. He talked about the, I think there is a topic in talking about like this sort of like elitist, sort of like white European idea that, you know, you're better, you're better. It's like, okay, so this like there's Isaac Newton, and leave in its but the idea here that I want to revisit is that there's a connection between the intuition, what Stephen Strogatz calls intuition, and really needing to like have time to think about math on your own, like beyond, like...

So yeah, so teachers are great. School is great for learning new things, but the great intuition that Stephen Strogatz had with math was something that it... how do I say this? It's rooted in neuroscience. It's rooted in the action to perception cycle. Like he literally sits with math problems, and you could see that when he was talking to the guy who does the YouTube channel Three Blue One Brown that there was a resonance, I think, and that in order to understand math, you sort of have to play with it mentally. You have to sort of play mentally, and what that means is it's not really play. It is kind of, it is playing, but it's not child's play. This is like, it's adult play. It's... you really want to think about the granularity of numbers.

I think this note is about the importance of thought experiments, such as Einstein did, to play with ideas, math, in your mind, so that you can reach new conclusions through deliberation, consideration, and mental play.

Clustering Intuition Action Perception

The proprioceptive feedback loop is both down and up, both motor control output and sensory input in a loop 24/7. Like on millisecond time scales, moving your hand to a coffee cup is a constant bi-directional feedback loop (that defines the proprioceptive feedback system). There isn't really a separation between the activities of input sensory signals and output of motor signals, but they do have different paths.

I'm talking about creating a representation of numbers and different modalities, and different sorts of like, different experiential modalities, because you have... I think there is some conceptual intuition that is multimodal, and that you... the action to perception cycle... it's kind of like, I think the call to gain math intuition is almost like... maybe it's a little bit like the call to meditate like a Buddhist. If someone doesn't have time for meditation or for math, they may not take that time, okay?

But the people who are succeeding in math, like Stephen Strogatz, are succeeding in his way of doing math. He is having success as a teacher and a bookseller. But what's interesting here is the action-perception cycle is relevant for turning concepts into something usable.

I think of the unconscious as the tonic brainwave oscillations (inhibitory waves) that result from the conscious, which I think of as the high phasic firing (of action potential sequences that trigger inhibitory wave pattern changes to the tonic oscillations).

I kind of think that one of the reasons my book hasn't been published already by someone else has in part to do with the fact that our collective think on a whole range of subjects is sort of directed at a high level and, in some sense, is misdirected at a high level. Not by intention, I think, but by our own inattention to the details.

It's almost like this is a topic that is expanding in terms of people paying attention to it. I think the internet has been this explosion of all this stuff.

So that would be interesting if there was a sort of clustering that happened to all the information on the internet, right?

All that information could be auto-clustered by sentient AI, in other words, all the information on the internet could be reorganized and integrated to advance collective knowledge faster.

Right now, it's like every individual person is creating their own sort of cluster of the internet. But you're the cluster of your mind, and it's highly variable. It's about what you focus on, how much time you spend focusing on it, how many different ways you think about it, and how many different ways you try to transform that information.

If you could quantify the information in your brain, and or on the internet somehow, say: Well, it's a thought that I had for a minute, and then write down the key points of that thought. Then you have a list of those points and go through them one at a time, and say, "Okay, trying to transform this point, what would happen?"

When you sort of play with every single point like it's a 3D object with properties in Unity/Blender/WebXR (but we're talking about a concept), your action to perception cycle is going to build on that. I'm thinking about my match now again in a new way.

What I'm about to do is draw clustering. I'm going to be drawing words, and all these are the titles of the proposed chapter outlines, book outlines. I'm going to write down all the words from that.

Then I'm going to do clustering and ordering, thinking about both the high level and the low level of the book. That's the next stage of the book: clustering and organizing.
