# realization is a differential pattern in the phase field of the brain

The hypothesis that I'm favoring suggests that a rendered conceptual realization is a differential phase pattern in the phase field of the brain. The neural correlate of that is an electromagnetic phase change that is tracked by dendritic oscillations.

The key thing is the temporal oscillation provides the ability for the brain to integrate patterns together (as your experience of reality, that the brain is experiencing via the dendritic sensors)

The concept of temporal oscillatory synchrony reminds me of Neuropype's innovation at integrating unstructured sets of data from the heart & brain or from any sensor stream. Using carefully calibrated time series correlations from EKG & EEG data.

# Temporal & Spatial Coincidences May serve as a baseline for integrating different types of unstructured sensor inputs + abstract thoughts + motor actions together.

With the idea being that when you have two sets of unstructured signal data, such as heart waves, brainwaves, they might be comparable with a common baseline, reference frame, which in this case is a timeline, but also the neural network of your brain can compare signals by their locations in space, with location serving as another baseline or reference frame to compare unstructured signals. To construct a tomography representation that unites signals from the eyes & ears.

# Sequences of volumentic virtual rendered inner representations constitute human mental functioning in day to day life. Excerpt from note b0009y

"Where he talked about internal representations & strategies, he talked about becoming conscious of your internal representations. He talked about the understanding that you're making a mental strategy out of sequences of internal representations.

"A mental sequence, you have mental imagery, and as you progress through that mental imagery, you are executing the path of your life.

"You are following us a strategy that consists of different modalities, different feelings, different thoughts, different sensations, different smells, and there's a sequence of these (volumentic virtual inner representations) that your mind is going through, played out in a sequence, that results in an outcome that you keep getting over and over.

"Sometimes it's a negative outcome. Sometimes it's a positive outcome. And so if you pay attention to that sequence and you think about, okay, well, where is this sequence? What is this sequence of thoughts? And I'm having. What is that? What result is that going to lead to? Right? What?
