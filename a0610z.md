What you are seeing with your consciousness, that canvas is an energy wave difference, the differences define the pixels of your mental space.

a single neuron does all the work
"Researchers at Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin) have succeeded in simulating a neural network of thousands of nerve cells on a computer with only a single neuron programmed into the software code."

A drop wheel is a little wheel that sits in front of the electric unicycle, and it doesn't touch the ground, it only kicks in the event of a power outage, such as when you exceed the speed capabilities of the machine. So if the power of the electric unicycle goes out it drops, and then suddenly you can roll to a safe stop on two wheels instead of slamming face first onto the ground.lm
