(NeoMindCycle)'
Some trivia for my Facebook friends. It's not really obvious to me how many people know this but the name of my company is Neo Mind Cycle, it's a company that is still in stealth mode which is why you don't hear about it, it's the parent company of Silicon Valley Global News, and VRMA Virtual Reality Magazine, and the company exists to create the software architecture for Self Aware Networks and Nerve Gear which is an ideal for Brain Computer Interfaces. The book I am writing is very much in alignment with the work I've dedicated my life to doing, via this company.
