Dream Computer : Neo Mind Cycle Brain Frequency Sof

This works became the the work of lifetime. Ever since I was, you know, in retrospect like I this work in hindsight, after finish, after writing this book, I realized that this work really has been the work of a lifetime. And then I, when I was a, a small child, maybe five years old and in the 1980s, I remember even younger than that, I remember fascination with stories, especially science, fiction stories such as short circuit which was conscious robot.

00:50

And I remember thinking about as a small child, contemplating the nature of an artificial conscious mind in that robot in that movie short circuit. And there was a sequel short circuit to and there was herbies love bug. There was there is the calf matter space and the calf matter space.

01:18

I think, you know, when you put this collar on the cat, suddenly it could speak, it had had the ability to do magical things and so that was like, that was in a sense, this idea that if we could, you know, like if there was a brain computer interface that we could attach to a cat, we could expand, it's mental capability and it's ability to communicate, and it could be an extension of its brain and or we could, you know, basically have like a computer chip like I, you know, from from that, I mean, down the road, I had this, I had to stream of, you know, when I was much older, the scream of being in a cafe and putting on a chip on my collar or my my waistband, that would put me in to a basically, you would bring me into a lucid dream that the computer facilitated by taking my brain with your pattern manually and so I could get up out of the cafe inside the lucid dream.

02:39

But when I walked out side, I had this like, you know, I was in this highly detailed world as virtual reality, but I was that I was aware of, you know? But my real body was back in the cafe that I was experiencing this sort of like out of body virtual reality that was lucid dream.

03:01

Like, you know, as if, as if sword art online in involved inducing, a lucid dream state, with the computer controlled. They didn't specify anything like that. I mean, in fact, the sequel to the first one is not something that you lie down, and go to sleep and leave your body somewhere, what your mind goes into VR and the sequel.

03:24

You, you have basically like an augmented reality or augma where it connects to your nervous system, but it just overlays reality, okay? And that's that was sort out online. And then there was this spinoff Called NeoMinecycle software networks.

04:02

In your mind cycle, self-aware networks.

04:12

Artificial neurology.

04:18

So with the new mindset, we had, you know, we're playing. So I had the ability to combine multiple tracks with different frequency. Stimulus like alpha beta theta. Different frequencies gamma frequencies and there was one there were extra frequencies. You could get on the website. One of 
them was the Len Oaks particle.

04:47

The transparent corp website in the form and the length of protocol was based on the protocol that Lenox developed in 1980s, using EG to drive, light changes to light patterns. And so I was able to download the Linos protocol and run it and then have the emotive EJ has not.

05:18

And with the transparent corked software, actually, I'm not sure it was that software another software yet. There was a, there was a software maybe been in a mode of software you could download. Just the whole it was a whole bunch of applications that people just independently wrote to work with the motive and one of them was called subconscious and that was going to basically add different sound effects to your framelinks.

05:50

And so I could plug the EEG. Have the aging frequency changes, drive changes to subconscious. But also to the, to the Lin Oaks protocol, like they would drive changes to the frequency patterns, to the buying will be sour ice cream piece pretty wish which it was there. If it was Paul and so they would.

06:24
So if it felt like it was just amazing experience that that there is there is different ones, there's one that ramped up and became more intense. There was one that granddad became more mellow and there are several different ones but you had it would definitely like push your mind to an altered state.

06:54

You know? The way a glass of wine contains your alternate state a marijuana can change your state who pushed your mind to another. Another place you could make yourself like over over the excited, they're extremely creative. You know, you could be studying a lot and in terms of like your bank, we shift to that mode, where just, like, really in the zone is this in terms of studying?

07:27

And there was all these different IQ you can make yourself feel very sleepy. And even, you know, help get yourself to sleep with certain wave patterns. But when you had EG driving changes to light and sound effects to the wave patterns and to even the sounds with subconscious, it was like, you could, it felt like you're in this airplane and which your brain.

07:54

You're like literal consciousness was extended into a computer because in a sense, you're getting feedback from your own on your own, brainwashes, your brain is are being like transformed in a sense to write in some patterns and then you're seeing and hearing them so that can further. So that is bit now being modeled by your brain.

08:18

So the reflections that your brain went as light and sound patterns are not being modified. And that grace, this sort of like loop of brain activity. It's like expansion of awareness of your own vertices and how your thoughts and feelings are familiar with. And I went through this and I actually did this and one time, and maybe more than one time, but at least one time on psychedelic medicine, and I felt like, I saw the beginning of the universe.

08:44

Like, I felt like I could understand the entire universe of the practical, and I think I written down the story. So, I was seeing if I could find it, But but besides that part, like neo-mind cycle gave me this idea that we could potentially extend our minds into our computer, the consciousness could be expanded that I could that the mind that I have now included exists inside a larger mind where my ability to compute could be massively multiplied by an external brain and I said, okay, my expectations
