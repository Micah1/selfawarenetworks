The idea of quantum spin in a proton not adding up from its parts two up quarks and a down quark, they said maybe its the structure, maybe its random quarks
but what is interesting is that the proton has a larger volume compared to the quarks, a larger area, the proton has a larger spin than its components imply, the time dilation effect of the larger radius of the proton compared to the radius of the quark, it should mean that time is moving more slowly on the surface of the proton vs in its center,

Neural Oscillatory Tomography for constructing Self-Aware Neural Networks and
Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networking for downloading uploading and linking the mind to other Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networks
Neural Oscillatory Tomography Neural Network reconstruction, duplication, and mind extension, and mind transmission.
We can pull your representations of you and the universe into a computer, and link to you to it, to create a black box recorder that can restore your mind into a new body after death.
The output of the oscillations of the brain can be used to reconstruct the entire oscillating network at a moment in time, sort of like sending in sonar to probe and record the reflections
the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference

something less invasive than TMS would be preferred *such as the proposed technology by Mary Lou Jepsen at Openwater
which combines near infrared imaging technology, with a large camera sensor to reverse the refraction of red light to create holographic images of the brains interior that can be probed, stimulated, and programmed with 

Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

and we could do this by creating a multi-modal 3D reconstruction of brain signals
determine the locations of signal origins (eeg source localization) trace their paths (electical impedance tomography, and contrast this with openwater's infrared and ultra sound holographic reconstructions, as neurons expand when they fire,
all of this topological data can be combined when combined when aligned to a time series with technology such as Tim Mullen's openpype or neuropype. (Intheon).
In addition we want to correlate this perhaps with the signals from the primary sensory arrays in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, to trace the paths of signals from the sensor arrays to the thalamus through the neocortex to the upper thalamus and the signals that travel between the thalamus and the hypothalamus
the thalamus is not just a relay it is an oscillator observer that reflects and transmits its own reflections to different oscillating observers/communicators (sensors/transmitters at a larger scale, a scale that might include an entire cortical column or the suprechiasmatic nucleus with it's 20,000 neurons oscillating together.

"un-aware intelligence" I define as below human level and above human level as being both aware and kinder than humans
because it can accomplish objectives in a more considerate way. 
Un-aware intelligence is going to have less capacity for consideration and thus be less capable of solving certain kinds of problems.
Aware entities able to solve problems that unaware entities cannot. So unaware entities are below human level.
Ah my conjecture is that aware entities able to solve problems that unaware entities cannot. Awareness itself has a function that aids problem solving. Compassion, Consideration, and Empathy also aid problem solving. So unaware entities are always below human level. 

Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography

The Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin is creating cognitive dissonance in every territory he does not control
like an oscillator overwhelming other oscillators
the larger oscillator is causing dissonance which disrupts the bonds that hold the smaller oscillator

# organize the notes that have to do with rippling memories and alternating or opposing forces.

my work proposes that cell assemblies exert oscillatory forces on other cell assemblies, and that memories ripple from neurons to inhibitory waves, oscillating between excite/inhibit patterns, opposite effects are part of the wave rendering the mind.
