# "Neural dynamics differentially encode phrases and sentences during spoken language comprehension"
"Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain encodes and separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses. They imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity are readouts for the constituent structure of language."

# "Visualization of visual circuits for social recognition in juvenile"
from Johannes Kappel:
"I am beyond excited to share my PhD work on visual circuits for social recognition in juvenile #zebrafish with you, supervised by 
@JohannesLarsch & @skeptencephalon, now published @Nature"

Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.

# New supporting research: "A gradual temporal shift of dopamine responses mirrors the progression of temporal difference error in machine learning"
"the phasic responses of midbrain dopamine neurons show a remarkable similarity to a type of teaching signal (temporal difference (TD) error) used in machine learning. "
"such a gradual shift occurs both at the level of dopaminergic cellular activity and dopamine release in the ventral striatum in mice."

# "Newborns Develop Language Skills Within Hours of Birth"

I want to imagine that the visualization makes is so that we can compare the neurons to a group of oscillating fireflies. All lighting up in quick succession. Then sharing an off interval together.

# 1/F

Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?

James Bonaiuto "Not sure I understand what you mean. It's just that power drops at increasing frequencies. It's pretty common in biological systems - it's called pink noise"

Micah: I mean with EEG frequencies in the brain, isn't an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency observed and referred to as 1/f? I guess I could be misunderstanding the use of 1/f.

James Bonaiuto "Yes, that's right! I just didn't understand what you meant by magnitude"

Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

# Add to Cosmos Fractal Map
I think the cosmos is a fractal of dissipative resonating oscillations inside a harmonic oscillating wave pattern, from atoms, to life, to the cosmos. We are not really even alive life is type of oscillatory pattern that emerges in certain conditions: game theory of evolution

# Clustering vs Segmentation

https://dfrieds.com/machine-learning/segmentation-vs-clustering.html
I think that sensory inputs into the brain have to go through a sort of point segmentation in the first place for the rendering of learned patterns, generating accurate models from incoming data, but when it comes to the mind creating new ideas, such as having original thoughts during a meditation session, that is generating new data from existing data. that's creativity or the clustering of prior ideas into new ideas.

In a sense identifying what is real in the world is a segmentation task, but imagining what could be real is a clustering task

Clustering is creativity, rendering accurate patterns that represent the real world is segmentation.

The hunch is that the natural transformation of data over time, from events like the modulation of data via thalamic connections

# "Correspondence between the layered structure of deep language models and temporal structure of natural language processing in the human brain"

"These findings point to a connection between language processing in humans and DLMs where the layer-by-layer accumulation of contextual information in DLM embeddings matches the temporal dynamics of neural activity in high-order language areas."
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.11.499562v1

The layer by layer accumulation of information in Artificial Deep Learning Neural Networks, or DNNs is a good indicator that neural arrays, or layers in the brain, are learning information that is played back in temporal & spatial sequences (not a new idea in of itself) 

It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.

The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

# Quantum Stuff

The idea of quantum spin in a proton not adding up from its parts two up quarks and a down quark, they said maybe its the structure, maybe its random quarks
but what is interesting is that the proton has a larger volume compared to the quarks, a larger area, the proton has a larger spin than its components imply, the time dilation effect of the larger radius of the proton compared to the radius of the quark, it should mean that time is moving more slowly on the surface of the proton vs in its center,

Neural Oscillatory Tomography for constructing Self-Aware Neural Networks and
Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networking for downloading uploading and linking the mind to other Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networks
Neural Oscillatory Tomography Neural Network reconstruction, duplication, and mind extension, and mind transmission.
We can pull your representations of you and the universe into a computer, and link to you to it, to create a black box recorder that can restore your mind into a new body after death.
The output of the oscillations of the brain can be used to reconstruct the entire oscillating network at a moment in time, sort of like sending in sonar to probe and record the reflections
the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference

something less invasive than TMS would be preferred *such as the proposed technology by Mary Lou Jepsen at Openwater
which combines near infrared imaging technology, with a large camera sensor to reverse the refraction of red light to create holographic images of the brains interior that can be probed, stimulated, and programmed with 

Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,

and we could do this by creating a multi-modal 3D reconstruction of brain signals
determine the locations of signal origins (eeg source localization) trace their paths (electical impedance tomography, and contrast this with openwater's infrared and ultra sound holographic reconstructions, as neurons expand when they fire,
all of this topological data can be combined when combined when aligned to a time series with technology such as Tim Mullen's openpype or neuropype. (Intheon).
In addition we want to correlate this perhaps with the signals from the primary sensory arrays in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, to trace the paths of signals from the sensor arrays to the thalamus through the neocortex to the upper thalamus and the signals that travel between the thalamus and the hypothalamus
the thalamus is not just a relay it is an oscillator observer that reflects and transmits its own reflections to different oscillating observers/communicators (sensors/transmitters at a larger scale, a scale that might include an entire cortical column or the suprechiasmatic nucleus with it's 20,000 neurons oscillating together.

"un-aware intelligence" I define as below human level and above human level as being both aware and kinder than humans
because it can accomplish objectives in a more considerate way. 
Un-aware intelligence is going to have less capacity for consideration and thus be less capable of solving certain kinds of problems.
Aware entities able to solve problems that unaware entities cannot. So unaware entities are below human level.
Ah my conjecture is that aware entities able to solve problems that unaware entities cannot. Awareness itself has a function that aids problem solving. Compassion, Consideration, and Empathy also aid problem solving. So unaware entities are always below human level. 

Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography

The Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin is creating cognitive dissonance in every territory he does not control
like an oscillator overwhelming other oscillators
the larger oscillator is causing dissonance which disrupts the bonds that hold the smaller oscillator

# organize the notes that have to do with rippling memories and alternating or opposing forces.

my work proposes that cell assemblies exert oscillatory forces on other cell assemblies, and that memories ripple from neurons to inhibitory waves, oscillating between excite/inhibit patterns, opposite effects are part of the wave rendering the mind.

# "Sentences Have Their Own Timing in the Brain"
https://neurosciencenews.com/sentence-timing-brain-21033/

What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
