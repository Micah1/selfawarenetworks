Neuro Waves Ossilations Psychophysics part 3

00:00
I left I left because I had I had to go to sleep. I think I left around midnight, so I don't know if everyone left at the same time. I did but I'm. Not ah, yeah but yeah rant I'm if we can manage to pull him in for that part of the conversation at some point or was because he's just oh yeah now he knows the ton of stuff what was your question for him?

00:24
I remember yeah, I was there. I remember you you're asking for Ramsey. I didn't actually. It was a. Huh, you know, but they were like right above right above me with a mic and they were kind of. Asking. When I heard hippocampus and then there's all sorts of chemical reactions and I'm not really sure what all of those are that's when I think Ramsey it was like oh he'll know you know, but then when he got there the other people who had been engaged in that part of the conversation had already left and you know, that person wasn't speaking up and I didn't really want to call them out my name be like oh so and so was talking about you know, because yeah, just so many reasons but yeah.

01:17
Um, All right yeah, so I was just gonna say I you know, I I could take on the the the question if you remembered what it was but I but if not, that's okay. Um, yeah, it wasn't really mine but definitely it's surprising, you know, like very surprising to me and now I feel super naive that you know, I underestimated by like 20,000 times the number of neurons.

01:45
Yeah, so so that book by the way, so I so we were listening to an excerpt from a book called rhythms of the brain.

01:55
And what I did was a certain points, so I was just having my kindle I was having Alexa read from my Kindle at the point that I was in the book and but while we were listening to that I started I started making notes and I could I could share some of those notes with folks if you want like I took screenshots and I'm sort of like, I'm super interested because I've been doing things like around the house and with the dog and everything so I didn't make any notes so please all right, so I'm just like looking at this one note right here, so the one consequence of decreased interconnectedness and larger brands is the increased segregation of the neuronal pool.

02:41
So Ringo 1991 suggested that this segregation may be the force for more specialization in larger brains. For example, the functional differences between hemispheres. And then let's see. Remember what? It's like so like I'm learning to use the highlighter in the book when I do screenshots because like sometimes it's like oh what did I say that for do you ever have that okay let's see oh yeah, so it's interesting to hear that so basically the neuroscientist didn't invent in a sense they didn't I guess I didn't invent EEG it's basically like it's basically like the same sort of.

03:28
Thing that is used that was created by him seismologists, so they they wanted to measure earthquakes. And that's that's basically the technology behind this scalp. EG. And but so the rest of the sidebar just task is literally identical to that of a neurologist who attempts to localize the source of an epileptic seizure from scalp recordings, the source localization problem is engineers call it the inverse problem is the task of recovering elements and location of the narrow fuel if you're generators based upon spatially average activity detected in scalp electrodes, so actually gotten to an argument that lasted several months because I couldn't understand exactly this the limitations of source localization, it wasn't.

04:17
I mean, it wasn't real argument. If we was like, it was like a series of discussions around a paper see there was a paper that came out and I think I linked it on Twitter a while back but let me see it was called EG source localization with.

04:41
With oh with DBS, so do you know DBS is a deep frame simulation device, right? Ah and eg so that has to be surgically implanted and so the idea of of you know, basically source easy source localization is is a technique that comes from trying to predict earthquakes, which is super cool so I had no idea this is true something I learned today but I I saw this paper comparison of imaging modalities.

05:12
I think this might be it okay, let's leave if it is it. I'll link it to it. I think it's fair.

05:23
Yeah, it's not that one. I'll see do you noising depth signals the other side yet, okay. So oh wait, here it is now it's it's okay it's called so the name of the paper is called subcortical electrophysiological activities detectable. With high density ED source imaging okay, so this paper I'm gonna link on my Twitter and I'm gonna go ahead and open up Twitter another window and I'll copy this this paper came out in January of 2019.

05:54
February 2018, and I took this to a neuroscientist who I knew was. At UCSF. He was a guy that I talked to every day for like more than a year. And and I in the argument was this as like well look if you can use if we can prove that with source loganization that with EG if we can figure out the signals are coming from thalamus, right?

06:23
Or we feel where they're coming from the brain that we could use this basically to reconstruct the the origin points of signals within the the brain and then and then we could. Use that to basically do, you know something like psychophysics right where you're comparing with someone is seeing to their brain activity and but we could do it like in high dimensional three dimensional way and we could take the three dimensional model and we could wreak it do analysis of the three dimensional activity with the three dimensional world and he's like, no, no, no, no, we don't need to make this 3D because because we're not getting we're not getting any new.

07:13
Information from from it. We like everything that like the whole 3D plot is from the 2D information by making a 3D we're not getting any more information. So there's no there's no point in doing that. And it's like, but I want to do it. And I thought well if it's 3D and we can visualize in 3D we might gain more insights by looking at it right then versus having it in 2D but but also there's many other arguments that came up in the call today basically explaining why you know, in fact it's here, it says it says here in on this page.

07:52
This is why I say this page is a difficulty of source localization has to do with the low restitivity of. Of neurotic tissue to electrical current flow the capacity currents produced by the libid cell membranes and the distorting and attenuating effects of glia blood vessels. Pia Durham Scout muscles and skin.

08:14
So the result is that EEG recorded by a single electrode is a spatially smooth version of local field potentials under the scalp on the order of 10 to the 10 centimeters squared. And your most conditions has little discernible relationship with a specific patterns of activity that's around of the neurons that generate it.

08:36
And this is kind of what he was saying Cactus is almost exactly what he's saying, which is made which makes me think he read this exact book. No, he's been hologram. Good. Oh, no. I was just asking like is it such a feat to construct three deholographically from the two dimensional imaging?

09:03
Well so like with this paper that came out in February 2019, they basically proved that the the source localization that they were doing was was correct because they compared it to the DPS imaging so DBS also did a measurement and they compared the two measurements and DBS's implanted deep in the brain and and they're able to verify the the prediction of the source levelization.

09:32
But I guess you can make it argument that. That being able to do that once doesn't mean you're doing it you're doing it right every time and it may be every time you try to do it it's gonna it might you might be close one time you have your way off the next time it's just like it's like trying maybe it's like trying to convert.

09:55
You're trying to convert something that's 2d into 3d and there's just too many different ways to for for that 2d thing to be reconstructed in 3d that maybe maybe you can be right some of the time but but to too much of the time you might be wrong and and and so maybe that takes like this like the experience of someone who's who's been doing medical imaging was imagined for 30 plus years like he was to like but no no this is too complicated in terms of like, you know this like too many things moving around like that like the thing about like yeah, like, you know, you can stick the Se these neural ink electros in your head and but they're gonna move around every time you breathe.

10:37
I mean that that is something like I didn't learn from reading somebody's you know, actually no, okay. I did. I did learn that from reading. But the point is I like that is something that like you might not you might not learn it like in the in your first year you but you might it might take like that's like really deep knowledge, you know, sure sure but I sort of feel like we fail our way to success right so if we've if we built something and we know that it's wrong that's great because if we know why it's wrong and we have more direction of what's right, so.

11:16
Yeah. Um, let's see another one sure long term definitely long-term big team long-term thing yeah. See another thing oh so I guess I took a note that so magnetto encephalography burger. So this is a funny point so he was a physician not a physicist had he understood Maxwell's equations he he might not have started electric recording electricity from his son's scalp in the search for the oh that was his son no oh that no way oh no, okay, no yeah, no, okay so so the story with with with hands burger.

11:59
Was he was he was the physician who sort of pioneered. Scalp easy and the story was that there was a there was a story about in his day a woman had a.

12:15
She had a dream that her boyfriend fell off a horse and she wrote a letter. Right when she had the dream and. And at the same time around the same time her boyfriend fell off a horse. And and the letter could not possibly have moved fast enough for him to.

12:40
Have received it or gotten word of it before he fought he fell off the horse so um, so Hansberger was thought well that um, that that telepathy was was involved he thought that her brain had through the air sent a message to his brain. And so so that that's sort of missing from this part of the story that we heard today but the part is really weird today was that yeah it's kind of funny like if he had if burger had been a physicist instead of studying electricity he would have he would have studied electromagnetism and so that I thought that was really just a funny.

13:23
Funny point the story of Hansberger is really hilarious he was. Trying to prove telepathy but he ended up you know being like the one of the most important figures and and, And medical imaging you know, the founder of EED basically in a way. I don't know if that's the right the right phrase to use but but basically, One one I guess it was really good to hear sound like a lot of people have been asking questions like well how clear is how's the spatial resolution of of you know, EG versus you know, eCog versus nerlase and here we got this like this this book really just like whenever there's like okay, here's here's all these questions that that you're gonna be asking in the year 2020 one on Clubhouse and here's all the answers and they're all in this book and on top of that, we're gonna we're gonna tell you about the special resolution of MEG and And all these other different centers too as like, oh great that's what good time good timing.

14:30
I don't want to slide track too much from tonight, but I am wondering. If you. Consider doing a book club to do like maybe like a weekly chapter by chapter and you know just to try and get like a really broad brought away array of perspectives on it and and because as you said, I think this all does relate to so many topics that I find myself in.

14:58
Yeah, so I mean, I well, I'm gonna be careful because it's like, you know, but I've been thinking about that a lot actually because. Because you see this through there are people who are doing they're trying to do book clothes right but what they're doing is I'll go ahead they're gonna like take turns reading the book and then and they don't get to it and then you go back the next week and it's a different book, you know, how did you get through an entire book yeah, so you go back the next day in a different book so I can different book every day it's too much jumping around.

15:28
I think great has a pretty good layout so like I'm in I I'm in that book club for my skin Minsky's society of mine, oh and it's it's had you know, Has been everybody's taking turn will not everybody but you know maybe half a dozen people each week taking turns reading chapter sections and then usually several hours of discussion but it's been going pretty smoothly as a model where it you know, we're getting through a chapter each week and then of course there's the discussion for several hours and then there's the after party discussions for several more hours and then there's the part, you know part two after parties.

16:13
But I'm really in enjoying that and I don't know like I wouldn't try to set it up but I definitely love to participate. Okay right on I yeah, I've been thinking about doing that a lot so. But it's good for me to hear what you're saying about about someone else's project being very successful because I haven't seen a very successful version of that yet, so maybe that could be serves a model.

16:41
To to try to do it do it well. Um, okay so so tetrodes when this came up this was really cool because um, this almost has like a direct the the direct correlation to to neuralink and it's sort of like I felt like this part of the book really kind of like explained, um, What they were trying to solve with within their link in terms of like.

17:14
Like the different kinds of like. Anything here. I'm just looking for something specific on my note here so tetras are especially useful in areas with high packing density of neurons where isolating isolation of individual neurons from nearby peers is a nearby peers is difficult with single wires under ideal conditions the tetra can record to 20 well isolated neurons so and then it says, Okay, but then it says for this reason so so the court the the pyramidal cells cortical pyramidal cells generate extracellular field to flow mostly parallel to there's so much injuric axis, so for this reason the action potentials can.

18:01
Be detected several hundred micrometers from the soma. In the proximity of thick apical dendrites. The lateral spread of current is more restricted nevertheless tetrodes can hear pyramid pyramidal cells as far away as a hundred micrometers lateral to the cell body. An extracellular spike amplitude decreases rapidly the function of distance from the neuron.

18:26
And then so so this is like so I'm so right when he said 140 micrometers I'm like, I'm typing that into the computer and I'm looking it up and like okay, so how much is it distance? And then right up that he says he says he says a cylinder with a radius of 140 micrometers contains approximately 1,000 neurons in the rack cortex, right?

18:46
So so like okay, so that means that like that means like the neural link a neuralink electrode. Maybe each one of them may be able to to listen to a thousand neurons. Depending on how tightly packed they are right that's interesting, right? And then he then when he starts to describe like the basically the limitations of.

19:10
Of the this is like something I want to kind of revisit because he's describing like all that he's you know, basically you can triangulate the position. You're gonna attempt to triangulate the position of a neuron and you do need to describe how you how you triangulate the the electrical I forget how they use triangulation with with EKG right with the heart to.

19:41
But he was he's making that analogy okay if you've got more than you've got three or more electrodes and you can you can you can try to figure out where where the neuron is, but then then he starts to go into all these like different problems. Well, you know different parts of the neuron could could could in action potential could could come from different parts of it from any part of it.

20:00
And which was interesting because like, you know, you like an example his examples were yeah well so it could be like the the the dendrite and and this and the soma. Have to some together to create the action potential but but then he specifically hit like any part of it like what would he mean any part of it?

20:19
It's like I guess I guess I guess and I I guess some the the spike reading could come from any physical part of the neuron which is a little bit weird. I'm not sure why but but but like if a neuron is really long and it it it intertwines with a lot of other things and you know that that means that and and you know at sometimes the spike might come out over here and sometimes it might come out over there and then if you Just have like, you know, you know 20, you know three different wires in there and you're trying to figure out where is this neuron exactly?

20:54
It's just it's making your job a lot more difficult, right? So like now I'm thinking again about okay, well the fact that that a hair in the neural link is like 16 different electrodes, right and they're putting in hundreds of them, right? They're putting in like I guess no not hundreds of putting in hundreds of heritage, like, you know how to putting them like, Like, you know 3000 electrodes at once and and there's a really good this is like the really good reason for why because if you're trying to like really get precise about you know, which which neuron is firing exactly, you know, then then you're gonna want to have a lot of electros to be doing triangulation and end in a, Yeah, yeah, that's basically it is a built like a really sort of like.

21:44
Yeah did he say something about a frequency versus timing issue? In different yeah, he did that he was talking about. When you're doing like so hit that but that came up in the context of the scalp measurements with eg and he was trying to say that with the. You're getting like.

22:13
I think I think it was something the fact like you get it you're you can get a time series but when you're talking about the power bands, you're not you're not you're getting a frequency and it's not also it's not like sort of disconnected from the time series like if you just use a four-year transform it's like just frequency is not also time but then like if you use like wavelets and use the the the other kind of fourier transform, I forget what it's called, but.

22:39
Then you can oh yeah, so like so if you're doing for if you're doing like a 40 transformer on I'm not not on the whole not on all of time, but basically on a very discrete amount of time or if you're doing like wavelet then you could. Then you could have both time and frequency domain if that makes sense.

23:03
Does that sort of but but I'm just sort of like I think that's that's an area where I have more questions. I don't know if you don't know about you but I that's like yeah, yeah.

23:22
Don't have anything else to do what you know. All right, so let's see because I know that between all of the minds that kind of float around in these circles on here. I know that everybody has you know, a little bit of data here in a little bit of data there and yeah.

23:42
You know, isn't that great isn't that great when like you're talking about something and neither weren't neither person can can really know the answer and then someone else is oh, I know the answer and they like pop up on stage. I love that. But that's not every exercise not all the time, but I guess.

24:00
See okay so there's one okay so there's what I say to know because there was a page where they said in other words the brain does not operate continuously but discontinuously using temporal packages or quanta and the designers of general purpose programmable computers recognize a long time ago that networks with cycles have orders of larger.

24:23
Capabilities and networks without cycles. The wavelength of the oscillatory category terms temporal windows of processing and indirectly the size of the neuronal pool involved it follows from this speculation the different frequencies favor different types of connections in different levels of computation. And general slow oscillation can evolve many neurons in a large brain areas, whereas the short time windows of fast oscillations facilitate local integration.

24:56
Larger because of the limitation of the axon conduction delays. So I mean, I guess so the there's some of this like I feel like I need to read this again tomorrow, but some of this I'm like yeah, so like like yeah, the the fact that it is discrete. So I wrote this eyebrows this article.

25:14
I called humans are metal robots and and you can find I think I think that's a title maybe guys, so let me go to svgn.io. I'll see if I can find it put on Twitter. But um, but the reason I said that is it's not it's not a joke it's it's a humans are metal robots in a valid sense because they're neurons are full of metal like the calc calcium are neurons have potassium and sodium and and they use calcium and these are metals and but not only that let me I'm gonna link this article on Twitter.

25:54
But we process things not an analog way but any discrete way and I still have a app that we have these a lot of neuroscience groups and people will say things like well humans don't like we don't know what consciousness is and and and everything to say I don't know because cuz there's a lot that I whenever that's that's the whole point of what I'm writing but anyway so here so here is um the book that I'm writing.

26:24
I'm writing a book that basically points out the human that I believe human beings have with the current reads. To have already solved the consciousness is but if you look at this article that I just pay posted on Twitter and put hang on let me hit it right now, okay so that article is humans are metal robots in about scents here's the thing so we thank you yeah yeah, so this is like this is full of research papers, but I reference I didn't just like this is not like I didn't reference like some holy book this is like there's a research paper in here like written by it major scientists, and one of the things that comes up is is that, The brain processes information and discrete steps discrete forms so here so at point number three the brain is digital it's not analog it processes the screen information like a computer a recent paper changes the dominant paradigm of neuroscience relates 50 years, so that was in May 4th of 2018, but what's interesting is?

27:24
He's saying that in this book and his book predates that paper so I I so that's really cool for me because now that there's an older source now. I need to like, um, I believe in he put the reference in the back of the book so I think I I've made have to go back and get the source or I did already took a screen shot.

27:45
I don't know but but, Yeah, that's really cool um, so my article references a later source and his book as much older so I have to have to change the after doing updates okay, no actual credit for for the origin of the human brain processing things in a discrete step another thing the take the cue.

28:10
Defragger and um, The second edition has all of the new footnotes you found since the first yeah yeah this this book is this book is one of the best books. I mean, I've read some great books this book is one of the best books that I've read so far.

28:30
I'm really excited about this book and I'm really excited about the sequel to this book because it is just like it's shock full of like great references and clear writing and has his broad scope covers of vast number of topics. I mean, I so I mean, I also have on my Kindle I have the I have the the book when I was I started reading about how he in early part of the book that wasn't in the call today.

28:54
Earlier this week. I think yesterday I was reading about his he was talking about the the how the brain is constructed, um how then how the network the network the network of the brain is constructed and and I was like this sounds like Olaf's porns and I like so I was born this book is also my kindle it's another book that I've read part of the way through and I'm still finishing but I flipped back to Olaf's forms and I'm reading it as a yeah, this is like this is like he's the same.

29:26
It's a lot of same ideas here and then it and then and then I flipped it back to this book and he mentions allow spores like five or six times as oh, okay so all right, you know, where where what time zone are you in you should jump in on the the minsky book club.

29:41
I think you'd find it interesting we're I think it's chapter eight this week so you know, it's already cruising through but um, Yeah, I think Pacific I'm I'm in Eastern so I think it's 8:30 on Thursdays PM, I see must be getting really late for you right now yeah, oh no, I.

30:03
Sleep at odd time.

30:09
On the on the Minsky book club for society of mind comes at it. You do consider sending me at the time the time to show up on Twitter and I'll let it remind me if you oh yeah yeah yeah, so when one thing is like, um, you know, like I love it when people like the Chopin a group that where the topic is neuroscience and people will say scientists have no idea what quality is it's this magical thing and we don't like magic and all the stuff here it is unpaid here it is like and in the pages it says if so then one over f dynamics maybe the functional architecture of underlying quality support.

30:49
Okay. So no it has been covered the people this isn't this isn't neuroscience it it's not something that is magical this is a like a actual thing that they cover in a neuroscience textbook okay, so and on top of that like, you know, I was looking at this reference for um, Basically this guy he talks about this like five or six times I think during this turn this recorded call he says so Labette was this, um, you know disguised he's saying that basically they caught the conscious experience requires the engagement of the appropriate brain networks for hundreds of milliseconds and like yeah, I've heard this idea before right right like so like if someone is unconscious or someone is conscious like it's like okay, what's the difference, you know of all these anti physiologists with their their theories of the brain leaving the body, it's very amazing but but then it's like yeah, but Okay, so but what is more precisely what's different right and what what about when I'm awake and there's some things I'm not contrast of and some things that I am conscious of like what you know, there's um, You know, how does something go from you know being something that's outside my awareness to something that I'm suddenly aware of you know, and and the this was answered in 2004 but by Labette and he's like yeah, this is like the email that this is like the consciousness is temporarily a temporally active pattern done like this solves consciousness in 2004.

32:25
Like I told you I'm okay. I know I'm sorry. These ideas right there's still a lot of good debate to be had. Um but uh and there was there was a bit of a joke there in there but I but at the point I said like um yeah there's like this book is shock full like great references right it's one of the best on the my major point by saying that and and the other thing was that this book is just amazing for like this the scale of all the different topics that it covers and all the different research papers that it covers and and like the you know, when I pointed out that basically it like this is this whole chapter sounds like the entire like he's summarized it the entire work of Olaf sports, this is great and it's and and then he references a lot of Cyber six times there's just magnificent he's like this is like this book is like if you could if you could take you know, 20 years of 20 plus 20 plus a year that I don't know 200 plus years of neuroscience really because your hands burger is it and and there was this whole point in the beginning when he's talking about, you know, Cajal and you know, the the guy who one of the guys who like was who like in first like in the 1800s Ramon and and as in his rival could you all were both like, you know, the first to be they were staining neurons, so they could Image basically that they had they drew all these like they made these drawings basically or I don't know if they were like, um prints or something from there from staining neurons as they basically.

34:00
Created like some of the first illustrations of of neurons in the brain that that we that that are in the sort of like the the modern history of neuroscience right and this is like an 1800 and so he really like he covers like the past two hundred years of.

34:18
Of neuroscience in this book except that this book is outdated and there's a newer book though, so this book is like so I don't know what what year it was released, but it's just. Seeing type it up rhythms. Our age why rhythms of the brain? By the way, so we're the brain was.

34:44
What year was it? If anyone gets their faster go ahead and shot at the answer what year was the book.

34:55
Hmm why isn't the year up like a little more obvious let's go back one and maybe check the Wikipedia. There's a PDF.

35:09
Wow. I think you can get the book for free right now. I think it's on the web for free. Wow, okay, let me show the link. Okay like everyone if you're still here, you can have a copy of the book that the Twitter was just there's just being read for free.

35:31
So let me go ahead and copy this and this is called rhythm to the brain.

35:38
And I'm going to cover this. Wow, that is awesome. Awesome for you guys. I bought a car. I bought a coffee. I think my coffee was 40 bucks, but yeah, if you look at my Twitter right now, that is the that's the book right there that we were just playing.

35:56
Yeah and I did not see the year when I was checking that out so it's the year was it was published in 2006 so this is an old book 2006 for neuroscience, but it is just great and then he's got a newer book so like I'm after I've been with this I think come back so here so this is a remark, this is another note that I took this is a remarkable observation he says in essence the claim is that a collective pattern recorded from a small portion of the cortex looks like a pattern recorded from the hole.

36:29
This scale in variance or cell similarity. Is a decisive characteristic of fractals. I almost like fell out of my chair when he said that I was like, whatever you heard me, I made some sort of sound at the time was like the fractal structures such as river beds snowflakes furn leaves tree arbors and arteries and fractal dynamic processes such as pink noise cloud formation earthquakes snow and sand avalanches heart rhythms and stock market flux price fluctuations are so similar in that any piece of the fractal design contains a miniature of the entire thing.

37:08
And so that knocked my socks off. I did not expect that to be in this book and that gave me huge smiles because. The model three-dimensionally even you know, just holographic whatever because. Yeah, so many reasons yes. I'm with you big smiles feel lots of validation love and that yes, all right, so let's see another note that I took was the recorded signal in fact may contain more information about the observer's brain state than about the input because the process is an interpretation or construction rather than a reflection to use terms borrowed from psychology in order to predict the president's state of the brain one needs to have access to recent history.

38:02
So um, and he also mentioned it this term that I wrote down and called Nero Nero physiology, okay, so the title of this of actually it's not so so I usually titled the group and neurophysics right and then I'm no no no, no, no. I'm sorry. I missed this up not neurophysiology, that's not basic.

38:28
Psychophysics psychophysics psychopathy so that so the name of this group was almost neurophysics and I changed at the last second took out the physics part but then he comes because I have a group also on faceobok, it's called neuro physics. And. But he said psychophysics has a great second what does that hey I looked it up and and it is so neurophysics here is you know, when we're talking about hands burger and EEG and like the actual you know, that oscillations of the brain that this is the topic of neurophysics cycle physics where we're now like we're not only talking about neurophysics, but we're comparing the neurophysics to someone's real robotic world real world experiences so psychophysics is like the real world we're trying to interpret what a person's real life experiences.

39:19
To to the neurophysics of their brain which is like really interesting because it's like I wasn't aware of that term which is something I got and it's very valuable so I can almost like rename the the the thing about rename renaming the the the book and actually the group and on faceobok from neurophysics plus to something else and I was gonna go something like neurophysics plus nerve gear plus brain press, sorry plus brain waves plus rhythms plus oscillations and something like that, but it.

39:50
And but I I haven't really settled on. What to name it and all of a sudden there's this new name psychophysics, so neurophysics and psychophysics psychophysics includes neurophysics right wow and then um and and then, uh, The point was that the, The thing is like well the recorded signal is okay, so the record of signal is not what you just saw right now he says in the book in order to predict the present state of the brain what needs to have access to its recent history so what he's saying is like the the signal that you're seeing in the brain the the neurophysics that you're detecting with your with your brain sensors with your neural link or your you know, your other brain computer interface that doesn't represent what you're seeing in that moment that represents the room and Everything that happened in the last you know minute maybe could be everything like the table the chair the the mirror the wall yeah like all of that stuff is part of the brain signal, so you have to take whatever's happening right now.

41:04
And everything that just happened to in the in the in the brain's reason history and really that's really what the brain signal is so that that really like it's a it's not a reflection it's a construction and that so I I I highlighted that because that is a particularly powerful point to make especially like, you know in in in these group conversations about brain computer interfaces, you just got to remind people it's it's it's not so easy to decode what's in the brain because there's it's it's it's a, It's a if you think about your own sort of conscious right now.

41:42
Right?

41:48
What we have our attention on yeah yeah and in and maybe that points to like why you don't you don't see the same patterns necessarily repeating over and over again you give someone the same stimulus but maybe now they're in a different room and or the air is different or the sounds are different and or the day is different they're just aware of the fact that the day is different it's not the same day.

42:12
And and their brain patterns are gonna be different so like well that just makes your job as a person trying to like decode what brainwave brands are a lot more difficult because it's like it's not the same picture from one moment to the next with the same signal. So that's just like a really complicated um, so so here we go, there's another note I said experiential requires the engagement of appropriate brain networks for hundreds of milliseconds the delay between Labette's mind time relative to physical time is a favorite argument of philosophers to question the unity of the mind.
42:50

So the generalization of the relationship between physical stimuli and cognitive events has come to be known as psychophysics. Right that was that was another note and psychophysics was the term. So let's look at the another note. So several recent experiments provide evidence for scale free and spatial fractal nature of scalp.

43:37
EG recorded over. Extant durations. That was the reference I believe to the fractal scale-free and spat in space for free. So here was this idea that basically like every mammal like every. Every brain that's similar to our brain is basically a fret like a fractal the same program. That that was like that was mind stretching and alarming sort of way.

44:02
I was like what wait what what about it like it's like something okay basically okay like every part of your brain is the same and every piece of your brain is like basically the same as the whole of your brain and every animal based together has like a is like a copy of your basically your brain and the like do you like me?

44:22
I mean are like is you're like yeah, we're virting on. Theory here, you know.

44:29
It's also it's sort of a frightening though because I think about like all the pigs in the cows trapped in in in the and they basically all have your brain, right?

44:41
I mean this it this goes yeah, this is why I say I'm studying quantum, you know applied quantum field woo and you know, but that's why I always phrase it that way because yeah if you look at if you if you look at the fractal nature, you can't you can't really divorce one discipline from another just each discipline focuses on specific aspects.

45:07
But if you you know, if you take this to heart then yeah, it is all just. Copies of or not copies, but you know, it is all just a fractal array right? Yeah continental copies. Yeah, it's a self repeating pattern. It's all copies of the same sort of cognitive structure.

45:28
Let's see we've got like template better than. I would decide. So there's there's something that some things that are really good like who's talking about like face walking face modulation and and he's talking about like. How the oscillations are not they don't secretize in one part was because the brain is very big but also because some some oscillations are pulling on other oscillations and they're keep the preventing, you know oscillations are like they're so sort of bouncing off each other like I'm just like imagining like when he says I'm like imagine like, you know, if you've got like, you know every scene like this binary star systems or this you get two stars that are just like rotating around.

46:13
And they're not like merging they're just like they keep forcing each other to like rotate somehow but they're not. Like they're they're orbiting each other, but they're not like they're not colliding and it's just like our it's like. You might personally think well if you bring oscillators together, they're going to synchronize and they might they might become a single oscillation but maybe also the another other situations might happen in what's happening is like, they're they're preventing the you've oscillations that are preventing other oscillations from from your slow oscillations and fast oscillations and there's there's, A isn't it always like an approximate secret you can finish that word for me but isn't it always approximate like it's net it's never exactly.

47:06
Synchronized right so they can push each other towards being synchronous but it's never exactly.

47:19
I'm taking this from other I'm trying to yeah, I'm trying to make consistency across broad strokes here, so yeah, so I mean the sort of like well the big the big picture that I got was that you know, he's he was saying that the when he was saying that the brain was operating on multiple timescales.

47:38
And I started to think about this. I was talking to one of the neuroscientists on Clubhouse a while back some named his name was like F Scott or something but. But I was talking about like well, how does the how's the you know, when you go from like the neocortex oh sorry when you go from like you go from like the from the thalamus to the neocortex and back to the you know, you go through go through each of the layers and then back to the neocortex how does this has a floater information to work and he saw he began to lay out so he's like it's like you have connections that go from the thalamus to the b1 you connection to go from the balance to the b2 and basically from The thalamus to each of the other layers and then you have connection to go from the v1 to the b2 and then you have to you data going for v1 to be2 and then from v2 back to b1 and we kept going into it's like okay, so it turns out like like everywhere you go you've got stuff that is is going in six different directions, it's going it's going it's going up it's going down it's going left it's going right it's going to forward and it's going back it's uh, and everything is connected to everything else and sort of.

49:02
Up and down so yeah yeah, we've got like we've got we've got two different horizontal directions and we've got the up and down all right and and so that's that gives you like six different directions for information to go so it's like these are so like it's like um, oh I was gonna I was trying just throw I was trying to throw spin in there.

49:22
I will spend yeah, so yeah, so how would spin work again but um, I mean different people. Believe it. I usually think of it as that internal push-out word or pull inward or but I think it's you know, it's usually spin up or spin down but. So I think there's eight I think there's eight instead of six directions so okay I'm choosing I'm choosing right now to think of it as eight rather than six because I'm thinking that there's like an internal compass okay, so yeah, so I'm thinking I'm thinking okay, so not only do we have like six different directions plus two additional directions for spin, so maybe there's maybe okay, well we'll just say okay, there's like six to eight directions, okay because we've got spin which I don't really understand what what you mean, but maybe type that down so so so spin it's been would give you a traditional directions.

50:19
It's just one value so but yeah, okay, so there's six different directions, okay that it all has to yeah. I'm sorry. I I should have kept that little internal tangent more internal apologies nice that's fine, but so I was just gonna try to complicate the picture anyways so so then we were hearing today that we've got things happening that we've got oscillations happening on multiple timescale, so the brains operating are multiple timescales, so so, um, I don't know exactly what that means.

50:54
In terms of like is are the multiple timescales sort of like. Happening at at every layer of the cortex you know layers like one through six, if you're going to divide it up that way are there multiple times go there or are the multiple time scales like, you know, like the brain like the brainstem might be the this the the start of the brainstem might be the slowest like he was saying like the brain involved to have like a slower time scale and then over time as you get up to the neocortex the time scale it gets faster right it sort of like an evolutionary site a perspective that he brought up in the book was that that when We were when you know, if you go back in time organisms, didn't we need didn't need to move very fast they need to need to move very much because the food was plentiful and in life was easy and as things got as things got harder organisms became much more highly coordinated and had much bigger brains because it had to trial a lot harder to get food.

52:02
I mean, I feel like that would just be too easy to say that each each kind of layer has its own. I just feel like that would be too easy. I feel like it has to be more complicated than that like each zone if you want to call it that is operating at multiple, you know what I mean, okay.

52:24
I mean well I'm saying this is this is so I mean it it you know beyond theory so much someone may have already like I've done the research on this in so that so I don't know if anyone in the room knows but but we may be at this this may be a paper that's already been done.

52:39
So let me just make a note to figure out yeah if you're gonna laugh. Yeah, so see you soon the question is does the brain operate on multiple? Time scales. Vary between layers or between.

53:08
Functional regions the same. Or between old brain. And new brain so this these are questions to look up so we don't have an answer today assembly yeah and then and then of course, you know, so this there's a we were talking about the other day that there's. See what who's the guy there's a guy who he's got this new technology that's super cool he's in clubhouse and and he was in the last podcast that I that I recorded.

53:42
And he was saying that. He was saying that he's got this new sensor technology that can. It can detect. Basically it can it can identify DNA can identify have virus by DNA by like if blasting it out with an electromagnetic wave blasting it within like electromagnetic wave and that that EM wave is going to.

54:11
He was saying that it's going to the heat so yeah, so he was saying that basically the em waves can can change the temporal spatial and phase characteristics of of bacteria viruses and DNA. And. That and and because of that principle he's able to basically use electromagnetism to detect DNA, so he's going to so he's going to involve a device he's he's invented device that he says will be able to detect you know, you put your finger on it and it can tell you if you have.

54:53
A virus a very specific virus everyone it's been the topic of news for the past couple years right you do you remember who this is or if they have their own club or anything yeah yeah no, um, yeah, he's uh, He's a uh, he doesn't have them club he has some company he's got it on patents he does not have his own clothes because that's trivial when you're when you're this guy yeah, it's kind of his company's like raising hundreds of hundreds of millions of dollars something like that, but um, Is fans should make him a club thing.

55:27
Well his interns. Yeah, I think All right, well you can make him a club. I might Twitter is down at the moment. So your trailer up. But I have him I have him on my computer and if somebody message I'll send a send you is info when my my stuff is back online.

55:50
Okay, let me see if I can get to rent to the final of the notes. Oscillations allow for temporal predictions. That was something I better like, oh yeah, of course. How are you gonna make a temporal prediction if if there's no oscillation, right? That means it's like yeah, if you're not if you're if you remember your memories are not temporarily active, how are you gonna make a time-based prediction?

56:14
Just I feel like there's like a self-esteem it's a statement that seems like it's true like with you don't need to prove it like self-evident seems like a self-evident statement. We hold these truths to be self of. It that oscillations allow for temporal predictions. So by the owner who takes us money, right?

56:38
All right moving on so the brain states are labile and I said what is lab biome self-organized state is lava means self-organized data, or what does it mean? Let me look this up. How's another thing you said? Okay. Open change readily changeable or unstable. Fluctuating wildly or decomposing readily.

57:05
So the brain states are. Open to change or go with that. That's interesting because he says yeah, they're unstable but they're also a self-organized state, okay. All right. Yeah, I get it. So the brain dynamically. Hmm, okay. Yeah sure we'll go that. Yeah, I mean, I think he mentioned that the old idea is they don't it's meant old ID and now it's kind of a new idea that the brain is always on on the edge or the brain is always like.

57:39
It's always at the at the tipping point like. Basically like, you know, if you have like a,

57:51
If you have like a like like sand on a hill and all it takes is like one more one more. Grain of sand and you get the outlet right like an avalanche of sand and so the rain is always moving towards that tipping point so it can react quickly to incoming data.

58:12
So so so yeah, so he was like yeah, so the brain has all this oscillation happen. I'll just regularity happening and all these like regular patent patterns, which is something I read about in another book. Work basically, you know, he was saying yeah, it looks people are saying that that was happening temporally, sorry.

58:32
I'm sorry what was happening. On the on the the tonic scale of things basically between like zero and 200 hertz there's a lot of a lot of tonic oscillations that don't they don't seem like they they might contain information they might they might seem like they're like, they're made of pink noise right like the one ever F spectrum you might they seem like well there's not there's not how could this contain information which is a lot of regular regular firing patterns right you think about it, well yes, all this oscillation is very regular and if you try to change one the activity of one neuron the rest of the neurons pull it back into alignment, and if You go if it gets if it's faster or slower they the the oscillator does not know you can't you can't get away from us you have to like so give these large groups of neurons that are all managing the same oscillation, okay, well when does information happen right if it's just like this this like, When when does the brain react to to to but so, I mean, I guess you have to start you have to start there at the at the base of understanding the brain and the sort of like, Have a lot of us as like a lot of oscillating patterns that that is there that are ready for information to happen, they're ready to react information right and and that's like in in that is.

59:56
Powerful idea. But I think I think I think it's one that you want to like sit and think about it the idea of the brain is being of like a fast clock but it's got this time division because time division would work best, oh there was this point that he made that so so yeah he was saying the idea he's just is the ideally if you were to do it if you're designed the brain from scratch like an artificial brain, maybe the idea would be that if that you'd have a fast clock.

01:00:27
In a time division feature because that would work best. But by contrast he's saying that fast faster oscillators were added after to two the slower oscillators because of how evolution happened and this is what we call as my note that we're covered what we've talked about a little while ago, another point that he brought up if he was like versus like it's one of those it's another one of those statements it sounds kind of like obvious but I never thought of it until he said it and he says like computation always means that information computation the brain means that always means and information is moving from one place to another.

01:01:06
And like when he said I was like, yes that's obvious but I never thought of that computation always means information is moved from one place to another. Is that weird momentum is a powerful thing so like that's that's interesting because like okay, so if you're gonna have information, you're gonna computation happening, you're something movement needs to be happening.

01:01:31
So if you're if you have oscillations happening all the time that could be like what you need as a minimum for further to be like live information happening in your brain all the time. And and like I think like I'm saying these things and they sound so obvious it's so simple but I didn't think of them.

01:01:51
I mean, like didn't think I didn't think of this exact phrase like it like yeah, of course it seems obvious but that phrase and it hadn't come in. So this is like, I love this book. Okay, so I think that we're about the robot at the end. So Mark Penton and reason that if we found a quantifiable relationship among the power bands came versus theta.

01:02:15
And the fast oscillation 140 to inference. So yeah, so let's skip that phase lock and statistics. And David Cohen First magnet, oh yeah so this is interesting. I the the guy who discovered the MEG was David Cohen the he discovered the first magnetic waves of the brain the exhibit all in the acetyl area of the brain.

01:02:41
So that was a note that I made just for for the neurophysics group because one of the things I've done for the neurophysis group is like, you know talking about some of the some of the basically creating a map of some of the the the researchers who were made major who had a major impact in history.

01:03:02
Lands for that for that group. And so, this is this again, this is like such a good book. And if you checked my Twitter earlier and followed me on Twitter, you've got some good information today, and I generally post good information there, so you know follow if you want.

01:03:22
I think it's about it for the night though because I think it's it's past bedtime for me and I want to say thanks to everybody for showing up and hanging out and if you anyone wants to raise your hand, you can come up and say something but we're going close to the group otherwise in a couple minutes.

01:03:40
Thank you everybody. Well, thanks for doing this. I've downloaded the book. I am going to have more time to sit down and pick through the notes that you've posted. I really appreciate it. All right. So, I think someone came on up. So someone's here you go ahead and speak.

01:04:02
So someone can't soak in tweak. Hi guys, hi. Yeah, thanks for the yes. I'm listening to you and it's like totally in your language for me it's it's quite an interesting stuff. I just been to I to a different room and somebody just said about a website. It's like elfstein top digital human dot humans.com where you can actually have a conversation with Iceland and the like that could be thinking because like first of all, you're.

01:04:38
Like. Your knowledge guys. It's amazing and I'm just I'm working for the past year. I've been working for on on a new method of taking English language to Polish people. I'm part of myself living in Edinburgh and for some time. I I've been thinking about the possibility of creative maybe something like AI or or something like that to and to be able, you know to replicate a human being you know, and to upload all the English language and to allow people to actually.

01:05:16
Learn but I I wasn't you know, I I I didn't think that it's possible. And so, I make it I I think is it is it if I don't know if it's the correct way of us if your name solament. I could you know, what would what would you think?

01:05:37
Is there something like how? How this AI work and is it possible from the you know, the from from coding point of view, you know to create something like that. Thanks one. Hey, you're asked me if it's possible to create a sentence sentient. AI. Doesn't think you'll think that it's it's important to add to us to ask the right question.

01:06:05
I think is your I'm I know too little to to ask the correct question because I don't even know what the sentient AI means, so does the so maybe it's too early for me to just jump. And ask for some of the questions. Yeah, yeah, no, I feel like from for most people it's to earth that they don't they don't know what a great thing to ask is what is it?

01:06:28
What's the conscious AI what's an emotionally and where artificial intelligence what's an artificial general intelligence, what's a a self-aware network. What is a what is an intelligent robot what's I robot like these are all like yeah, nobody knows like I mean, I don't think nobody like I have an idea but a lot of people have no idea and So.

01:06:58
Maybe.

01:07:04
So would you be able? To see some groups, you know on faceobok that you recommended to you you are admin of.

01:07:18
Some resources on your own articles or or submitted channels or or something that works where I.

01:07:34
Could possibly. Can I think of an idea?

01:07:44
Yeah yeah well so I mean to be 100% realistic you're gonna want to know basically everything about neuroscience and everything about deep learning you want you want to know who all the the the leading scientists are neuroscience and what the what their work was and all of the the the biggest names and computational neuroscience and indeed in deep learning specifically you want to know who yelling couldn't is who different it is who yet Joshua Benjio is, Who Jeff Hocking is you want to know like who Olaf sports is and David Igleman and you know, there's like yeah basically it's a get it's like the last just you want to know the last you want to really get somebody the last two hundred years of neuroscience in the last 20 years of of deep learning and and and every subject that's in between you could definitely check out my neurophysics group on on faceobok for starters, and and look at the the files that I should.

01:08:54
Hear there and the links that I've shared there you could start that way but but in general yeah it's it's not if there's nothing that I that I can ignore there's nothing that I can go. I'm learning from literally like, you know, all of science for the past since the beginning of science is like yeah, you have to like it's not I don't think there's any shortcut who pray you're gonna need to that that's my that's my so that's that's I mean if I'm a hundred percent realistic if you're gonna build a really sentient.

01:09:28
Intelligent emotionally intelligent self-aware robot conscious mind. Machine just to thrive a bunch of you know verbs in a funny way you're gonna need to know everything and that's that's my that's my belief, so you study for 20 years and yeah, no shortcuts.

01:10:00
My mica.

01:10:17
No I have an idea about what I want to do and obviously. The health problem changing. About this, you know, so I put together like 30,000 and 30,000 people.

01:10:42
Just in case like in general. I just would like to get into it from my handsome photography of understanding better notes. Myself you don't have me so sure. To start.

01:11:03
I could ask more intelligent quests, for example, you next time will be. Well I what I would do is. Definitely one of them one of the most exciting companies because you mentioned ear you want the sort of thirty thousand fifty thousand foot view as a potential investor in these technologies to understand what the options are available in the business sense for someone to get on board with one of the most exciting companies in in the world might be like deep minds and they're they're part of Google.

01:11:44
And awesome the question so have great day you too have a good night. And we're getting closer there, thank you everybody good night.
