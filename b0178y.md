Scientists previously thought of gamma waves as essen

Through the other idea that I have is to look into how the the wrinkling of the cortex might be scattering and focusing electricity or electromagnetic. Electromagnetism or our specifically magnetism. How is how are the the solek? And the gokai refocusing, the brain in terms of it's electrical and acoustical and magnetic.

00:39

And yeah in terms of it's electrical acoustical and magnetic moments, how is this the energy scattered and refocused? And you can say that oscillations are doing some directing of focusing and we have and when you know neurons TV from the oscillation they're causing a disturbances in that focus changes that the whole oscillator the alden runs in the oscillator are tracking because that whole oxider is pulling the deviating neuron back into an oscillating pattern.

01:20

That's the key reason, why the oscillator is as aware of deviating neuro patterns by knowledge is actually started a higher level of oscillator, but but it's also key reason why the largest dipoles of the brain are

01:41

And essence. It's the brain doing macroscopic, loading on what individual sections of the brain are doing so. So the brain is learning patterns that become invariant to cortical columns pilot higher level patterns because the whole brains are in those patterns. So the brain can be like a dynamic player like an orchestra player, where every piece in the orchestra knows how the orchestra is supposed to be played, it knows its own part and an orchestra, but also can pay attention to the orchestra as it's being played so that it's ready to play.

It's part at the right time. So human beings. Have solved consciousness multiple times, but not not putting together. The whole picture yet pieces of it have been sort of discarded and lost and forgotten, and poor side, plus scientists. But there's been, there's, there's, you know, with the rediscovery of 40 hertz frequencies in late 60s or early 70s that had been so gamma herds had been discovered and in lost and then rediscovered, it and relate sixes or the seven years actually just like 60s and it was stopped for a while.

03:22

Okay, well maybe gamma frequencies are responsible for for consciousness, but there's not it, but there's not, that was discovered but the whole picture of how it worked wasn't sort of put together at that point. So that was kind of like, yeah, that's an idea. But there's a lot of like still.

03:42

Like we don't understand what that means though. And maybe. But yeah. So this is like already speculated and then like, of course, there's ideas been revisited but I'm in this book, I'm arguing. It's actually right? And it's frank. But here's the rest of the story.
