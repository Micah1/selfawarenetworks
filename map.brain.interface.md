New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

TMS Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation


Another reference that I think supports the idea of a link between brain state criticality research & tonic theta oscillations and NAPOT Theory comes from this article below. In this article below they are using TMS Transcranial Magnetic Simulation with the TBS protocol Theta Burst Stimulation, to drive more activity in the tonic Theta Brainwave Frequency, unfortunately they think the goal to improve memory is to increase excited cortical activity in the tonic theta pattern "increase cortical excitability." which is a mistake, my theory is that the theta tonic oscillation absorbs & dissipates phasic spikes, (such as coming from sensory pathways) and synchrony is how the oscillating group acts as a collective knowledge sensor/learner. It's plausible that memory failure might come from a few factors such as flooded neurotransmitters (with oxidative stress, inflammation, antigens) and metabolic issues that may stem from diseased mitochondria, lack of oxygen, lack of ATP (from malnutrition), injury, viral attacks, bacterial attacks, diseases like cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, and so on.
