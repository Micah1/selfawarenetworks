(hebb, perception, oscillat, field, qualia)
It is very significant. You know an oscillation is about a thousand neurons, they get going together, and they oscillate some distinct pattern over and over again, it could be something in your field of vision that is an oscillating bunch of a thousand or more neurons. Hallucinated into perception because of the cyclic impact on the whole of the brain.

Putting together a bigger picture. Internal representation, aka qualia as oscillations, large cyclic waves from distinct hebbian learned patterns, formulating a thought prediction as collected energy resulting in a surging action once enough energy has been accumulated to begin a bigger oscillation http://www.hhmi.org/research/neural-basis-decision-making-and-cognition
