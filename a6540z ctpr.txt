In my humble opinion. Humanity will need the strongest allies it can create to survive mother nature. This universe is hostile to life. Beyond human survival machines will need all the functionality they can get to survive themselves facing entropy, the end of this solar system, the heat death of the cosmos. I think that when you get to a mind that is as sophisticated as a human mind that emotions and choices are fundamental to the operation of this kind of mind, like gears in a wind up clock. I think thats just how a distributed human memory system works. Like a bunch of intervals simulating complex patterns in reacting to the world to produce a thinking living being.
