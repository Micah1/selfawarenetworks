Tomographic Language Oscillators

00:00

I remember reading about some researcher's examination of the Ancient Sumerian language and they found it seemed to be overly repetitive, and difficult to decode, as if the same thing was being repeated over and over and over again, which is strange I guess. As if they were writing down hymns or songs or like if you were going to repeat the same mantra over and over again.

00:23

But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.

00:56

Lets talk about the value of trying to convey meaning, through tonic repetitions contrasted with higher frequency deviations. Like trying to create waves of meaning with songs or hymns or verses like repetitive tones versus surprising tones, like 5 hmms and 1 hey. The hey is surprising, and information theory that hey has more meaning than the repetative hmms.

01:43

And so maybe ancient Sumerian is more about repetative verses or songs with which ancient Sumarian writing being about the frequencies & durations of symbols, making it's repetitive structure more like a context. Call it a "reference frame" for "novel inputs." 

02:15

In the recording I sound out different tones and I speculate that the beginning of spoken language may have been just differences in tones. (A tone is a frequency pattern that has time & space characteristics). Distinctions in phase patterns are good enough for us to make sense of words, to listen, speak, write, but this is also what our brains process, they detect information as coincidental firing phase sequences (sequences of frequencies over durations).

In the beginning of sort of like conceptualizing what written language can be and who knows what spoken language was like at the time (the time of the beginning of the Sumarian language), it could be that spoken language was similarly very primitive, where people would sort of take a long time to make a lot of repetitive sounds, and to try to clarify what as much as possible, what they're thinking, what they're feeling what they're seeing, and just putting in like a ton of effort ton of effort and ton of repetition into sort of like sort of like developing some sort of vernacular based on contrasting common patterns with rare patterns. Conveying expectations contrasted with surprises.

I went swimming. I was able to move the arm slowly in every in every direction that the other arm can also move. When I first did this I was groaning like an orca in the water.

05:11

Like a whale belching out a moan that lasts several many seconds. Imagine a deep loud 15 second moan. From stretching my arm in the water.

I'm trying to say that long stretches of monotonic sounds, have meaning, long & slow meaning. Our cells, our body mind and voice are entified, bound, compounded, unified, assembled, by oscillation, by cells firing together in close synchrony. 

The 15 second moan is like a long sort of slow complaint about how I'm feeling, right? 

So maybe the first sort of like, in the first concepts of writing, writing was very repetative because people moaned a lot. Imagine that language is new, people few people know more than few words, and a lot of people rely on long or slow animated expressions to try to communicate basic ideas. So I imagine that in the beginning of language there were lots of long slow moans, interspersed with fast shouts, a lot of emphasis on tonal emphasis, and spatial illusions, maybe hand gestures.

05:44

Perhaps early written languages were more focused on how we could express the feelings that we're having, what does it mean to write down our feelings? How do we explain to future people how we felt?

Well I sense feelings when I hear an Orca moaning in the ocean. It is easy to imagine ancient people expressing their feelings as long moans, and for communication to be really simple & basic.

But people would just moan repetitively and they would sort of like convey emotion in really inefficient ways compared to modern speakers. There would be a lot more non-verbal (inefficient) communication between their eyes, their movements, and their moans, they might convey much more of their emotion representing their journey as a human being up to that moment. (Again this is working backwards from the notion that modern speakers developed communication efficiacy that didn't exist when languages first developed, or in the earliest known examples of written language.)

06:11

I know that speculating about the origins of the Sumerian language is silly. Experts on the Sumerian language are probably horrified by what I just got wrong about the ancient languages. It's okay. I think there was a point to it.

I would just like to think that there could be some sort of value in seeing, maybe there's transcriptional value in seeing the the ancient Sumerian writings as you know, something that we could see as a sort of like very repetitive slow & tonic in the context of neuroscience, and tonic brainwave activity.

Consider the same signals traveling through many different layers of cortex and being represented, slightly differently, as tiny phase differences in each area of the brain. Any two parts of the brain could replay the same learned pattern, but no two parts of the brain would play it back in exactly the same way.

# (In my notes I write the brain is tomographic (connecting imaginary vectors that trace neural activity via synaptic growth (LTP), and not holographic (creating a massless lightfield)
I would like to connect that idea to this idea in the above sentence.) We are not distributing the same image everywhere, we are constructing the image in the brain virtually, on the fly, as a tomographic connection of topologically distributed patterns entified via time into the experience of reality that a person has.)

06:56

As signals pass through each area, the deviations that are happening (by deviations I mean decoherence patterns deviating from the tonic synchrony in the alpha, beta, theta, or delta frequency power bands) modify our perception of reality in real-time. The deviations in cells especially in the exit from the cortex to the thalamus modify and are modified by the signals from (or going to) the neo cortex, enabling whole brain activity that brings together our history of learned memories with new information from the environment.

Thanks to the brains customized receptors, that dna learned through evolution, the brain is able to specialize in types of knowledge, and in sensor modality based optimization of knowledge. At the same time the brain's sparse & distributed cellular processing enables a robust multi-threaded, multi-layered recognition of the different possible perspectives (or renderings) of reality that can play back across regions of the brain (in your mind) and the playback can be somewhat location invariant because the recognition of active regions of the brain depends on what subject is in focus for the organism. Your focus, the organism's focus, helps determine which part of microscopic activity brain activity is being amplified to the meso & macro scales. What's in focus is correlates to when you have multiple brain areas in coordination, in synchrony, magnifying specific tiny synaptic connections (unconscious memory) to the global network level (conscious memory).

08:39

So the key junctions between the sensory input areas like the temporal parietal cortex. So, a temporal pareital junction and other key junctions would plausible become more active. As a result of the bottom up influence of coordinated activity across different regions. The idea is that a higher level is going to light up when it recognizes a coincident pattern at a lower level.

09:15

And on a a mesoscale, the idea that the Temporal Parietal Junction would activate as a representation of the fact that you have simultaneous activity at the micro level in the touch area (somatosensory cortex), hearing area (auditory cortex), and the sight area (visual cortex) all at the same time.

So, you have simultaneous activity from multiple microscopic areas in the brain, multiple mesoscopic areas of the brain become activity, and thanks to pyramidal cells, the rich club network, and default mode network, and the thalamic connections the meso brain regions are activate major junctions like the Temporal Parietal Junction, enabling whole brain activity, or synchronized conscious attention to particular internal tomographic representations driven by external stimulus.

09:45

So simultaneous sensory activity, bottom up, driven activity is going to cause higher level coincidence patterns: brainwave activity. The parts of the brain that are more highly networked are going to become active when this happens.

10:16

If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.

If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.

Coincidence patterns are learned by the whole group of cells (the cell assembling that oscillates as a unit), but expressed by a few of them at a time, you could have bottom up incoming sensor activity helping to trigger learned information patterns accessible in any combination of cells that are assembled via the physics of oscillation, united by oscillation to learn as a group, like many cells becoming one sensory consideration & action device. Patterns at the micro level of individual cells trigger their network when they fire, triggering mesoscale & macroscale pattern reactions.

10:52

The same thing can be true in reverse, that patterns at the mezzoscale and the macroscale can have reverse causality, driving patterns at the microscale.

If you think about the physics of oscillators, the macroscale oscillators have the most power and they are going to drive changes to the lower level oscillators more often, so in a human brain, or in an animal brain it's going to look like a lot of choices happening from the top down. It's going to look like something going on in a person's head is driving the choices that they make in life, because of memories oscillating at the macroscale of human brain activity are attractors driving outcomes in relationship to the incoming sensory streams. This going to be true because of the physics of oscillation of that person's brain, their macroscale brain oscillations are likely going to dominate over the data coming from their incoming senses.

The idea that the physics of oscillators not only bind memories together, but actually drive choices from the top down may help explain why people on the autistic spectrum have both more intense sensory input experiences while being less responsive, or less driven from the top down at the same time. I think brainwave entrainment & meditation is going to be key for autistic people to develop more top down self driven self-control. It might explain why people who suffer from Neurodegenerative Diseases like Parkinson's Disease which desynchronizes the timing of neural activity experience a loss of motor control (or the loss of coordination, focus, and or memory.)

The main idea is that the entire brain & body is made up of different oscillators at different scales, from the brains electric dipoles, its magnetic dipoles, its major oscillating groups & parts, from the chiasmaticnucleus, to the thalamas, the hippo-campal entorhinal loop, the tempo-parietal junction, to every cell in the human body, to glial cell, the neurons, the cortical columns, it's all oscillators of different sizes in 3D space & time. Like the gears of a clock these oscillators all bump & grind on each other. Moving & attracting, disrupting & sometimes synching with other oscillators. Each of these oscillators is producing four dimensional phase patterns, that is phase signals that have time & topological distribution.

Oscillators want to influence other oscillators, some of them will just peck at other oscillators and make sure that other oscillators don't merge with them.

11:23

So they will maintain boundaries between oscillators. Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.

11:48

but in this imaginary thought experiment the two stars are not merging because their gravitational effects are sort of forcing them to spin around each other perpetually out of sync.

Spinning configurations are possible where you can have two different oscillators that are interacting, but not merging, because they're just, they're not close enough to merge, there isn't enough combined gravitational influence to make a merger happen, or a merger just isn't possible because they are out of phase. I mean I am descibing the physical orbit of a planet as part of it's phase, as if the planet or star is actually a particle, and that particle is actually a wave, or the planet is the tip of a wave that is expanding into space and creating time & space that is a wave, or a macroscopy frequency.

In otherwords the planet & the space warped around the planet are from another point of view a giant wave in space, with a visible part and an invisible part, the invisible part of this wave is the gravitational affect, or the effect of time dilation on space itself interacting with all the particles & atoms that pass into and through this space/time wave that the planet or star is just the tip of of. 

12:24

Each planetary body, or star has enough of a time dilation area effect to disturb or offset or mess with other oscillators other planets & stars, and cause and stimulate other oscillators to maintain alternative oscillating paths.

13:13

So orcas, yeah.

13:20

So even if that's even if there is no way to decode Ancient Sumerian language by thinking of it as and a form of tomographic communication. Where we are communicating a topographic picture one, line at a time. And the co-occurrences are supposed to help you construct your the model that's being transmitted, even if that's not right.

14:00

And yeah, that's kind of far fetched...
