""It isn't ever entirely a dream world, nor another reality apart from this"

It is one thing to be in the dream and totally unconscious that you are in a dream, and it is another thing to be involved in the dream and yet wakeful about it."

I'm not dream at all, I'm awake to the nature of thought and awareness being delusion. In the eastern mysticism many think they can separate thought from the visual awareness, and in Tibetan's when they meditate the occipital lobes (visual cortex) is far more active than in the Western meditators. Because the Tibetan's do not consider visual thoughts to be thoughts, they think it's instead awareness.

So both visual awareness, and thinking are the same thing, this I know from very recent research into the human brain. The eastern mystics have always been partially awake in the dream to think their thoughts and awareness were two different things.

So it is another thing entirely to be awake to that reality that all your thoughts, and all your awareness, is by it's very nature delusion, no matter  how accurate and precise awareness seems, it's still delusion. Such is it's nature.
