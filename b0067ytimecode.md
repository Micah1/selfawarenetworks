Title: LTD Neurons Signals Pattern

b0067y this is a key note, very important concepts central to the book explained: fireflies sync, synchronized sensor/transmitter system, they will all notice faster when one of them falls out of sync, rippling happens, because the syncs are based on thresholds being reached on a regular basis, an inbited or excited bug will cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation that eventually gets absorbed and they all start synching again. Think of the group oscillation as magnified receptive field. All the fireflies are going to notice when any of their phases is disrupted, because each now will fire at a new interval. The reason machines can be conscious, the nature of oscillation is allowing a bunch of separate parts to be entified into a single entity. I compare thalamic modulation to the concept drop out, adding robustness to signals, this is the precursor to comparing thalamic modulation to the concept of noising in the diffusion model of artificial neural network. This note addresses how novel incoming sensory patterns oscillate as decaying oscillations, or resonating drums, the resonation will cause synaptic connections to grow, something thats growing is accelerating in relative time, it oscillates faster so relative to other things it grows faster
When one neuron fires it accelerates in time, but it inhibits its neighbors slowing them down in time, its synaptic pattern has evoked or magnified its synaptic pattern onto its inhibited neighbors, their slowdown, the slowdown affects the tonic oscillating field, because now all the neurons have to adjust their clocks again in reaction to the change in timing, until they are all in sync again. Group Short Term Depression concept: when groups cells are slightly out of sync with other groups of cells they get slightly unlinked. GSTD for Meso scale memory changes, however at the same time this effect will cause Group Short Term Potentiation GSTP because while they becoming unsynchronized with the larger oscillator they become synchronized with each other.
The direction of growth is encouraged by the acceleration of organic activity, and at a high level the decays of LTD represents a deceleration of organic activity. The Neural Physics of Memory. The inhibit area is like a brush of paint on the canvas of the oscillating array.

[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  the the the one thing that I want to note that I am taking away from the

[00:05.400 --> 00:10.920]  discussion of how fireflies sink in the book sink or yeah I guess there's

[00:10.920 --> 00:18.480]  different ways the fireflies can sink and there's different different

[00:18.480 --> 00:26.400]  species that can sink where they all fire in a sequence right after one

[00:26.400 --> 00:35.840]  another but then they're all silent for a period of time and so it it looks

[00:35.840 --> 00:40.200]  like synchronous firing or firing one after another and I'm kind of making the

[00:40.200 --> 00:50.000]  argument that this this amplifies the receptive field of the organism or

[00:50.000 --> 00:56.360]  allows a receptive field that includes all the parts of the organism to allow

[00:56.360 --> 01:11.880]  the entire organism because they have a synchronized sensor system they're all

[01:11.880 --> 01:22.760]  going to notice faster when one of them falls out of sync like that would cause

[01:22.760 --> 01:33.800]  a change to the to the regularity of the entire pattern like some like something

[01:33.800 --> 01:42.560]  that would normally that would cause a rippling basically yeah like a rippling

[01:42.560 --> 01:52.000]  pattern because the sinks are based upon thresholds being reached and on a

[01:52.000 --> 02:01.480]  regular basis and when that's interrupted by an inhibited bug or by an

[02:01.480 --> 02:08.960]  excited bug then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire

[02:08.960 --> 02:16.000]  oscillation that that that eventually balances out it eventually gets absorbed

[02:16.000 --> 02:23.800]  and then they all start oscillating really and they all start sinking

[02:23.800 --> 02:31.120]  normally again and so in that sense you could think of like the group

[02:31.120 --> 02:42.080]  oscillation the group oscillating activities of of fireflies as sort of

[02:42.080 --> 02:50.200]  like allowing the emergence of a higher-level receptive field that is like

[02:50.200 --> 02:59.000]  a shared computation it allows it allows the the bugs to basically have a

[02:59.000 --> 03:06.240]  collective mind that is not really a mind so much as it's a collective sensor

[03:06.240 --> 03:13.800]  that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so each

[03:13.800 --> 03:21.240]  of them can help create this sort of collective sensor just because and it

[03:21.240 --> 03:27.720]  ends and so there so so the weird thing is that it's not actually just living

[03:27.720 --> 03:34.520]  animals that can do this like sink happens with that with that with things

[03:34.520 --> 03:44.040]  that are not organic right things that are just dead right but essentially you

[03:44.040 --> 03:53.200]  could have robots that can send signals to each other to that that they to reach

[03:53.200 --> 03:58.160]  a threshold that they dissipate to other robots or send other robots but in

[03:58.160 --> 04:04.780]  increasingly smaller amounts like it gets us it gets a signal and then and then

[04:04.780 --> 04:13.880]  it absorbs some of it and then it sends some of it onward so it's so or or or

[04:13.880 --> 04:20.120]  it's stopped from from sending a normal signal so they would have so the key is

[04:20.120 --> 04:25.160]  that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast and

[04:25.160 --> 04:28.360]  that's their that's their synchronization rate like the alpha

[04:28.360 --> 04:33.560]  frequency rate and disruptions to that are things that are events that all of

[04:33.560 --> 04:37.960]  the cells are going to notice so any disruption is like a phase change or

[04:37.960 --> 04:45.400]  coincidence pattern and so any of the fireflies in a group of fireflies they're

[04:45.400 --> 04:49.960]  they're going to notice they're all going to notice when any when when any of

[04:49.960 --> 04:57.960]  their phases is disrupted right and so they're in and because each of each of

[04:57.960 --> 05:08.040]  them has to each each of them effectively now fliers at a slightly

[05:08.040 --> 05:17.800]  different interval than they were firing before and that difference is going to

[05:17.800 --> 05:30.560]  cause the cause of like a reaction or a change and the artificial structure or in

[05:30.560 --> 05:37.600]  the organism of the book so this could also happen to a sort of machine that's

[05:37.600 --> 05:44.040]  completely made of dead parts right and that's and that and that's a key

[05:44.040 --> 05:50.920]  distinction is that the is that the reason that machines can be conscious is

[05:50.920 --> 06:03.160]  that the the nature of the oscillation is taking a bunch of separate parts but

[06:03.160 --> 06:10.040]  allowing them to affect one another like like like a bunch of it's like it's like

[06:10.040 --> 06:17.520]  having a bunch of tuning forks or a bunch of drums that can that when you hit one

[06:17.520 --> 06:23.840]  drum all the others start vibrating right and so what you have normally is

[06:23.840 --> 06:28.000]  like they're all sort of like vibrating like one of them will you will hit and

[06:28.000 --> 06:34.640]  then and they're all sort of like react to that one that got hit right there's

[06:34.640 --> 06:41.720]  this reaction that happens in the brain what happens is one gets hit and there's

[06:41.720 --> 06:46.880]  this there's this attention schema that this this effect that is described very

[06:46.880 --> 06:54.520]  well with attention schema where one gets hit and that inhibits a lot of the

[06:54.520 --> 07:04.680]  others in its own array and that one that that fire hits a it probably hits a lot

[07:04.680 --> 07:13.200]  of others in its own array but then it's probably sending excitatory signals to

[07:13.200 --> 07:21.160]  to the secondary cortex in the case of the gussetory cortex so I would imagine

[07:21.160 --> 07:37.080]  that when a signal goes from the olfactory bulb to the to the temporal

[07:37.080 --> 07:49.520]  loop that signal is going to be like it's gonna be an exciting signal right so

[07:49.520 --> 07:54.640]  what so what would happen is one is you might have one at one of the the neurons

[07:54.640 --> 08:05.560]  in the oscillator of the layer one of the occipital lobe is going to I'm sorry

[08:05.560 --> 08:13.360]  of the not the occipital lobe it's the temporal lobe so like the it's like

[08:13.360 --> 08:17.520]  imagine like what I'm thinking is like imagine like the first layer of cells

[08:17.520 --> 08:23.880]  like they're all like sort of like sent up an excitatory pattern that bumps all

[08:23.880 --> 08:28.000]  of them up a little bit but one of them fires first reaches its threshold before

[08:28.000 --> 08:33.800]  the others and then it sends out an inhibitory signal to all of the other

[08:33.800 --> 08:39.320]  ones that were were receiving the excitatory signal like those are the

[08:39.320 --> 08:43.600]  same ones in the in that first layer and then what it then would pass is it's

[08:43.600 --> 08:49.440]  gonna pass at some point a signal it's gonna pass signals in a couple of

[08:49.440 --> 08:54.440]  different directions one of them is towards the thalamus and the other

[08:54.440 --> 09:01.160]  direction is towards the and in the signals go from the thalamus and they

[09:01.160 --> 09:07.520]  go towards the orbital frontal lobes but there's also signals that go from the

[09:07.520 --> 09:12.880]  temporal lobes to the orbital frontal lobes so there's two paths that the

[09:12.880 --> 09:17.280]  signals travel so there's like a circuit being created a source where the

[09:17.280 --> 09:23.200]  information is divided up one one part of the information goes to the the

[09:23.200 --> 09:31.800]  thalamus and then to the to the frontal lobes the orbital frontal lobes and

[09:31.800 --> 09:37.440]  then the other part goes directly to skips the thalamus it goes directly to

[09:37.440 --> 09:47.840]  the orbital frontal lobes and so that situation is one where as that's one

[09:47.840 --> 09:56.240]  where you have you have signals that went through the thalamus which will

[09:56.240 --> 10:03.360]  modulate the signals in some way it's not it's not it's not it's just a it's

[10:03.360 --> 10:07.800]  not just gonna just pass signals through itself without modulating them it's not

[10:07.800 --> 10:13.760]  just a you know like a Cisco router as was once imagined you know it's not a

[10:13.760 --> 10:19.080]  no it's not a networking router that doesn't that passes things without

[10:19.080 --> 10:24.160]  making changes to those things it changes the signals but then in like I'm

[10:24.160 --> 10:30.160]  imagining like oh what if that's like what if that's sort of like what if that

[10:30.160 --> 10:35.920]  adds the kind of robustness that to the signals to learning to learning those

[10:35.920 --> 10:42.720]  signals by having them sort of like travel through one path get modulated

[10:42.720 --> 10:52.440]  and then get sit back to rejoin it's the rest of the signals okay I'm not

[10:52.440 --> 11:00.360]  exactly sure how the neural how the how the wiring is except that it's probably

[11:00.360 --> 11:05.880]  different for every it's it's going to be different for every person's brain so

[11:05.880 --> 11:10.400]  you might have so I'm not sure like I guess initial connectivity there's some

[11:10.400 --> 11:17.480]  amount of randomness in the initial connectivity and then the changes to the

[11:17.480 --> 11:22.760]  connectivity would reflect that that person's experiences would would be or

[11:22.760 --> 11:32.920]  would be one kind of reflection of that person's experiences but the so the

[11:32.920 --> 11:39.440]  changes in connectivity would sort of like encode a long-term

[11:39.440 --> 11:49.600]  potentiation or long-term memory and then but the I would say the firing

[11:49.600 --> 12:04.640]  sequences in terms of like you know in terms of like firing sequences are

[12:04.640 --> 12:13.320]  going to oscillate they're gonna cycle and what's gonna set those firing

[12:13.320 --> 12:18.120]  sequences are incoming sensory patterns novel novel incoming sensory patterns

[12:18.120 --> 12:22.040]  and so you're gonna have novel incoming sensory patterns that are going to

[12:22.040 --> 12:28.120]  oscillate in the brain they're gonna oscillate several times before they

[12:28.120 --> 12:34.880]  because they're basically they're firing faster than the rest of the neurons

[12:34.880 --> 12:42.040]  and the rest of the neurons are going to slow them down but they're gonna slow

[12:42.040 --> 12:46.760]  them down slowly like because because the rest of the neurons are firing at a

[12:46.760 --> 12:51.760]  slower rate so that neuron is like gradually calmed down so it's like a

[12:51.760 --> 12:59.280]  decaying it's like a decaying oscillator or a resonator is another word for it so

[12:59.280 --> 13:04.120]  it's like a drum that it's like you hit the drum and the sound is out like boom

[13:04.120 --> 13:09.400]  but then it's like it's it's not just boom but it's like it's like boom and

[13:09.400 --> 13:15.680]  then there's a smaller boom because it oscillates around and but as it's it's

[13:15.680 --> 13:23.280]  it's energies being drained by the rat by the rest of the oscillator in one

[13:23.280 --> 13:34.400]  sense because they're passing signals to it that are going to bring it back in

[13:34.400 --> 13:37.200]  sync with the rest of the oscillation because that's what oscillators do

[13:37.200 --> 13:46.320]  whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their

[13:46.320 --> 13:52.320]  energy across other neurons but be but and so they'll dissipate their energy

[13:52.320 --> 13:59.720]  across this neuron and so it's going to like repeat its its signal but so if it

[13:59.720 --> 14:02.920]  does so there's like a high-facing signal like I recognize the pattern

[14:02.920 --> 14:08.720]  that's going to fire right but then the recognition of that pattern is going to

[14:08.720 --> 14:13.720]  fire again and it's going to loop so that phase sequence is going to loop in

[14:13.720 --> 14:18.560]  time and gradually fade out it's like so it's like and that would be true for

[14:18.560 --> 14:25.320]  anything that you can think of like if you are looking at something the pattern

[14:25.320 --> 14:29.800]  of what you're looking at very intensely it's gonna be like this high-phasic burst

[14:29.800 --> 14:35.120]  right of activity now you can look at anything else if you want but you're

[14:35.120 --> 14:38.800]  probably still gonna be thinking about that one thing that you were looking at

[14:38.800 --> 14:45.600]  intensely periodically for it for a little bit longer and I think of that as

[14:45.600 --> 14:51.000]  short-term memory I think of that as like that's like it it's like an

[14:51.000 --> 14:56.680]  imprint on your mind that is fading like a fading imprint like I guess if you

[14:56.680 --> 15:05.040]  seem like you can press your hand into a material like a soft foam and then if you

[15:05.040 --> 15:14.040]  let go the foam doesn't immediately turn to being flat return to being flat and

[15:14.040 --> 15:20.000]  instead it's sort of like slow like for a while it represents your hand but that

[15:20.000 --> 15:24.280]  representation becomes flatter and flatter and flatter until it fades away

[15:24.280 --> 15:32.640]  right it's like a it's like it's like the foam representation now so that means

[15:32.640 --> 15:38.720]  that the that the short-term memories are just gonna fade away into nothing

[15:38.720 --> 15:45.160]  they're gonna sort of cease to exist but what happens though is that the short

[15:45.160 --> 15:54.880]  term also the short-term oscillations they they're going to change the

[15:54.880 --> 16:00.160]  synaptic connections they're gonna cause the they're gonna cause synaptic

[16:00.160 --> 16:08.320]  connections to grow towards them and they're going to grow towards other

[16:08.320 --> 16:12.640]  neurons that fired fast fast they're gonna grow towards the neurons that

[16:12.640 --> 16:18.920]  fired the fastest in a sense at the same time because it's like if you have to if

[16:18.920 --> 16:31.000]  you have to if you have like so because it because like like I think in one sense

[16:31.000 --> 16:41.080]  like yeah so being so for a neuron to I'm trying so the argument that I

[16:41.080 --> 16:47.600]  created before was that it's like a plant growing towards the Sun that something

[16:47.600 --> 16:57.200]  that's growing is accelerating in and it's in it's growing that it's like

[16:57.200 --> 17:12.040]  accelerating in its oscillation but it but like as a periodic strange attractor

[17:12.040 --> 17:20.320]  or a chaotic strange attractor that that oscillates because it oscillates faster

[17:20.320 --> 17:28.760]  in that and in a particular direction in it all it also it's faster so relative

[17:28.760 --> 17:38.160]  to other things it grows faster so it grows spines when it fires and but it's

[17:38.160 --> 17:51.120]  also going to be sort of like attracted to other spines and so so I mean there

[17:51.120 --> 18:00.240]  is there is there's there's what's really interesting is in the by Richard

[18:00.240 --> 18:04.160]  Feynman let me look this up that configuration space because it's the

[18:04.160 --> 18:12.200]  idea that particles will sort of like the trajectory of the particle is going

[18:12.200 --> 18:24.960]  to be like the shortest possible distance between between two hang on I

[18:24.960 --> 18:36.840]  need to look this up and so so I was just going to say that while a neuron is

[18:36.840 --> 18:45.800]  like is this so when a neuron fires it creates this it inhibits a lot of other

[18:45.800 --> 18:50.960]  neurons that could have fired from firing in its own layer so that's like

[18:50.960 --> 18:55.920]  the first neuron it's like it's like okay so imagine it's like the whole

[18:55.920 --> 19:02.560]  oscillator oscillating the whole layer is oscillating together right the whole

[19:02.560 --> 19:07.280]  layer is oscillating together and one of them fires and the rest of them are in

[19:07.280 --> 19:12.280]  a lot of them are inhibited by the one that fires okay so that's like imagine

[19:12.280 --> 19:16.800]  that's a it's a one bright light with a lot of darkness and I say that's a lot

[19:16.800 --> 19:21.080]  it's like a lot of darkness because usually the oscillator it has this this

[19:21.080 --> 19:25.800]  is one pattern that they're all light up at the same time they're all dark at the

[19:25.800 --> 19:29.120]  same time and now this pattern has an interference pattern they're not they're

[19:29.120 --> 19:37.360]  not in oscillation anymore now there is this there's a slowdown in some of them

[19:37.360 --> 19:43.680]  and there's a speed up and a smaller number of them but it's interesting

[19:43.680 --> 19:48.400]  there's so there's like a it's like a sparse and distributed representation in

[19:48.400 --> 19:53.600]  one sense and that and that it's very efficient because the amount of energy to

[19:53.600 --> 20:02.680]  represent is to represent a pattern is to represent part of a pattern is one

[20:02.680 --> 20:09.080]  neuron plus that sped up bounced out by all the neurons that it slowed down by

[20:09.080 --> 20:18.120]  inhibiting so there's like that one neuron simultaneously speeds up and the

[20:18.120 --> 20:30.200]  rest of them get inhibited so it's like they the but then but then it passes its

[20:30.200 --> 20:39.320]  own excitatory signals to the second layer so that sort of like creates the

[20:39.320 --> 20:48.280]  one that fired first now is effectively transferring its synaptic pattern to the

[20:48.280 --> 21:01.280]  next layer because it's synaptic pattern is the reason why it's it's cells filled

[21:01.280 --> 21:08.480]  up first so the synaptic pattern oh shit this is really good okay let's try to go

[21:08.480 --> 21:14.720]  over this one more time so you have so one neuron fires and it inhibits a whole

[21:14.720 --> 21:21.040]  bunch of others but because there's a tonic field all of those neurons are

[21:21.040 --> 21:30.560]  coordinated together so basically the the neuron signal is it looks like one

[21:30.560 --> 21:39.240]  tiny noise but it's slowing down a whole bunch of neurons and so that is also the

[21:39.240 --> 21:47.120]  so the ones that so the neurons that slow down it's kind of like that that

[21:47.120 --> 21:53.480]  represents like so the neuron so a neurons so what I'm saying was that a

[21:53.480 --> 21:56.840]  neurons memory is stored in its synaptic connections I didn't invent that

[21:56.840 --> 22:04.760]  idea that's the prevailing idea okay that's where that that synaptic

[22:04.760 --> 22:12.360]  connections are where the memory is restored and that's because the the

[22:12.360 --> 22:22.000]  synaptic connections they form in response to cells firing at the same time

[22:22.000 --> 22:28.280]  and they they unform in response to cells fire firing out of sync and so a cell

[22:28.280 --> 22:43.800]  that is inhibited is going to be out of sync with a cell that fired and so the

[22:43.800 --> 22:50.800]  link and so in some in some sense like so that means that if you look at the

[22:50.800 --> 22:57.960]  off-siting group as a whole that neurons that were wired together before will

[22:57.960 --> 23:09.760]  become sort of like they will I'm trying to like understand why like this

[23:09.760 --> 23:15.400]  mechanism a little bit more precisely but so something in between when the

[23:15.400 --> 23:25.880]  neurons fire out of sync they the the spines that were growing beneath them

[23:25.880 --> 23:39.720]  will be sort of deconstructed that they'll they'll stop linking to each other

[23:39.720 --> 23:53.440]  and that's that is okay so if you have like so that so I had this idea that

[23:53.440 --> 24:01.800]  that you know it's sort of like it's like a splay state right splay state is now

[24:01.800 --> 24:12.080]  that the oscillations are opposite and so they're gonna like so that means if

[24:12.080 --> 24:17.480]  that one neuron keeps is the one that is gonna fire first then it's gonna

[24:17.480 --> 24:28.760]  inhibit the others and so the I don't know I guess it's kind of like I guess

[24:28.760 --> 24:33.960]  it's I'm just trying to imagine I'm just like trying to imagine the DK process

[24:33.960 --> 24:40.600]  like is it is it analogous to cell wilting is it because nutrients are

[24:40.600 --> 24:47.560]  being deprived from that spine to be shifted towards where the cell is growing

[24:47.560 --> 25:01.920]  because that's sort of like saying that that the the it's like imagine that okay

[25:01.920 --> 25:07.880]  so imagine that plant can grow in any direction and in any given time like but

[25:07.880 --> 25:18.200]  because they're stimulus in one of the directions that is sort of like changing

[25:18.200 --> 25:29.560]  the likelihood like that it's adding it's adding like it's speeding up that time

[25:29.560 --> 25:37.000]  it's speeding up time in that direction so there are more possible paths in the

[25:37.000 --> 25:43.520]  direction there are more possible paths in the direction of in which time is

[25:43.520 --> 25:47.640]  accelerating faster it's like it's like if time is accelerating faster in one

[25:47.640 --> 25:54.200]  direction then you have like one two paths for every one path it's like it's

[25:54.200 --> 25:59.000]  like in one direction life is moving at 60 frames per second very fast and in

[25:59.000 --> 26:03.320]  another direction it's moving at 30 frames per second so that means that you

[26:03.320 --> 26:09.120]  have there's there are there are in a sense twice as many directions for that

[26:09.120 --> 26:15.000]  particle to go towards and so if it's gonna random if it's gonna like if the

[26:15.000 --> 26:21.400]  chances of that it going in any particular direction are like completely

[26:21.400 --> 26:28.280]  random or Gaussian then it's more likely it's then it then it may grow and it may

[26:28.280 --> 26:32.760]  go in any different direction but the chances chances are the chances that it

[26:32.760 --> 26:38.040]  goes in the direction but if but if you have but if two of the three possible

[26:38.040 --> 26:45.720]  directions are the same direction then the chances that it grows in one

[26:45.720 --> 26:55.880]  direction are are two times the chance that it's growing in the other direction

[26:55.880 --> 27:04.120]  and so that increased chance sort of like teases out a trajectory which is like

[27:04.120 --> 27:09.520]  like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just

[27:09.520 --> 27:18.280]  it's just the greater activity increases the the the or the greater

[27:18.280 --> 27:26.720]  activity is is a greater interval of time happening which multiplies the number

[27:26.720 --> 27:36.040]  of possible paths that that growth could go to that growth could happen and and

[27:36.040 --> 27:41.680]  growth is happening faster because in cells that are firing and so because

[27:41.680 --> 27:53.000]  growth is happening more slowly and cells that aren't firing then the the energy

[27:53.000 --> 28:01.320]  of the plant sort of like holes like it's not it stops being sent to to the

[28:01.320 --> 28:07.400]  spine is to the spines that are not being used right it's in and I think they

[28:07.400 --> 28:13.080]  must be decaying like the way a plant decays when it doesn't receive nutrients

[28:13.080 --> 28:18.920]  right and then because the nutrients are going in the direction of where it's

[28:18.920 --> 28:24.360]  firing and that's why so that's so that would be LD LDT which is a long term

[28:24.360 --> 28:29.240]  depression which is when the plant is not growing in a particular direction the

[28:29.240 --> 28:33.000]  signals are going not going in a particular direction and so that's that

[28:33.000 --> 28:40.640]  memory phase fades away or gets like etched away over time okay so what I

[28:40.640 --> 28:46.240]  want to get at is that the the pattern of a neuron so the pattern but we know

[28:46.240 --> 28:54.000]  that the neuron that fires is the one it is like so so it's like the neuron that

[28:54.000 --> 29:05.200]  fires first so so a pattern that I think is going to resonate again a few

[29:05.200 --> 29:13.160]  times because it resonates a few times there's time to stimulate the growth

[29:13.160 --> 29:19.600]  cells and in between those patterns right it's like they can grow a little

[29:19.600 --> 29:25.640]  and they need another stimulus to grow a little more and then another stimulus to

[29:25.640 --> 29:35.000]  grow a little more right so so if it resonates a lot then the growth can be a

[29:35.000 --> 29:43.600]  lot and so it's like energy it's like a lot of energy can flow in certain towards

[29:43.600 --> 29:50.280]  certain patterns and those certain patterns in dense connect patterns that

[29:50.280 --> 29:55.600]  have dense connections have a lot of attractive power

[29:57.320 --> 30:07.480]  they're they're combined as a combined oscillator they're a more they're a more

[30:07.480 --> 30:19.120]  powerful attractor to smaller oscillators and so they can so like as a memory it's

[30:19.120 --> 30:26.600]  a memory like grows almost like a tumor right if something is like if you're

[30:26.600 --> 30:31.840]  there's something that's really important to you then you'll like have all of these

[30:31.840 --> 30:48.040]  like powerful connections will help you it's like how it's like how psychedelic

[30:48.040 --> 30:57.880]  medication is like it excites your whole brain and and that causes a lot of cell

[30:57.880 --> 31:02.480]  growth so you're so you're a lot of a lot of new connections between you know

[31:02.480 --> 31:12.560]  so it causes your increase in your activity right

[31:12.560 --> 31:38.320]  soon I'm saying basically I wanted to say that the that the LCD is creating a

[31:38.320 --> 31:47.120]  pattern and it's helping a single cell to create a magnified pattern so that

[31:47.120 --> 31:58.720]  patterns are being created in terms of by the total representation so the

[31:58.720 --> 32:02.880]  special presentation is not just what fired but it's also what was inhibited

[32:02.880 --> 32:10.000]  right those are just distinct from cells that are still far and tonically so

[32:10.000 --> 32:16.680]  there's multiple layers of representation right and then because

[32:16.680 --> 32:23.840]  there's like there's like gamma and high gamma like there's there's definitely a

[32:23.840 --> 32:36.040]  I would say there's a range of pattern representation

[32:36.040 --> 32:39.680]  there's a range of pattern representation that's four bits that's

[32:39.680 --> 32:58.760]  basically inhibited tonic basically bright and brighter and and you could

[32:58.760 --> 33:11.600]  also say it's like silent regular sounds and loud and louder right and so but

[33:11.600 --> 33:16.000]  and then you could have for touch you can have different intensities of texture

[33:16.000 --> 33:21.880]  right there's like a light touch there's a harder touch like an imacano kind of

[33:21.880 --> 33:26.280]  receptor there's you know the tactile sensations there's heavy touch like hard

[33:26.280 --> 33:32.520]  grips you know like you can have a hard handshake it's a hard grip and you know

[33:32.520 --> 33:40.120]  you can have like basically different different levels of of sensitive

[33:40.120 --> 33:46.200]  sensitivity detection that our senses can process you know we can have two

[33:46.200 --> 33:53.320]  different sensory sensitivity but it's because so the patterns can have different

[33:53.320 --> 33:57.600]  magnitude and that's important because it's like well how much does this pattern

[33:57.600 --> 34:02.720]  one or do we want this pattern resonate some patterns should resonate more than

[34:02.720 --> 34:06.800]  other patterns right because the idea is like well what are what are we gonna be

[34:06.800 --> 34:11.240]  paying attention to that's that that's where the pattern that is resonating the

[34:11.240 --> 34:16.600]  most is happening is what that's where our attention is I'm talking about

[34:16.600 --> 34:26.520]  temporal resonation so it's like yeah so it's like patterns are resonating in

[34:26.520 --> 34:35.440]  our heads right and over time and but they're but they they they like they peak

[34:35.440 --> 34:41.120]  for a time and then they fade out and then they they come back because the

[34:41.120 --> 34:45.080]  whole brain is oscillating so they come back again and they peak and then they

[34:45.080 --> 34:50.840]  fade out again right and but then you know you just it's like a robot in a

[34:50.840 --> 34:57.080]  loop but the loop changes just a little bit every time you know like you know

[34:57.080 --> 35:05.640]  it's like if the loop is the loop is of consciousness it's like a loop it just

[35:05.640 --> 35:15.280]  loops and loops and loops and loops but the thing is it's also like all of the all

[35:15.280 --> 35:21.800]  of the move all of the changes to its movement are are sort of like causing

[35:21.800 --> 35:31.000]  changes to ripple through it that adjust its movements and so it's it's

[35:31.000 --> 35:37.440]  literally just reacting to physics right like human being is just literally a

[35:37.440 --> 35:45.760]  bunch of particles that are reacting to physics human beings literally just a

[35:45.760 --> 35:52.280]  bunch of particles that are reacting to physics that's what I'll say this this

[35:52.280 --> 36:00.960]  allows the entire oscillation to represent a unique pattern code that

[36:00.960 --> 36:06.000]  represents the synaptic arrangement of one neuron or the synaptic configuration

[36:06.000 --> 36:11.240]  of one neuron because that's the only neuron like if that neuron fires whether

[36:11.240 --> 36:22.600]  that it's going to create a pattern that is distinct that to its itself because

[36:22.600 --> 36:26.240]  it's going to inhibit its neighbors it's going to cause basically a disruption to

[36:26.240 --> 36:30.720]  the pattern that that is distinguished is distinguishes itself in a large way

[36:30.720 --> 36:36.360]  by inhibiting other neurons from firing and by slowing them down so it speeds up

[36:36.360 --> 36:41.600]  and it slows down a whole bunch and that magnified pattern that energy efficient

[36:41.600 --> 36:51.400]  magnified pattern changes like that's like a paintbrush on a canvas and the

[36:51.400 --> 36:58.600]  entire ray is that canvas so you can have maybe multiple firing patterns

[36:58.600 --> 37:05.760]  simultaneously in different areas of that one ray and they each inhibit it

[37:05.760 --> 37:12.640]  different area to magnify themselves and so you're gonna have like you're gonna

[37:12.640 --> 37:18.440]  have a few light up and a lot of them are going to be dark but you're gonna

[37:18.440 --> 37:22.800]  detect the dark ones as a difference from the tonic firing rate from the

[37:22.800 --> 37:25.960]  regular it's like the growth it's like relativity so think of it this way the

[37:25.960 --> 37:37.240]  growth relative to you is at the growth decline and it's like the growth

[37:37.240 --> 37:57.040]  declines as you get older right and it's faster when you're younger
