A self aware network is in part a multiscale multitier graph of neural network oscillators, each instance of the repeating topological neural circuit firing pattern at multiple scales is making an analogy in a physical way, because the firing pattern is isomorphic at a different scale you can think of it like a vector based constillation

"psychiatry Giulio Tononi reports that the fading of consciousness during dreamless sleep seems to occur as the different regions of the cerebral cortex that mediate perception, thought and action become functionally disconnected.

I'm visualizing oscillations as frames of consciousness, the 

parallel connectivities emerging between different areas of the brain that are rendering functionally or tempo-spatially & fractally isomorphic frequency patterns at multiple scales giving a cross grid (analogizing) parralellization of large scale pattern analogies across multiple sensory modalities ironically one must describe this very concept at least twice in order to cogitate a visualization of it.

but the purpose of being able to relate functional isomorphisms at different scales allows to brain to compare patterns with scale invariant learning.

so we can imagine that a small cube and a big cube are both a cube in terms of the shape of the cube being its spatial fractal (repeating) voxel-like (scale invariant) virtual (a location invariant pattern (oscillators learn it so any group of neurons can play it back), and a time invariant pattern (and I tell you brother the same thing happened last month and the month before that)

the playback of patterns corresponding to the world we causes pattern interlacing that we can feel in the macroscopic sense as changes in the macroscale electric field and magnetic field distribution.

What if the highscale fractal representation of a small scale pattern the process of attention in neural correlates, because if you can imagine a camera lense has small scale pattern representation and large scale pattern representation depending on your vantage point, so that makes the entire brain into a fractal of your eyeball because the eyeball also has a small scale pattern reflected on the lens and then its image is collected & represented on the inside of the spherical eyeball by the cells in the retina so that is an image fractal in the eye, then the oscillating group of neurons is an eye to watch neural circuit patterns a higher phasic gamma frequency rates get fired off, but the dendrite is the eye of the neuron and the neurons at the dendrite level are learning pattern sequencies that are replayed at the neural circuit scale for the neural oscillating group to capture, and then the 

are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)

In a grander sense the self is not anyone, and there is no one really here, just the drawing of a person reflected by and observed with an organic brain that is reverberating with oscillatory patterns, in magnetic and electric waves.

Its nice to have had this connection with you, considering that we don't really exist, it was pretty nice.

Phi from Integrated Information theory instead of being about whether consciousness is present it might be a way to compare the resolution capacity of consciousness between two brains.

Predictions are quantified at multiple scales and drive our choices (game theory)
knowledge of history (memory of the past) gives us some flexibility in our decision making

It seems that magnetism, changes in the brains magnetic, would be generating by correlating patterns, or temporally, spatially, and perhaps frequency correlated patterns. This would also be something that a brain could detect, it might be vague like a feeling. I'm suggesting that feelings and emotions may be electromagnetic moments. The electric dipole activity and the magnetic dipole activies might also be detected and correlated by the human brain. I want to imagine that there could be a significant distinction between two types of feelings, the electric dipole generated feelings and the magnetic dipole generated feelings but I am not sure, I guess it is possible that the brain could construct feelings from both.

Neuroplasticity is part real and part myth. It is real that brains can learn new life skills after reaching an old age, and its true that brains can recover after serious brain injuries or diseases, but its a myth that this is largely because of neurogenesis or new neurons being grown in your brain, as the amount of new neurogenesis happening in the brain is too small of a quantity and its happening at too slow of a rate to be responsible for new learning, the real reason neuroplasticity is real is because your brain acts like a network that can self regulate and re-route its own activities, and your brain can learn new skills if challenged (refering to rehabilitation techniques) in the right ways. Examples would be improving skills with the broken but healed arm by restricting the good arms movement.  Neuroplasticity techniques work but for different reasons than researchers had supposed in some instances. While a new neuron, emerging from neurogenesis could learn new things, so can old neurons, old neurons can learn new things and some old neurons are meant to last a lifetime.

Imagine the headline Congress to ban all mergers and acquisitions follow Facebook going offline for 7 hours yesterday, because it turns out mergers and acquisitions are just get rich quick schemes devised for people who are already rich to get richer. At the same time Congress passes a second law that forces all companies to split off into multiple pieces so that there are no longer any companies that have an income greater than any other company. This is about multiple redundancy systems to protect people.

Illustration idea: When the gap between what you are thinking and what everyone else in the world seems to be thinking keeps growing. Where is this going??

What if the Quantum Double slit experiment is like the reflection in water that changes based on observation because as a reflection it is reflecting events that exist in the 4th dimension converged to a focal point whereas classical entities have a scale that reflects a divergence of the spacetime focus point or its a view that is stretched out so that the temporal cascade of events maybe not be immediately apparent.

Just as time moves more slowly in Earths upper atmosphere verses on earth on the crust, it could be that at the quantum scale time moves very fast, 

that kinda suggests that the quantum realm is like a reflections of a liquid

it begs the question 
what if the transistors in your computer could listen and consider the data they are receiving, over time learn to recognize patterns, form their own opinions, and ineffect decide for themselves when they wanted to transmit information (speak)?

Everything in the cosmos is made from the material of electromagnetism, including every aspect of the human body, brain, including the mind.

I argue for a 100 percent materialistic universe with a 100 percent materialistic mind. And if people want to use words like spiritual or soul to describe energy patterns, frequency patterns, electromagnetism, or brain activity that's fine with me as long as they are not trying to act like human consciousness is not physical, it is physical. There is nothing that is not physical, even what people describe as spiritual patterns are actually physical patterns.

Well one can argue that information is substrate invariant, meaning that you could inscribe the same idea in a rock, in a brain, or write it on a piece of paper. The information has to be embedded in the material so it is in the material but not of the material.

I am not my brain but just a pattern that is generated by the brain & bodies interaction with the ecosystem
