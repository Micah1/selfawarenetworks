can we reduce the emotional & social entrainment to a 4 dimensional story , and how are the brains of autistics different when there is an emotional social binding, and how does their 

the brain has noise that changes with great variability but it's guassian and tonic, so scientists ignored it, but recent focus on the great variability of this tonic frequency is causing scientists to rethink the noise as potentially containing more information

because when we speak, imagine holding just a vowel sound, in your voice, it sounds like noise, and maybe your voice pattern oscillates a little bit, and only through changes in the noise pattern does meaning emerge, only changes in the vowel sounds, as changes in the noise pattern, result in words forming

so basically our brains are making variable noises, just like our voices,

or our sentences are sequences of variations in noises, and logically then our thoughts may also be variations in noises

the spike might last less than a millisecond
calcium channels (only open during a spike) calcium binds to and then the neuron spits out

don't mess with the potassium.
dendrite ho

if you fuck with the potassium, that action potential you made it made it last a 2 or 5, ms is just when it went very positive

10 millisecond is the whole process after it went down

so much more potassium will come 

messing with the K channels, you are changing the shape of the spike, more spread out, more milliseconds, because more calcium channels are open for longer, more vesicles releases

before the AP, its in a docked state,

if the two oil droplets touch they become a bigger droplet

synapto tagmen molecule
doesn't do its job until calcium

dendrite 

nmda receptors

multivesicle/ every vesicle has roughfly 2000 neurotransmitters, bind to to things including the receptor on the other side

the lateral spread, because there is 10,000 now they are diffiusing laterally 

spatial neurons

alternate between a neural network, an neuron only talks to part of the upper neuron, 

ampa and nmda can both be fast,

both on scale of a few milliseconds

calcium 

nmda channels let calcium exceptions

a pattern of signal firing,

the exact same neurons doesn't happen, but the areas do happen

a bunch fire here, then here, Area A, are b, then area C are a direct result of wiggling the whisker

how is the path of the signal regulated?

30 neurons firing at the same time, to get a second to fire, within 2 milliseconds, 

500 neurons, a couple super strong neurons can almost drive a spike

a neuron has 1/30 the size it needs to be to drive a spike

the outside world just shifts the activity that already happens

the neurons are waiting around on near threshold hold

saddle points, attractors states, on the edge

dendrite hairs or spines could store temporal memories

so the neuron knows

it will change what it listens to?

all the dendrites, 500 areas where the axons from other neurons, 500 synapses, if any of 

what can change the receptivity of an ndma receptor, phosphorilated?

gbcr receptors, change the phosophorilation

express more kinase from the center of the cell that is not directed, its global dist

the cells in the network might modify the ndma receptors 
acetyl choline cell (instead of sending glutamte) gpcr g1 coupled receptor, decreased the local activity

signalling
 or gets them ore activated, or removes them from mem


not a gaba 
inhibitors response

amrican cells have an inside to outside, temporal summation, the action potential starts at the cell 

dendrite is a leaky voltage (water) hose
enough water is an action potential

the dendrite temporal memory has to impact when the cell fires,

10 dendrites, the soma is where the hoses is they all meet

all the dendrites are different sizes

all the water will reach at the same time

if you put water in the shortest hose first

if the organization if the dendrites is changes 

dendritic spines, hairs, points on the dendritic, effect the voltage hoses, if there is more

back prop

op amp with feed forward, nmda channels can contribute

dendritic spikes, can happen through calcium channels

Hawkins was talking about the dendrite spike as preparing the neuron to fire, as the basis of a neuron predicting that it was about to fire.

can a dendrite spike be a large factor, a forward dendrite spike, the layer 5 pyramidal cells, you need that plus something else, 

if neurons fire in the 1rst layer after the 2nd layer the connection is weakened
in the book called spines

if you plug up the holes? it makes it with 9 inputs, you can plug the leakiness
 the little bumps

spines is where the voltage gets into the dendrite?

calcium buffer proteins, if it holds calcium long enough, a back prop

spines,

the spine connects to the ampa ndma receptor,

spines get bigger and smaller

the receptors on spines increase and decrease in number getting added and removed

receptor ms, seconds, minutes

the spines getting added or removed, hours or days,

long term potentiation happens that is part of spines getting added or removed, 

protein synthesis 

might be connected to spines being added or removed

spines, calcium might RESEARCH AREa




ARTIFICIAL PERCEPTION

instead of needing to decode the entire brain

if you could just record of all of what happens in layer 2

Touch cortex

primary somatosensory area in the human cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. This is the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch

parietal and post parietal or just multi modal areas

horizontal feedback or vertical feedback

more feedback than feed forward horizontal?

v2 has project back to v1 so that's vertical feedback

there could be more axons with weaker

loops

loops in microciruits nearest 300 neurons around that neuron

is that a micro column a microcircuit?
