What if our brain's ability to more accurately control devices that read brainwaves are influenced by the feedback we receive through our senses. That is to say what if there is a certain sound frequency or visual patterns that act as a feedback to say we've given the correct signals to the EEG (?) that our brainwaves are on the right track?

You can set up an EEG system to work with software to drive the light and sound listening and seeing tracks to a mind machine, that includes LED Flashing glasses and headphone, with the result being that you start to notice how your thoughts and feelings are reflected in the light and sound effects that you are seeing because your brainwaves driving the changes in light and sound effects. Then you start to have an understanding of your brainwaves. This was my business in 2012 I had a neurofeedback salon where people could come and experience their brainwaves driving light and sound effects.
