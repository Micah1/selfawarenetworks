Update: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) was previously written as Neural Oscillating Array Tomography (NOAT) As you can see below.

Neural Oscillating Array Tomography is the idea that 
the brain consists of sequences of arrays, from the sensor arrays in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin, to each layer of cortex inside each cortical column. I had this idea and then I saw this paper which talks about overlapping edge communities in the brain "The diversity and multiplexity of edge communities within and between brain systems" https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01514-X 

Essentially what they are talking about in terms of edge communities, like vertices between dipoles of brain activity, I am arguing could be imagined as overlapping sensor/transmitter arrays that are doing neural oscillator array tomography.

Keep in mind however that the paper is making a statement about functional edge communities, not about anatomical edge communities, what I am suggesting with NOAT is an anatomical sequence of overlapping arrays, that correlate with the concept of functional edge communities dividing up the functional networks of the brain.

The idea of star trek food replicators, and people beaming & teleporting is interesting, because its like could you read and write the spacetime phasefield with 

it means programming space at the particle level
but then I think about the programmable matter in Star Trek 

Electric Diffusion

The idea of a rematerialization machine, its like what if you could precisely cause an area of space to oscillate the way you want it to. So that 

Programmable matter, what if space was programmable matter? 

It's almost the same idea as the teleporter, it's just that you are precisely tuning and entire tensor field of space.

but its almost like space itself is a hologram anyways

wait

space as an oscillating field is a hologram
the human mind is representing a view on this hologram
but the view itself is like another edge in spacetime that is moving around.

because space is a phasefield
its also a hologram
and that means that if we can capture holograms and reconstruct holograms and send them

What makes this make sense is that information is mass. This is something I wrote about elsewhere. So the Holodeck & the Replicator from Star Trek would be the same technology. So if we could alter the wave patterns of space, like 3D printing food, we could 3D print reality.
