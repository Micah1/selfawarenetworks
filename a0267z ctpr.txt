(oscillat, observer, cortex) The Observer of the brain's activity is the brain

Daniel Dennett argued that the consciousness is a kind of illusion, with the brain creating images based on what it is exposed to.

I think that Anil Seth is calling this same process a hallucination.

The idea is that the visual representation of anything in front of you is captured by your eyes and then represented in your visual cortex, and then what is seen by your visual cortex is re-modelled by other parts of your brain, in an oscillating loop of brain activity, adding a temporal viewing to your international representation.

As someone who writes about science & technology at Silicon Valley Global News I prefer the computer analogy and so I will call this process a rendering, a computational rendering.

The purpose of my book, as a sort of conference like presentation of the work others have done is to create exhibits around the sources that are supporting this narrative of phenomenal consciousness being created by a brain to be viewed by a brain in a feedback cycle, a neo mind cycle or a self aware network.
 
I hope this book is as fun to read as it was fun for me to write.

One thing that I found to be interesting while writing this book was that I suddenly began to see an explosion in article about consciousness in the news. See this article from Keith Frankish, a philosopher and writer for AEON called "What if your consciousness is an Illusion created by your brain" https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-your-consciousness-is-an-illusion-created-by-your-brain
