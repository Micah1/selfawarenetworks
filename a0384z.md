Do we know quantum particles enough to know that they couldn't be conscious?

Sean Cusack
they'd have to have enough degrees of freedom to contain the complexity of an intellect. it would be interesting to demonstrate the minimal complexity for consciousness...

I think we are missing an important tile of the puzzle of consciousness, that is: should consciousness be studied from outside the box or from inside the box? in the first case I argue, that research would be mainly driven by the efforts of other sciences as quantum physics, while in the second, consciousness is studied by means of another consciousness, that is by consciousness itself. That would automatically bring up an expectation that an autoconscious particle thinks, or, in other words, that it is capable to draw inferences on reality and produce a change in it, let alone changes in itself. I'm personally persuaded, that AI can tackle this effort better as the leading science that drives ahead the research.

(sigh) What do you mean by "conscious"?

take Stuart Hameroff for example, he thinks microtubules in our neurons connect with the quantum particle range which is where choice becomes possible in his model.
is there any evidence to prove him wrong?

I think that our microtubules connect to an alternate universe to make us conscious. Is there any evidence to prove me wrong?

"(sigh) What do you mean by "conscious"?" I mean can particles in the quantum realm be considered components of thought in some other kind of mind, or possibly in current minds.

No.

Micah Blumberg 
Based on your best guess or some proof? Some conclusion you know someone researched and wrote about?

Matt Mahoney 
Consciousness is a belief that evolution programmed into your brain.

Micah Blumberg
So you defined consciousness as a belief rather than something that transcends beliefs?

@Micah: Apart from decoherence at body temperature, problems with timescales, and problems with distance scales? No, not really.

"If human thought comprises non-computational processes,then how is the brain supporting these processes? To answer this question, Penrose appeals to physics, and claims that the theory of quantum gravity is likely to be the kind of physics required to explain a conscious mind. ... Microtubules, according to Penrose, support a substrate for the quantum gravity effects required for consciousness. "(H.Brighton/H.Selima - Artificial Intelligence: A Graphic Guide)

problems with scale. PERIOD, but just because it might seem implausible, on the basis of scale, for quantum fluctuations to have an influence on human thinking, you have to behold that idea until the end of an unconscious disregard for the potential mass effect of the whole quantum field at once.

does the whole ocean have an influence which resembles a kind of intelligent system that humans have never truly calculated? do you laugh at the idea of anthropomorphized oceans, because I didn't say it was like a living intelligence, I am talking about "systems"

because isn't the brain a memory system we are now finding out in this most recent decade of mankind? what will man discover tomorrow?

Exactly what does the brain do that can't be explained by the mechanical firing of neurons?

Do you sense space? Does anyone sense space around themselves? Have you considered yourself as spacetime itself? How do your mechanical fires create the sense of space for you?

Penrose's point seems to suggest that in the future some questions will be answered by evolution itself, but there would be a lot to wait (say thousands of generations?) for these changes to appear on the surface, if any. On the other hand, I think that every attempt to investigate consciousness from the way quantum physics interacts will physical brain will reproduce this controversy ad infinitum.
At some moment, there will be need to address consciousness building models, making appropriate hypothesis and previsions and data analysis that may lead to some conclusions that lie on a different perspective than biology and quantum gravity. AI has this potential. But I think there is a lot more to do.

You still haven't defined "consciousness". How would I recognize it in a machine?

This is bring your own definition of consciousness to work day. I'm not here to define terms. Everyone can have a different definition of consciousness I don't care, I will just say that being so specific is not germain to intent of the original post. I'd rather people generalize, be creative and abstract.

OK, how about asking the original question without using the word "conscious"?

Can quantum waves contain or create beliefs? can the wave particle patterns reflect and process patterns as distinct and as complex as the brainwaves in humans?
