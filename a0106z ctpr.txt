I am beginning to think we are connected with other life in other galaxies normally, that we each represent different versions of reality blending together in all places simultaneously.

so evolution

the natural selection of spacetime
and the natural selection of organisms is the same thing

oscillators are getting more complex

brains will continue to evolve long past where they are today.

It is because the index of the complexity of information is increasing overtime relative to increase in entropy overtime

in other words entropy is the oscillatory dissipative of complexity, so entropy is increasing overtime because oscillation configuration complexity is simultaneously increasing over time

its that oscillators are causing other oscillators, nudging each other and combining, atoms, planets, people, but also dissipating at the same time, super nova, death, planetary collapse, 

Earth may collapse? Because the configuration of the oscillations keeps increasing as the patterns combine to delay being evaporated away, 

So the oscillating patterns are ensuring their own survival by becoming increasingly complex, they are combining to form more energy efficient spins that can survive increasingly complex environments of competiting patterns that are trying to maintain their own spin.
