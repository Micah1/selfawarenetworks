So, my suggestion is that the phi max for my, IT is actually closer to the resolution and, and not about whether there's the function of awareness of sound like, awareness in a self-awareness.

00:20

So okay, so the idea that something that so that a logic gate because it has causal power or it's a causal relay. So let's say that, even if you don't have call, like if you don't have legs, so calls the powers. Like, even if you even if there's no independence, right?

00:44

So it's like, so let's say that it's just a reaction that

00:54

So yeah, you have to replace the essential question of, you know, once you get once you get past back that you know, a finite state machine is not going to have any sort of mechanism for free freedom that it's just basically a physics operation that's reacting to whatever it comes encountered encountered in to what it encounters but you can still place liability on the system.

01:22

It's self in terms of like but in terms of like address in terms of like addressing it it's not it's it's through trying to address. This is like a sort of like moral failing.

01:40

I think sort of complete because it's not actually that it's it's a physics, there's just there's a physics issue. There's a this system was it's it's a training data issue. This system was and it's a health house of the network issue, right? So it's like here it's a system that was that has a certain kind of program or encounters, a certain certain number of situations.

02:11

Something can go a mess and it needs to be treated more like treating a broken bone, right? In terms of like treating the certain terms, like treating the brain like treating when when when something goes a mess in society, and there's a conflict, you know, if if there was a crime or harm committed then you know there's this like hole justice and punishment or you know, people will have to be locked up or find or someone and so forth.

02:47

And it's the way society has has a developed to try to manage these these points. But it's sort of based on this idea of this of applying this more sort of a moral character to what is a physics system? That's reacting and because that assumption isn't, right, because it is a physics system, then the treatment should be the treat treating a system or repairing a system like repairing robots.

03:25

And that's why I believe that. I want to make an argument that that we need to shift away from the current criminal justice system, and move back towards what Eagleman argued in. In his book incognito, we need to move back to putting the system underneath medicine, so and just sort of like changes sort of like making a major society change globally in order to address what is a global issue actually and more medically aligned way.

04:14

So the idea here is that a circuit has causal power. So let's say that the operation of the brain is just it's just a physics system, right? And that's how it needs to be treated, but it's not like we can say, it has no liability. Okay. Because it's a physics system, like it's still, it still has causal power in terms of like cause of relay in terms of like you know, how it is acting or reacting.

04:47

I mean, you cannot put you the way it's society has to deal with. It is is if a machine is if if I think of it as a machine that has gone as unable to perform a task safely that it previously was able to perform a safely and thinking of it.

05:05

And in that context, there is a context in which, yeah, if if a machine, is unable to perform its duties, as like, could be, like any any kind of task, so it could be a citizenry into duties, right? If unable to perform those duties of being a citizen safely, then there are reasons to restrict access, right?

05:29

And in which case and until you know a basically like a combination of of restricted access to a confined space, plus a therapy program to train to retrain and recover and heal, plus a period of demonstration of it of that, the programs behaviors in the recovery system. Rehabilitation system have have actually succeeded.

06:05

So there would be like scenario testing and we'd be able to use VR to organize a lot of different scenarios that would be on otherwise very difficult or very expensive for people to play through. And I think that the goal is to give people some flexibility in to feel some navigational flexibility.

06:34

In terms of having learned more ways to deal with the chaos that life is going to throw at them, so they have more flexibility to make better better choices. Because they've learned with new examples, a new ways that they can approach the same problems that they face in the past and and new ways of dealing with more advanced problems that they may faith, that they will probably face in the future.

07:01

So, so the whole thing with, like, if a logic gate has causal power, the key to, okay? So if they're saying that, you know, you know, with high fine. Max. It's a logic. It has called a power even if it's two dimensional that it can feel like something. But here, here's the missing link.

07:19

Okay. Healing, the feeling itself is about the The machine detecting its own causal structure. Okay? So because so it's the feeling is emerging from the cause of structure, right? Feelings. Don't emerge from from space, from space time. They merge from from people and so feelings. Describe the causal structure.

08:02

All right. Sorry. Probably right. But okay, so no. So so the feelings are detected by the causal structure and emitted by the causal structure, right? And,

08:21

But it's because, but they're detected because they have detectable patterns, right? And they the patterns that are detected are, what's being felt and so there is so. So I'm going back to like, in order for there to be a topographical analysis of or a linear, and a linear algebraic analysis of of an emotional transition from Wednesday, to another, you'd have to

09:15

Tested. You'd have to say it feels like something because it's it because it's emitting a pattern as detected, right? And because you, you can, you can cut because that pattern can be contrasted with the incoming with oh with other incoming patterns and and then worked into the knowledge graph and so that a pattern can have.

09:53

And so that the there's there's a layer where the, there's the layer one patterns are rendered by, and then rendered to, and then so rendered. So layered one pattern to rendered by and then two and then later two is going to read and then it's going to render. And so, you're going to have this.

10:26

Here we go. And you'd have to say that in order for any kind of feeling at all to have a period that it has to

10:43

It has to have a connection an analog in analytic analogous connector. So so it's like what I'm saying is like, there is a place where the feeling is being rendered, there's a place where the visuals being rendered, there's a place when where the audio's being rendered where this matters sensory is being and these places, like these places, all exist geographically and on the topology of the brain they and like the brain is a graph that generates visual features and a visual area and some add a sensory features and a mattress and security area naughty features in the audio area and feelings and a feeling area.

11:30

And so on They call the different representations of reality are generated topographically in different parts of the brain. And and what I'm saying, where I'm going with this is I'm saying that they are feeling each other that the patterns are the brands are able to sometimes, not always relate one set of sensory patterns to another set of sensory patterns.

11:53

Usually, you know, and, and the most common ways would be to make temple spatial correlations between sensory between different, kinds of sensory inputs. And that means that, you know, basically a time and space relationships. And the brand is very good at that because the brain tracks patterns and four dimensions and the brain.

12:20

Well already and learned patterns before dimensions, then the brain can use the four dimensions of space time to compare patterns. So it can say, okay, well we've got two patterns plotted out spatially that happened at the same time. It could be like a lightning and thunder example, right? If I hear lightning and I'm FSC lighting and I hear thunder and they both happen.

12:45

Like within a certain proximity of what another eventually, my brain is going to notice that there's a relationship between lightning and thunder in rain, right? And clouds. And my brain starts to notice a relationships because there is a stir's, there's a temporal and, or spatial synchrony between the two different types of learning patterns.

13:13

And so we can grow these, really deep links between stuff, that happens long distance leaks, between stuff that happens in geographically remote regions, like visual stuff happens in the visual cortex and and touch stuff happens in it in the smadison's, report text. And those are those are you know the cortical columns involved in processing.

13:35

Each set of patterns. Those are geographically remote from one another but there are long connections, or long inter neurons between those regions. And so at some point, you know, the the intern neurons connect to the pyramidal neurons of the representative cortical columns that are having a similarity in terms of their temple.

13:58

Spatial framework for comparing one set of unstructured data to another. And so to add to, this is like, okay, so the brain has learned all of these representations while these different kinds of patterns and how to really once that patterns to another. And then when you add into the dimension of feelings, as get another cortical column that has data, unstructured data.

14:25

That could be a fourth dimensional. Meaning, there's there's fourth dimensional. I mean, there's there are spatial properties to emotions in. There's temporal properties and there's also phasic properties. It's not just spatial and temporal was also the phase in each location of the temple. Spatial as it's actually have a frequency and and and if you could draw if you could draw a frequency through just one dot through one through one point of one vector.

14:57

So let's say you have the vector that goes through a 40 space or three data space and that represents, that's one vector per moment of time per millis back under something. I don't know. I mean that's the way thing is like, okay, so you could say that. Well, if a neuron if and now, on as far as it was one millisecond and then is the speed of the brain in millisecond intervals.

15:22

Well, now, because if you have two milliseconds, if you turn around firing and and one fires, like so one fires at one millisecond and then one fires a picosecond later, right? So, basically you'd have that's because or another way to look at it is this or you could say you have to two neurons firing per not a second and then so, okay.

15:58

Well, then you say, okay, wait, wait a second. Now, wait a second. What about what are all? What's the total number of neurons firing per male second, right? Because that's how you get to the real complication. It's not you can't see through the lens of this one. Or what is?

16:11

And it's not always changing number, right? It's always going to change. But the idea is that you could have two neurons, fine. I mean that you could have, you can have teacher, you could let me say. So we have 86 billion neurons, right? And it's gonna be like, so 80% is in the two, so 1886 trillion neurons but 80% of them are not really the consciousness.

16:53

They're just that's just part of the just extra. Okay, so 20%. Okay, so let's enter 86 billion is going to be 8.6 billion and twice. That is going to be 16. 16 gonna be like 17 billion. So, you know, something like that somewhere, around 17 billion neurons are what's really involved with the consciousness, man.

17:27

And it is curious that, you know, it could be even like half of that because you can have, you can take out one entire hemisphere and a person has to be conscious. You can take a person's left hemisphere right hemisphere away and it gets to be conscious so it's actually like half that number.

17:45

So really like we're thinking about like eight point six. We need about eight point six billion neurons before we're at human though. There's, there's no me aside from this computational rendering that's happening and my in and hurts frequencies like that. This this is there's a story at the brain is computationally, creating that scopes my the shape of my body, everything about me.

18:29

It, it creates my personality and causes changes to my personality. When I learn things or when I, and when I learned a, when I, when I learned a things that to such an extent, a certain threshold of learning has been crossed. That my mind reorganized, it finds a new way to connect the dots in how it organizes the contents of the mind.

19:06

Like, like a network becoming more connected and more networked. Like imagine you have two pieces of data that start out in different places and gradually, they make, they make some connections, they gradually, they grow connections.

19:27

If those connections are warranted or connections are trimmed and resolution is improved like, maybe I'd be like if that can happen, that would be like objects are higher resolution for you when you, when you get older and they were when you were younger. All right. In your developmental stage.

19:52

If you were a child, maybe maybe children, and I don't know. But if this, maybe this is not true, but I'm like, I was just, I was thinking. What if would if there's a situation where a certain stage of human development, a human being, you know, it's just learning to see and the world that they're able to create is relatively low resolution and as they as they grow and experience more life that the the level of detail that they're putting into their representation of reality just gets richer and richer and deeper and deeper.

20:34

And so from the scale of being a young person and trying to think about the world, there might be a there might be by contrast to an adult. Like a really low scale of resolution as to what the meaning of any particular event means in the in the in the global context of all events that are that are likely to happen.

20:57

What is this significant of this for that? And what do I do with this or that? How do I connect the dots to accomplish a storyline? That makes sense, right? And I mean, and some sense I guess that, you know, there's there is a huge sort of vulnerability, I guess that, that had developing mind has.

21:20

And so yeah. So, parents are very important to protect the vulnerability of a developing mind, but Everything we perceive is a temple. Spatial pattern hurts pattern temple, spatial phase pattern. Everything we perceive can consists of blocks of temp. Spatial phase patterns Like a block world.
