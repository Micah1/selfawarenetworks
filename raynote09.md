Dark Time Theory, Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, at the Quantum level, constructive wave interference probably binds atoms together creating an attractive force, while destructive wave interference perhaps pushes atoms apart creating a repulsive force.

The contructive wave interference is probably enhancing the density of time & the gravitational effect locally.

Whereas destructive wave interference is probably reducing the density of time & decreasing the gravitational effect locally. 

That's how we get back to the idea of flying machines that defy gravity, reducing their own effective mass with destructive wave interference.

The force of exploding jetfuel, to propel a rocket ship, could be considered a kind of destructive wave interference.

The force of an atom bomb exploding, in a sense represents the destructive wave interference resulting in an atom splitting and releasing more wave interference to it's surrounding environment.

Destructive wave interference is likely the reason entanglement doesn't work at higher temperatures. Waves can't entangle because they are moving too fast. Cooler temperatures are needed for the oscillatory binding of quantum particles.

You can search for the word "repulsive" to find previous notes that I made on this topic

particularly in "Hex 7.md"

I wrote: "A photon which has no apparent mass can split into the matter and antimatter opposites the positron and the electron, they attract each other like magnet, and they neutralize each others mass, which means as a photon there is neither an acceleration or deceleration of space happening. Or perhaps the positron has mass because it is accelerating space, but with the reverse polarity, as if it was causing the electromagnetic field to spin in the reverse direction, still creating accelerating space but with a repulsive trajectory that is opposite but equal to the electron. Two electrons, like all fermions, will not share the same space because they interfere or decelerate space between themselves, providing incentive to stay part, since bosons are not spinning space condensation is easier. 
"The electron is attractive perhaps because it causes space around it to accelerate, the positron is anti-attractive because it causes space around it to decelerate? Yes its like two opposing electromagnetic vortices trying to occupy the same space, 
two positive magnets, or two negative magnets when the sames are brought together the result is decelerating or repulsive space, but is that space repulsive to anything else no? Is that because the decelerating space is on a certain wave length that affects only items or objects sharing that wavelemgth of concentrated activity 
"A positive and negative magnet north and south pole attract because they accelerate space between them, creating a vortex that maximizes the direction of flow "

I wrote: "his ties into the strong nuclear force, because the greater time area created by the wake of the  positive proton is going to increase the odds that neutral or negative particles move towards it. The proton has a mass that can attract the neutron and the electron by creating a wake in itâ€™s path that is the area in time that essentially the neutron & the electron become more likely to fall into.

"Positive & Positive charges are being pushed apart in space, in part because the space around their combined charge is increasing too rapidly in time area,

"Same thing with the negative negative combination, the amount of energy it takes to combine electrons, or negative sides of a magnet is great because their combined energy is accelerating frames of time or increasing the area of space around the combined charge which creates the repulsive interaction or repulsive force.

"Whereas the combination of positive charges & negative charges has a strong magnetic pull that unites positive & negative because the area of time displacement, or time area, or the quantity of time frames around the positive/negative pair is reduced relative to the increased amount of time frames at the center of the new mass, it's like a magnetic lego brick made of waves, since the waves alternate frequency, one is positive and one is negative, they can combine without exporting their time area.":

from note a0387z.md
"In addition virtual particles, and virtual atoms that could exist exert a dissipative force on particles, its like if the threshold for the existence of a particle is almost met, but not completely met, then the virtual particle is dissipated instead, and its dissipation is what I think is the repulsive force in electromagnetism, and below threshold energy dissipation from virtual configurations (of almost particles) is probably the weak nuclear force."

destructive wave interference from virtual particles

note a0130z.md
"On physics, the idea that the energy required to create certain particles from the collisions of other particles acts as a repulsive force between particles if they do not have enough energy to merge,

because they are each curving or curling space in a way that creates a threshold (an energy requirement) for the other particle to overcome. 
and this is the basis of why two positive electrons will repel each other. (I think I wrote about this elsewhere.)

So the idea is that not only are virtual particles interacting with particles, but also virtual entities represented by the energy thresholds of space being warped in a particular way (spin up or spin down) are interacting with particles.

virtual entities are energies that only emerge between two particles with a particular polarity to one another, in other words they exist in certain types of relationships but not in others."

note a0113z

"The tremendous number of the ratio of the gravitation to the ratio of electricity is still a mystery today

But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it

So when you have a chaotic gravitational field, made up of the whole electromagnetic spectrum, and that includes the heat spectrum, the chemical spectrum, and mechanical acoustic wave spectrum, you are going to find a chaotic distribution of electron alignments, and the greater the chaos the more the force of electricity is diluted, the more the electrons align the greater the electrical force gets, this explains the difference between the electric force and the gravity force that we experience. A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned."

note a0104z.md
a particle/wave can contain kinetic energy which is defined by its information configuration which is an identity in a sense, that represents a physical configuration also

dissipation is like electron scattering, the virtual photon pushes them apart because they do not have a complimentary phase, so the virtual energy needed to combine two electrons is greater than their trajectories and that creates the repulsive force
