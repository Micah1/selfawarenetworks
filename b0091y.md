b0091y Pattern Slides Leds

00:00
Just imagined was basically like eyeball like rose of eyeballs looking at LEDs, right? So like once one row of eyeballs is looking at a row of LEDs and then it's tail. It's tails are leading to another row of LEDs that are lighting up, right? And then that leads to another row of LEDs that are lighting up.

00:26
And so it's like the eye is the dendrite of the cell and the the LEDs are the outputs from the saw, right? And so I that's what I need to draw is like a big circuit. It's basically like eyes a circuit of eyeballs with LEDs, right? Like so it's like a narrow circuit is like and then and then draw like a circle, right?

01:05
But then, the circle is like, it's like that symbol of like the incomplete circle. Like, you don't complete it, but then what you do is you you connect the incoming senses. So you have the eyes from outside and they come in and they sort of like enter the cyclone right.

01:24
And, and then they Yeah, it's a it's a cyclone like this but like sure that much, how there's like an input and then there's like and there's a an output like, right? There's a there's a muscular output that that goes that feeds back into the input and so there's like a there's a a, a sort of like a spiral that loops on itself, right?

02:13
It's kind of, so

02:26
So how does the brain relate one type of pattern to another? For example, how do I oh yeah, that's what it was saying. I was saying like, okay, so imagine that I am then my head is in the room, facing one of the corners of the room. And I am seeing a two and in front of me and then a one in front of me.

02:54
And then I'm seeing basically, like a I can describe the two but I'm not so it's not, the two is not, it's a sparse representation number two, but it's a graphic representation of a two because I can see an outline. I can see borders. I can even put a pattern like a texture pattern like a Christmas tree pattern.

03:12
It's like white paper with with a grain evergreen tree and then a yellow star on top of the other green and that pattern repeats over and over again like wallpaper. And and so I can see this too. And then I see the one I wanted has a has a white outline black outline around the white outline and then a red feeling and then I can see the tears fought places.

03:39
So now the one, the red one is in front of the Christmas tree too. Now they swap textures. So so the one has the Christmas tree wrapping paper in the twos and red and I moved the two back in front, the red twos in front and the one with the Christmas tree paper is behind the two.

03:55
And I'm actually, while I'm describing these changes, I'm actually seeing them move their places. Like my mind is doing a graphical rendering and swapping the one in the two. So my hypothesis is that the rendering is the any part of the brain can do the rendering. And but I would expect the the visual input areas to be sort of mostly focused on this area, but but that's how my my memory is like I can render graphics from myself and I can see the things that I'm thinking about, like, I can picture slides like, you know, like you have like imagine like, you know, when you play tetras for five hours, right?

04:46
Play tetras for five hours and when you close your eyes, you see the tetras, right? And it's sort of like, you see the shapes and the following tetras blocks. When your eyes are closed, after you've been playing tetraship five hours because your brain has just become a customs to representing those types of patterns to in order to help you maximize your score.

05:11
You are basically you're like one of alpha goes deep. One of it's very deep minds, alphago re reinforcement, learning neural networks. During the time it's you're playing Tetris, right? Then you have the, your brain is representing the patterns of Tetris to itself graphically and it becomes. So in trained in representing these patterns that you you find out that you're still seeing the patterns when you go to, when you're trying to go to sleep.

05:54
And what I'm saying is that that's sort of, that's the same way that I am can visualize, like, you know, a powerpoint presentation or a series of slides that I want to, you know, like a picture album, like a conversion visualize how picture album moves, right? But it takes time to like, then add like, okay, well, I'm gonna add some more, you know, I'm gonna add like, you know, what am I gonna add to each of the slides in the picture up?

06:23
What that takes more time? Because my brain has to actually, like, work at rendering creating a graphical rendering. And and after a while I can begin to like, you know, define like a set of slides in my mind, like what's, how many slides are there? I see right now.

06:43
30 slides and some of them have circular images on them are already. This is part of like I'm sort of designing like the thematic sort of like theme the visual theme of the slide back right now. Lots of circular imagery but sort of sort of like circles at different scales and different colors, high contrast, lots of blacks and reds and like I'm creating this like a slight theme right in my mind right now.

07:10
And so actually, I think I'm gonna get out my, my drawing pad, my iPad and, and start sketching. But actually go over the rest of this talk. So I was saying that. Yes, so that the brain is graphically, rendering the different patterns of the two and it's relating, you know?

07:34
If you want to relate a two to one or one to two, you can add them together. Physically, you could stack them, you could put the one on top of the two, or the two on top of the one, you can, multiply one times to, right? And, you know, you can multiply one, you can multiply two times 11 and start to play with the number of, you know, two, you can imagine two times 11 and then you can have an equal.

07:58
You can have an x between the two and and the and the two ones, and then you could, you could have an equal sign. And then you could see like the numbers 2 to after after the equal sign or you or you could put the raw, you could have like the number five, you could say two times 11 equals five and in that is that's also something that is evocative to your to your system because now there's like whoa no wait a second two three times two times 11 is not five and but to see that in your minds I now like it opens up this like vector of emotion towards my from my heart that the heart is as well.

08:42
That's just wrong. And yeah, I have jacked and disagree with that sir. My heart is against it where a second slow down. So Are you okay? Are you? Okay? So it's like it's like no no it's not five that's not too two times 11 is not five. Okay, just relax.

09:18
And are you do we need to check your temperature to make sure you're you're okay or you feeling. All right? No, no. It's this is humor obviously. But I mean, I'm just saying like the the brain think of the brain as capable of learning patterns that that ache can once it learns a pattern in one area, it can play back that pattern any in any area and you can play a pattern across the entire cortex.

09:45
And the entire cortex will will recognize it in terms, but but recognize it in terms of the modalities that it has been tuned to play. So, a lot of the differences between like, there's different ways to represent the number three, like, you can represent it with different walk, different kinds of wallpaper and that's like different parts of the cortex are taking turns, becoming activated in order to represent that pattern as you as a pattern rolls through different areas of of the cortex, it can take on different different properties.

10:19
Like now I can imagine the number of three is like it's like painted on top of a like a kind of like RC car that has spherical wheels and it looks very much like in like like an alien racing car. I know there was spiritual mode. There was there was a movie, they had a car that had spherical wheels.

10:40
That was minority report. Yeah, and the car we go up the building and but yeah so we have this. What I'm saying is a temple, spatial physics, scalar pattern. I want to say the scalar pattern because I'm looking. I'm I, the reason I say it's like scalar wave pattern because because because yeah, it seems like a scalar wave.

11:10
My might to find the face field, you can define it with scale of scaleaways, but that also kind of like it plays on the, the word scalar from, from linear algebra right from from, you know, vectors and scalars and, and tensors and matrices, right?
