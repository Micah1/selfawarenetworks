Notes on the Whitepaper video

listen to the video again to make notes on what you added with dialog alone

fix variating

Imagine that the brain is like a horn or a lens where signals converge to points, but also they magnify out from any point.

The quantity of potassum "for" when the threshold of the ap was triggered? check grammar

I went over the beginning how the whole array is not just receiving information from one neuron,

the exit terminal array from one neuron is also receiving the led light from a whole bunch of other neurons at the same time

so the exit terminal array is going to see that LED light from a whole bunch of different neurons simultaneously (imagine a tv screen or a grid of phase changes).

A lot of neurons are contributing light to that exit terminal array, not just one.

So this means that whole group is learning the same patterns.

So the whole oscillating group is capable of responding to the same pattern, and some of them are more sensitive to that pattern than others. They can each specialize in minor variations of that pattern, based on how they differentiate, so they are like asymmetric duplicates, similar, but representing the learned pattern in a slightly different way

So if one of them can't respond at a certain point in time because it is inhibited by another cell, or is otherwise not ready to fire, another cell can take it's place and recognize the pattern, with a different asymmetric representation of that pattern.

I'm not sure if Asymmetric is the right word, it's a different version of that pattern, it's a useful word, its like a mirror of that pattern, but its like a different different different mirror of that pattern.

So any part of that group of cells can receive that signal and the rest of the group can react to it, infact they do physically react to any pattern they receive as a collective, just like the fireflies in the book by steven strogatz

We are talking about phase changes at any scale in the brain, phase changes at any scale in the brain constitute information, in the context of information theory if you have a tonic or a very common signal that has low information value, and a rare signal has high information value. So the tonic brainwave activity has low information value and phasic bursts, the burstlets, and the big phase changes at any scale whether we are talking about big dipoles or little neurons or medial cell clustors or cortical columns, any phase change transmitted from any of the brain structures at any scale is information that is received by another structure, small structures can transmit information to big structures, big structures can transmit information to small structures. So large oscillating structures can drive changes at the small scale and visa versa. You can have top down and bottom up change, because patterns have scale invariant causation in the brain, so patterns of any scale can cause effects and changes to patterns of any scale, and that works in part because of the criticality of the ready state, the receptiveness of the tonic oscillation, but also the selective receptiveness to certain patterns that your brains morphology and synaptic connections grow to and adapt to recognize or decay to ignore

The tonic oscillation has a high magnitude synchrony, and a low frequency. It has oscillatory bidirectional interactions with low magnitude high frequency spikes, or lower magnitude higher frequency oscillating groups, and everything effects everything else eventually because of the physics of oscillation, but temporarily some neurons & oscillating cell groups can selectively recognize or ignore certain patterns. 

So the tonic is the slow low information and the phasic bursts are the high information rare content.
