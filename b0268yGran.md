So, I couldn't provide a good answer for that. But I would be curious to know what the answer is. So, Okay, so let me if you want you can hang out and I'll ping some more people let's see if we can find someone who who wants to tackle this.

00:24

And by the way, if you know anybody who you think might be able to answer this question. Let's go ahead and get them in the room. Neuroscientists, especially.

00:39

Yeah. So, let me see if I can.

00:56

Okay, so we got someone just joined the room. Let me bring you up to the stage okay, so you can talk. Hanson invite to speak. Andy, hey.

01:22

So yeah so this is just focusing on the basics you can neurons detect patterns and it seems like that's that should be like an essential thing like but I think there is also some debate about whether neurons are detecting patterns and and if so, how are they taking patterns and how are they transmitting patterns?

01:43

So, Supposed to talk about the biological neurons, right? Yes, I'm talking about biological neurons. So and in vehicle in the brain or are they Isolated in a kind of a patri dish. So I under what? So the I mean the the conditions are should be invariant, but I'm thinking about how neurons in a brain detect patterns.

02:28

So, let me invite Kyle up who just arrived.

02:34

And welcome Kyle. So I I'm so Hansen asked are we talking about neurons in a in vivo or in the brain or or what's the syn or artificial neurons and I I'm thinking about I I about real neurons in a brain a functioning brain. It could be a mouse brain.

03:01

I'm actually thinking about a human brain specifically because human brains are a little bit different and I'm wondering if if a neuron how when neuron can detect a pattern. If it's detecting a pattern. I think there's some debate so some people think that neurons they're just going to fire if they receive enough input but that's not that's not exactly the same as detecting a pattern is it because in order to like detect an information pattern like an actual pattern it has to be able to not fire.

03:38

When when something that's not a specific pattern, so if you if you just like overload the neuron and it just fires every time it gets overloaded that's not pattern detection, right you have to be able to throw out. It depends on yeah. I think it depends on what the how you'd define pattern and then the pattern and then also the complexity of how to yuck so even it's single neuron intrinsically it does depend detect the pattern and if you just think just the neuron you have electric stimulation, like potential I.

04:28

Went just like you said, I mean there's a fire fire firing has the threshold and so the threshold is self is a pattern so anything that below the threshold it won't fire the above the threshold it's firing so it's a function of that the the the destination or charge or potential so so that is the pattern so I am supposed that.

04:57

I suppose that that's not like a single neuron can basically react to that pattern and, But I guess you think of something more complex, but then the question is just that's the question what kind of complexity. So so what I'm saying is okay, let's say that that if we take what you said it is exactly correct that when when a neuron fires that is a pattern okay, but the thing is you have to have a detector at some other level that's going to detect it just because it's like it's like if a tree fires and in the forest and nobody's listening to it does it, you know, I mean if a tree falls in the forest and nobody's listening did it actually make a sound and that's good we have.

05:52

A question is. Well, let me continue to phrase this so so the thing is like if if there is no the nothing on the receiving end that's detecting whether this neuron has fired or not. Then then it may as well not have fired so the thing is like we need to be able to say that can a neuron detect a specific pattern that's not just being overwhelmed by data but can it actually detect a specific pattern to know whether some other neuron has fired or not to know what whether other neurons have fired or not specifically I and it's also like like, you know, we have.

06:34

There's also this this this thing of hebian learning where the you have connections that are strengthening between two or more neurons when they fire you see you see it's but it it is but how is that happening because when a neuron fires it's supposedly the the all the doubt all the upstream neurons are going to receive a signal so are all of those upstream neurons as are the connections between all the extreme neurons strengthened when that one neuron fires.

07:06

And well, I mean, okay, so I just do have to kind of formulate the question more clearly. I suppose these so the question is not really a neuron can detect pattern but is I mean, I suppose here you're want to have let's say I mean the highest. Level question is trying to ask whether I hate to use the word consciousness but for lack of a better word, I just borrow that the whether you're conscious of the the pattern and how that gets there, but of course, I mean, I am so even if you want to ask a question and that's to higher level questions want to maybe bring it down to simple level but not so simple is to just, Whether one to three neuron detect pattern and which we can definitely answer in the video permitted but something somewhere in between so so is that is that the correct characterization of what questions should be asked.

08:35

So I'm not going all the way to whether something is caught whether information is conscious or not. I think that is this that is a separate question do you see my question? I mean that this is the first part and second part so I'm asking I'm framing the question is that the high end low end and I just try to ask you those two are not the question you want to ask you want to ask something in between probably closer to the low end am I making sense or yeah yeah, so I'm talking about real like, We're.

09:10

Low end pattern detection. Yeah, okay, so that's that's the difficulty how. Do we frame this question the so do you want to have like.

09:33

So so we know from my single neuron it definitely detects a pattern but that's not you're asking so you are asking that two layer or something like that how they. Or or do they or how they detect? A pattern of is that the question and then and then also the another thing is how do we how do an observer determine how whether this group of neuron has detected the pattern is that okay is that so a good I am your question.

10:17

I don't know like I guess you're you're you you're. Coming from a I say so we need like a friend like somehow I have to bridge what I'm thinking to what you're thinking because you're in a different place and so what I'm thinking is that you know, we have in the context of like.

10:45

You have neurons that are predicting that they're going to fire right neurons are predicting that they're going to fire and they do that they do that because. They do that with the help of there's actually there's a process where the dendrites will fire before the action potential fires. And then and then before the dendrite fires, there's actually the, The receptors there's there's actually some sort of.

11:23

Activity happening in the receptors. That proceeds even the dendrite firing so the connections will have.

11:39

You'll be activity in the connections. I want to say is it? Let me see like a spike in the in the synapse. You can have it in my keyboard. I'm writing. I'm sure that we like writing. I'm trying to write but like I think my keyboard. We're ready. The spike in the synapse.

12:08

Are you typing it into the bio or something so so. Um, I am just typing into a notepad did you want me to type into my mind so I'm just whatever you're typing into something that we can see or you're attacking it for some other purposes and while talking to us so I so the the only purpose is for me to sort of visualize what I'm saying so that I can.

12:46

Sort of have like a so I can refer to some notes while I'm talking it's this is so. Handsome. Mike is like this is I would say your work my life's passion urine correct and they're created while we are alive, yes. Well, so I mean, so dendrites are part of every every neuron and and they make up the they they make up the bulk of.

13:25

Of brain tissue, they're very large.

13:31

So when you have the neurons facing so. There's space in between the connections but those connections are set up. See.

13:44

Receive the data. I am just going to say data, but like signal, right? Where it's coming from like a layman's terms well for the further most part which traveling between between synapses are neurotrans neurotransmitters, or just particles. But the patterns could be like so they're still waves and gravity going through a small crack.

14:15

S in that, right? Well. Yeah, yes. I mean, yes, there are there are brain waves a traveling. Through the through the brain, it's um. Yeah, I mean, you know when we get down to this ground level I and I think part of it is is if you have if you have a lot of caffeine you get down to this ground level where we're talking about these really.

14:47

I just feel I feel a little bit spacey when you get down to these like raw details like okay, so how do we think about this now okay? I've got brain waves right we've got that mean by prediction because you have to have there's a signal traveling so a signal has to be material signal and and what do you mean by brainwave?

15:19

The there's you know, the energy transportation. I mean, they the neurons neural neurotransmitters are basically the carrier of the energy and transmitting from the chemical with the chemical potential. I'll go ahead and. Transmit through the metric potential so you have to have some kind of physical process to do to go and when you say protection predicts what does that mean you have to have a signal before it predicts any prefer it predicts any simply you cannot.

16:12

I mean, you can say maybe is in preparation or something but has to there has to be a signal meaning physical process that triggers it right right so so we're talking by the way well. Welcome to Paul.

16:30

So it's about how neurons can detect information or how neurons can take patterns and distinguish those patterns from noise. I think that there's some you know, there's some people who maybe they work with neurons and they know they can just they can cause any neuron to fire by overloading it with with an electrical stimulus and by overloading it's it's inputs.

17:04

And or another kind of stimulus and but the idea is what I'm trying to like get at is how a neuron that is. In terms of biology is able to detect a is able to basically be set up to detect a certain kinds of patterns and to disregard patterns that are not the patterns that it's looking for like a neuron the idea is that a neuron could could be a specific pattern detector or specific information detector.

17:44

S do that yeah, how would a neuron do that and how would a neuron basically throw out the patterns that is not looking for it, you know, that's yeah. Well I guess I think of a neuron is basically a little bit like the the jury in a courtroom it's winning the evidence for and against and the evidence for comes in the form of excitatory inputs from other neurons and the evidence against comes in the form of inhibitory and process from individual arms and so it's weighing the balance of the evidence for against them if it means towards four then it fires so I think that's one way of thinking about it it's also an event-based detector so it's not you know, the this might great models can get a little bit misleading I think but basically the evidence has to come in within maybe a five millisecond.

18:32

And if it's enough to tip it over the threshold then it says hey this thing that I'm supposed to be looking for happened just now, you know just a few milliseconds ago so I think that's the that's the core framework and then there's a lot of ways in which dendrites can add a lot of sophistication to that analysis for example branches of the dendritic tree can do sub-computations and do sort of intermediate intermediate sub detection and if enough of those branches agree then that rolls up into the kind of an escalated cell level detection, that's one thing in there.

19:07

Was also you know spontaneous firing which had some complexity and anyway, I think. Okay sounds great but I okay well, I mean that the what you're saying I think is true but I'm just like I'm thinking well what if you had a lot of excitatory firing that that represented a pattern that was not with the neuron was looking for like was not with the dendrite we set up to look for and wooden neuron be able to like distinguish between a lot of excitatory pattern excitatory pattern firing.

19:51

That was not what it was looking for versus a lot of excitatory firing that is what it was looking for and so that's sort of like is there a way for a dendrite to distinguish between two kinds of excitatory firing to fire only when it sees the kind of excitatory firing that actually matches the pattern that it's set to look for.

20:13

Two ways that can happen one is the inventory inputs could just suppress stuff so some other part of the network knows that a certain thing has been found that's in contradiction with what this other neuron might be looking for in an ambiguous situation you can use the integratory projections on the other suppress all the other neurons with what's been determined and therefore suppress that activity that seems like one way to it could happen or the level of the network.

20:45

I don't know if that's that's kind of what you're thinking of so that it now yeah so that would be an example of of many neurons working together to detect patterns but do but within like, you know, so what I've you know been sold on is idea that are that are are dendrites themselves are like little computers that are and that are able to do some by implication that means the dendrite is a little information processor by itself so is a dendrite able to by itself detect.

21:20

Patterns without within an you know, distinguish between two different kinds of excitatory patterns and inhibit itself from from firing. Without without neighboring without a multi cell inhibitory process to is there any is there is there an inhibit an internal inhibitory process. For that end right thinking about individual neurons is that each neuron really has limited information you know 10,000 inputs might sound like a lot but that's out of you know, 30 billion cells in the cortex and so it only has a limited amount of information to go on and as a classifier, you know to either sort of spike or not spike is probably confronted with mostly and the US information most of the time and that ambiguous information might just slightly tilt one way or so you tilt another but it doesn't know for sure it's making an educated guess if you will and it's only what all the neurons do together.

22:25

In in interpolating across all these educated guesses and ruling out things with inhibition that the network as a whole is able to reach a conclusion, you know partly through let's say winner take all competition to sort of see where the most salient evidence for the proponents evidence is going to return to network level decision and I'm not sure that neuron is really is really deciding or detecting anything.

22:50

I feel like the neuron is mostly saying what's happening currently is, you know more likely than not possibly in this in this sort of zone that I've Sort of overtime evolved to be sensitive for but the neuron doesn't know what it means and it's wrong most of the time but only when added to the network signal you get a reliable output.

23:13

So I guess you're hoping that the looking it looks like you're looking for quite a bit of agency in the neuron and I don't know if an individual they're on has that much agency yeah yeah that is actually the question so I'm actually trying to sort of openly explore the granularity of of the agency of a neuron and the the deepness of the the pattern detection capability and pattern so yeah, no, so I do understand the sort of multi-cell idea of that you're describing and that that's that's really great but I I mean, let me just, Bring myself a second.

23:58

Okay yeah, so the other people are making us annoying as the next fun to meet myself for a second, but um. So but I know some I'm really because there is so what I was reading very recently was this book by Peter Peter his last name is TSC and and his his book is about the criteria criteria causation or the or you know, how neurons detect patterns and and and they can kind of be reset and I think there is.

24:37

I think that his book while it's very interesting is is coming into conflict with a lot of other researchers on who are at the state of the art examining the the amount of detail and so if so, I mean, there's a lot of people who are saying well, the dendrites is you know, this is capable of powerful computation by itself it's a neural network, but what exactly does that mean it, you know, some people want to reduce the neuron to what the neuron is doing is very simple and some people want to say well, it's very complex, but what is the actual degree of granularity of processing?

25:12

That's happening and I think we're getting statements all over the place we're getting you know people who are saying well, no actually it's gonna be the recognition of any kind of data or any kind of patterns gonna happen at the multi-cell level maybe at the at the at the neural circuit it a at the minimal neural circuit for what information is gonna be detected is gonna be you know a yeah, you know, at least it's gonna be represented by some neuro oscillation that's like 20 million neurons or something right and then someone else is gonna say that well, it's gonna the The minimum pattern detection is gonna be a mic a micro column or a column of cells that's where it's for a pattern is gonna be detected and and some people are gonna say well no a single neuron can detect a pattern we've got the Jennifer Aniston on neuron right and so that's only gonna fire when Jennifer Aniston is detected but is that let me invite these these people who just arrived up so Daniel and Nick I'll invite them.

26:16

And so the question is what was the name of that author by the way you mentioned the book Peter and his last name is TSE, so Peter the book didn't even the book is is the neural basis of free will criteria causation and he he's making an argument that a single neuron is a is an information pattern detector that can that can and what that means is it's not just firing when it's inputs or overloaded it's not just firing it for response to it an excitatory a blast from downstream neuron.

26:51

It is it is distinguishing between two different types of excitatory firing that are downstream one is an excitatory firing that contains the information pattern that it is set to look for and the other is it's it's self inhibiting the dendrite is going to self inhibit when it sees in an excitatory firing that is not what it's looking for, so he's arguing that how it is not what it's looking for.

27:21

Well so the idea is that it's it's going to reset its weights on the dendritic branches somehow and so that it's only it's going to like change the NDMA receptors that so it's only going to receive signals within a certain millisecond range that range is going to change depending on what it's set to look for and it's it's a there's other properties of the cell that are going to change so that it's only going to respond to certain to certain patterns and it's going to somehow inhibit or.

27:56

Throw. Out patterns that are not what it's looking for. So it's gonna do like a micro computation recognition that is seeing sort of like a single cell fractal of what the multi-cell pattern recognition is doing perhaps. And and like I said, you you talk to different people in different researchers and different areas and you're gonna get different answers in terms of the granularity of pattern recognition, whether it's single cell or multi-cell and so I'm just sort of like yeah open-minded about exploring what the answers could be here.

28:28

But I think there's a point that most folks would agree on I think sometimes when people tell a story they pick a sort of one kind of extreme end, you know, like the enteric nervous system, for example, you know, the nervous system they got through people who talk as if it's like a parallel source of agency that's you know, competing for control the body with the brain whereas it's just something specialized, you know for the gut.

28:49

And so everyone knows that a neuron has just like a single compartment that sort of sums up some puts and then you know fire is based on a threshold is oversimplified and that there's a lot more complex. On There's a lot of state that the neuron can have measured in internal calcium concentration also concentration of something called CAMP Cyclical KMP which is what all the trans neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine.

29:20

They sort of modulate the CAMP which then controls the neuros behavior over like a 20 or 50 millisecond time frame kind of to sort of tweak and tune the neuron and then calcium concentrations in the branch and the dendritic branches or even in the spines which is like little you could call them a micro branch with just a few.

29:38

Masses on it can have their own local calcium concentration that can tune that spine of which there are thousands on a neuron to you know, turn on or off or you know be slightly elevated or depressed. So there's quite a bit of state in the neuron. There is this view that the dendritic branches are like sub neurons in a network that are rolling up to the main neuron.

30:00

You sort of somewhere halfway between. It's not quite the same modularization as if there were really many neurons in a network but it's somewhere happened between halfway between that and the single compartment neuron and there's been a lot of attention on the criminal cells in the cerebral cortex that have a an apical part the part that's near the towards the surface of the the cortex that you know towards the outer layer which guess a lot of context information from other brain areas converging there and then the so-called basal part which is the part of the neuron that's the dendrites that are lower down.

30:37

You know you calm like the leaves by the apical part and the roots are these whole part and the roots are sort of getting bottom-up feature information whereas the the leaves are getting kind of top-down context information and then how those two types of information are combined can be controlled by the middle of the neuron and there's a theory of consciousness right now just out last night unless the leg last year proposing that the way these two compartments either are connected or disconnected locally within the neuron the fact what's happening with consciousness and how contacts and features integrated so those are some examples of A.

31:12

Like it is being explored with the neuro structure and how it competing, you know, quite a bit of computation when argument is that each individual spine is a little sub computational compartment that's rolling it signal into the the local dendrite region which enrolled it into the branches which enrolls it into the summa so all of that seems pretty reasonable.

31:29

I don't think any scientists would dispute that. Welcome neck have you had any immediate thoughts following what Paul and and the rest of us have been saying? I'm doing some nice injection right now.

31:49

Sounds good process. Now we're studying the the morphine response so yeah experiment feel free to concentrate. So hence did you have a view on some of this or you just trying to sort of resolve these sort of kind of different viewpoints about is a neuron just a single unit or is it a sort of a complex computing machine well specifically I so I'm trying to dive in deeper to how are like, you know, ample receptors and NDMA receptors differing but from from one another in terms of how they're affecting the dendrites activity, but then I'm sort of like wondering well, how is it the dendrites activity in detecting?

32:40

You know, because because in order for the dendrites to so the ampere receptor is going to be in the let me just make sure I have this correct. I might have it incorrect, but so the the spine that is. The the the spines on the dendrite are connecting to other cells is that correct?

32:59

I know this mine is just like a little kind of protrusion on the dendrite it kind of creates a little mini kind of peninsula you could say within the dendrite where there's maybe possibly two or three synapses just that little kind of spine offshoot. Is that they're from white pressure was no no so so yeah so the spine is a little peninsula that is that with my original impression, but then someone else did something that confused me and so then I was like wondering if that was connecting to another cell so we have this spines and then the dendrite also has the the boutonn's or this this synapses right that's the other the other see other thing that comes out of the dendrite so we have the dendrites have spines and then they have the boutonn's or which are that is that this what this this synapse that connects to the other cells.

33:53

I yeah the boutonn is just the way of thinking about so when two neurons touch each other the area where they contact sometimes has a broader surface area, you know, especially if it's a stronger connection it has to you know grow and kind of spatial extent in order to have greater surface area between the two neurons so that more neuron transmitter can pass between them and so that makes the the point of contact to become enlarged and you know kind of button shaped or kind of bubbles shapes which are the synaptic boutons, so you could have a like into a dendritic spine on the dendrite and you have to act.

34:28

All. Trans touching that dendrite one maybe with an excitatory input and one within it put for example and maybe there's a neuromodulator a synaptic input sort of nearby that's dumping dopamine diffusely and sort of area around that spine and a bunch of other spines so it's cutting all of those inputs and it might have you know, six or seven different receptor types on that one spine which include peppers which are the basic excitatory input and then and MDA receptors which are also excitatory but they have a lot of special properties and then you have the, Never receptors for the inhibition and then the different neuromodulatory receptor is for kind of tweaking that tuning of the neuron.

35:13

Okay, it's out of like you said that there were so as we were talking about buttons and there's different receptor types on the boot times you might have many different receptors on a single boot time and then it sounds like he said different receptor types on one spine is that what you meant to say that there are also reciprocines well what?

35:33

Side or the dead right side the axon side is just going to be releasing neurotransmitter that's its job the bouton on the dendrites side is you know going to have all the different neurons for integrating signals. So sometimes you just have a kind of a point-of-point connection like a one-on-one connection which case it's like one external bouton contacts one dendritic bouton and where there's two meat that's the synapse and there's this synaptic left which is the gap between them where they're transmitter passes that's one kind of one-on-one connection but you can also have these standard explains where instead of being just a single one-on-one connection is more like many to one connection where the dendritic spine is sort of the receiving unit compartmental unit and then there's you know, multiple different synaptic inputs converging on that dendritic spine.

36:26

So that's the conventional way but we've seen there's been new there's been new observations where people have observed signals traveling backwards where so the so the dendrite to the action. Right from the dendrite to the oxide yeah this could be a little bit. I mean that's not the direction of excitatory inhibitory transmission which is the main signal passing transmission, but cannabinoid receptors work at reverse, for example that goes from the dendrite back to the axon and they're more for regulating the homeostasis of the synapse.

37:06

And then I would surprise me through the other signals that travel backwards but there'd be maybe more kind of regulatory signals not single transmission type signals have to think unless you know, some new research. You mean with the cannabinoid with it the cannabinoids actually being released from the dendrite or do you just be like axle external?

37:30

I was thinking that I was thinking they cannabinoids being released from the dendrite and then affecting receptors on the axon side of the synapse so what I was thinking was that you know and the process of a neuron firing like it sends all the neurotransmitters from the, From the axon side to the to the post to the pre to the to the dendrite side but then when it resets you have a lot of neurotransmitters sort of coming back from the either get absorbed or they get sent back to the they eat the the the neurotransmitters even get either get absorbed into the the dense rights membrane or they get sent backwards to the to the to the yeah, this is just about how to neurotransmitters get recycled yeah, you know these sort of drop.

38:25

Dead so they can you know, take all the receptors but then they're recycled to be, you know retransmitted again and so they get reinsured by the excellent side, you know, if you have a dopamine axon it wants to read, you know, it's once a vacuum up it's dopamine so it can use it to do more neurotransmission and so the reuptake of the dopamine for example will be on the axon side, so it can bring it back into the axon and then we package it into vesicles and get it ready to release again.

38:54

The dopamine wouldn't get absorbed by the dendrite side the dendrite doesn't really have any use for it.

39:06

Okay and so and and that's and that's true for most transmitters acetylcholine is an exception, it's not reabsorbed it's broken down instead, but the others are all just reupt to be put back in ready for retransmission yeah go ahead so in terms of like I'm wondering you know, because I read this what was that one of the news items that came out was that the dendrites in human dendrites are different from my standardized because they don't it's they're they're a lot longer and that affects the sort of like electrical properties.

39:40

Of the of the dendrite it takes a lot more to to get it to fire but I'm wondering if that if that means that there's more if it takes if it takes longer if there's if that means that that that affects what a dendrite's ability to to consider its information criteria before it fires, is it somehow extended and that that's a really weird.

40:06

Sort of question to pose because I mean I guess you could just you know you could you could rush to say okay, no no no just that forget about that idea you can rush to throw it out well. I mean longer girls do mean longer transmission delays and since bikes are integrated within a three millisecond window, but it can take 10 to 20 milliseconds per signal to travel, you know, when one end of run around to another for example, if it has to cross over the hemispheres, so you do have these time delays going on which means that the information being integrated is from different points in time depending on.

40:41

What brand areas coming from so that's maybe one consideration but and I think spines are also more prevalent in human neurons than in rodents. I'm not sure about that but it wouldn't surprise me if that's the case. So I was reading I was reading the book the rhythms of the brain and and they're talking about how basically there's um, you know with EEG, they're just faceobok yeah yeah yeah and they're talking about how you know EG there's the there's the the one over f.

41:14

Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.

41:37

They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

42:11

The dendrite to fire. I'm not sure but but if it does then that would mean that there's. There's a different there's there's a different sort of clock pattern happening. Well the other thing is I'm not sure that dendrites are usually that long it's the axons that are long the axons right, you know, carry signal across the brain but they're all gonna converge on you know, the neuron is this synthetic trees only gonna go out.

42:39

I think a millimeter or two from the cell body location. And then the the block of the dendritic tree is necessarily a fixed property. I mean, it sort of compacts and extents pretty dynamically, you know in different certain conditions neuromodulatory states or whatever it's tend to, you know, increase the inputs into just primarily the dendritic you know, which is going to give a different response for a good amount of neurotransmitter release yes, so kind of one of the ideas that we're current that's when you block the current is sort of compacted space and you get a greater increase in that input resistance into.

43:18

The dendritic space and so basically you can think of it as removing a leak in that area and so for any given amount of excitatory neurotransmitter, you could have greater response. You're talking about kind of tuning the response behavior of the dendritic tree yeah yeah so basically like, you know, if we assume it to be a fixed property but I'm not sure in a normal brain that it's ever necessarily a fixed property because you know modulators aren't necessarily just released in the vacuum.

43:52

You're looking at a heart neurons. From yeah, just from the neurons actually brains them. I think. Later is another input can sort of tune the behavior of the dendrite of you know, one way versus another based on the news of the moment yeah absolutely in the retina when you light at adapt to dark lightness to be able to paint the dark and it takes while adjusting light those are biochemical modifications the dendritic response properties, so the circuits are actually being chemically retuned to work better in the dark or work better in the light, so not everything, you know, Those those sort of recruitings can take a while and have long lasting effects.

44:49

Yeah the nemesis of whatever studies the set point versus the game can of the system. So what I'm kind of wondering is how is the dendrite activity affecting the the when the the sodium and potent like basically the the sodium and potassium gradient like for example, if you you have the sodium crisis a positive releases this positive charge right that's going to open the calcium channels for for a duration, but then you have to pat potassium is going to release this negative charge which is going to it's gonna.

45:33

Almost almost immediately start this negative wave of energy, which is going to close those calcium channels pretty quickly and I'm wondering how does the dendrite activity sort of the resultant changes to the amount of to the to when the potassium starts it's? It's it's a it's it's it's negative release it's release of negative charge a little bit sodium is deposited one and chloride is the negative one so the inhibitory inputs from gather neurons that's chloride which is a negatively charged ion that comes into the cell and the positive excitatory inputs are sodium which is going through the effort receptors, those are main positive and negative inputs there is calcium, which has a whole special story and, The potassium is really more about maintaining the baseline firing threshold, it's sort of like a regulatory kind of voltage management system does not part of regular signal transmission.

46:46

It's part of like this sort of cycle of how the neuron fires and then how it resets itself, that's that's evolving fantastic. And it closed the opposite direction of the sodium passion flows from the inside out to sort of negatively affect the cell whereas the sodium flows from the outside in to positively affect the cell.

47:07

Well that makes it the inductance opioids like being careful and stuff are going to activate that sort of potassium flowing out through like a dark channel mediated process.

47:22

Okay well what kind of what kind of chloride is this I haven't haven't really heard of this before confused the in by the way. Nick do you agree with that is this chloride coming from this is kind of basic ionic transport across the cell for the neurotransmitters, you're basic one you primarily learn about sodium potassium sort of having a higher concentration outside than inside so whenever you you open up a sodium channel sodium tends to flow inside gradient, then the opposite being that for potassium, which is higher on the inside.

47:57

Of the cell versus the outside so if you open up the potassium channel you like a curved channel or something like that then potassium is going to flow out and a lot of the you know, patching stuff we have to be careful because anytime that you sort of create an artificial seal by breaking open the membrane you create a potential for leak and potassium tends to go out and sodium tends to flow in as well and so you can kind of get an artificial activity of the neuron based on just the diffusion gradients that are there and then obviously chloride which is your Primary negative ion within the picture I guess we could say in a lot of like all mentioned gaba, you know, it's it's primary mediators to chloride channel, so I definitely I I definitely missed out on chemistry class.

48:46

I didn't take it but I thought you have like you can have like a sodium chloride or a potassium chloride is chloride its own sort of separate thing that I say I guess I'm missing some data here, but I had a neuroscientist was explaining to me that it was that the the the action potential was the sodium becoming very.

49:07

Positive and potassium coming there, very negative and so this is just regular chloride it's not potassium chloride, it's not sodium chloride. Well potassium is positive charge. Yeah. Yeah, so separate out the action potential idea that's separately that's kind of a special process that's how the neuron does it's spike so the first is these ions the other individual atoms so sodium ions means natural sodium is just a single atom of sodium.

49:50

And the potassium ions are single atoms of potassium and the chloride ions are single atoms of chlorine and same with calcium so you got to these individual atoms and they're in solutions so you know salt is sodium chloride but you dissolve salt and water the sodium and the chloride dissociate you get pre-floating sodium atoms and pre floating chloride atoms in a solution of water, so that's kind of the situation in the cell, you've got used dissolved salt.

50:17

Is. Sort of atoms chloride.

50:55

Atoms to flow in and so that's how the positive and negative voltages get into the cell is these actual chloride and sodium atoms from sodium chloride table salt actually going through the pores of the cell and the pores are being open and closed by the neurotransmitters that's the basic idea about how the positive and negative signals are integrated and so the positive the neurons sort of maintains the membrane potential of something like actually.

51:23

I forget what it is, it's like negative 40 low volts. I don't know Nick do you know a hand? Seventies different neurons, but it says some negative value I can maybe a negative sixty per quarter neurons 90 to minus 40 usually yeah so so as those as the amp over receptors let that atoms in it goes up, you know from let's say minus 60 to minus 58 minus 505 minus 52 is getting higher and higher but then as some gamma things let the chlorine atoms and then it goes down again, you know back down to minus 60 minus 65 by 70 and so the chloride and the sodium are like once pressing the accelerator.

52:04

S into break and they're kind of setting competing signals pushing the voltage up and down inside the cell and if the voltage gets up above a certain threshold. I think it's like minus 30 or something then it turns this whole after potential process which is like this giant spring loaded reset process where all of a sudden a whole bunch of sodium atoms come in and the voltage spikes me up and then turn resists counter wave of potassium ions that all open up and as they all flow out and it's giant you know, see change it's like the whole thing kind of flips over with this massive voltage swing and it's that massive voltage.

52:39

That is the so-called act of potential which lasts for about a millisecond and then it propagates down the axon we're just sort of massive kind of waves sort of like the way that the football stadium where you know the wave then you do the wave or like falling dominoes would be another analogy those falling dominoes just trickle all the way down the axon and carry the signal to the end of the axon and that's the action potential and it's being done by this, you know giant wave of sodium atoms coming in and then potassium atoms going out Texas big signal and then around has to resettle that has to clean all that up but move all the items back to where they came from which takes a while.

53:17

Okay so initially the positive and negative inputs are the the the glute that there's the glutamate receptors and then the GABA receptors and when the glutamate receptors open up sodium atoms come in and they're adding a positive charge and when the GABA receptors open up the chloride atoms are coming in and they're adding a negative charge and at some point.

53:40

That's going to trigger the action potential to start because there's a because there's too much positive charge that is that right? By the charge builds up to a critical threshold point that then triggers the you know, sort of exponential opening of more sodium channels which then gives you that sort of all or nothing's like potential and then with it reaches a certain pot positive charge, then that triggers the you know, theoretical opening of the potassium channels and positive charge them close back out to sort of reset the membrane potential okay, so are the are the chloride atoms involved in closing the sodium channels or is it the potassium that's involved with closing?

54:28

The sodium there's certain channels. Well that's our voltage dependent and so depending on the voltage of the cell is going to dictate sort of the opening of the channel and so they go from open to once they hit a certain positive charge when they go to inactivated and then they or is it integral from open to close to inactivated or opened inactivated to close that I was going to mess up but regardless once the sodium channels open they sort of hit a positive charge that's then necessary for whatever the interaction between the charge of the file physical properties channel.

55:05

Causes the close until the cell goes back down to a negative potential that then allows it to sort of have another confirmation shift and that case when a rising or increasing amount of voltage within the cell then starts to open the channels again, so when people think of neurotransmitters is this thing that opens receptors there's also a special category receptors that are opened by voltage levels.

55:33

And those are the ones that causes avalanche domino effect to heaven. I'm so so what I'm asking this question because my my understanding of the role of the potassium has changed and in a bit so what would you how would you describe the role of the potassium at this point in in regulating the cell?

55:51

It does two things one is as a key part of this action potential process this sort of, you know, Domino's trigger this called the neural spike to a place a key role there is the thing that causes the spike to come back down to negative the sodium causes it to go up to a high positive type part of this bike and then the potassium brings it back down to the negative so it plays that role and then it also plays a role in just maintaining the the normal voltage level of the cell, it has like a baseline voltage that gets regulated the maintained with regulation.

56:24

Sodium, how does the potassium?

57:00

Is because the there's more potassium inside the cell that outside and so the potassium flows out. So sodium.

57:12

That's right, okay.

57:31

Then they flow in the direction of the concentration just based on the size, but one channel one poor will either be a sodium poor, it'll be a potassium poor candles and. I should get the same basically activity transmission.

58:40

Channels open and close much slower the sodium channels open way past but I'm not sure if that would even you know, I'm not sure if the the dynamics of that time dependency would even be matter for you know the cells so that sort of a different inverse where billion years ago, do we the cell decided in sodium in the inverse way or?

59:15

Just made in the lab replaced swapped sodium channels symmetric initial conditions.

59:50

Which were the excess sodium and potassium are inside or outside the cell that as well all biological cells every biological cell in the human body and all animals going back to sea creatures all have the excess sodium outside and the excess potassium inside so are the potassium receptors on the dendrite side or the axon side.

01:00:16

Oh, well, it is inside our cells outside the cell. It's not wet weather is the dead right of the axon. Is that if I swap them? Well, it's hard to imagine let's say there was no DNA, you only had RNA how many things work? Well, that's a very different universe.

01:00:38

That's not how biology evolved. Like how does that question relevant but okay. Yeah, there's that I mean potassium are sort of interchangeable atoms they both have a positive charge sodium's one of them's larger. I forget which one's larger probably my question is what makes them or something?

01:01:26

I think with the you know ion concentration and seawater the salt concentration is seawater and how that led early life evolving would be my guess. But we probably drifted from Mika wanted to understand channel mechanics. Well, when I want to know is um, how is the well the reason I'm trying to ask how does the dendrite affect potassium is because some researchers say they're saying that you know, basically that the the the potassium concentration is affecting the duration of the action potential.

01:02:16

And so I'm trying to figure out okay well if the action at the duration of the action potentials varying because of the concentration of the potassium. What's affecting the the concentration of potassium and how in and and you know is the dendrite effectness. So if the dendrite detects the pattern and it's able to trend if the it's a dendrite a detective pattern, it has to transmit that pattern to onward otherwise it might as well not have detected the pattern.

01:02:48

So the idea here is that detects the pattern and then it transmits it onward through the rate through by affecting the potassium gradient. Or potassium concentration and that affects the duration of the action potential. And so, I'm just I'm just I'm trying to figure out what are the mechanics of how the dendrite is affecting the potassium.

01:03:15

It and maybe that's just through the potassium receptors. Yeah, I'm not sure that anything is communicated within the cell using sodium and potassium or even chloride. It's all voltage. Those things are just adding positive and negative charges to the voltage because the voltage that is communicating that's allowing the communication happen inside the cell and to travel down the dendrite tax on for example.

01:03:39

In those changing the calcium change the actual spike time because I mean, obviously changing potassium is going to change the resting memory potential and even a change how close that cell is the threshold but I don't think it actually changes the actual time, you know, once you trigger the action potential does it?

01:03:57

Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, you hear these terms like neuron spiking neurons and broad spiking neurons. So I think just in terms of how the voltage get a channels are tuned Spikes might be, you know, kind of faster and shorter or that. How long they propagate but in how wide the waveform is but against this because I have a bunch of recordings going from you know where took the same brain slice one from three to fourteen millimeter potassium, and I didn't notice anything different when I was looking at the spikes already data and they seemed to pretty much be the same.

01:04:32

Yeah that is surprised makes. I thought it's not that's not the concentration it's the voltage level that's determining it. But I think it would have to be different not based on I see so making you're saying there's a researcher claiming that the potassium level is changing the waveform. Um that the potassium level yeah, yes it's changing the shape of the action potential by by by keeping the.

01:04:59

Calcium channels, open longer. With us I would make more sense The calcium channels. I mean the passing product I'm not less not as sure about but calcium channels are slower acting and that's actually maybe the other kind of key thing to get into the ion channel story NMDA receptors are kind of special.

01:05:20

They allow sodium in just like the apple ones, but they also allow calcium in but they don't allow calcium in a certain when they're in a certain state in a mode and they have to guess which into that mode and it takes like milliseconds to kind of so repeated.

01:05:37

Of the neuron to switch them into that mode and the energy NMDA channels are also part of molecules and then calcium effects longterm potentiation, which is long-term memory. So calcium's, you know closely involved in the cell learning and changing its behavior and adapting.

01:06:04

But we say it sounds like this sort of you know, spiked waveforming is sort of someone's desist or sort of you know, putting out this thesis that you know, the spike waveform shape might be playing some some basic role and and how a neurons. Work internally. So, I don't know if that's kind of a generalist got to be a neuroscience.

01:06:26

It sounds like this sort of a thesis that proposal this would have hypothesis and put out this maybe other trades at the moment. Yeah, but if it does get published though, let me know because like then I got to tailor the you know, spike sorting software that we have again.

01:06:39

Yeah, there's there's a lot more questions, um, they need to be asked to figure out exactly what's what's happening. Because um, if the if the cast, I mean at some point the the role of of sorting him in and chloride and potassium is affecting what's happening to the calcium receptors.

01:07:05

So, maybe the calcium channels are open longer, but, But I see that so what I'm trying to map out is okay, so how is what the dendrite is is detecting affecting the the sodium and the chloride and the potassium and how were they affecting the calcium and and then how is that affecting the the duration of the of the action potential?

01:07:30

And so I'm trying to sort of like get get, you know established the link here between because I think potassium has to has to play a role in in. In that in terms of the the duration of the calcium channels, but also how is the you know, how are the dendrites how's the dendrite effecting the potassium, you know, and and because the dendrite has to detect something and in order for something to be detected to be turned into a change in the act in the action potential waveform.

01:08:02

It has there has to be a process and so I'm just trying to figure out what that process is. Yeah. I feel like the potassium part is probably a minor part of the whole picture. I mean, if what you're interested in is what might be going on in terms of kind of complex interest cellular signal processing.

01:08:22

I'd look into calcium and CAMP. That's where a lot of the really complex machinery is.

01:08:31

Yeah and with that I gotta jump back to my experiments but my guys you want to look for how many of these different ionic changes affect the cell as far as you know, actually potential spiking voltage and voltage propagation. Many of the old classical patch clamp literature, there were just sort of defining the different intracellular solutions and the different exerciser solutions and different parts of the brain and then sort of how the different the leak currents within the the neurons themselves that are being recorded sort of changed the the bio-physical properties.

01:09:05

I guess we would say of. The voltage changes because a lot of it's just voltage changes perhaps, you know, there might be a little bit of overthinking from the just the ionic side like Paul said I think we're mostly complicated stuff comes sort of that second messenger systems, you know, like dependent changes in.

01:09:25

Signal propagation. I guess we'll say but anyways, thanks for the fun little conversation. I got to run guys, okay, yeah, thanks also I need to go back to the thing. I was working on I just got a sitter intrigued by the room the room pieces yeah, okay. I'm gonna close the room because I I'm at the gym and I got to exercise so thank you both thank you all right answer.

01:09:46

Nick and ball Paul have a great.

01:13:48

01:18:09

You.
