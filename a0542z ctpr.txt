(synap) Either date works.

The first step I usually make is to confirm a venue, the second step is to announce the event and seek speakers, demos, sponsors to fill it up etc.

How many people are you hoping to attract to your first event.

By the way SF VR has just confirmed the Microsoft Reactor for January 18th, it can hold up to 100 people, I am going to announce the event soon.

I can start inviting the speakers/demos that I reach out to, to your event as well, so they have the option to attend both events.

If you Katherine and Dan are interested in collaborating with SF VR the value is that we have a significant eventbrite list (I think it's like 12k) of people who have come to past SF VR events. A good size list can help on the event marketing front.

SF VR used to sell out venues that contained 600 or more. We would use a venue like the Grey Area Theater (on Market St) or Hack Temple (in North Beach) 

The Marriott and the Hyatt are sometimes used as venues for events, not very pretty in my mind. I like the Moscone Center but that is a big rental and it should take me a year of small events before I build up to that one. I also like the Mission Bay Conference Center, which looks very pretty, but unfortunately it's out of the way, not near the bart or the main traffic areas.

Of course the Palace of Fine Arts is high on my list since being an attendee at the Being Human event of 2012 was one of the main inspirations for why I decided to move to San Francisco so it's high on my list of places to attend.

I would like to help collaborate on big and small events, but we might need further discussion and more time to figure out the best way to collaborate. I should be set to bring MicrodoseVR to demo to your event on either date however so consider me confirmed for that.

Sincerely,
