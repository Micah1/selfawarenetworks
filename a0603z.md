Buck Institute scientists have discovered a new mechanism of how mitochondrial dysfunction begins, which could spotlight how to tackle the problem.

This paper illustrates an example of the idea that oscillations interact with other oscillations "Brain-wide interactions during hippocampal sharp wave ripples" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35561219/

I think it explains how needing to urinate can wake up the brain, because chemical messages can change the frequencies of brainwaves, more chemical activity from inflammed bladder, can, in a way similar to pain signals, interact with the existing brainwave state the way two oscillating frequency bands in close proximity interact with one another

I've simplified my work a bit for the next couple weeks. 1. I am hosting a discussion on PD & Brain Diseases on May 26. 2. This activity bridges two topics in my book. 3. I will release all of the reviewed notes on schedule and if there are any left over by June 1 I will try to review at least 10 a day to get them done weekly. One of the around 1000 notes today had more than 25 pages of content to scrub through, edit, summarize, categorize & chunk up. 

This will be like the draft edition of the book, published on github, shared with anyone, completely free. However from the draft edition I will create the first edition and that first edition will be sold on Kindle. Finally I think I will be activating github wiki. So the book draft content becomes an editable wiki, and my wiki on github will become the home location of the Science Institute I have been working on, which ties back into the discussion I am hosting on May 26th. 

for the  brain there is nust this field of tempospatial frequencies

the fast signal of needing to urinate wales the body to alertness with a flood of chemical signals?

no nerve pulses, the fast train of nerve pulses collides with a sleepy brainwave state, the interplay guides one awake

so the fast pace of pain signals causes increased alertness the source of the pain as two oscillators exert force on each other pulling attention or oscillation in a direction

Maybe you could wake someone up from a coma this way, essentially by inducing the right frequencies of brain oscillations, but it's unclear exactly what method, what place, and what kind of stimulation might help, adding to that is the question of tissue health, mitochondial health, atp production health, can the tissue even sustain new oscillatory stimulation?
