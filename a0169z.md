(oscillat, field, array) Oscillating Phase Fields of Awareness
Lets create a quiz to find out if you are a robot. We will build it with WebXR. We need to ask you some questions. First of all lets talk about your eyes, do your eyes contain a robotic sensory array called a retina that oscillates and sends signals to other groups of oscillators that oscillate thanks to the movements of metals inside and outside lipid sacks which separate into charges that propel sacks of chemicals to hit other oscillators causing them to displace their charges faster or slower resulting in oscillating phase fields of awareness that track fast & slow changes to the phase field and learn patterns from it overtime, eventually resulting in the comprehension of reality.

Do your ears contain a sensory array, from hairs sensors that vibrate with the influx of sound patterns, or mechanical vibrations challenged to a small scale by your ear drum.

Does your skin contain sensor-arrays called mechanoreceptors? Do all of the signals from all of your sensory arrays arrive at your brain at at somepoint interact with your
