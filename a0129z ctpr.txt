(LTD, oscillat) I want to expand on how an oscillator is like a photocopier?

because a large set of neurons are depolarized all at once, then another set by another neuron phasically firing, then another set depolarized by phasic firing, and so that set is now going to oscillator together. The neuron firing binds together an oscillating circuit component through the LTD process, and the neurons that fire as a result instead of being inhibited each puts another set of neurons into LTD which synchronizes them

When neurons depolarize together they oscillate together.

Lets say that they were all near the inhibited threshold? As

this is not a mechanism for oscillation or is it

how is LTD a mechanism for oscillation?
