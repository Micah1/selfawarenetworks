"The real breakthrough in brain evolution was the feedback loop in perception-action cycles. That allowed animals to be aware of the outcome of their actions." that was one breakthrough, even insects have feedback loops. I think a bigger breakthrough is the human astrocyte and neuron-astrocyte metabolism which may have key responsibility in the expansion of the human memory capacity, long term vision, and planning.
