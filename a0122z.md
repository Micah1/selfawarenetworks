Note created on Jul 28, 2013 but it appears that I've added to it since then.
(hebb, oscillat, graph, vector) I'm saying the nature of sensory experience is cycling synchronicity. Complex sensory experience is a synchronicity with several trillion oscillating parts per millisecond or something like that.

I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.


A brain is making a map of its own electric ossilations and chemical reactions. Synchronicity is not just electric, its chemical, we feel it and know it because the map of feeling is synchronized with the map of knowing and the map of hearing, wording, biking, seeing, smelling, legging, handing, breathing. All the maps in the mind, of your hand and face and the cheese you ate, the people you were looking at earlier, they are all connected, and then another Hebbian map connects it all again.


Do you think notions are attractors that you are running? Or do you think notions are attractors that are running you?

An example is, if you have an idea that there is a strong connection between religious fanatics predicting the end times and the return of messiah, with the AI doomsayers claiming that Artificial Intelligence will be the end of human existence, and it's all you write about lately, then is the idea running you?

Don't let notions control you, use you, and abuse you. These ideas are not the boss hehe. They are not programs that have enslaved the flesh of humanity.

So my more updated view of attractors is that our memories are attractors, our long term (unconscious) memories as synaptic connections and our active (conscious) memories as the tonic brainwave oscillation, both types of memories are attractors that drive brainwave oscillations, drive changes to brainwave activity patterns, and drive decision making (brainwave oscillations, representing the state of our memory system, physically drive our actions, and our choices, through the principles of oscillation inside the brains 3D neural network architecture.
