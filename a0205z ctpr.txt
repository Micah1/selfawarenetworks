I have a hypothesis that it's a mistake to be annoyed by others. It means that other people are not living up to your expectations . People are not matching your vision of what could be. This annoyance becomes the driver of imposing one's will on others. So then an invisible ego is causing you suffering in the form of annoyance because of this desire to impose one's will on others. The only way to break that annoyance is to realize it's a mistake, then a lower oscillation pattern will enable change that relieves the annoyance. When I realize that I have made a mistake, when I see that I am wrong, my brain switches to a lower frequency oscillation that enables change.

""What they saw in those rats compared to rats who didn't get the drug, was that the low-frequency waves did not occur in the motor cortex, neurons there did not fire coherently and the rats did not alter their subsequent behavior on the task.
Although the researchers were able to study the cognitive mechanisms in the rats in more detail than in humans, the direct parallels they saw in the neural mechanics of adaptive control were significant.
"Low-frequency oscillations facilitate synchronization among brain networks for representing and exerting adaptive control, including top-down regulation of behavior in the mammalian brain," they wrote."" http://www.sciencedaily.com/.../2013/10/131020160731.htm
