(tomography, hippocampus, LTD, thalamus, oscillat, field, synap, cortex, fourier, ATP)  evidence that synaptic configurations are how at least some of our memories are stored. https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-scientists-gain-brain-cells.html

memory via synaptic configuration is one argument but it does not exclude other possible ways for the brain to transmit data as acoustic waves & mechanical wave patterns, with or without microtubule memory systems that might re-configure synaptic configurations, and it does not exclude the idea that the cells magnetic dipole shape might be changing the brains phase field which might effect charge buildup in one area or another at the synaptic scale. With all three memory times potentially affecting synaptic configuration there are 3 intertwined sensor modalities storing correlated time series of wave patterns with dimensional characteristics (amplitude, frequency, and mechanical to electric-acoustic soliton wave forms inside the envelop defined by the frequency / amplitude inverse relationship. So its like the pre-synapse is a loud speaker that spits, and the post synapse is like a microphone that counts spit as a charge build up (ions & atp) and then various stages of energy release happen cumulating in an action potential that in a sense is transmitting a phase pattern to its post synaptic network, the network sort of magnifies the pattern, deconverges it, and multiple patterns overlay each other, from different neurons to different areas of the brains network

the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.

I think it could similar to the "voting" process described by Jeff Hawkins from Numenta was talking about in his book "A thousand brains" How the brain could be making many slightly different representations, maybe thousands, in each area of the cortex, to represent the same things with different sensory perspectives.

I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Their (the post-synaptic group of one exit terminal) group shared a common temporal oscillation (the LTD neurotransmitter event) so they fire together, and the next row then fires together, the whole oscillator simulaneously learns many versions of the same pattern everywhere, stored in the synapses, but magnified in the vertically oscillating cortical column, and magnified horizontally across the brains interneurons between pyramid cells, plus the other highly connective brain areas. Including the corpus callosum, the parietal temporal junction, the thalamic bridges and this high level horizontal pattern might be coordinated with help from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which may also have an oscillator that is magnifying learned firing sequences. I am preferential to the idea, written about in "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins" that the cortical column is actually functionally mimicking the grid cell and place cell everywhere in the brain. That's interesting especially if this idea of consciousness being a rendering or an image that has to exist somewhere now has to include some idea of how the results of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop connects to the thalamus in way that might bridge information with the neocortex otherwise
