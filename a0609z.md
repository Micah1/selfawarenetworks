Note Cypress Gratitude is Micah Blumberg, Cypress was a name I used on faceobok for a while before changing it back to Micah.

In the book "On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee" http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B003J4VE5Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1327776084&sr=1-1 the authors detail how thinking works, how your entire experience of "this world" is taking place in your neocortex, a thing that is about the size of a placemat folded and scrunched up on top of your older mammallian brain inside your skull. This neocortex has 86 billion neurons, but essentially there is one simple self similar repeating pattern that processes all of intelligence, all your senses, perceptions, thoughts, feelings, smells, sounds, visual thoughts, things you see, things you know about yourself, all your facts, opinions, all of this is processed with one simple mathematical process. HTM, Heirarchal Temporay Memory, aka PREDICTION, and PREDICTION is so good as a brain theory there are now machines that see video the same way a human see's video. With software and machines modeled on neurons humans have made artificial intelligence that can see, hear, smell, and perceive patterns even with artificial senses that humans do not have access to.

What I say is just another view, not to replace your views, not to challenge other views held by others, in my view there are no right views, only views, so if you don't like it, don't complain to me, to me it's just another view, I have no attachment to any view, so no view bothers me :) try on that way of seeing things, you will cease to think that trolls exist, because nothing will irritate you

what you see is a thought, a visual thought in your visual cortex, look at this http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/
Scientists use brain imaging to reveal the movies in our mind

Imagine tapping into the mind of a coma patient, or watching one’s own dream on YouTube. With a cutting-edge blend of brain imaging and computer simulation, UC Berkeley scientists are bringing these futuristic scenarios within reach. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and computation...

Cypress Gratitude also reported by BBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13428627

Researchers 'decode' brainwaves
www.bbc.co.uk
Scientists believe they are a step closer to being able to read people's minds after decoding human brainwaves.

Cypress Gratitude you have a neo cortex, and part of that neo cortex is dedicated to processing visual information, that's how they are able to listen in on the signal and decode your brainwaves

Dairin: Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling (the five senses), reveal brain activity, but it does not prove that brain activity is thought.
