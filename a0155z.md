If you have the open github version of this book please share the book and recommend that people buy copies of the book to show their support of the word being done at the Self Aware Networks Institute for Artificial Neurology, Medical Research, Brain Interfaces.

The more books we sell the faster I can grow the Institute.

I intend to build a WebXR version of this Institute that expands on all the ideas presented in this book with references to both historical works and the latest science & technology.

Extropic Oscillations increase total entropy overtime as they dissipate. If they sync the total entropic signal is magnified in an area, its like 

Bose-Einstein Condensate

Imagine a spherical mass like earth is creating like an electromagnetic Boss-Einstein Condensate in terms of causing the invisible lines spacetime eminating from the sphere to converging together

maybe its broadcasting out this broad vertical wave and its causing other larger objects nearby to fall into.

I am suggesting that the curvature of spacetime might be the electric & magnetic fields of the earth reacting to the magnified signal of earths EM phase field reflections

the combined reflection of oscillating mass might multiple like a laser like the Bose-Einstein Condensate

the idea is that its not directly attractive, its increasing the chances that something 

I muse, not in a serious way, about there being an original oscillation of the cosmos, that may have been a bose-einstein condensate, and if it existed at the beginning of the universe, it was the result of all possible oscillations in Synchrony.

Rather I imagine that the original state of the universe as being a single oscillation between location existence and the velocity existence which is the interval of time during which it doesn't exist in a location. As it decayed it would divide into smaller oscillations, a whole quantum field of them, and they could grow, combine, and form complex structures like people, planets, stars, dust, and water.

When I was young, because of stories I believed that dreams contained powerful and essential visions of the future so I trained myself to remember my dreams and to be able to articulate them well, I think this is a contributing reason to why I can remember and describe many of my psychedelic experiences as well

The human brain is literally a dissitipative system in a quantum phase field, but the descriptions of the calculations it does are perhaps far removed from our descriptions of how quantum computation works

The book is largely already written and the final pieces are falling into place.

I wish and I hope for healing around the world, so everyone can heal from past and present trauma. So that human beings are not unconsciously causing harm to others and themselves because of the reverbations their actions inevitably create because your likely behaviors can be deduced with artificial intelligence eventually.

I would describe my kundalini awakening through pain (I broke my arm falling in a crash that happened on my electric unicycle) as seeing the infinite horizontal scope of both my consciousness and reality.
