hameroff & peter tse

Hameroff is a woo woo sounding guy fasho, but I don't think that's "how" he arrived at his conclusion that the conscious experience involves quantum mechanics.

I think he was searching for some longer term memory than could be provided by the mechanism of strengthened synapses, something that could also both learn and react within three milliseconds and his answer was that inside the synapse the CaMKII interaction with micro-tubule was just the ideal mechanism to both store long term memories, and somehow alter the spiking in terms of either amplitude or frequency.

IF quantum mechanics is a random or non-random element that interferes or alters the spike trains that *may begin at the microtubule (*if Hameroff is right about the origins of spiking)

THEN human thinking would have an element of the quantum interfering with our normal programming.

Note: I am not in support of woo woo conclusions. I just think that the driving motivation for that direction in his research had to do with finding a mechanism of long term memory potential that was also fast enough for what we know the brain is mechanically capable of. The woo woo stuff was probably after market flourish, and incidental to his actual work.

There was something that bothered me about Hameroff's woo woo, and that bother's me about Peter Tse's work as well. It's the idea that by introducing the quantum, by introducing randomness, you are introducing unpredictability, this idea they seem to claim is leverage against determinism, they think it means freewill. That is an annoying sort of claim.
