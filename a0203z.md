I believe that connections between nerve cells are mostly random and also fractal. I think that the shape of organs and the body is the result of gene interactions, and morphogens

and protein attractors http://phys.org/news/2014-06-team-theory-cells-differentiate.html

because of these (call them epigenetic?) mechanisms, my bet is that hard wired instincts are not wired, but instead are statistically likely behaviors based on the structure of the biology

The pyramid cells in layer six of the neocortex that have up to two hundred thousand connections to other cells are thought by some to be connected to be like wake up cells, they need lots of connections to sort of wake up the whole brain and get all the other cells into a tonic state of essentially Gaussian oscillations.

DNA is involved in the structure of the brain and I have brought a couple links to explain how that is possible.

1. First of all dna acts as a switching mechanism, that causes cells to differentiate at different times through a rather simple chemical process http://phys.org/news/2014-06-team-theory-cells-differentiate.html 

2. The overall shapes of the various parts of the brain are accomplished through morphogens that systematically activate or inhibit where cell growth occurs, resulting in the familiar body shapes we all see in biology.

Synapses, the connections between nerve cells, are thought to be mostly randomly formed, being both Gaussian and fractal in overall distribution.

I believe that every human has the right to know how their own brain, mind & biology works, because with that knowledge you gain the agency to fully accept yourself & others, & the knowledge of how to heal yourself & others. Ideally I want every student to learn neurophysics.

However there are situations when tiny transcriptomic errors, from something someone may have eaten accidentally, or resulting from some injury, that could lead to cascading effects such as in PD, that lead to corrupt decision making. So I proposed a Medical Justice System.

but I was not the first to propose the idea of a merger between Medicine & the Justice System. I recommend the book Incognito by David Eagleman for his take on the future Medical Justice System (It's where I got the idea for my proposal)
