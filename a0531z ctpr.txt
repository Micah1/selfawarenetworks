(LTP, neuralink) someone asked if Neuralink could recover memories from before the age of 4.

The answer is no, Neuralinks initial year one functionality is not designed to recover memories.

If you can't remember your life before the age of 4 how is a computer supposed to recognize and identify memories from that part of your timeline, assuming they are still in your brain somehow

Also are the memories of people between the ages of 0-4 in the same format as your memories now? or are they more abstract, weirder, and not really coherent to adults or to anyone even if you could pull them out of your head?

Long term memories or LTP (P for potentiation) involve new protein synthesis, and actual change in the structure of the brain that is part of how memories from a very long time ago can sometimes play themselves back in your memory. If babies between 0-4 even make long term memories we would be able to see the stages of LTP happening in their brains including the new protein synthesis that happens not only when memories are stored but also when they are recalled. (Recalling your old memories changes them a little each time) The goal would be to stimulate your brain in such a precise way as to trigger your brain to play back neural firing sequences that represent memories from the first 4 years of life.

However if long term potentiation does happen the brains of people between ages of 0-4 then it should be possible to recover those memories which brings us back to what I argued earlier which is will those memories even be coherent, with they make any sense? Will it be a lot of jumbled together nonsense? I don't know, or will we see clear photos of the people around them somehow extracted by neural networks and devices like neuralink.
