a0254z contrasts & compares Michael Levin's genius work to some of the ideas that I've developed.

I realized in January 2023 that I was more influenced by Michael Levin's work more than I realized but I had forgotten his work and his name until recent. This note is about sharing his wonderful work as a significant influence to some of my earlier ideas about COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, as well as other authors like Jon Lieff MD, Steven Strogatz, Giorgio Buzsaki, Jeff Hawkins, Peter Tse, and many more people that helped lead to my concepts about consciousness via entification through oscillation
which I arrived at differently from how Michael Levin came to his idea of consciousness, because I was more consciously studying & juggling together ideas from Georgio Buzsaki, Steven Strogatz and Jon Lieff

I realize now that/need to talk about Michael Levin's incredible work given the strong similarities between ideas that encompass Cellular Oscillating Tomography and my concept of consciousness via entification through oscillation, not just because of the similarities but also because of the differences. The differences are what make it interesting.

I remember having seen or read the story of the beheaded worm that had been reprogrammed
to grow two heads or two tails (Michael Levin's work) and I remember reading about the idea of consciousness being related to a morphogenic bioelectric field (I may have seen the paper)

But I hadn't really looked closey at Michael Levin's work in detail until January 2023 after he was mentioned by Joshua Bach as having similar ideas for what consciousness, ideas that sounded very similar to what I've been writing about. Actually I have a number of podcasts called the Neural Lace Podcasts that predate my work published on github where I share some of my earlier ideas, and I started an EEG Salon with conumer EEG hardware in 2012, and I led the Neurotech SF Salon for 2 years hosting many speakers, utilizing many medical imaging technologies and interfacing with many people in San Francisco's medical imaging community, including medical professionals associated with UCSF.

I decided to look back at Levin's work before June 2021 when I published my ideas on COT in June 2021 and I found Levins work his ideas that are similar to COT predates my ideas by many years.

Obviously therefore I must conclude that his work influenced my work on some level of my consciousness even though I had forgotten his name as a researcher. The more I thought about it the more I became comfortable with the idea, and the more I started to recall his two headed worms and his bio-electric morphogenic field concept of consciousness, and it's plausible that I even encountered his comparison of cells & bodies of cells to an artificial neural network without consciously realizing it. So I have to give him credit as a forgotten reference for my 2021 (COT) Cellular Oscillating Tomography Conjecture. So Michael Levin as a forgotten influence, one of several influences I had intended to mention in my book, will join the list of reference to my 2021 conjecture of Consciousness being accomplished via Entification of many smaller sensor transmitter systems into a unified sensor transmitter being via the principles of oscillatory synchrony as outlined in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.

Neither of us is the first to think about the cell as a computer that sends & receives signals. Neither one of us was the first to consider how cells might form a kind of computer system known today as a neural network. Clearly Donald Hebb was contemplating that at least as early as 1949 when he launched his famous book the Organization of Behavior.

But in looking at Levin's long history as a Biologies I found that he wrote about the cell having the same receptors that neurons had, and speculated about ordinary cells functioning as an artificial neural network long before I wrote down the idea of COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography in 2021. So I think I have to have been influenced by his work in that even if what I wrote is slightly different in important ways than what he has written.

My truth is that I came to the COT idea separately and via a different path, despite having been influenced by his ideas. For example at the time I was reading Jon Lieff MD's book "the Secret Language of Cells" and I had been reading Jon Lieff's blog for years, and it was in thinking about T-Cells and their complex interactions with neurons that I then thought about the fact that receptors on all cells were just like receptors on neurons, and thus were subject to Hebbian learning. So I don't feel like all of my ideas about Cellular Oscillating Tomography were influenced by Levin, but some influence was there. I want to say this because while his work predates mine I walked my own path to arrive at my own conclusions on my own timeline, unaware of the full extent of Michael Levin's work.

Who hasn't wondered at some point in their life whether plants or basic tissue such as your hand could be conscious?
I suspect Michael Levin's theory of consciousness came from needing to explain how cells were unified into a coherent system, and electric fields afforded a plausible way for cells to be unified especially as a dominant paradigm in biology has been that cells communicate via spikes (a notion that I disagree with, cells communicate via waves, spikes don't travel between cells they travel between the soma and the exit terminal).

but in terms of how I came up with my idea of Consciousness I feel like I may have been more influenced by Nicholas Humphrey's book Soul Dust, Douglas Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach & I am a Strange Loop, and an EEG book called Symphony of the Mind, in terms of my early ideas of trying to think of the brain as a single but complex system capable of conscious representation likened by some to an orchestra of many parts.

So I think the idea of the brain as an orchestra of parts, unified by some sort of signal transmission was not new, and not original, but then I read 2005 On Intelligence and 2006 Rhythms of the Brain by Giorgio Buzsaki and it seemed that brainwave synchronization was a natural fit to the problem of attention binding, and there was a wave of studies that lasted years about how Gamma Waves might be the glue that bound together consciousness.

I think it was Peter Tse in his book "The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation", who clarified my understanding that synchronized neural signals are not meaningful, and my understanding from working with EEG myself, as well as talking to Professional Medical Imaging people from UCSF that led me back again to the strong conclusion that synchronization by itself wasn't enough to describe consciousness, it just wasn't meaningful, quite the opposite, brainwaves were regarded as noise.

Information, I learned to understand, needed to be differentiated from the synchronized brainwave pattern which was guassian in characteristic, like pink noise.

Later after reading Lindsay Grace's wonderful book, Models of the Mind, I connected this concept that I had learned to Information Theory by Claude Shannon. In Information theory most meaningful information might be the most rare, or most novel, and the most common information pattern is the least interesting, and the least informative.

Gamma waves by themselves are not informative if they are all the same, but perhaps the interplay of Gamma waves with Alpha or Beta waves might cause tiny but meaningful deviations in the powerband brainwave frequencies that were actually meaningful to the brain, because those deviation represented attractors that changed the timing of the brain activity, encoding a new pattern, resulting in a new affect.

There is plenty of research that shows that Alpha waves and Beta waves are not homogenous, they do have tiny differences in frequences encoded in the powerbands, there are effectively many Alpha frequencies that band together for example, and the same is presumably true for all the power bands, Delta, Theta, Beta Gamma, High Gamma, and beyond.

When I came up with the idea of Consciousness as a single unified sensor/transmitter system consisting of smaller sensor/transmitter systems, I was thinking about Stephen Strogatz's descriptions of fireflies synchrony, and clock sync and his descriptions of neurons as oscillators that synchronize via signal transmission

and this is why I don't emphasize
well it's part of-why I don't focus on electric transmission,
its why I didn't think of consciousness as something specific to a morphogenic electric field, but as something substrate invariant to any signal type. A conscious system could transmit for example only light signals, and good grief to open another can of worms it is interesting thta Stars transmit light signals, it makes you wonder what kind of Galactic  Scale Synchronization patterns might be discovered, and perhaps this has consequences for pattern formations in the night sky? Some have argued that the distance between Stars is too great for a cosmic mind via light signals, but lets get back to the main topic for now.

You could have a conscious brain that consists of clocks that communicates via light signals or vibrations, it does not have to have a morphogenic electric field, this clock brain is conscious because it reacts as a single system while consisting of many separate sensor/transmitter parts, which are entified into a fractal that is an emergent property of their synchronization via signal passing, and in my work I mentioned all signal types that pass between cells, electric, magnetic acoustic, mechanical force, heat, chemical.

It's interesting that neurons are sometimes compared to clocks, essentially our cells are biological clocks, and that makes a human being the fractal of a clock in a sense, inside a clock universe because everything that is a thing is a dissipative system from at least one valid point of view, and a dissipative system is isomorphic to a hurricane on some level, or a vortex, a cyclone, a galaxy, or a clock, something that is a body of smaller clocks or gears that rotate, with the system maintaining it's equalibrium, by consuming energy and exporting entropy to the surrounding environment for as long as it lasts (credit to Ilya Prigogine for dissipative system perspective on life)

Do you see my work while having similarities and influences from biology and plausibly from Michael Levin's work was fundamentally making a different argument in 2021 when I published it?

My argument is that consciousness is not an electric field thing, it starts with entification via a bed of oscillatory synchronization and this bed of oscillatory synchronization is what I describe as the canvas of consciousness, or the ground of being to borrow a phrase from Zen Buddhism, and with the past research on Gamma Waves we can get to that at least.

My argument is different in that I argue that it is differentiation, from phase wave differentials, (not from electrical spikes, and not from electric fields inherently, but from signals passed via the electromagnetic spectrum that encompasses all types of wave shapes at all scales), that difference or phase wave differential acts as the ink of distinction making for a conscious entity from a brain, to a collective of fireflies, because I thought about how in Steven Strogatz's example of fireflies if one firefly vanished because a frog had snatched it out of the air with it's tongue then the whole hive of fireflies would notice because their collective signal synchronicity would be off put by the vanishing of that one fire fly.

This same concept led me to believe that when a cell fired or was damaged in the brain, or the body, the entire body would eventually feel it, because the signal would change all of the signals of all the cells of the entire being via the principles of oscillation.

This would change the organism's expection, or the conscious expectation of a collective of fireflies, because all of their signals would literally be changed by the change in one of them.

According to the theory of Sync the book by Stephen Strogatz, which describes oscillatory physics, everything is affected by everything else eventually.

Maybe we arrive at our similar ideas via different paths, but eventually ideas spread, and we all become aware of them. That said there are similar ideas between arguments that I make and many other types of theories. Every modern scientific thinker seems to have been influenced by Zen Buddhism to some degree.

So what I will do is when I create the chapter about my inspirations from Jon Lief's work, Steven Strogatz's work, and all the other names I plan to mention in my book, I will now include many references to Michael Levin's wonderful work. 

Here are some references to Michael Levin's work that I found today.

Now perhaps we can do some comparison and contrasting between what he (Michael Levin) has been saying all along, and what I have been saying since June of 2021 (but also before then) so that from the differences we can perhaps gain new insights into how our ideas different and perhaps learn something new.

To start with since I think his ideas must have influenced me but are different in important ways it is useful to explore them in more detail to examine what is different and to ask why. So a deep dive of comparison & contrast is in order for the purposes of discovery.

Here is a 2012 Paper he wrote "Morphogenetic fields in embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer: Non-local control of complex patterning"
"A true understanding of the signals underlying this process would enable rational control of growth and form, giving rise to regenerative medicine applications that correct damage done by birth defects, degenerative disease, cancer, traumatic injury, and even aging. Similarly, a mature understanding of the origin and regulation of shape, including its genetic and epigenetic aspects, would deepen our understanding of evolvability (Gilbert et al., 1996; Goodwin, 1994) and have untold benefits for the nascent field of synthetic biology - the bioengineering of functional artificial systems using principles and building blocks abstracted from the biological world (Davies, 2008)."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413735/

I found in particular a paper from 2019 that explains his theory of consciousness in
the body as a morphogenic bio-electric field, and finding this felt reassuring to me.
"The Computational Boundary of a “Self”: Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition"
"Most of the prior discussion focused on objective, functional traits, and capabilities and is compatible with several views on consciousness. Nothing in this model explains why specific functional features give rise to first-person experience (the so-called Hard Problem)"
"a pancreas, in its striving to keep homeostasis, has any self-awareness in the human sense, but it may have as much proto-consciousness as a simple neural network" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923654/

My theory of Self Aware Networks specifically address the Hard Problem of Consciousness, he talks about Zen ideas of conscoiusness, and considers how the pancreas might have some proto-consciousness, meaning he believes the pancrease lacks self awareness, but is still a conscious system, and I agree.

I also found an article from early 2021 "The Link Between Bioelectricity and Consciousness
BY TAM HUNT March 10, 2021 from Nautilus that mentions his ideas on consciousness connecting it to bioelectricity"
https://nautil.us/the-link-between-bioelectricity-and-consciousness-238148/

November 2021 here is his argument about the collective intelligence of cell swarms and he connects it to the concept of artificial intelligence. Which is super similar to my conjecture about COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography (June 2021) but it's clear to me from looking at his other work that his ideas that led to HIS conclusions predated mine. I just arrived at similar conclusions via a slightly different path than the path he took. I honor his incredible work which I completely believe is truly believe reflects his life's work. I doubt he encounted my page on github about Cellular Oscillating Tomography.

March 2021: An interesting news article mentions Michael Levin's work 
"A NEW THEORY LINKS CONSCIOUSNESS TO BIOELECTRICITY

By May 2021 his primary theory for how Cells are united into Conscious Systems via morphogenic bio-electric fields, he does not mention Entification via Oscillatory Synchronization which is my argument based on a fusion of ideas from many authors.

Nov 13, 2020 "COGNITION ALL THE WAY DOWN BY MICHAEL LEVIN AND DANIEL DENNETT AT AEON.CO 13 OCTOBER 2020
"Cognition all the way down by Michael Levin and Daniel Dennett at aeon.co 13 October 2020
"AGENCY IS ON A CONTINUUM OF EVOLUTIONARY OUTCOMES.
"Agency is not a distinct category separated from the category of mechanistic processes. Levin and Dennett illustrate this point using the biology of cells. Any cell with an information-processing capability, and they all have one, has some degree of agency. All this needs to mean is that cells have goals. That sounds like anthropomorphism. But it’s not really. It is just a matter of explaining what the cell does in accessible language. Does a cell understand what it is doing? Is it aware of what it is doing? No, of course not. That is another matter. Or is it? That is the big question. Is consciousness on the same continuum? The authors duck that question in this essay, although Dennett has addressed it head-on elsewhere."

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00902/full

I would say that another difference between my path and his is that I had a theory of phenomenological consciousness aka the Solution to the Hard Problem via my NAPOT theory Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography and I worked backwards from that to hypothesis that regular cells could be components in conscious systems, whereas he came to that conclusion without any theory related to the Hard Problem. It wasn't until after I developed the first version of NAPOT theory that I thought about generating COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, and the Tomography part was the most difficult because it essentially argues that a cell tracks and communicates via coincidence detection in receptors, and that coincidence detection becomes the cross section concept in Tomography which is about creating images from cross sections which are coincidence detections that allow a cell to infer an information pattern from signals passed between cells.

As far as I know his work mentions receptors and learned patterns but it does not mention tomography, cross sections, coincidence patterns, or cellular pattern development, and cellular pattern communication via the same methods employed in tomography.

Biological Holism: A New Paradigm?
by Waddington
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QpByFkccNFNCakWeN/biological-holism-a-new-paradigm

Oh this next one is fascinating:

November 2020 "How Do Living Systems Create Meaning?"
"2. Meanings Require Reference FramesBateson famously defined a “unit” of information as a “difference which makes a difference” ([56] p. 460).As Roederer points out, information so deﬁned is actionable or pragmatic; it “makes a difference” forwhat an organism can do [57]. It is, therefore, information that is meaningful to the organism in acontext that requires or affords an action, consistent with sensory-motor meaning being the mostfundamental component of language as broadly construed [6]. It is in this fundamental sense thatmeaning is “enactive” [19]"
"Such “engrams”may be implemented by single cells, local ensembles of cells, or extended networks connectingcell ensembles in different parts of the brain, and hence may be encoded by patterned activity at the intracellular up to the functional-network scale [48,49]."
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345815728_How_Do_Living_Systems_Create_Meaning

fascinating but still handwavy, meaning in "encoded by patterned activity" there is no conjecture about how the cell encodes and decodes specific patterns that have specific meaning like my theory, it's just like [a pattern happens somehow in neural activity so lets call it patterned activity]

COT argues that cells make a pattern from detected coincidences (cross sections) that are unified via oscillations (if they are the same frequency they synchronize) and the result is a tomography process of cellular pattern development of signals that leads to understanding how cells generate, transmit, and also receive patterns from other cells.

"Endogenous Bioelectric Signaling Networks: Exploiting Voltage Gradients for Control of Growth and Form"
https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071114-040647
This paper above in particular is amazing and I want to come back and read it again several times.

As I look over these references I just have profound and growing respect for Michael Levin's work and his genius. Amazing.

When I mentioned in another note on the github for the Self Aware Networks Institute github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks that the future would include custom organisms, I was probably thinking of Michael Levin's work in part, and perhaps a little bit of Blade Runner and some dreams from childhood about being chased by eyeballs and other weird & scary organisms.

"The science of the “self” — explained by a biologist | Michael Levin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5GDnD_WA2Q 

Wow, his concept of self development of the self, described in the video above, is profound and different. My concept of Self in Self Aware Networks is that the self is at the root a direction concept within the contex that the brain is for highly coordinated movement, that directional concept points the the source of causation that comes from the body or container of the self that is different from the causes outside the self that the brain spends it's whole life predicting, modelling, and rendering. His concept of self includes the physical boundary of the cellular body and it starts in the embrio with the first interactions in the womb, Which is fascinating because that is more of physical boundary calculated by cells that I would argue don't have a sense of self, they are components in a conscious system, but not self aware until much later in life after the organism has left the womb and is embodied in the real world outside the womb, at that point the crudest representation of the self as a directional concept that is separate from other causes of other consequences begins to develop, but perhaps the boundary of the self, the boundary that is the body of cells does indeed begin it's development in the embrio, his argument is plausible.

There are a ton more references to his work but I think this is enough for my note.
