(thalamus, oscillat, field, dendrite, synap)
the decay rate of an action potential is adjusting the phase rate of neurons that are inhibited in the same receptive field

one layer of a cortical column has a combination of spikes advancing the thresholds of all its post-synaptic neurons, and that is a receiving phase field defined by the synapses in its exit terminal

this causes that field to fire or inhibit in temporal sequences in an order defined by their voltages, "when" their voltages cross their threshold to firing

this causes neural circuits to fire in sequences like lines on a tv screen that is seen by the oscillator itself because each neuron is mechanically listening to other neurons as charges increase or decrease inside and outside its membranes

the sensory inputs like hands are like a retina, a dendrite is like a retina, so the rows of the cortical columns see the action potentials, the rows are seen by the cortical column, and the cortical columns are seen by the thalamus

mutliscale tempo spatial oscillators

the magnified data serves as part of a display for another neural circuit

conscious is a lot of stitched together displays, with memories becoming attractors that drive behaviors.

so by smelling stinky when I met her I inhibited her cycle, she's being silent

her oscillation then will be slow and strong
expressions but they are more like networked oscillation patterns resulting in behavior patterns that have frequency characteristics

we can see cities as oscillators, countries as oscillators, and the social planet as in oscillation, or oscillations inside oscillations with a multitude of scales.
