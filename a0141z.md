Sync
The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.

In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.

but it seems like we probably balance ourselves by dissipating signals.


Feyman's idea for configuration space, why two particles will find the shortest path between them.

Once oscillators fire together they merge together, they never stop firing together on their own, imagine that it takes some third oscillator to send them a knock that will cause them to oscillate differently again, and oscillators merge in random clubs

Also the idea of a bad spot helped me to think of the subset of fired patterns in any given array as a pattern that was being magnified in scale like a photocopy, its a strange idea that is not intuitive, but the idea is that because a bad spot is like a phase differential that is not absorbed, it is still a bad spot if it is communicated to any other neuron, because the next neuron also does not absorb the bad spot, the argument is that the bad spot has no area to begin with, if an absorption doesn't happen it is not taking up additional space each time it moves to a new oscillator, even if it leaves the last oscillator, because it's area is growing temporally.

the transformed set, which has two bad spots, now lives inside the first set, so the bad spots are growing in area, but not really, 

the transformation from before or after 

so the brain is essentially cascades of arrays, one array creates a pattern that represents what it saw, the next array represents a pattern that represents what it saw, the next array represents a pattern that represents its perspective, and so as you move your head, the patterns are passed backwards through many arrays that see each other over time, producing a phase field that renders the matrix computer program in your brain essentially, so your brain is like a holodeck that is conscious.

The patterns that are evoked in each array resonate and dissipate away back into oscillation with the greater neural oscillation that they were connected to before they fired, this oscillation dissipates the signal across all the oscillators, each one absorbing a little bit of it until they are all oscillating as one again. However the activity causes dendritic connects to grow between simultaneously exited areas

I sort of think of how particles find the shortest path in physics, something like the laws of energy conservation or time conversvation something like that
