You are in charge of making your own decisions in that you are a virtual entity, but ultimately "You" is an attractor in a brainwave powerband driven forth by the principles of oscillation in alignment with known laws of physics. Yes you are making choices, but there is no you that is separate from the laws of physics.

You are the electromagnetic spectrum as illustrated by neuron activity in a brain, that they then take turns reading or writing, seeing or saying, in the oscillatory talk of neurons that reshape their connections rapidly to represent new incoming patterns and fold proteins to help create an advanced data structure for your long term memories as well.

A demo idea

what if we had a printer, and the 

or a screen, and every pixel was lit either red, blue, or green, 

the demo has large pixels so they are easy to see

but what we do is this, we select a random distribution of dots in an image, 33 percent of them, 3 times, so that the dots are separated into a random set of 3 photos.

Then what we do is separate the dots into 3 frames, and play back the three frames in a loop, so that we are seeing a whole image over time, from the individual firings of neurons of the other neurons, but what is seeing them?

well while the first group is firing, the second group is listening, and that group is either going to predict that they are going to fire next, or wait one round and then fire, if Neuron 1 had an excited round, they then do an inhibited round 1 times simply to wait and listen for a round, they are listening to the 2 other neurons, neurons 2 and 3 are listening to incoming signals to predict whether they are going to fire next in a sequence, or whether they are not going to fire next in a sequence, all it has to ask is "am I going to fire next", but its receiving answers from every direction, via synapses in its dendritic branches for example, 

if the other 2 neurons just fired or not, that is part of what it is listening to,

the point is that we are establishing a self communication mechanism, they listen to each other, and to any other available incoming signals, when they fire they create patterns, the crudest possible patterns, that the other neurons receive as signals, and the other neurons learn the patterns in the signals that they are receiving,

critically what they are learning they are rendering materially because their connections reshape themselves to create paths that represent learned patterns as paths, synaptic communication paths between cells, a short term memory mechanism.

this is why after playing tetris for 5 hours you may see tetris when closing your eyes, because your brain is used to flowing in very specific patterns

I think this is also one of the mechanism for how people's EEG Powerband spectrum becomes in sync with another person's EEG Powerband spectrum when they speak to each other. It's that the frequency of the words are translating

the frequency of the transmission from one person's voice to another has an entrainment value, like listening to brainwave entrainment, binaural beats, isochronic beats

when we engage with other people we can tune into one another because we able to transmit the kinds of vibrations to others through our voices that our brains use within ourselves for the conscious ground of being

represented by oscillating clouds of soliton waves in electromagnetic spectrum,

the soliton waves representing a virtual data object, a hz, that was put out by part of the brain. It's a hertz or a frequency, like light is a frequency, but its also a stable wave, that represents a pattern that is part of a pattern when combined with the other patterns. 

This hertz / soliton wave, It's a virtual instance of the rendering that people call consciousness.

Dendrites have to recognize this hertz in order for another part of the sequence to know what it means, and another part of the sequence to predict what comes next.

Many of these electromagnetic soliton waves, represent just a piece of an internal representation, its a sparse and distributed representation, sparse because other neurons need to listen,
