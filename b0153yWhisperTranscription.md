A higher quality transcription than the original transcription, however since I apparently added to the original transcription it makes sense to keep both.

Concise Summary:

Consciousness is envisioned as a series of frames replayed by the hippocampus, where regional neural activity forms soliton vector patterns that scale up fractally—from individual neurons to cortical columns. Unlike a hologram that provides a complete image, these patterns are tomographic: each neuron captures a unique “slice” or view of an overall spatial map.

This four-dimensional, dynamic map—integrating electrical, magnetic, and motor representations—serves as the basis for attention and predictive coding. The brain’s continuous prediction of neural firing not only constructs these internal maps but also drives a “seeking” behavior, guiding choices and aligning perception with the external world. Moreover, these tomographic spectral maps provide dynamic reference points that T-cells can decode, enabling them to triangulate their position and navigate precisely toward sites of injury or disease.

So the okay so it's it's that so consciousness is like a series of frames that your hippocampus is playing back, coordinating pieces of regional activity—basically regional activity in the that takes the shape of a soliton vector pattern that represents the scaled up representation or fractal of a similar but smaller soliton vector pattern in a piece in a cortical column that in turn represents a scaled up soliton vector pattern in a neuron that has been activated. Since many different neurons are recording essentially different slices of that same pattern, it's not holographic; it's, it's tomographic, right? The distribution—the sparse distributed representation of patterns—is not holographic; it's tomographic so that each variant or version of the pattern as represented by different neurons is representing like a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned.

So that there is a spatial representation that's free, that is learned by the network as a whole and then represented to the brain to a higher level of the brain to other neurons when that sequence fires.

So what you have is that the firing of lots of neurons is something that neural circuits can, in four dimensions, create, remember, and replay tomographic maps that then serve as the foundation for, you know, attention—like basically like attention schema via the active, activated, and deactivated neurons in the temporal pattern—to have their configuration sort of change because what they're representing corresponds to the representation of the external world. Basically, like the tomographic spectral map represents the map of your map of reality, but it represents your map of reality both in terms of like what you're paying attention to in each moment and what you're not paying attention to in each moment so that what you're paying attention to in each moment is changing corresponding to the incoming signals but providing like a four-dimensional map of consciousness that predicts real reality and as much spectrum in detail as your brain can do it.

So along with your muscle movements and your other capabilities that you can have highly coordinated movements, but along with that, along with the fact of creating this map—this map you can feel—because there's multiple kinds, there's multiple kinds of representation including electrical and magnetic soliton phase representation that is combined together to create this map, but also, you know, representation of the muscle activity. But what it is is like the very fact of that what causes this reputation: the sensory representation predictive coding is also causing your brain to calculate predictions for various kinds of patterns and that, so that leads to sort of like the mechanism of choices at every level.

It's that which you sort of predict happening that appeals to you more, right? Let's say that you're more attracted to the fun, to good stuff happening because there's this trend of your brain predicting that it's going to fire, right? So neurons predicting that it's going to fire, there's no sense in predicting that you're not going to fire so it's just sort of like, "Am I going to fire? Am I gonna fire?" and it's a sort of like that creates the sort of like seeking—the prediction creates a sort of seeking, the seeking of the seeker because there is this basically that's the seeking is the inversion of prediction, right? It is prediction and so you get to this place where you get to a place where there is this sort of...
