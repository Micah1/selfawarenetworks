Having a conversation what is it that what's the outside data that you're as causing this? Always. Micro singles to come. Okay, so listen your brain you're we're talking about a human brain we're talking about that a computer receiving some kind of data, what's what is. In big blocks. What's happening not in little blocks?

00:37

In big blocks. You have you have an input? You have a process. You have an output. Or you have an input you have a process you have a decision and then you have an output. Okay, so so so what I just covered was that you have multiple of multiple scales of.

01:07

Of so there's there's just like so so the brain has an input has input layers right and artificial neural networks have input layers and the brain has input layer, so the input layer is your eye. And your ears and your smell and for the computer yeah and it's so a neural network a neural net your sense is yeah and and um, And then that extends so you have like and the so the four the four main senses are hearing vision touch and taste those are the four main four main senses and and the fifth one is smell but what happens is the first four they they have a path where they they'll go in through one side.

01:58

You know from your eye to this to or your ear it'll go it'll go the ears go to basically to the center of your brain. And the eyes will go to also to the center of your brain. And and then all the touch stuff and taste will also go will go to the center of your brain to where the thalamus is from the strain from your fingertips all the way up through your nervous system right into the center of the brain right and they all go to the thalamus first and then thalamus is like the router and the center of your brain, okay, and then and then they'll go then they'll continue onward so the left so my left here.

02:44

Will go to the thalamus and the center of the brain and then it'll go over to well the audience so the audio travels up it goes to go through thalamus and it travels up the cortex it's going to travel up to the left side of my audio cortex and.

03:01

Then the right here will travel to the thalamus and then it will travel up to the right side of my audio cortex and then the the left eye will travel back along the optic nerve to the thalamus and then over to the right to the right side of the obstacle lobes everything's reversed everything's reversed but everything traveled but it travels but but it travels from but it's interesting is everything travels from from the eye to the center of the brain.

03:36

Reverses and then to the to the reverse side of the brain, so the eyes are being the input up to the eyes are happening in the back of the brain, this is where the occipital lobes are. That's the visual cortex the beginning of the visual cortex and then you have the parietal cortex which is above the occipital cortex and then above that you have the somatosensory cortex well there's actually I'm sorry there's actually like the parietal cortex begins to merge with this matter sensory cortex, so you have a lot of touch touch and vision starts to merge in the higher levels of the parietal cortex and then and then the rest of the brain the rest of the cortex is prefrontal cortex.

04:19

And the prefrontal cortex so it's a bit so basically the the three areas of the brain that receives data from your senses are called the primary sensory courtesies this their and they are visual cortex audio cortex and somatosensory cortex, okay, so you know all of this so so the input let's so the input so everything that's not input.

04:49

Is is. And is either motor so motor is everywhere it used to be thought well you'd have like a motor strip maybe one strip that would be for motor now we know that motor is everywhere that means that every since the neocortex is six layers. And it's it's it's you know, all the cortices are neocortex.

05:15

I mean what I mean is like the all the 401 the four quarter series that I just mentioned they're all neocortex, but they but they all have a motor output and it's usually it's usually like that to be like the fourth or fifth layer. Somewhere in there that's the motor output so the first the first layer is the input and the output of the motor and in between input and output or in between input and motor are what's called interneurons.

05:42

And the inter neurons are the sort of high level. Way that it's possible for us to think because they're doing the work of inhibition. Inhibition is like slamming the brakes the brakes in the are the like the spaces in between our thoughts. If we didn't have like that the general the celiac this is kind of a silly way to oversimplify it but if we didn't have breaks.

06:11

We wouldn't we wouldn't have separate thoughts we wouldn't it would just be all just one mush it's like maybe maybe when you when you will what's that legal that legal thing that you can smoke where you like you can't tell the difference between yourself in the room, do you remember that?

06:27

Like you you eat something about I'm spinning I'm spinning. I'm gonna go outside and spin for that thing what's that called yeah soviets? I'll be a divinorum yeah so that's so let's say that that's what it's like when you you're in your interneurons are prevented from inhibiting from installing brakes in your thought process like everything merges together and there's no way to distinguish one thing from anything else because you're because the brakes have been taken off.

07:00

It's like the brakes I mean like in the the analogy of a car that's breaking accelerating and braking so you have excitation you have inhibition and those are the mechanics those are the mechanics in which your brain presses on the gas or presses on the brakes now what's interesting what's interesting is if you if you have an F nearest device and I sort of talked about this at your house, well, we could do it when I was visiting your house.

07:27

I talked to you about this if you have an if you have an F near his brain computer interface and we could monitor your blood flow. If we can monitor your brain while you're thinking okay, now imagine imagine that you are you're looking at a graph and you're looking at the center of the graph.

07:46

And so the graph has there's a left and a right graph and the the left eye is looking at the left graph and they're identical the right graph is looking at the right graph so if you're looking at the center of each graph each i is looking straight ahead and there's a dot there's a dot for your left eye and there's a dot for your right eye and you're looking straight ahead of both dots now what what the researchers are going to ask you to do and this is I'm just I'm just describing an experiment that's already been happen, it's already happened so much so many to do this the researcher will say, okay, now what I'm going to ask you to do is I'm going to ask you to move your eye.

08:21

From the center dots on each of the two graphs to the dot at the on the rightmost side of each of the grass, so your eyes are going to move from the center of the graphs over to the right, that sounds pretty simple, right? It's very simple, but what we will observe in your in the brain is what we'll observe a an increase of blood flow and in on one of your on on one on.

08:59

On on one in one of your hemispheres somewhere somewhere around here will there be an increase in blood flow. And in the other hemisphere of your brain and almost the same area but on the other but in the other hemisphere because you know, if you left and right side of your brain are two different hemispheres it on the right hemisphere, there'll be so unless there'll be a decrease in blood flow and on the right there'll be an increase in blood flow so as you're as you, you know, your motor activity shifting your eyeballs from the center over to the right, you're there is going to be a correlating.

09:35

Decrease in blood flow and one of your hemispheres an increase in blood flow and the other hemisphere we can measure that we can measure that with an afternoon's device. Okay and then how do you interpret it you interpret it well so yeah. I mean we could draw it we could draw a graph, you know, we could create a graph where we where we showed that in this part of the graph that represented your brain there was an increase in blood flow here that that our our device captured so you just thought you just plot we measured this amount of increase of blood flow here and we measured a decrease and the amount of blood flow there.

10:17

And that's a that's a lat that's a yes, that's a lateralization study. All right and that's why that's one of the reasons why I would like you to use your 3d printer. To consider making an a headset that we could stick open BCI sensors in. But we said that there was already designed for it.

10:45

I don't know that I mean there there are designs for. EEG device. But but we need a something that will fit F near sensors. But but the the thing is the reality is that weak that we if we had it any kind of cap like like that like that cap that you get like the helmet thing the net that sticks to your head that goes that you're gonna get your friend to send you then you could just take you could literally just tape the F near sensor to that net so the 3d printed thing is above and beyond what's absolutely necessary, you could just write you could just tape it.

11:33

The sensor to to a head net. And that would occur that would accomplish that would accomplish the goal. Okay, um, but so what I'm saying, is this is that the the, You know, the the, The so this is what so the book is like, um. Here here we have you know, I hear people in neuroscience really like extremely educated researchers, well, we'll say the brain can only recognize.

12:09

Frequency information. That's not right. There are there are people who are you know? What's that? It's Bill Murray. Yeah. There there people are people who like who are super smart researchers, but they're deep learning researchers and they honestly believe that neurons are dumb. They think that neurons are just dumb like, you know, like like they're not capable of understanding patterns, they're not they're not capable of distinguishing between do two types of patterns.

12:45

Place where they think. Right?

12:53

They they think that the the net with the network itself has to be where intelligence emerges they they can't imagine that the cell by itself has the has the capacity to recognize patterns specific patterns and choose what it wants to respond to and inhibit its own response if it's front from so it doesn't fire for a pattern that's it's the wrong pattern.

13:21

They don't they don't imagine that capability exists, but, But they. So I just got this this new book by this this brilliant researcher who I've been following for more for I think maybe 20 years. And he talks about all the amazing things that the cells are doing in terms of communication.

13:45

I you have you have cells that are basically. They're they're doing their kind of like intelligent communication that would be like over vast distances where they are. I met I mean imagine that you have a you have a we imagine that we that that we had a guy and in New York City and he was dealing with the problem and we're we are sending we're gonna send another guy to New York City to help him fix this problem, okay?

14:19

This is what this is what sells to they said, okay, so okay, so then we're gonna like also send out chemical messages. To that are gonna go to this guy to help him find his way to the other guy. So that the repair guy can repair the problem for the guy in New York who has the problem.

14:43

And we're gonna and and we're gonna like guide this one guy all the way to the other guy. This is what sells do. And and then this one guy is gonna repair the problem and then we're gonna you see him like this is like this is this involves like communication over vast distances and your cells are doing this but the but the people in deep learning think that one cell can't distinguish between two types of excitatory patterns and and choose its own response there's a there's a gap between there's a huge gap.

15:21

Between like these are these are non-neuron cells that can do this and neurons are more capable than these non neurons cells, so I have this opportunity here to sort of like basically like design a new perceptron a new artificial neuron a new artificial neural network, that is not just frequency information but it's.

15:49

It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.

16:27

This faulty. No basically no I'm saying it's this limited it's just I'm saying that we have it's yes, it's it's faulty it's faulty yet it's faulty because it's based on wrong information it's based on the wrong information is synaptic on reliability, it's not synaptic unreliability was a concept that they that formed the basis of neural networks of in not only in deep learning but also in computational neuroscience, it's the bedrock of artificial neural networks today.

17:04

And it's wrong it's there's no such thing as synaptic unreliability and so yes, so I have the chance to revolutionize to bring a revolutionary new concept and that's sort of what the book is book is about. When you wrote your last article.

17:30

There wasn't the you know, I I don't think that many people read the article because I I'm still I'm like not enough people like not if people read it, so I just didn't that because what I'm seeing is. There's a huge number of people who who are operating as if they my article never existed like for example, um, the article the last article that I wrote not synaptic and really ability but the one that was about how deep learning is going to change volumetric.

18:05
Basically it didn't it it's it's just it was my writing was too niche and that's why I need to but it was a piece of people just the most people are operating in the dark because they don't understand how because I mean, I see I see people talking about using light arm.

18:26

For for volumetric scanning and at you and Apple when they when they when Apple introduced their their WWDC, keynote event they. The Apple Microsoft Google these companies are clueless, they're clueless. I gave this article they should have read my article they don't know they don't know what they're showing is is what they're showing the public.

18:59

Is clueless because the stuff that I've seen at conferences like seagrass where they use AI. To do things like if you if you if you feed images into a computer to do what's called. Semantic segmentation 3d semantic segmentation so you can do semantic segmentation with lidar data with steps data with with lots of you know with photogrammetry data you could do all of this but then what you do is you have the neural network is going to figure out the depth from the depth information from all the points and space and it's going to figure out you know, combining the depth with the textures it's going to say okay, well how do all these points fit together and what and and which of these points belong together which of these points.

19:54
Form an object and what is this object and what is this object in 2d and what perspective and what does this object in 3d and a semantic segmentation network can turn a can convert a 2d object into a 3d object and vice versa and withgan synthesis it can take 2-3 objects or 2d objects and it can synthesize something that's halfway in between so you can have it create 3d representations of all the cards and 3d representations of chairs and if you look up avocado chairs MIT, you're either going to find my article.

20:29

What we're going to find the article written by written by another publication it has lots of pictures of avocado chairs that are halfway between avocados and halfway between chairs because gan synthesis synthesizes. Objects that have features of both avocados and of chairs and so it makes chairs that look like avocados, you know, or makes avocados that look like chairs and you could 3d print them.

20:59

This is Gan synthesis and you could do that with any two objects right and the thing the thing is but not only that does it does shape completion, okay now shape completion is where you can when you look up shape completion read my last article shape completion means that when you do you do a lighter skin if you look at all these lighter scans that people are doing and they're uploading the sketch fab the first thing you notice is that there's a big there's there's like the scan looks really good but then you get to a point where it just the scan stopped and there's this big hole.
21:32

In the graphics. It's like it's not perfect. It's not perfect because there's like it's like they have this like the newest scan of like of like a building but then but then it's only like the front two-thirds of the building and there's like a hole in in the scan and you can see it in the 3D model there's a space where the skin wasn't complete.

21:53

And almost all of these lighter scans their incomplete, but if you look at shape completion in my article, Shape completion means that the AI has recognized what it is and it completes the shape and so if we were using 3D semantics segmentation and shape completion. With with our lighter scans then we then all the scans that people would be uploading to SketchFab would be complete shapes.

22:22

They wouldn't have holes in them. The AI would fill in the holes would recognize what it was. Do you see they see what I'm saying? And into some degree, we'll be able to sort of do that retroactively where you know, what have AI will be trained on so many different shapes and so many different, you know, recognizing so many different real-world things that it will be able to go to all the sketchfab models and complete them.
22:56

It'll be able to fix old old scans by completing them. So we'll have all the old scans that we do we'll have AI we use an AI tool it will grab the 3D model it will fix it and it will upload the new version of it. It looks better than the original scan.

23:14

But not only that, it'll be able to go through old photos and make 3D 3D models of the people and the places from those photos. In fact, if you have photos of anything eventually that could become a virtual reality. Any 2D photo could become a 3D virtual reality. And so even movies.

23:34
So remember ready player one you read the book and and you could go into war games. Well, that is realistic. That is realistic because you could take the movie you could feed it into AI, it could. Create 3D environments and 3 representations of people from the movie frames and then you could experience the movie NVR.

23:58

Or you could you could tailor in in the future augmented reality will be so seamless that you could tailor as a real world. Just change the world world just enough to live the move to live out the movie in the real world around you in your house. Just enough.

24:19

I mean.

24:24

So this is this is like yeah, but.

24:32

But. But yeah did you want so yeah, so I don't know if you want to to finish the thing about the known networks or do you get that so we so um, So we're talking about the you know, a new artificial neuron a new kind of perceptron not called the mica perception perception.
24:56

It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.

25:47

That's that's not enough time to remember a sentence. So the idea is that you're going to have to have in order to for me to remember a sentence which is 10 seconds. I'd have to have us a I'd have to have two or more neurons or basically what's called a neuroscircuit we have to repeat them the messages relevant to each part of the sentence.

26:17

Each each millisecond of the sentence would have to be repeated. By a different neuron. Or you know, or it could be that could be just too neurons where one neuron would would say part of the sentence and the other neurons to the next part. I mean at the minimum it has to be two neurons but it's probably many neurons right and so you have the idea is that.

26:40

For 10 for 10 seconds, you're going to have to have a lot of different neurons that are going to have to fire each one has to represent. Part of that sentence in order for a 10 second sentence to happen or no, sorry in order for a one second sentence to happen you have to have you have to have neurons have to sort of repeat the message so short term so that's it that's the hypothesis right now for short-term memory one of the hypotheses is that you have a neuroscircuit that sort of like repeats a message and and basically it's like if I if I, If my if you imagine if your memory is only imagine if you're as a human being if you're memory is only one millisecond and my memory is only one millisecond and we have to we have to remember something for ten milliseconds and the way we do that is is I say, okay number four and you say number four and then I say number four and then you say number four, right and we have to keep saying that because it's the because it's the only way we can get our memories to last longer.

27:48

Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

28:33

Here it's the thing that's affected by blue light if you have blue light too late in the evening, you're gonna stay up longer you're not gonna get enough sleep that's why you know doctors are recommending the melatonin to help you get to sleep you gotta you know, get your melatonin at right at dusk and then by the time you by the time it's it's time to go to bed you have your you're tired and that will help you get to sleep and then.

29:01

But the but that's that's because the melatonin is is is your sleep chemical it's what it's your yes your sleep chemical it's the thing that you're. That you're circadian rhythm you need to activate so you feel tired so you actually do go to sleep and your caffeine the caffeine blocks the melatonin blocks a minute melatonin, so you don't feel tired when you have caffeine.

29:30
Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.

29:59

It's a stochastic. Pink noise. Type of oscillation it's like it's just like a regular beat okay really it's like every you know, they're all gonna oscillate with the same sort of beat and it doesn't really it's you know, we think it we we think it doesn't really mean anything that all that significant it's just like this regular pattern all the neurons outside of this like regular pattern and it made it it's like it doesn't really contain it's it doesn't necessarily it's not obvious that it contains any information because it's just it's just a regular pattern just firing right but it gets interesting when I when you send new input data, what are you working back and forth yeah.

30:51

Okay. I'm just right as a symbol to symbolize and also the Tory pattern.
31:02

That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?

31:35
So that I was reading this book a rhythms of the brain that's an incredible book that summarizes like 20 years of research neuroscience research and there's a sequel and I have the sequel. So have all these great books, but like I have the best for the best books that I'm reading the best of the best books like the books that are the kings of other books and those are the books that I'm reading I read in the Kings books.

31:58

And the Kings book summarize all the the lower level books all the lower level research. These are great things. But but anyway, so the thing is that the, The higher level oscillations.

32:16

They So they're okay so basically the the most of the time that you have tonic firing tonic firing is in this sort of like ready state. It's like you're neurons are always ready to fire they're always in the state where they're like ready like like basically like the at the tipping point like I'm like a where a caskey could happen where an avalanche can happen, they're always like sort of moving to that state where they're on the edge and they could just a thought can happen because they're ready for that thought to happen.
32:49

And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.

33:11

And the whole brain is a range in what looks like pink noise but it's not actually noise because it's all like there's a lot of different oscillations and all the different oscillations are interlinked they're interlinked there's small oscillations and big oscillations and bigger oscillations and bigger oscillations, but they're all cascading results of microscopic oscillations on the single.

33:36
Neuron level. So the single neuron level oscillations are creating the brakes and the larger oscillations the larger oscillations are oscillating around smaller oscillations and the oscillations are not like you would think you know, when when you look at oscillators it oscillations would combine into one big oscillation, but they're there.

33:58

They're prevented from combining so they like almost like orbiting planets like like the oscillations orbit other oscillations and it's like, you know, you think that planets would just collide because they're all gravitational objects but be but their movements keep them an orbit around each other, but they still affect each other so you have oscillations affecting other oscillations while maintaining their independence from other oscillations and then what happens is when you have a neuron that fires out of order.

34:24

And creates a disturbance in the force and disturbance that all the other neurons notice because all the other neurons that are oscillating now start to slow down that they start to basically they that one neuron that fired out of order like it's also it's oscillation has to now reemerge with the oscillation of the collective in which it fires so the whole network that it was oscillating with is aware of the fact that when neuron fired out of order because because they all feel it's gravitational pull because it It's pulled by the collective back into that singular oscillating pattern, so it's almost like when they fire out of.

35:07

Why do they fire out of order okay so this goes back to the beginning of our conversation okay, all right, so I was saying that because of synaptic unreliability. That because synaptic and reliability doesn't exist because of multi vesicle release that basically that you have. Three multifacal release multi vesicles the fat sac the oil of neurotransmitters, okay, those are.

35:38

All conveying the same information but. The information is not spread only by one or in other words the information comes and an organ process will set it down as many. Different neurons, it's possible in case some of them. Okay, so interesting no. No what is a so okay, let me use my words it means my words so what I'm saying is that you can have between zero and in three vesicles can be released between zero and three so if the neuron doesn't fire at zero if they're on fires, it could be one vesicle releases one oil sac if the if the if the is the action potential waves the voltage is larger.

36:34

Then more is one. Or three vesicles releasing. I mean how much information is going I have there written down somewhere but it's it it's it's something like 2000 something like 2000 atoms per per sack for oil sac it's something like yes something like 2000 neurotransmitters poor oil sac so if you so if you have two oil sacks and you're getting like four thousand atoms.

37:03

If you have three OSX you're getting like six thousand atoms that are being relation to the synaptic app and so and so you're multiplying, you know between you know, two thousand to four thousand six thousand different atoms are being pushed into the synaptic gap between and the thing the synaptic gap is gonna have like seven receptors in one in one.

37:29

Bhutan that will be you'll have one dendrite we'll have several boutons and then you have. You have other dendrites. So you have many cells pushed together so you have many dendrites and many buttons and the bhutan is like the thing that holds the receptors it's it's a bhutan it's basically this like thing a stick side of a dendrite and has a bunch of holes in it and the holes are the receptors and they'll accept you'll get maybe mate, you'll maybe have you know, you know five to seven receptors and a bouton something like that.

38:07

Um, how many workers you have and I don't know you're asking these are too many details at the moment. I will find out. I find out the average number of boutons is but um, I it's not too many but I'll find out but the thing is like futons no no bhutan is like, It's sort of like this sort of like a.

38:31

It's almost like you know, I know the code virus you remember the same pictures of the code virus and has like crown has like crowns. It's like a ball with a bunch of like things that stick out of it, but each one of those things is like a crown.

38:48

Yeah, okay so that's what a boot time is kind of like a crown it sticks out of it's like a bunch of things to stick out of the dendrite so Denver has two kinds of things sticking out of it one is a bouton which is kind of like it's kind of like a mushroom shape.

39:01

It's kind of it's kind of like a mushroom yeah it's kind of like a mushroom that's a good that's a good it's a mushroom it has holes in the top it's like has pores and top so it can receive atoms it can receive atoms okay, it's like a mushroom that has holes on top that can receive atoms.

39:19

And and besides that there's also spikes and spikes are just like little hairs on the tree so imagine you're you you're dendrites is a tree without leaves yet, so it's like you're dendrites a tree that doesn't have leaves but it has little hairs on it like so yeah like hey beautiful it's sure.

39:42

I think I do. I maybe I should look it up, okay.

39:52

So. And I mean, just look at us. They carry the oxygen molecules and they release the CO2. Alright but they wide they're like a little hairs it's kind of a. Like.

40:16

That membrane. And your lungs that's how you breathe. So you're saying that in the brain you have these. Little mushrooms that received the information through. Oil sacks and exchanged chemicals the oil sacks break the oil sacks contain atoms and when you release the oil sacks, they break and atoms spill over the mushrooms and the mushrooms receive the atoms.

40:54

So like the sodium atoms and the phosphate atoms at this point at this point. I think we're talking about again. The.

41:11

So there's there's there's there's sodium there's chloride there's potassium there's calcium but but between the neurons I think we're talking about GABA and GABAergenic and Abigail no no no, so there's there's there's there's dopamine hang on.

41:40

There's assets so it's acetylcholine dopamine and GABA. You know talking about the ABA okay, so between the between the neurons we're talking about what goes into the mushrooms the receptors, we're talking about GABA.

42:04

Hang out with there's one more. See let me just do like a search yeah, let's see. Gaba. A settle calling.

42:27

So this amount really these are ions that really. Well no no, hang on a second no no no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, so there there an ion is a charged atom. But in the case of it's it's a multiple.

42:54

So there's that there's that you can have you can have a chemical which is multiple atoms okay, but an ion but an ion at the root of it, whether it's a chemical or an atom is is is a chemical with a charge or an atom with a charge. Right you can all but the GABA is I think GABA is an atom it doesn't have a charge.

43:17

So I think we're talking about for the most part we're talking about atoms and chemicals that are that don't have a charge and so they would not be considered ions. In that case in some cases, they do have a charge but but for the most part these are non-charge non-charge non-ionic.

43:39

But the point is that the but the reset but so you're gonna have two types of in theory and the theory that I have you're gonna have two types of excitatory signals which the type excitatory signals will be like when one cells receptors when a lot of it's receptors are receiving signals, then if you if you artificially overwhelm a cell's receptors, you will force it to fire but in the natural environment.

44:11

I think that a cell could receive two types of excitatories. To signals and it could choose between you know self-inhibiting it's it's action potential through a number of methods or the network the second at the second level the network could inhibit that cell by feeding it inhibitory signals which might include basically, you know, you've got you've got you know sodium the sodium can respond sodium channels can respond and those are the positive.

44:46

Channels that will lead to an action potential but what count what can inhibit those is the chloride atoms so if the chloride receptors open up? Then those negative signals can can stop the action but it's like an inhibitory process which will prevent the action potential from happening out of order.

45:11

There's many other inhibitory paths that can happen inside the cell and outside the cell. The other the neighboring cells can be can like can release. Like you're gonna have like basically you're gonna have like get you're gonna have ample receptors and GABA receptors and some of those receptors will be receiving.

45:38

Will be doing something without sodium and you know the like sodium will be flying out of them and some of them you'll have you know, chloride flowing out of them and then.

45:55

Yeah, so my pictures a little bit fuzzy because like now I'm like and I'm like, I'm like, oh wait a second well wait, where's the line between the acetylcholine and the gaba and the sodium in the chloride? I can't wear it like I like and now I'm confused like how are they separated?

46:11

I mean, how does this work? But no, I think I need to in the research I need to to do to go deeper. But I but before what I can tell you I neither one of us right now has enough information. So I need to look at the research before we can go deeper but and you you also need to look at the research but I doubt you will so because you have no no motivation to do so but if you want to that be great.

46:40

We need to look at basically patch clamp and there's two things one is drawn leaves book the other one is patch clamp experiments classical patch type experiments because those really dive deep into the the classical patch clamp experiments dive deep into basically the, The electoral chemical. Properties of cells is basically a patch clamp is what you use you clamp you literally like, you know, like when you you know, what a clamp is in the context of of your garage right you can clamp something onto the table, right?

47:14

Well patch clamp is a similar concept it's that they they clamp something on to tissue. So you can clamp something onto part of the neuron you can clamp it onto receptors and you're clamping a sensor onto tissue to to watch what it's doing electrically and so the classic. Patch clamp experiments basically were able to observe you know, how you know potassium and and they basically rate they're able to observe how voltage changes happen in the cell and how the ions change in the cell and so there's like a ton of data that a neuroscientist advised me to reach to go to go through so I can solve some of these questions.

48:06

For my book. But now you get now you get the idea so like I have like this is so like the fundamental mechanics of the brain have been misunderstood. And I and that has affected the development of artificial neural networks. So not only can I potentially correct how the brain actually works in a fundamental way.

48:37

I can create a new artificial neuron to call the mica perceptron. There's been a number of perceptrons that were named after different researchers. But so there's yet, there's like a charles perceptron good. The design of the perception.

49:00

Will be. Based on.

49:09

So, here's what the do with the trying to do, electrically. Is reproduce. The the way they view. The brain transferring information so. Into make to make an AI right yeah what you're saying yeah instead of wiring it up to make. Ditch all the transistors. Work one way, which is what we have for linear basic computing.

49:47

Of. And quantum computing. They want to. Line it up, so the information is transferred the way that you bring transfers information.

50:06

That's not a true representation of how the brain is important, that's what you're saying yeah, they do it the other way they'll be able to relay a lot more information than what they're doing now. That is the that is the super vague super vague outline, that's a super vague outline vaguely of but you could be you could be describing my project or you could be describing what everybody already knows.

50:47

Because it's just so it's so high level and big at this point but because everybody knows everybody basically everybody knows that that that. Artificial neurons are not biologically plausible I and the bigger the big the the real big issue is that the key to the deep learning revolution is back propagation artificial backpropagation, which there is nothing like artificial back propagation in biology and people think that there is no back propagation is how is how a, An artificial neural network, well we'll fix its own errors where it it's basically you can you can you can reward a neural network for an even reward individual nodes for getting the right result you can spank individual nodes for getting the wrong result.

51:53

But you spanked them through back propagation and there's no biological path for for this sort of like high-level computational mechanism called back propagation in biology, so you essentially have to send a signal backwards and signal has to go to the right place. But.

52:17

This here's thing. It's like, People in deep learning can't imagine how this could be biologically possible plausible because they think that neurons are dumb. They think that you can't you can't have one neuron, you know, right a letter to address another neuron and a specific area of the body to send a specific message.

52:39

That is but they're they're wrong about that, they're wrong about that. They're wrong about that. Because even even cells that are dumber than neurons can do that. And that is for that is for a fact. But but in addition to that, here's the thing. In the real brain neurons are not too dimensional and neural column neurostircuits See there's neurosurgeries where you just have a bunch of neurons that are linked together, but then there's micro columns which are like and like a column it's like it's like a thin column in the neocortex from the first layer to the sixth layer and then you have cortical columns which is our thick columns that go they're really like I've only used if I can use two hands they're like the bottle will be the bottle will be one hand and this is my my and then my other hand is like a cortical column.


53:35

Is really a really big column between the first layer second layer third layer fourth layer fifth layer and sixth layer of the of the neocortex. That's really big column the protocol column. You have a limited number of those but it's like, you know hundreds thousands. And that's like the macro big column and that's like a big neural circuit and most of the brain is organized in these big columns with little columns and us in scripts of networks, but a cortical column is by itself so it's like it's a so it's the dendrite.

54:12

The dendrite is this tree thing, right? It has hairs and has mushrooms. The dendrite itself is a neural network that can recognize patterns. It can recognize two types of excitatory patterns and either inhibit itself to fire. Or pass on a signal to the summer, so that the soma is is is.

54:34

This summer is just like the the body between the dendrite and the axon. In the axon is the the axon is like I said the dendrites the beginning of the cell, which is like a tree the axon is like the is like the the tree brain is like the tree.

54:52

You know how like a tree has a stem? Yeah, it's like a long thin stem. That's the act that's the axon and the stem the axon can go from it can go from your from you might have like the dendrite might be in your gray tissue right underneath your finger right into my fingers through my fingers at.

55:14

There could be a dense rate right underneath my finger maybe about 10,000 dendrites and it's gray matter. But those dendrites might might go all the way down to like like the dendrites will connect to those things have the spines which are hairs and they have the mushrooms or the the the synaptic boutons.

55:37

And but they will connect to a summer which is where so it's like so imagine imagine a fractal right so fractals like you have imagined my hand is my hand as a fractal okay and the look which do you see my hand right now? Okay so the dendrite is like the tree so imagine each of my fingers are like the branches of the tree, so the dendrite is where each of my fingers is one is part of the dendrite now we're all the fingers meat in the body of the hand.

56:04

I'm trying to point to my own hand, but I'm holding the phone and there's always difficult the hand itself in the center the center of the hand right like this part of the hand that part of the hand that's where the soma is at so the soma is where all the tentricles of the dendrite meat.

56:22

And so it's almost like this it's almost like the center of the dendrite. All right, okay and then my rest my wrist is like the the axon it's really long and thin. Okay and the end of the axon is the actual terminal this is the part that connects to well, it's actually my arm so it's the end of the axon it's the part that connects to the rest to the other cells, but there's like a space.

56:47

Image it doesn't physically connect there's like a space between the end of one axon and the, And the button and the buttons of another cell. Yeah, yeah, you know this but yeah, so so the soma. I had psychology and psychology so okay good a lot about the way that the brain the axons and the dendrites and all that stuff all right sending signals back and forth yeah, but they didn't talk about the talk about the idea that so so in order for the someone to fire has to receive a lot of voltage.

57:34

I've received a lot of voltage from you know from the different receptors that are firing that on dendrite and from the dendrite itself that can fire voltage so there's there's there's the synth this individual synapses can each fire like little little pieces of voltage and that can treat that contributes to the overall Soma's power which may trigger the action potential but then the dendrites themselves the big fingers those can fire action potentials in two different directions, they can find.

58:09

Our towards the the soma or they can fire backwards downstream from the from the second layer down to the first safe so that is a that is a one path for back propagation for a signal to travel from the second layer back down to the first layer of cells.

58:27

And so so in the brain you have in the real brain you have each layer of cells receives data from the thalamus, okay? All of the all of this and that all of the primary sensory core disease receive data from the thalamus from your from your thalamus but that's ultimately from your sense, okay, but um, so what's happening is they're receiving data and it's going from it's the Dallas sending data directly to layer one directly to layer two directly to layer three four or five and six but layer one since data up to layer two and layer two since data back to layer one there's a lot of like traffic going back and forth.

59:15

But but imagine but now you see how the neural columns and each neural column goes between layer and layer two and there's a lot of up and down traffic okay, but then but and most of the traffic stays in that column in that cortical column a lot of up and down traffic a lot of cross traffic but ultimately the traffic is fine in 3d it's flowing in six different directions, which means the traffic is flowing up and down.

59:43

Left and right forward and back so you have like you have the excellent you have x axis, you have the y axis or sorry x would be up and I'm sorry why would be up and down x would be left and right and and z would be forward and back and data is flowing in all six directions.

01:00:01

So each cortical column is processing most of the data in asylum from in the y along the y axis. But. Along those different layers but every layer is sending information in every direction and so that's so it's like that's different from like neural networks where an artificial neural network today has an input layer and the first layer sends information to the second layer the second layers of information the third layer third layer since information to fourth layer there might be 256 or 500 layers or a thousand layers.

01:00:35

I don't know. And then tired yeah now we're both tired, uh, yeah, so it's 15 after one it's oh shit. I forgot it's two hours later for you alright, um, okay let's end it there but. Yeah, so we can enter talk I'm gonna talk about neuroscience there, but you should get to sleep and you should really like what you know, you're doing this you're gonna do a sleep study or whatever but like.

01:01:07

See a doctor about you know, strategies for getting good sleep don't just like do a sleep don't just like have bad sleep, so you can impress the sleep study people right you're trying to impress them. To get the sleep study well, okay, but are you trying to continue to have bad sleep so you can impress the sleep study people or are you gonna actually like do try to fix your own sleep?

01:01:37

My doctor's trying to figure out why I get bad sleep, but he's not recommending melatonin. Can you see us? I think he might have said something about melatonin and the use of caffeine but he's. He's doing blood tests he's doing the sleep study he's doing brain scans to see how my.

01:02:05

What maybe in my head why suits I think nicely what I mean, I can I can tell you right now the doctors are ordinary human beings and and they're just as likely to troll as as the as the next Texas idiot and you should see a second opinion if you get a second opinion doctor.

01:02:25

I mean, we put them on pedestals but they're ordinary people only one giving opinion to what I'm saying is you sent me to all kinds of different doctors today, okay, yeah you. Urologist. You know, it's checking everything. Yeah, all right is it but still is it possible you can see another sleep study doctor that he doesn't know well that he doesn't it's a it's a division of the hospital you're in the circumstances here's problem, okay doctors have multiple addendas and he patients to be part of their sleep study if you see another doctor who's not part of his cadre because in different different hospital that he doesn't know he may be able to prescribe you with a strategy.

01:03:21

That it's not about serving a study it's about helping you to sleep because being able to sleep is a medical is of critical importance medically for you to be able to sleep. I don't know where you're being us and the way things work is you have. An insurance group.

01:03:49

You have a main physician you recommend specialists specialists do their work the general physician takes all that information and tries to figure out what's wrong and then makes recommendations for. They all work together is what I'm saying from my perspective here from your perspective what I just said was being opposite and for my perspective it's you're the being obstinate but hit but I'm just saying like why can't you take melatonin now and set an alarm clock now and turn off your sources of blue light now and start treating yourself now, why do you have to wait until the studies over?

01:04:35

I'll talk to about it. Okay, it doesn't this all the other. Questionable observations that he's made he makes a complete observation you're going by something that you've read in a book he's observing my medical conditions he's looking under the hood you're talking about I a general practice okay, you're making recommendations based upon what you've read, he's making recommendations based on his is actual observations of data.

01:05:12

You know, he's observing okay and he's you know forming hypothesis it won't yeah what I want to say before you go to bed is that it is that. That. Please get a second opinion because there are there are doctors who who he has he had he has an agenda.

01:05:38

I'm telling you he has he has to do studies to it's he has multiple things happen. And it doesn't mean that he's doesn't mean that anything he's saying is wrong doesn't mean his analysis is wrong it just means that he's doing more than one thing at the same time and any person who's doing more than one thing at the same time can have their goals confused he's not strictly trying to help you as his only thing he's also trying to help his studies he's also trying to help his research he wants to he wants to study you well fine let him study you let him study you but see a doctor who doesn't have an agenda just to see if they're saying the same thing that doesn't hurt.

01:06:21

That doesn't hurt you it just let it like you that you just know are they saying the same thing. Okay, right? It doesn't hurt your doctor friend either I know you don't yeah I got to go to bed and now you don't want to disappoint your doctor friend all right goodnight.

01:06:39

I got to go to bed here's that my friend he's my doctor he's a doctor but he has an agenda that's when he told me he wants to put you inside he wants to find out what's wrong with me and you don't put somebody in a sleep study in order to further an agenda you put people in sleep study to observe your behavior, they think that is is the agenda to have you need to have.

01:07:06

Mica right gonna stop. How do you think scientists performed? I'm telling you that there's gonna be you're gonna find out that there are multiple people on their sleep study and he he had you always have to find more patients you always have to find more no no no it's got a sleep study or you have a bunch of people that check in and he study them and you write a paper on them, it's a study it's an observation of data by watching me when I'm sleeping, okay, but in the I know it's me, I know doctors listen to me listen to me.

01:07:45

I know doctors who do sleep stud. Ies. I know Dr. CD sleeps later with EG and and other things that's all they do they just do one sleep study after another that's all they do they need new patients constantly it's like feed me another patient so I can do another sleep study they their professionals at sleep studies, they need more patients.

01:08:04

I'm telling you, but I don't understand where you're going. I gotta go. I gotta sleep, okay.
