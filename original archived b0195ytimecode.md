In b0195y I talk for 2 hours, it's long, but worth it, because in a nutshell I describe the main thesis of my book almost completely.

I start out describing my eeg experience where I saw the beginning of time, but I dive deep into cognitive model making including predictive coding.

I talk a lot about my psychedelic medication experiences through out, starting at the 37 minute mark,

I talk about neural coding from fingers to dendrites, pointnet++, 3D neural network in Unity, rhythmic playback in a strange feedback loop, patterns in a temporal feedback loop, ink & canvas metaphor, different patterns from the inhibitory interneuron system, stages of perception, from a looping pattern to sculpting the looping pattern, always ready tonic patterns, phasic is a difference, and I make an argument that we are virtual beings, as if played across a piano, with our location being in different parts of the brain at different times

[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  There was this time that I took this completely legal psychedelic drug called

[00:06.960 --> 00:14.720]  salvia divinorum and I lost the ability to temporarily for about 15 minutes I

[00:14.720 --> 00:20.280]  lost the ability to to distinct to just to make distinctions between different

[00:20.280 --> 00:28.480]  objects which means it's like that's like the whole room becomes one sort of

[00:28.480 --> 00:32.760]  object like nothing there's no distinction between like a couch in the

[00:32.760 --> 00:43.200]  floor or between the sky and the ground it's this completely like space is this

[00:43.200 --> 00:48.560]  undifferentiated sort of smoothness it's at the only time I've experienced this

[00:48.560 --> 00:55.960]  sort of representation of reality there was there was another time with I was

[00:55.960 --> 01:02.760]  doing what I called this this neomind cycle where my brainwaves were driving

[01:02.760 --> 01:06.560]  the light and sound patterns that I was seeing hearing with LED glasses and

[01:06.560 --> 01:15.160]  there was isochronic beats and audio and there was and so that my brainwaves

[01:15.160 --> 01:21.040]  would drive changes to light and sound effects and you would definitely notice

[01:21.040 --> 01:25.680]  that if the EEG stopped you notice it right away it's like falling out of

[01:25.680 --> 01:28.760]  it had this it creates some pressure like you're just dropping out of an

[01:28.760 --> 01:37.320]  airplane it's a dropping out of the sky from an airplane it's just like this

[01:37.320 --> 01:41.600]  when you when you can feel a representation of your own brainwave

[01:41.600 --> 01:45.480]  activity driving changes the light and sound effects you're seeing here and

[01:45.480 --> 01:48.840]  you're in a sense creating a representation of your own brain

[01:48.840 --> 01:53.040]  activity and you can get a sense of how your thoughts and feelings are changing

[01:53.040 --> 01:59.000]  the light and sound effects after a while and so that was this incredible

[01:59.000 --> 02:04.160]  experience and that I was doing in 2011 and then I moved to San Francisco to open

[02:04.160 --> 02:12.400]  up a salon so I could do the neomind cycle salon where that was my business

[02:12.400 --> 02:19.680]  where it's like EEG driving brainwave and treatment experiences and but I got

[02:19.680 --> 02:27.120]  to a point where I I combined besides doing that I said okay well I'm also

[02:27.120 --> 02:36.640]  gonna take some psychedelic medication and and I did and I experienced I first

[02:36.640 --> 02:46.280]  tried to visualize the universe as a series of frames and you know like if

[02:46.280 --> 02:49.400]  you see one if you see like right now in one moment you're it's like you're

[02:49.400 --> 02:57.240]  seeing one frame at a time but if you saw two frames simultaneously then then

[02:57.240 --> 03:01.160]  you would see like two of every person you felt through if you saw if you

[03:01.160 --> 03:07.000]  doubled that you you'd see four of every person four of everything and it's

[03:07.000 --> 03:14.880]  it's this it's this at some point if you keep doubling that perspective so

[03:14.880 --> 03:19.720]  then you're seeing you know eight of everything and 16 of everything and 32

[03:19.720 --> 03:27.080]  of everything 64 of everything 128 of everything 512 of everything and so on

[03:27.080 --> 03:30.200]  and you keep doubling and when you double numbers they get pretty big pretty

[03:30.200 --> 03:33.560]  quick and so pretty soon it was like a hundred and twenty thousand of everything

[03:33.560 --> 03:45.520]  right but the and then you know then you're into you know 250 6,000 everything and 512

[03:45.520 --> 03:53.160]  of everything and so on then you're into huge numbers pretty quickly but what

[03:53.160 --> 03:58.760]  what changes is instead of the visual being like this sort of like really

[03:58.760 --> 04:04.400]  choppy hard to distinguish anything it turned into like a smooth and creamy blur

[04:04.400 --> 04:09.680]  where there is there's no real distinction between one thing and the next

[04:09.680 --> 04:15.400]  you are just you're no longer making you're no longer distinguishing one

[04:15.400 --> 04:22.400]  moment of reality you're sort of seeing that at some level at the highest level

[04:22.400 --> 04:27.960]  the everything gets blurred together with these smooth creamy colors and then

[04:27.960 --> 04:35.160]  everything becomes black and silent like the sounds all sounds cancel each other

[04:35.160 --> 04:39.400]  out all frequencies eventually cancel each other out

[04:41.280 --> 04:44.800]  yeah I guess it I guess I don't know I guess it doesn't have to be black I guess

[04:44.800 --> 04:52.320]  it could be it could be just completely white like adding all colors together but

[04:52.320 --> 04:56.800]  it went black for me in my in my experience like everything and some

[04:56.800 --> 05:01.880]  point it was smooth and creamy and light and then completely dark like space and

[05:01.880 --> 05:08.880]  it was this ever-present and they're they're in that darkness then then the

[05:08.880 --> 05:18.040]  light came on and it was this it was the beginning of time as the beginning of

[05:18.040 --> 05:24.760]  time as something that's outside time give this time as a spectrum from point

[05:24.760 --> 05:30.320]  A to point B at the beginning the end of time but then but then if you could

[05:30.320 --> 05:34.440]  conceptualize every frame of time from the beginning to the end and add them all

[05:34.440 --> 05:40.800]  up together and create a symbol to sort of represent all of those frames I say

[05:40.800 --> 05:45.080]  like okay well the physics of every single frame of time is bound and

[05:45.080 --> 05:52.200]  connected not not in a way that we see in a daily basis but it but in a real

[05:52.200 --> 06:00.480]  sense that space time is that they that everything in space time is anchored by

[06:00.480 --> 06:03.000]  everything else everything in the future is angered by everything in the past

[06:03.000 --> 06:15.840]  vice versa and that the gravitational effects of of planets and galaxies and

[06:15.840 --> 06:24.120]  the curvature of space is all sort of because the past and the future pull on

[06:24.120 --> 06:29.160]  each other because she because the future events it's just just an

[06:29.160 --> 06:35.400]  idea that everything and because you know in it in quantum physics everything

[06:35.400 --> 06:45.120]  is that there was a sad there's a sad YouTube lecture about how the weirdness

[06:45.120 --> 06:53.120]  of quantum physics that everything is is related everything is relative to

[06:53.120 --> 06:59.840]  everything else everything is defined by everything else and everything define

[06:59.840 --> 07:10.960]  everything else defines everything I have to hold that quote but but yeah getting

[07:10.960 --> 07:25.080]  back to the thing it's like if you run to if you run to be a human if you were

[07:25.080 --> 07:33.520]  gonna say okay well how does a human being you know take some moments in time

[07:33.520 --> 07:40.440]  and space space time and convert them into a conscious experience but some

[07:40.440 --> 07:47.040]  point you know we can we can look at the human the study of human

[07:47.040 --> 07:51.680]  neuroanatomy and your photons don't they don't go into your brain from your eye

[07:51.680 --> 07:58.800]  they bounce off the eye they bounce they cause proteins to flip and that

[07:58.800 --> 08:08.880]  creates cellular activity the transmission of neural signals and that

[08:08.880 --> 08:17.240]  they have they have they have effects that that go deeply reaching into your

[08:17.240 --> 08:22.520]  brain from your eyes along the optic nerve to the thalamus to the opposite

[08:22.520 --> 08:32.560]  of lobes and and so on in the back of your head and we have to sort of like

[08:32.560 --> 08:37.280]  say okay well you know your eye has a lot of different cones and it has this

[08:37.280 --> 08:41.040]  blue cone receptors just it they just sort of like they're just for light and

[08:41.040 --> 08:47.480]  there's certain it's like it's like it's like there's some it's not like it's

[08:47.480 --> 08:53.280]  one it's not like an eyeball is is one camera it in a sense it's like there's

[08:53.280 --> 08:58.880]  a lot of different cells in there and each of the cells is being sort of

[08:58.880 --> 09:03.000]  independently affected and some of the cells they're only a fire if they're

[09:03.000 --> 09:07.200]  seeing if they're noticing something moving from the left to the right or

[09:07.200 --> 09:11.760]  from up to down and so that's their their job is they're only going to be

[09:11.760 --> 09:17.120]  looking for certain criteria for certain patterns to happen and these cells are

[09:17.120 --> 09:21.200]  going to reject other kinds of patterns so the goal is the cell doesn't want to

[09:21.200 --> 09:28.440]  only become activated from stimulation it wants to only become activated from

[09:28.440 --> 09:34.120]  information from the detection of certain patterns and the rejection of

[09:34.120 --> 09:40.440]  other patterns that don't match but do not match what it's what's being sent

[09:40.440 --> 09:46.760]  sent in and this is we're talking about the cells the nerve cells in the eyeball

[09:46.760 --> 09:58.320]  ganglion neurons and so on and so forth and so the so I guess what we have to do

[09:58.320 --> 10:04.400]  then if what's being taken into the brain is a lot of different points of signal

[10:04.400 --> 10:11.840]  points okay so it's not like we're piping in the the exact like it's not

[10:11.840 --> 10:15.320]  like a camera where there's like one lens it's like it's a whole bunch of

[10:15.320 --> 10:21.040]  different sensors and the sensors are like you know it's like an array of

[10:21.040 --> 10:25.400]  sensors like an array of camera sensors in the eye if we were just making an

[10:25.400 --> 10:28.840]  analogy or comparing the eye to an array of camera sensors and they're used to

[10:28.840 --> 10:33.320]  take them little points of light of where a photon hit and then from there

[10:33.320 --> 10:37.880]  you're your brain is the job of your brain is to reconstruct the picture so

[10:37.880 --> 10:47.600]  that if you if you look at a bottle of medicine and and it hits your the light

[10:47.600 --> 10:53.360]  from that medicine hits your your eye and those signals eventually travels to

[10:53.360 --> 10:59.360]  your occipital lobes in the back of your head and your brain reconstructs that

[10:59.360 --> 11:07.480]  picture and the in the visual cortex or so it's believed from a city of

[11:07.480 --> 11:15.800]  neuroscience and so there's the the idea is that your brain has to take all of

[11:15.800 --> 11:20.240]  these different points all of these different signals that are received from

[11:20.240 --> 11:25.400]  the surface of the eye and reconstruct an image and and what's also

[11:25.400 --> 11:31.600]  interesting is that it all has to reconstruct the thing is like it's not

[11:31.600 --> 11:36.280]  it not it not not not every person knows that the eye is covered in in blood

[11:36.280 --> 11:42.640]  vessels that are blocking your vision they're not a hundred percent blocking

[11:42.640 --> 11:46.280]  your vision it's like it's through the blood vessels but they're blocking some

[11:46.280 --> 11:49.200]  of your vision in fact there's a there's a blind spot that you can detect by

[11:49.200 --> 11:54.400]  holding up the pencil in front of your eye with a certain with a certain

[11:54.400 --> 11:58.800]  distance away and you look straight at it you can't see the tip of the pencil

[11:58.800 --> 12:02.280]  because that's where your blind spot is but you don't see your blind spot because

[12:02.280 --> 12:06.240]  what you're you're you don't see the blood vessels that are that are covering

[12:06.240 --> 12:11.680]  your the sensors in your eye because your brain is just taking the points that

[12:11.680 --> 12:18.320]  it can detect and from those points it's reconstructing a picture which is a

[12:18.320 --> 12:26.800]  representation an internal representation of reality and so my

[12:26.800 --> 12:34.800]  argument with this book is that that you're going to have so there's it's

[12:34.800 --> 12:41.080]  like if we could if we could see the brain is a 3d sort of 3d neural network

[12:41.080 --> 12:46.920]  like like point net or like deep line so point net plus plus is a neural is a

[12:46.920 --> 12:53.400]  deep learning neural network for 3d classification and segmentation and this

[12:53.400 --> 13:00.600]  is a something that you can you can you can create point clouds it's you know

[13:00.600 --> 13:03.280]  one way that's that's commonly used to create point clouds is with the light

[13:03.280 --> 13:11.600]  are and there's you can use it you can use a depth camera or two cameras that

[13:11.600 --> 13:16.280]  are arranged at a certain distance apart to capture depth data and construct a

[13:16.280 --> 13:23.040]  point cloud from that depth data the point cloud is just done it's just a

[13:23.040 --> 13:29.320]  lot of points in space that quote that you know if you look at this point cloud

[13:29.320 --> 13:33.840]  you might be able to perceive the image of a mug or a table or a car but to a

[13:33.840 --> 13:39.680]  computer they're just points in space a computer doesn't doesn't by itself see a

[13:39.680 --> 13:43.920]  mug or a table or a car I just see there's just there's no perception it's

[13:43.920 --> 13:52.320]  just there's points in space but a computer like with a point net plus

[13:52.320 --> 14:05.400]  plus a computer can perform operations on this cloud of points to try to

[14:05.400 --> 14:15.240]  I to classify what which points belong to sort of like to sort of you know

[14:15.240 --> 14:18.480]  there's just objects which call objects segmentation say all these points

[14:18.480 --> 14:24.480]  belong to one object because they're in close proximity to each other and the

[14:24.480 --> 14:29.840]  classifications like these points are that belong to this object correspond to

[14:29.840 --> 14:36.840]  a mug these points that are with this object correspond to a table and these

[14:36.840 --> 14:43.440]  points that correspond to this object point to a car and so the computer has

[14:43.440 --> 14:47.240]  to figure out which points belong to which object and then what that object

[14:47.240 --> 14:52.120]  corresponds to in terms of classifying images so that in that sense you can use

[14:52.120 --> 14:59.440]  like labeled data labeled images where the computer to make comparisons to you

[14:59.440 --> 15:03.440]  know basically you would take like one perspective on that cloud points and

[15:03.440 --> 15:09.040]  compare it to images until you find something that is sure as enough similar

[15:09.040 --> 15:14.760]  features that the neural network says well it's an 80% chance that's a mug and

[15:14.760 --> 15:21.800]  70% chance that's a table in addition you know more you know the point the

[15:21.800 --> 15:27.640]  point cloud can can identify well these are the wings of an airplane this is the

[15:27.640 --> 15:33.240]  the tail of an airplane it can do it's called part segmentation and semantic

[15:33.240 --> 15:37.240]  segmentation you know like okay well there's here's the floor here's the

[15:37.240 --> 15:43.560]  walls here's the lamps and the ceiling and it's taking apart the entire room

[15:43.560 --> 15:52.600]  and you know just basically it's it's able to basically do objects it's

[15:52.600 --> 15:59.560]  combining object segmentation and parts segmentation and and classification

[15:59.560 --> 16:03.400]  into one process and we call that semantic segmentation and that's really

[16:03.400 --> 16:11.640]  the goal of point net is 3d semantic segmentation but the argument is that

[16:11.640 --> 16:18.040]  that I'm making which is not which is in part that our brains are doing

[16:18.040 --> 16:27.040]  basically 3d semantic segmentation to reconstruct the the images that we're

[16:27.040 --> 16:40.200]  seeing I think that bottle of medicine and then what happens is while the well

[16:40.200 --> 16:50.160]  that that actually that that it's big it's there's a temporal component where

[16:50.160 --> 16:56.360]  you'll have a group of neurons that will represent because because you know

[16:56.360 --> 17:00.840]  there's like when you think of your there was this great analogy think of your

[17:00.840 --> 17:05.880]  mind is like a movie for a second just isn't this is just an analogy it's like

[17:05.880 --> 17:12.400]  the movie has frames so each each moment with what we'll say just imagine each

[17:12.400 --> 17:17.640]  second like a movie could be 60 frames per second each second there's 60 frames

[17:17.640 --> 17:29.040]  okay and we're gonna I'm gonna argue that that in each of those frames 60 frames

[17:29.040 --> 17:33.280]  per second there's gonna be a different set is just a thought experiment I don't

[17:33.280 --> 17:37.480]  what the actual frame rate of the brain is probably a lot more than that but

[17:37.480 --> 17:42.000]  we'll just say that in each we'll just say for the sake of this thought

[17:42.000 --> 17:49.400]  experiment that there's 60 frames per second happening okay and and I did on

[17:49.400 --> 17:55.240]  the and the level of the brain it's it's brain activity is happening perhaps at

[17:55.240 --> 18:04.800]  the millisecond level so maybe there's there's you know I don't know a thousand

[18:04.800 --> 18:08.640]  frames per second or something but it could be even faster because you know

[18:08.640 --> 18:15.560]  you could have basically you know there's so many neurons that you could

[18:15.560 --> 18:20.480]  have while individual neurons can be so if you have a lot of them you could do

[18:20.480 --> 18:29.240]  you could be doing operations much faster by basically you know having one

[18:29.240 --> 18:39.520]  so one set of neurons might go off in one millisecond but and and then in the

[18:39.520 --> 18:42.280]  next millisecond that happens a whole different set of neurons could be going

[18:42.280 --> 18:48.560]  off and you might have many different it could be strategic could be that you

[18:48.560 --> 18:54.960]  have that sort of subdivide it so you have you could have 60 different sets

[18:54.960 --> 19:00.640]  of neurons going off every every millisecond just because the each set

[19:00.640 --> 19:05.320]  of neurons is located in a different place in the brain so you have so you

[19:05.320 --> 19:17.000]  have 60 neurons per second per millisecond I mean 60 groups of neurons

[19:17.000 --> 19:19.840]  oscillate in per millisecond just because they're in different parts of the

[19:19.840 --> 19:24.800]  brain just there's so many neurons so thinking kind of could be much faster

[19:24.800 --> 19:31.640]  because it's it's happening on a larger scale now I'm not sure about the actual

[19:31.640 --> 19:37.120]  situation where I don't know if the brain can how fast the brain is actually

[19:37.120 --> 19:40.240]  operating that's a good it's a good open question there's lots of opportunity

[19:40.240 --> 19:45.600]  for for more research there could be hundreds of years more research that

[19:45.600 --> 19:50.240]  would be done on the brain after after this book many hundreds of years it

[19:50.240 --> 20:00.920]  depends on you know how how fast technology is going to continue

[20:00.920 --> 20:09.160]  accelerating if we think of technology in a linear acceleration then we're you

[20:09.160 --> 20:14.640]  know then I guess that might inspire us to think that there are really many

[20:14.640 --> 20:18.840]  hundreds of years left of neuroscience research before we figure out every

[20:18.840 --> 20:22.680]  everything about the brain but if we're thinking about technology accelerating

[20:22.680 --> 20:32.160]  along an exponential curve then the neuroscience may actually reach a sort

[20:32.160 --> 20:38.000]  of rapid conclusion where we where science just advances so quickly that

[20:38.000 --> 20:44.600]  we that it everything that there is to know about the brain may be discovered

[20:44.600 --> 20:52.160]  sometime soon with the aid of the computers that will help accelerate the

[20:52.160 --> 21:03.920]  rate of discovery of new technologies and and new features of of brains and so

[21:03.920 --> 21:09.040]  science may accelerate in quite extraordinary ways and but I think we're

[21:09.040 --> 21:14.760]  at the point now where we can make arguments about what is what is fundamentally

[21:14.760 --> 21:23.800]  happening and the brain that causes human experience and so it's it's so

[21:23.800 --> 21:32.400]  going back to it it's like there's there are enough frames okay that if you

[21:32.400 --> 21:36.640]  think about 10 seconds of your own experience and you slice that up say

[21:36.640 --> 21:42.960]  okay well my eyes traveled from we're just I'm just making up the story but my

[21:42.960 --> 21:49.360]  eyes traveled from the left side of my computer screen over to the right side of

[21:49.360 --> 21:55.200]  my desk where I saw the medicine bottle again and then they traveled back to the

[21:55.200 --> 22:03.160]  left side of my computer screen again and and so that was if you say okay

[22:03.160 --> 22:06.480]  that's the movie now you could you film you could film that with a camera or depth

[22:06.480 --> 22:10.480]  camera so you move your camera you could film from the left side of the computer

[22:10.480 --> 22:15.360]  screen past this the edge of the computer screen over to the medicine

[22:15.360 --> 22:19.840]  bottle and move the camera back and you've created a movie and in each frame

[22:19.840 --> 22:25.640]  with the movie the frame is a little bit different and the idea is that you're

[22:25.640 --> 22:29.680]  you're gonna have a sequence of neurons that's gonna fire to represent each one

[22:29.680 --> 22:37.560]  of those frames okay and the neurons are going to be the neural networks in

[22:37.560 --> 22:44.120]  Iran are going to be sort of learning a sequence so that they can know when

[22:44.120 --> 22:48.720]  they're going to fire they're going to predict that there's a theory out there

[22:48.720 --> 22:59.280]  called prediction prediction coding or coding now predictive coding that's what

[22:59.280 --> 23:04.280]  it is and it's also sort of the same a similar idea is it's found in a similar

[23:04.280 --> 23:08.720]  idea to predictive coding is found in the book on intelligence by the Hawkins

[23:08.720 --> 23:16.280]  where the idea is that your your brain is making predictions of the world and

[23:16.280 --> 23:23.560]  those predictions are how it models the world and and so when you adjust one of

[23:23.560 --> 23:28.040]  Jeff Hawkins and he talked about in intelligence one of his examples was if

[23:28.040 --> 23:35.520]  you reach out and grab something like the medicine bottle and you and you you

[23:35.520 --> 23:43.640]  touch it and suddenly you hear a chicken a chicken screaming you'd be very

[23:43.640 --> 23:47.520]  surprised because you're you're not expecting the bottle to sound like a

[23:47.520 --> 23:53.120]  chicken you're expecting the bottle to sound the way a bottle would sound if

[23:53.120 --> 23:57.480]  it makes any sound you're expecting to feel the way a bottle would feel you

[23:57.480 --> 24:05.240]  had the point is you have expectations about the sensory properties of the

[24:05.240 --> 24:10.920]  bottle what it feels like what it looks like how it moves what it's gonna do if

[24:10.920 --> 24:16.200]  you take the cap off how the cap is gonna feel when you're unscrewing it same

[24:16.200 --> 24:19.040]  thing when you reach out for a door handle this was the door handle one

[24:19.040 --> 24:22.640]  was one of the ones in Jeff Hawkins book on intelligence you reach out for a

[24:22.640 --> 24:26.400]  door handle you have this prediction in your mind about how it's gonna feel and

[24:26.400 --> 24:30.760]  if it felt very different it'd be a surprise and the fact that it would be

[24:30.760 --> 24:39.360]  surprised points to the fact that your predictions are are happy that you're

[24:39.360 --> 24:42.880]  making predictions about the world and in that your representations of

[24:42.880 --> 24:47.960]  everything around you are in fact sensory predictions they're their

[24:47.960 --> 24:53.600]  predictions encoded in in in light patterns and sound patterns that your

[24:53.600 --> 24:58.120]  brain is accepting and in reacting but they're also encoded they're also

[24:58.120 --> 25:04.160]  temporally encoded in sequences and spatially encoded so when you look from

[25:04.160 --> 25:08.440]  let's go back to the example if you look from the left of your monitor to over

[25:08.440 --> 25:13.680]  to the medicine bottle and then back to the left of your monitor then and I

[25:13.680 --> 25:17.120]  mean my from the left of the monitor towards the right of the monitor towards

[25:17.120 --> 25:20.240]  medicine bottle so and then from the medicine bottle towards right of the

[25:20.240 --> 25:23.640]  monitor towards the left of the monitor okay so this is the medicine bottom

[25:23.640 --> 25:29.560]  history is actually on the right side of the monitor if that wasn't I guess it

[25:29.560 --> 25:39.800]  wasn't made clear earlier but but the the point is that your brain is making

[25:39.800 --> 25:46.720]  sensory predictions of a reality and what's missing from this picture is is

[25:46.720 --> 25:50.520]  where is the observer who's watching us is there a little man inside the head

[25:50.520 --> 25:54.720]  where's how does this information become conscious how does it become something

[25:54.720 --> 26:00.600]  that we think about that's I think that's what I can add to the picture a

[26:00.600 --> 26:06.340]  little bit and so we so we know so you know this is a great book called

[26:06.340 --> 26:11.080]  rhythms of the brain by Buzaki I think it's how you pronounce his name I'm

[26:11.080 --> 26:19.320]  sure but I guess this book is in print off but anyway so he the book is really

[26:19.320 --> 26:24.440]  worth reading it's probably mandatory for neuroscientists and neurologists to

[26:24.440 --> 26:29.920]  read definitely covers a lot he's a newer book out that it's also sort of

[26:29.920 --> 26:38.400]  mandatory reading that ran from inside out and but what I'm getting at is so

[26:38.400 --> 26:44.480]  we have sensory predictions but we also we should look at you know how look at

[26:44.480 --> 26:50.440]  the example of point net plus plus and how these your brain is as a 3D neural

[26:50.440 --> 26:55.280]  network is going to be able to do at least the same sort of operations that

[26:55.280 --> 26:58.840]  point net plus plus does which is where it's your brain is gonna be able to say

[26:58.840 --> 27:04.920]  okay well all the points in space connected to that medicine model to find

[27:04.920 --> 27:09.280]  the object of the medicine model and I have this sort of perspective which I

[27:09.280 --> 27:13.400]  don't know if everyone has but I because I've tried to be a divin on I know what

[27:13.400 --> 27:18.040]  it's like to not be able to distinguish the medicine bottle from the table right

[27:18.040 --> 27:23.640]  I know what it's like when I can't tell one object from the next and so I know

[27:23.640 --> 27:27.320]  that yeah my brain is doing an object segmentation and then semantic

[27:27.320 --> 27:33.560]  segmentation simultaneously it's doing that kind of deep learning operation

[27:33.560 --> 27:41.600]  albeit with a different sort of you know doesn't operate exactly the same but

[27:41.600 --> 27:46.440]  even though it operates in a different way from how point net plus plus operates

[27:46.440 --> 27:57.120]  that the the guiding principles of sorry the guiding operations of a neural

[27:57.120 --> 28:05.800]  network that is going to notice that you know these these these points belong

[28:05.800 --> 28:10.160]  together these features belong together these lines belong together these lines

[28:10.160 --> 28:16.720]  represent letters on the bottle okay at some point you know if you remember so

[28:16.720 --> 28:21.280]  you can remember back when you first started to read which I didn't know for

[28:21.280 --> 28:26.000]  some of you was second or third grade I actually I don't remember when when I

[28:26.000 --> 28:29.120]  first learned how to read it might have it might have been in the kindergarten

[28:29.120 --> 28:33.480]  right they're starting to learn letters seems like a kindergarten thing learning

[28:33.480 --> 28:40.600]  letters but the point is like some point letters are indistinguishable you

[28:40.600 --> 28:46.720]  can see this when you see a language that you haven't learned get another

[28:46.720 --> 28:50.920]  language out there that you haven't learned and you don't know how to

[28:50.920 --> 28:54.240]  interpret those letters you don't know what the letters are you don't have a

[28:54.240 --> 29:03.280]  way to distinguish what what or what what the shapes are in some other language

[29:03.280 --> 29:08.080]  and so you may not recognize that you're looking at a letter that you've seen a

[29:08.080 --> 29:15.960]  lot or or a letter that is or symbol you know that that is very common or

[29:15.960 --> 29:19.800]  simple that's very rare you may you may not know probably don't know if it's a

[29:19.800 --> 29:25.880]  language you haven't learned and and what are the associations you know with

[29:25.880 --> 29:32.080]  that symbol or that letter what are the kinds of words or ideas that are evoked

[29:32.080 --> 29:45.920]  by that character okay what is the context what is the social reality

[29:45.920 --> 29:53.000]  context of those symbols that you are encountering that that actually that

[29:53.000 --> 30:03.200]  matters and so without that without that context it is a it's a it's a it's you

[30:03.200 --> 30:08.040]  know if you are if you haven't learned Chinese and the medicine one of those

[30:08.040 --> 30:13.200]  Chinese characters you you on it you you may not know what medicine is in that

[30:13.200 --> 30:18.520]  body meaning you may not even know that it is a medicine bottle you know unless

[30:18.520 --> 30:26.520]  someone tells you right it could be anything but but you you might you might

[30:26.520 --> 30:32.760]  know if you if you see the of course that an English version of the same bottle

[30:32.760 --> 30:36.480]  next to like if you're if you're an English speaker and you see an English

[30:36.480 --> 30:40.280]  version of the bottle and looks very similar to the Chinese version of the

[30:40.280 --> 30:42.960]  bottle you might infer that the Chinese version of the bottle is the same

[30:42.960 --> 30:47.160]  thing as the English version especially if you look at on the back and the

[30:47.160 --> 30:53.200]  numbers representing the amount of medicine in each capsule are the same

[30:53.200 --> 31:08.560]  maybe they both say 500 milligram or 500 something you know on the back and but

[31:08.560 --> 31:13.960]  the beginning to getting to the thing is is what's interesting about the brain is

[31:13.960 --> 31:25.000]  that your your your neuron activity not only has to happen in sequences where you

[31:25.000 --> 31:30.520]  have neurons that are basically there in the dent and dendrite area they're

[31:30.520 --> 31:36.680]  receiving signals and and dendrite in some areas receiving signals from

[31:36.680 --> 31:44.640]  different nearby neurons and that is causing the the neural like the neural

[31:44.640 --> 31:49.160]  firing rate to increase or decrease see the thing that it's not really like

[31:49.160 --> 31:56.720]  sort of like explained clearly clearly in in like computational neuroscience 101

[31:56.720 --> 32:02.880]  is that neurons are basically it's not really clearly explained the sort of

[32:02.880 --> 32:07.080]  temporal reality of neurons they're basically always firing it like tonic

[32:07.080 --> 32:11.040]  rates they're always trying they're always firing tonically like sort of like

[32:11.040 --> 32:17.960]  an agostin or random sort of pattern or basically with with a with an

[32:17.960 --> 32:22.640]  oscillator with a group of neurons that are all sort of firing tonically at the

[32:22.640 --> 32:29.800]  same rate okay but in order to have a sequence where as you look from the left

[32:29.800 --> 32:34.400]  of the monitor towards the right of the monitor towards the bottle from the

[32:34.400 --> 32:40.320]  bottle towards the right of the monitor towards left of the monitor you have to

[32:40.320 --> 32:48.320]  have a sequence of neurons that is going to fire for each sort of like place

[32:48.320 --> 32:52.200]  placement of where your eyes are in a given span of time let's say you're

[32:52.200 --> 32:55.280]  you're looking from the left and to the right over and over again at whatever's

[32:55.280 --> 33:01.320]  in front of you okay and you're your your eyes are moving from left to the

[33:01.320 --> 33:07.680]  right and you are filling that and so that you can say okay well this is ten

[33:07.680 --> 33:11.920]  seconds of my conscious experience I'm gonna divide this I'm gonna divide this

[33:11.920 --> 33:16.560]  into a millisecond so so millisecond is a thousand milliseconds in one second

[33:16.560 --> 33:22.400]  that's ten thousand milliseconds each one of those frames then could have

[33:22.400 --> 33:30.160]  different neurons that are being affected in that in that moment in each

[33:30.160 --> 33:35.680]  one of those frames so ten thousand milliseconds is each one is a different

[33:35.680 --> 33:40.480]  group of neurons that fire to react to represent that one moment so it's like

[33:40.480 --> 33:45.480]  a good little point point net and the point net is going to recognize well

[33:45.480 --> 33:49.680]  this is a table and this is a chair and this is a floor and this is a lamp and

[33:49.680 --> 33:54.360]  this is a ceiling this is a desk this is a coffee cup and it does cement 3d

[33:54.360 --> 33:59.160]  semantic segmentation well it's as if you're going to have an entire group of

[33:59.160 --> 34:08.320]  neurons they're gonna be doing that in each millisecond for for ten thousand

[34:08.320 --> 34:17.760]  milliseconds or ten seconds and what's happening is that the neurons that aren't

[34:17.760 --> 34:24.960]  firing are listening for when they're going to fire but so that they can

[34:24.960 --> 34:30.160]  predict when they're going to fire but the thing is is that they're also they're

[34:30.160 --> 34:34.360]  not just in it we're arguing that the prediction of when they're going to fire

[34:34.360 --> 34:39.640]  is part of how you're creating over the representation so it's predicting a

[34:39.640 --> 34:42.960]  neuron is going to predict it's like it's like before you reach out for the

[34:42.960 --> 34:46.680]  medicine bottle you have this prediction of what it's gonna feel like when you

[34:46.680 --> 34:52.120]  before you grab it in your hand okay and so that is like those are dendrites

[34:52.120 --> 34:55.920]  being activated in your brain just imagine this is the dendrites are the

[34:55.920 --> 35:02.440]  first part of a neuron and it's receiving signals and it's predicting that

[35:02.440 --> 35:05.680]  it's gonna that your hand is gonna close around the bottle and it's predicting

[35:05.680 --> 35:09.840]  when the bottle is gonna feel like if the bottle doesn't feel like a bottle if

[35:09.840 --> 35:14.560]  it feels like a chicken's head or a bug's head where you reach out and grab the

[35:14.560 --> 35:18.000]  bottle and suddenly you're holding a roach it's gonna be very surprising and

[35:18.000 --> 35:21.880]  that surprise is generated because you have this prediction in your brain which

[35:21.880 --> 35:26.680]  is certain neurons are expecting to fire but different neurons fire instead

[35:26.680 --> 35:31.880]  and that creates a surprise because your things didn't go as expected so you had

[35:31.880 --> 35:38.960]  these predictions that weren't correct and and so when you get novel

[35:38.960 --> 35:42.760]  experiences and then you're you know you're gonna notice that a little bit

[35:42.760 --> 35:48.760]  more because creating like a novel activity pattern is creating something

[35:48.760 --> 35:53.760]  for your brain to pay attention to which escapes the normal sort of expectation

[35:53.760 --> 35:59.720]  but I what I'm saying is like okay so you so you have you know your brain

[35:59.720 --> 36:03.560]  activity happening in multiple stages or multiple steps or multiple frames you

[36:03.560 --> 36:08.040]  have neurons that are firing listening from when they're going to fire so they

[36:08.040 --> 36:11.680]  can fire correctly in a nice sequence so you so that when your way when you're

[36:11.680 --> 36:16.680]  moving your your eyes from left to the right you're not experiencing things in

[36:16.680 --> 36:21.200]  the wrong order because your neurons are firing in the right order right if you

[36:21.200 --> 36:24.600]  experience the right side of the screen on the left side of the screen and the

[36:24.600 --> 36:27.920]  left side of the screen on the right side of the screen then then your neurons

[36:27.920 --> 36:31.000]  will be firing in the wrong order that's this kind of that's the kind of weird

[36:31.000 --> 36:34.960]  you know thing that can happen when people are hallucinating they see

[36:34.960 --> 36:39.400]  things that are not not there they're just not rendered correctly you're not

[36:39.400 --> 36:44.200]  seeing them correctly you're seeing you know patterns on top of things you're

[36:44.200 --> 36:47.840]  seeing the shape of reality change certain hallucinations will take you to

[36:47.840 --> 36:56.800]  other worlds and you know or or or make you see aliens talk to aliens because

[36:56.800 --> 37:04.480]  your brain activity is being confused by the medication which which which which

[37:04.480 --> 37:13.200]  I believe is very possibly very healthy sort of medication in certain

[37:13.200 --> 37:18.760]  contexts there's definitely um it's not it's not negative to confuse your your

[37:18.760 --> 37:25.080]  brain with psychedelic medication it definitely that could be it's very

[37:25.080 --> 37:32.920]  creative thought and to you know like Steve Jobs was it was a bit was a fan of

[37:32.920 --> 37:39.320]  LSD sort of one of the best things that he ever did was to take LSD and I think

[37:39.320 --> 37:46.520]  that you know that's one of the reasons Silicon Valley has sort of like Silicon

[37:46.520 --> 37:53.440]  Valley has become like a leader a leading representative as the sort of

[37:53.440 --> 37:57.900]  like the beginning of the computer industry is associated with Silicon

[37:57.900 --> 38:04.240]  Valley you know an Apple computer and and and of course you know later on

[38:04.240 --> 38:08.960]  Google and other companies other tech companies Microsoft Microsoft I guess

[38:08.960 --> 38:14.320]  is more Redmond but but a lot of tech companies a lot of computer companies

[38:14.320 --> 38:19.240]  sort of got their start in Silicon Valley then another thing about Silicon

[38:19.240 --> 38:22.880]  Valley was that there was a lot of it's a place where you can get LSD there's a

[38:22.880 --> 38:30.600]  lot of psychedelic medication there's a lot of basically you know it's your

[38:30.600 --> 38:40.200]  your your brain is is supercharged overcharged

[38:40.200 --> 38:46.080]  creatively inspired and you may have amazing visions that go on to

[38:46.080 --> 38:51.960]  revolutionize the world it's the psychedelic medication can be the door

[38:51.960 --> 38:58.400]  it's called the doorways of perception by the doorway of perception all this

[38:58.400 --> 39:04.600]  Huxley phrase that I think he coined that phrase a door of perception all this

[39:04.600 --> 39:17.040]  Huxley and but what I'm saying is is that if you go if you go a step further

[39:17.040 --> 39:27.400]  and you know we can look at you know your brain is listening to your brain

[39:27.400 --> 39:33.880]  your most of your neurons don't have contact to your sensory organs so you've

[39:33.880 --> 39:38.640]  got these got neurons that are in your eye and those are collecting sensory

[39:38.640 --> 39:48.880]  data but after that you know after your sort of primary excitatory neurons then

[39:48.880 --> 39:54.520]  you have your you know you let your brain you have the neurons that don't

[39:54.520 --> 40:00.840]  have direct connections to to sensory inputs or direct connections of sensory

[40:00.840 --> 40:05.720]  outputs like motor I'm sorry motor outputs and and those are the interneurons

[40:05.720 --> 40:15.240]  and interneurons an interneuron inhibitory system is a system that I

[40:15.240 --> 40:19.160]  think about it's like you know there's all these different ways that signals

[40:19.160 --> 40:25.240]  can travel right and you've got you've got features you've got you know

[40:25.240 --> 40:30.880]  basically patterns coming into the brain and let's say that you have this

[40:30.880 --> 40:38.600]  representation of a cat and a cat's tail but you don't see how the cat and the

[40:38.600 --> 40:41.560]  cat's are connected because the cat is hidden behind a pole well if you've seen

[40:41.560 --> 40:47.520]  cats before then you know that the tail is part of the cat you've never seen the

[40:47.520 --> 40:52.400]  cat and the cat's tail you've never seen a cat's tail on a cat before it's

[40:52.400 --> 40:59.360]  possible you could be confused into into what the tail is or that or the fact

[40:59.360 --> 41:02.840]  that the tail is connected to the cat if you don't see that it's connected to the

[41:02.840 --> 41:06.840]  cat if all you see is a tail on one on one side of the pole and the cat on the

[41:06.840 --> 41:11.920]  other side of the pole that tail could belong to a different animal I make that

[41:11.920 --> 41:15.040]  argument because you know computers you know can make that mistake

[41:15.040 --> 41:19.400]  computers that are tasked with computer vision and then and there's this thing

[41:19.400 --> 41:24.120]  called that with that it happens a lot with two-dimensional convolutional

[41:24.120 --> 41:31.360]  neural networks called where you're the it's called overfitting you know where

[41:31.360 --> 41:39.680]  you have you use a process like gradient descent or dropout to to randomly

[41:39.680 --> 41:46.720]  delete some of the data and you know I make this joke it's like you know when

[41:46.720 --> 41:50.600]  you're killing your brain cells with alcohol you're randomly deleting some

[41:50.600 --> 41:55.960]  of your brain data but that could have a beneficial effect in that it

[41:55.960 --> 42:00.320]  forces your brain to say okay well shit we're missing the data that connects the

[42:00.320 --> 42:09.920]  cat's tail to the cat but because we're missing data a lot that we have to learn

[42:09.920 --> 42:17.000]  to make more creative connections between things that seem to be separate

[42:17.000 --> 42:20.600]  because we can't because there's a there's a pole between the cat and the cat's tail

[42:20.600 --> 42:27.080]  from your perspective because you because the cat is behind the pole but

[42:27.080 --> 42:33.000]  because your your brain or because the computer is a dropout you know a gradient

[42:33.000 --> 42:41.240]  descent is is able to make that creative connection to say okay well even

[42:41.240 --> 42:45.200]  though there's a there's a clear gap between the cast on the cat there's

[42:45.200 --> 42:52.080]  enough feature similarities similar fur colors similar you know they're both

[42:52.080 --> 42:55.840]  moving nothing else is moving that it can make a sort of creative leap and say

[42:55.840 --> 42:58.880]  okay well maybe even though they're not physically connected these two things

[42:58.880 --> 43:04.520]  are are actually connected and maybe it can be into say okay well there's

[43:04.520 --> 43:08.480]  something in front of the cat that's this is blocking the connection between

[43:08.480 --> 43:14.920]  the tail and the cat and that I think is the sort of value of psychedelic

[43:14.920 --> 43:20.680]  medication which can do weird things to your brain but those weird things may

[43:20.680 --> 43:25.120]  cause you to have leaps in creativity creative genius which which can lead to

[43:25.120 --> 43:31.120]  the creation of a flake Apple computer as the result of psychedelic medication

[43:31.120 --> 43:39.480]  use and you know certain get said so maybe maybe I would say well the the

[43:39.480 --> 43:44.760]  results of alcohol use haven't been as impressive as psychedelic use that we

[43:44.760 --> 43:49.680]  you know psychedelics people invented computer companies with alcohol they

[43:49.680 --> 43:55.440]  invented dictatorships right so so maybe the alcohol is a little bit too

[43:55.440 --> 44:01.120]  aggressive for the human brain it's hard to say dictatorships I mean like you

[44:01.120 --> 44:10.200]  know church cathedrals I'm just imagining that you know it's like a

[44:10.200 --> 44:16.680]  giant cathedral and rises high up into the sky with the spires but all around

[44:16.680 --> 44:22.920]  the landscape there's there's just little houses so the church just like

[44:22.920 --> 44:28.800]  physically dominates space and anyone who visits that church just knows that

[44:28.800 --> 44:34.120]  the ultimate power and dictatorship is there in that building and everyone and

[44:34.120 --> 44:38.160]  anyone and everyone else is just a peon compared to you know sort of the

[44:38.160 --> 44:42.560]  headquarters of the church this is what kind of like you know architectures that

[44:42.560 --> 44:49.360]  it's creative but it might be more sort of it's not as genius as a computer

[44:49.360 --> 44:56.080]  company you know a computer company that's genius that that is sort of like

[44:56.080 --> 45:04.080]  a much maybe a much better way to tease your brain into into the kind of work

[45:04.080 --> 45:08.360]  that will revolutionize the world and I I've really enjoyed for me personally

[45:08.360 --> 45:14.080]  I've enjoyed psychedelics since I was about six age 16 when I I was in high

[45:14.080 --> 45:22.040]  school and I I tried someone someone gave me LSD and I took it in class not

[45:22.040 --> 45:27.320]  really knowing that much about it and I remember telling the girl in front of

[45:27.320 --> 45:34.040]  me in class said I'm on LSD right now she said no way I don't believe you and I

[45:34.040 --> 45:39.580]  just thought that was funny and I believe that was at Magnolia High

[45:39.580 --> 45:50.280]  School it's okay LSD at Magnolia High School when I was a student there but

[45:50.280 --> 45:59.000]  but moving on I think that the point is that you we still have this sort of like

[45:59.000 --> 46:04.040]  question okay so I forgot this idea if the brain is a 3D neural network then it

[46:04.040 --> 46:07.920]  should be able to do at least the kinds of operations that point net plus plus

[46:07.920 --> 46:15.280]  does point net is by the way still even though it is a it does 3d semantic

[46:15.280 --> 46:21.440]  segmentation 3d 3d object segmentation 3d classification on point sets it does

[46:21.440 --> 46:28.680]  those things but it is not a 3d neural network in terms of its substrate in

[46:28.680 --> 46:33.840]  terms of how it's constructed it's still a 2d computational process but in the

[46:33.840 --> 46:41.280]  human brain human brain is an actual 3d neural network which means that that you

[46:41.280 --> 46:48.240]  know a cortical column both a neuron and a cortical column which is several which

[46:48.240 --> 46:56.440]  is many neurons they it's the receiving information from from every

[46:56.440 --> 47:01.680]  direction from from above and from below from the left and to the right from

[47:01.680 --> 47:09.240]  forward and from back it's sending and receiving information it's it's a

[47:09.240 --> 47:14.880]  bi-directional 6-doff neural network right and it does in it in the inter

[47:14.880 --> 47:18.520]  neurons right the neural columns in the center of your brain they never have

[47:18.520 --> 47:22.080]  any contact with you with the real world they're in the middle of your brain

[47:22.080 --> 47:26.880]  so all they get is the information you got to see from the from the cortical

[47:26.880 --> 47:30.000]  columns point of view all they get is information from other neurons so they

[47:30.000 --> 47:34.720]  have to listen to other neurons to predict when they're going to fire in a

[47:34.720 --> 47:38.960]  sequence so that what when you move your eyes from left and to the right the

[47:38.960 --> 47:43.560]  stuff that's on your left stays on your left it's on your right this goes to

[47:43.560 --> 47:46.480]  your right there's this one time I'll tell you I had this story where I

[47:46.480 --> 47:52.800]  experienced reality out of the correct time sequence where I I was I was taking

[47:52.800 --> 47:59.720]  LSD at at home and I was still in high school the time I think I was still 16

[47:59.720 --> 48:09.560]  and I I walked down the stairs and outside because my parents called me for

[48:09.560 --> 48:16.360]  some reason and then I walked back inside up the stairs and into a lounge

[48:16.360 --> 48:23.360]  area and then when I was in the lounge area I experienced myself walking up the

[48:23.360 --> 48:31.440]  stairs it was in fact like my brain was playing back the climb up the stairs in

[48:31.440 --> 48:35.720]  the wrong order so I saw I experienced myself having climbed up the stairs

[48:35.720 --> 48:41.320]  after I was already upstairs it's like your brain it's like that's when your

[48:41.320 --> 48:46.080]  neurons are firing out of order okay that's something that that that can

[48:46.080 --> 48:55.440]  happen on psychedelic medication and so that's the thing is is you your brain

[48:55.440 --> 48:58.960]  has to the neurons have to fire in the right order that means they're listening

[48:58.960 --> 49:02.200]  from when they're supposed to fire they're learning temporal sequences

[49:02.200 --> 49:07.560]  there is a so that they can find my daughters that you experience time in

[49:07.560 --> 49:12.160]  the right order otherwise you'd have a lot of trouble navigating reality if you

[49:12.160 --> 49:15.880]  weren't experiencing time in the correct order that would be very dangerous for

[49:15.880 --> 49:22.640]  you there's all sorts of things that go wrong with you in perception but not to

[49:22.640 --> 49:32.080]  get too far down that road I experienced in time in the wrong orders is one thing

[49:32.080 --> 49:42.560]  but it was interesting isn't there this has been depicted in fiction science

[49:42.560 --> 49:46.960]  fiction definitely remember episodes of Star Trek where Captain Picard was

[49:46.960 --> 49:50.880]  experiencing time in the wrong order where he'd he'd experienced the past in

[49:50.880 --> 49:57.680]  the future right after one another especially some of the the later episodes

[49:57.680 --> 50:04.720]  the final episodes of the original Star Trek next generation series he was he

[50:04.720 --> 50:09.280]  went to the future his his aversion of the future and then he went to the past

[50:09.280 --> 50:12.680]  and he was traveling back and forth between the past and the future to try

[50:12.680 --> 50:22.000]  to fix some catastrophe and and his future self has some sort of terrible

[50:22.000 --> 50:30.440]  disease that was pretty serious and not something he can get out of but but

[50:30.440 --> 50:35.360]  maybe he could go back in time and and fix something and I forget what that was

[50:35.360 --> 50:39.480]  that he was going to fix because I haven't seen that a long time ago but

[50:39.480 --> 50:44.480]  it's interesting that that's sort of like experiencing reality out of order is

[50:44.480 --> 50:49.640]  has also made it into stories and friction and I've had experiences like

[50:49.640 --> 50:57.560]  that and that is and so so I'm just sort of like making this point to say well

[50:57.560 --> 51:02.640]  your brain actually has to learn sequences this is the reality so that

[51:02.640 --> 51:07.680]  your neurons can find the right order to represent each stage of reality in the

[51:07.680 --> 51:13.440]  order that you're experiencing it and not in the wrong order and predictive

[51:13.440 --> 51:23.680]  coding sort of gives us part of the template of how this of how of how this

[51:24.120 --> 51:32.280]  sequence can happen because if a neuron doesn't actually fire at like see let's

[51:32.280 --> 51:36.240]  say that to create the representation in the neuron hand to fire but before it

[51:36.240 --> 51:41.560]  creates the representation it creates a prediction by having a smaller firing

[51:41.560 --> 51:47.040]  event it's called a forward dendritic action potential there's also even

[51:47.040 --> 51:56.920]  smaller possible events like there's a synapse action potential event sort of

[51:56.920 --> 52:03.880]  like a sin a synapse firing so synapses individuals synapses or receptors on the

[52:03.880 --> 52:08.560]  on the dendrite so the dendrite is like if you look if you look at your hand

[52:08.560 --> 52:14.720]  and imagine that your fingers are the branch or the branches of a dendrite

[52:14.720 --> 52:19.080]  and where you touch your fingers each of those points where you touch your fingers

[52:19.080 --> 52:23.720]  like each points of each each points of contact in your skin just imagine that

[52:23.720 --> 52:36.520]  that is represented by is representative of the the synapse right so

[52:36.520 --> 52:41.080]  if you touch your finger anywhere in different places touch different fingers

[52:41.080 --> 52:45.840]  in different places I can imagine that when those touches those are those are

[52:45.840 --> 52:52.360]  like synapse those are like your synapses receiving little chemical little

[52:52.360 --> 52:57.240]  packet for chemicals and and where you've been touched in your fingers when

[52:57.240 --> 53:02.080]  you're touching your fingers with other fingers that you're creating the sort of

[53:02.080 --> 53:08.000]  analogy of synaptics synapses and now imagine that you clap clap all your

[53:08.000 --> 53:13.480]  fingers together okay and that is like we clap all your fingers together imagine

[53:13.480 --> 53:19.080]  that is that's closer to you're creating a much bigger signal on your hand and

[53:19.080 --> 53:25.560]  that that could be you know closer to like the dendritic forward dendritic

[53:25.560 --> 53:32.080]  forward action potential or a forward spike it's not really I think AP is

[53:32.080 --> 53:36.680]  actually the wrong word is think of the is the sort of electrical spike from the

[53:36.680 --> 53:43.240]  dendrite and the electrical spikes in the dendrite they go to the soma right

[53:43.240 --> 53:48.720]  and you need to have a certain number of these arriving within a certain

[53:48.720 --> 53:58.560]  frequency to to represent a pattern that has been that you know that the that it

[53:58.560 --> 54:03.000]  means that neuron has detected a certain pattern right so if you get enough of

[54:03.000 --> 54:08.320]  these dendrites then a certain pattern has been detected and in the cell has a

[54:08.320 --> 54:12.760]  sort of duty to sort of like only fire when it receives a certain kind of

[54:12.760 --> 54:19.000]  pattern within a certain millisecond range you know and you know like that

[54:19.000 --> 54:22.200]  like it's like that cell in your eye that like only fires when something is

[54:22.200 --> 54:27.160]  moving from left to right in your vision well that is a pattern that cell is set

[54:27.160 --> 54:32.880]  to look for and it's like okay well each of your each of your dendrite to set to

[54:32.880 --> 54:37.720]  look for certain patterns based upon previous patterns so the previous

[54:37.720 --> 54:42.960]  patterns that it receives help help to set up what it's going to be looking for

[54:42.960 --> 54:50.960]  okay so if it sees what it's been looking for then it fires also has to you

[54:50.960 --> 54:58.960]  know not fire when it receives signals that it hasn't been looking for so so

[54:58.960 --> 55:06.880]  there's this process where the anyway long story short is that it is at some

[55:06.880 --> 55:11.520]  point you know you clap your fingers together and that's a lot of signal

[55:11.520 --> 55:15.840]  happening versus you know just touching one of your fingers one at a time that's

[55:15.840 --> 55:22.200]  a bigger sort of forward spike and then now the palm as imagine the palm of your

[55:22.200 --> 55:30.800]  hand is like the soma and the soma is so your fingers are like the dendritic

[55:30.800 --> 55:35.520]  branches and but they all ended in the in the palm of your hand the ends of

[55:35.520 --> 55:38.280]  your fingers come to the palm of your hand that's this that's like the soma

[55:38.280 --> 55:45.400]  but you're on and if you get enough signals from each of your fingers right

[55:45.400 --> 55:52.080]  that the then what can happen then is the soma can fire and the soma can fire

[55:52.080 --> 55:55.520]  it's like imagine you take your two hands and you clap them together so you're

[55:55.520 --> 56:02.840]  making even bigger signals clap your two hands together loud bam that's like a

[56:02.840 --> 56:12.480]  soma firing that's a big event okay and that event is when the big that's the

[56:12.480 --> 56:17.680]  real action potential and in see the thing is the thing is I think was not

[56:17.680 --> 56:23.640]  clearly explained sort of as a temporal reality of action potentials in it's

[56:23.640 --> 56:27.200]  explained in neuroscience but it's not necessarily explained in computational

[56:27.200 --> 56:33.880]  neuroscience one-on-one because we because it because the computational

[56:33.880 --> 56:39.360]  neuroscience is about one sort of step of the neuron function but they're not

[56:39.360 --> 56:43.320]  there's they're thinking about a single moment of a neuron function not about

[56:43.320 --> 56:47.960]  how the neuron is changing over time so so when neurons fire tonically they're

[56:47.960 --> 56:55.520]  all firing at the same time big in big clusters but it doesn't really seem like

[56:55.520 --> 56:59.920]  like that may contain that much information if you just have a large

[56:59.920 --> 57:03.880]  amount of neurons are all firing at the same time tonic firing doesn't seem like

[57:03.880 --> 57:15.280]  it it it may contain information it might but it that'd be like using a whole

[57:15.280 --> 57:20.120]  bunch of neurons so you were a little whole whole little it's like if they're

[57:20.120 --> 57:23.200]  all firing they're all basically have the same information and you're using a

[57:23.200 --> 57:29.640]  whole bunch of neurons to do something very simple some art so so how is it

[57:29.640 --> 57:34.600]  that if you have an individual neuron it's designed to look for one pattern

[57:34.600 --> 57:39.520]  right but all of that like basically it could fire it might fire and it might

[57:39.520 --> 57:43.800]  change the firing rate of that neuron the firing rate could increase or decrease

[57:43.800 --> 57:48.560]  but even if that happens the rest of the oscillation of that neuron pulls that

[57:48.560 --> 57:51.480]  neuron back into awesome but back into tonic oscillation with the rest of

[57:51.480 --> 57:56.120]  the neurons so even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired

[57:56.120 --> 58:04.360]  sooner or later than it normally fires that's just this temporary pattern but

[58:04.360 --> 58:09.120]  that's actually what we want because like imagine that when you're moving from

[58:09.120 --> 58:16.440]  the left to the right not only is it the case that neurons need to fire you know

[58:16.440 --> 58:20.520]  when you're looking as you move your eyes from left to right you're gonna need

[58:20.520 --> 58:28.240]  to fire in the right order like a piano right but like like you know like you

[58:28.240 --> 58:37.560]  play piano notes but you also don't want to be firing you don't want to continue

[58:37.560 --> 58:41.680]  to be firing constantly it's like that'd be like hearing a piano note that

[58:41.680 --> 58:46.720]  never stops that piano note needs to die away so the next piano note can be

[58:46.720 --> 58:51.560]  heard and that next piano note needs to die away so the next note needs to be

[58:51.560 --> 58:57.240]  heard so we kind of need the so if a neuron differentiates from the rest of

[58:57.240 --> 59:03.040]  the group that needs to be a temporary thing in order for the transition of

[59:03.040 --> 59:08.800]  perception to change they say well so no now where's the observer where's a

[59:08.800 --> 59:13.440]  little man in your head observing all these patterns well it just so happens

[59:13.440 --> 59:23.520]  that predictive coding gives us a sort of gives us a distributed man inside

[59:23.520 --> 59:27.480]  your head it says okay well you have neurons that are listening if inter

[59:27.480 --> 59:31.200]  neurons it they don't come in contact with the outside of the world but they

[59:31.200 --> 59:34.680]  are listening to other neurons so you have neurons that wait for their turn

[59:34.680 --> 59:41.080]  you see there's this example in EEG where you can put connect two people to

[59:41.080 --> 59:46.680]  EEG separately in separate rooms and measure their their their brain their

[59:46.680 --> 59:52.800]  power spectrum the brainway frequencies alpha beta theta delta gamma and

[59:52.800 --> 59:57.920]  alpha beta theta delta and gamma

[59:58.560 --> 01:00:05.360]  alpha beta theta delta and gamma so you can see what power spectrum is dominant

[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.240]  in the brain now you bring these two people together and you have to start

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.520]  talking you know what you'll see is that their brain waves become in sync with

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.880]  one another you can also see this in birds and other animals and birds

[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.400]  especially when birds are communicating their brain waves become in sync you

[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.160]  have without even measuring their brain waves you can notice that one bird will

[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.120]  be silent while the other bird chirps and then the other bird chirps while the

[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.360]  other bird remain silent so they take turns talking to each other but the

[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.480]  argument is that this is happening also inside your brain right where there's

[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.560]  this sort of where you know going back to the piano analogy to play a piano

[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.880]  music you need to have a tone that plays and then another tone and then another

[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.200]  tone but then because your neurons need to know when they're going to fire they

[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.400]  need to predict when they're going to fire so they can play a sequence like a

[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.220]  piano sequence that means your neurons are listening to other neurons firing so

[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:08.960]  it's like when two birds are listening one bird is speaking chirping the other

[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.960]  bird is not chirping it's like that's sort of an analogous of what's

[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.080]  happening inside your brain you have one set of neurons firing you have other

[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.180]  sets of neurons listening and then the next step neurons fire and other sets of

[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:26.400]  neurons listen one neuron fires other's are inhibited one no fires others are

[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.280]  inhibited one around fires others are inhibited and these sequences of firing

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.040]  inhibitions happen in cascading patterns and then so then your your brain can

[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.720]  create temporal and spatial representations so you can notice when

[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.480]  you move your eyes from left to the right you have a temple you're having a

[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.440]  temporal and spatial recognition you're recognizing spatially what is what

[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.720]  objects are there all these points belong to this object like this medicine

[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.400]  bottle and all of these you know or that's my monitor that's the left side

[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.080]  of my monitor that's the right side of my monitor and and as I move my eyes

[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.040]  from left to right the stuff that's on the left stays on the left the stuff

[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.160]  that's on the right stays on the right and I can tell the medicine bottle is not

[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.000]  separate is separate from the table because I'm doing a semantic

[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.920]  segmentation but my brain is doing the temporal separation right because if it

[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.280]  was all because I wasn't doing a temporal separation separation

[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:30.920]  semantics of a temporal semantic segmentation in addition to a spatial

[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.480]  semantic segmentation then then I would see two bottles at the same time or four

[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.920]  bottles or eight bottles or I would see all the spacetime is blur so my brain

[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.000]  is really doing both a temporal and a spatial segmentation it's noticing that

[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.600]  there's one bottle it's not taking the past memory of of that bottle and putting

[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.240]  it on top of the same bottle like you might see you know if you had too much

[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:04.000]  to drink you might see two how many fingers am I holding up right if you

[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.280]  heard that phrase how many fingers am I holding up if you don't if like if you're

[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.880]  holding up two fingers and someone says four you have double vision because

[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.120]  they've drank they've drunk too much okay so double vision is like yeah well the

[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.280]  temporal sequences of your brain are are not operating correctly that person is

[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:31.400]  drunk but it is it it points to the fact that your brain is doing temporal

[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.640]  sequences in the first place the fact that you know that there's there's two

[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.040]  fingers and then someone else is seeing four because they're drunk so we have

[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:53.720]  these representations of sequences of the world around us and I'm saying that

[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.400]  you know we've got Jeff Hawking's book and we've got predictive coding on

[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.880]  intelligence we've got predictive coding then that point us to you know a method

[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.640]  for how the brain could be making temporal and spatial frequencies so how

[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:18.320]  the brain could be connecting the dots in in terms of recognizing temporal

[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:26.840]  spatial patterns from incoming streams of data okay so this is a this is something

[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.880]  that that's why part of the the point net is is definitely useful to if you

[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:39.760]  listen to like YouTube lectures on a point net plus plus yeah if you find a

[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:50.840]  good one then you'll get an idea you get a good analogy of how a computer with a

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:59.720]  neural network can turn a representation of points that it's received into the

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:07.760]  recognition of an object and classify that object to classify those points and

[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.640]  it's a semantic segmentation and if a computer neural network can do that

[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:17.720]  and it's really a human neural network can and so I've actually seen a friend

[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.560]  of mine a while back I won't mention his name he wouldn't want you to he wouldn't

[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:28.280]  want me to tell you who he is because because you know the government is a

[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:35.320]  conspiracy and all that right but he created a 3D neural network in in unity

[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:46.520]  and he I won't tell you how how he built it I know but it's it's not my place to

[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.880]  talk about his his work and expose his work but what I'll tell you is that he

[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:58.240]  is a 3D neural network in unity unit is a 3D game engine and the neural

[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:07.240]  network itself was was consisting of objects inside this 3D game engine and

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.920]  what he did was he connected depth cameras like the Microsoft deserved

[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.640]  depth cameras to this neural network and it took the representations from those

[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:24.320]  depth cameras and created sort of like the neural network matched the

[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.000]  representations of those cameras so we saw we saw what I saw was a three

[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.640]  dimensional representation of the data from the depth cameras that the 3D

[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:43.800]  neural network was making and it was so easy to just take camera data and turn

[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:50.600]  it into us and apply it send the data into a 3D neural network and have it

[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:56.880]  output a representation of the camera data and I thought well if if we if he

[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.440]  can do this in unity you know what I mean like with it with it is points to

[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.280]  say yeah if you if our brain if we think about brains is a 3D neural network and

[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:21.480]  all our brains have to do is is sort of like accurately reconstruct pattern that

[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:32.200]  that matches what we are seeing then then then the parts of the brain that are

[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.480]  listening to that pattern can make the connections between the points that are

[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:42.120]  being represented and so the learning of an object a 3D representation of an

[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:51.200]  object can be extracted from from 3D points from from from from the points

[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.040]  received from your senses so your brain can learn 3D points and we still haven't

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.520]  got to the part of like how this becomes conscious information or what the

[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:11.360]  observer effect is and so so my house so going back to rhythms of the brain by

[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:18.800]  basaki what we have and you know of course

[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:26.440]  predictive coding and work at Memento intelligence and so on we have is is

[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.960]  neurons that are listening to other neurons in temporal sequences to figure

[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.440]  out when they're going to fire so they're making predictions we have this

[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.560]  knowledge that basically when you when you have this prediction of how the

[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:45.560]  ball is going to feel that representation it may be consisting of

[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:57.440]  sort of like dendritic forward potentials forward spiking potentials but not

[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.520]  the action potential so it's like the neuron is collecting all this data for a

[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.560]  long time which is predicting when it's going to fire okay and the physical

[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.680]  collection of that data up until the point that it fires refers is the sort

[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.880]  of manifest representation of you of what a door handle is going to feel like

[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.960]  before you touch the door handle and at the moment that you touch the door

[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.400]  handle and it feels exactly like what you thought it was going to feel like

[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  that's the moment when your neurons fire to represent the feeling of door

[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.560]  handle in time and space but up until you touch the door handle that

[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:41.560]  representation exists as activity in the dendrites and activity and below

[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.360]  threshold activity in someone so so the neurons so it's like yeah you have

[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:55.080]  neurons that are going to represent that door handle both before and during you

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.000]  touching the door handle and so that's how you have these like pretty soon but

[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.080]  what that means is that is that you know going back to the birds is you know when

[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.040]  one bird trips and other bird listens and then the other bird trips the first

[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.720]  bird listens and so you have these sort of alternations in the oscillation so

[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.360]  the oscillations brainwave oscillations are alternations in neural firing and

[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.040]  when one group of neurons are firing another group of neurons is listening

[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.360]  and this is the analogy of you know when one person is speaking another person's

[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.440]  listening and when two people are speaking back and forth their brains

[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.000]  start to the power band spectrum of their brains is measured by the EEG

[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.800]  starts to synchronize because they're both on the same wavelength or in that

[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.160]  conversation and the and so the oscillation see that this is this is the

[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:55.720]  key I think it's that for a neuron a neuron is not just a receiver or a

[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.680]  sensor for information it's also a transmitter of information every single

[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:04.640]  neuron is receiving information and it's transmitting information so the

[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.280]  receiver and a transmitter and you have these you have neurons firing in

[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.360]  different one neurons when one neuron is firing other neurons are inhibited

[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:19.760]  because they're in there listening so most so it's it's um it's that most of

[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.840]  the time your neurons are listening and they're not firing but they fire

[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.080]  tonically they fire at regular rates and then when they fire because of because

[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.160]  they've heard a pattern that they recognize okay because they recognize

[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.880]  well hey it's my time to fire I'm going to represent what this person is

[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.760]  experiencing right now okay that's like the louder sound that a neuron can make

[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.120]  when the action potential fires from the soma and soma bursts okay that's that

[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.240]  that's that in the moment representation of something that's happening right now

[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.960]  boom boom this is the event boom boom I don't know if that's the reason maybe

[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.520]  that's not the right sound but but that is a that is a different it's not a

[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.000]  tonic frequency that's a phasic frequency it's a phasic pattern it's a phasic

[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.680]  frequency pattern and so you can say it we can go into well the brain is consists

[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:24.120]  of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns and temporal

[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  and they also can can this it's also tonic and it's also this sort of like

[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:45.720]  dialectic between tonic and phasic firing patterns right so phase so phasic

[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.120]  firing pattern can happen which is you know it's a different frequency it's

[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:56.040]  much faster can travel much farther it's not regular it's novel it happens more

[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.880]  rare and as soon as it happens the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with

[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:08.680]  they they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency so that you

[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.440]  know when you play a piano the tone doesn't stay loud it dissipates so the

[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:18.520]  next sound to be heard and so some it's it's a it's designed to like hitting the

[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:25.200]  piano key boom but it's got to fade out so the oscillation pulls it down but the

[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.640]  oscillation itself by pulling it down means that every other neuron in the

[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.840]  oscillation is noticing it because because of the dynamics of power dynamics

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.560]  of the oscillation it's it's they have to the whole group of neurons has to

[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.680]  reach sort of equilibrium so you have a neuron that fires out of order you can

[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.000]  see they're faster or slower the rest of the group can feel it the rest of the

[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.800]  group can sense that one neuron so the whole so that firing pattern that

[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.280]  happens is noticed not by not just by one neuron simultaneously but by the

[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:04.480]  entire oscillation simultaneously it's like the oscillation is the it's like

[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:13.120]  when I'm arguing it's like the oscillation is like the canvas and the

[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:23.720]  the the phase pattern is the ink on the canvas so the canvas of reception or the

[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:29.600]  or the the canvas of consciousness or the can the canvas of mental work space

[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.880]  and the ink on that workspace is the deviations from the canvas the

[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:39.320]  distinctions from the canvas right so so it's like the ground of the ground of

[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.240]  being which is just raw perception raw awareness that's the oscillation in the

[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.400]  objects in the mind that you recognize those are deviations from the ground of

[01:14:52.400 --> 01:15:01.600]  being from pure awareness so it's like that the you know but there there's the

[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:09.120]  I'm using some mystical language but it's it's kind of like there is this

[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.120]  canvas of consciousness and then there's objects that are painted on that kind of

[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.840]  the canvas and the objects that are painted are what are what's being

[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:22.040]  collected by the neurons that are listening in predictive coding but the

[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.960]  deep but and so those are creating temporary etches and the oscillations

[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.520]  are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away

[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.360]  so that new tones can be played so the brain isn't continually moving to be in

[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:39.600]  a ready state to receive more notes to play more notes to represent more

[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:49.760]  things okay but then so it's like the brain is the brain is playing music to

[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.560]  itself right so the notes go off in one area like one bird tripping while the

[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:01.440]  other bird listens but like one set of neurons fires another set listens so the

[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:09.760]  brain is receiving and transmitting data but it's like one group of it's like one

[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.840]  it's like the it's like one group is creating a pattern another group is

[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.320]  observing a pattern and so you have this sort of well that is that's what I'm

[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.840]  saying is that's basically qualia it's basically an internal representation and

[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:31.760]  an observer the observer is one group of neurons observing another group of

[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:38.200]  neurons firing and that is the basis of it's the basic idea of of consciousness

[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.960]  is that you have one group of neurons that's listening to another group of

[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:54.400]  neurons fire and what's what's firing it has includes patterns that are temporal

[01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:03.880]  spatial and phasic and phasic in terms of like you know these are these are

[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:11.040]  frequencies that go beyond phasic that go beyond phasic as opposed to tonic so

[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:18.720]  phasic is like satonic which is like slow and regular signals also slow and

[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.720]  regular tonic oscillation that is very regular and it's a whole bunch of

[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.040]  neurons doing it so there's not really information but then you have phasic

[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.880]  firing which is unique and that's like when the piano you hear a piano note

[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.800]  that's phasic firing and that phasic firing is much it's much higher

[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:44.760]  frequency that could be like a 200 Hertz gamma frequency or something but I'm

[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.520]  also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic

[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.720]  frequency range to the phasic firings and higher frequency ranges consists of

[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.000]  consists of temporal spatial frequencies between 0.02 Hertz and as high as

[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.880]  600 Hertz and in so that so my argument is also that the brain is brain is a

[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:16.280]  finite state machine and that the total the finite state machine is the total

[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:24.440]  summary of all the patterns between 0.002 Hertz and 600 Hertz that could

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:32.840]  possibly happen in the brain in all in all spatial regions of the brain and

[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:42.240]  basically from synapses to dendrites to action potentials to oscillations no

[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:49.360]  matter what size the Hertz signal is coming from whether it's coming from

[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:57.760]  something really small like a synapse or something really large like a dipole then

[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:06.400]  what happens is you've got different scales of phasic or tonic oscillations

[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:14.200]  that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with

[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:20.200]  I'm sorry you've got different scales of phasic or tonic frequencies in

[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:28.920]  oscillation that are playing out between different scales of tonic

[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.200]  frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out at

[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:45.600]  different different scales from from synapses to dendrites to soma to you

[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:51.200]  know the activity of a small neural circuit to the activity of like a large

[01:19:51.200 --> 01:20:00.120]  cortical column to the activity of a brain region in a dipole a dipole

[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.920]  representing the brain you know a magnetic moment or an electromagnetic

[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.880]  moment or an electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for

[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:18.240]  large oscillator such as a super charismatic nucleus and so we've got

[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:29.880]  these frequencies which you know there's that they they're they're these are

[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:40.680]  frequencies of you know they had there there's we can consider them in terms of

[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:48.720]  just like frequencies that are encoded with sounds like soliton waves or encoded

[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.000]  in you know sort of like like a magnetic wave and it's a very sort of like a

[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.960]  stable information containing sound and that can travel they can travel and

[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.880]  ricochet through the brain and so there was actually there's one time when I I

[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.520]  I tried meth mesculine I tried it a lot of pair not parody but some Pedro

[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:15.160]  cactus I've been mesculine many times but there was this one time that I felt

[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:25.680]  that I could hear my voice inside my head as a series of discrete moments when

[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.880]  different neurons were firing as if imagine if a neuron is a is a long

[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.080]  cable and along this cable there's a there's a bunch of different points of

[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:45.680]  which the sounds are are being are appearing and so like like the sound

[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.760]  could be like just part of the voice could be just part of a word and if you

[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.520]  if you progress like going back to like a movie like a time like a like if you

[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:02.680]  look at you know 10 seconds of your of your mind you go back and see your mind

[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.040]  is like a movie and now just think of your voice is a movie it's just like an

[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.080]  audio track right and different parts of the auto track represent this phrase

[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.680]  different parts of the auto track that represent this phrase different parts of

[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:22.440]  the audio track represent this phrase each part of the audio kits is going to

[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.200]  be a different set of neurons that fires just like you know looking from the

[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.720]  left to the right each moment in that frame or in the audio track is going to

[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:37.480]  be represented by a different set of neurons and as the neuron fires through

[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:46.000]  as then as the as the brain fires through through like you know we go to

[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:54.040]  through each stage when I when I was speaking you can hear a different vowel

[01:22:54.040 --> 01:23:01.700]  or different sound here different sound in each moment and all the sounds to

[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:09.160]  add up to words and sentences and but the idea is that in each moment there's

[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.720]  there's a different in that pipeline that's that is that that is a neuron

[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.480]  there's a different or that's many neurons in the pipeline of neural

[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.320]  activity as we follow a neural circuit among across many different neurons

[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:27.320]  each each one of those neurons is firing in that sequence of neural activity

[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:35.080]  it's going to represent that one part of that one person's voice okay and so that

[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.120]  is it's like you're your brain saying okay well I'm going to represent your

[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:44.600]  thought I'm going to play your thought back to you as a sequence of bits the

[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.960]  sequence of frequencies you listen to your if you listen to your voice or

[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:57.840]  someone else's voice like if you just like pause on one sound on one sound just

[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:04.880]  pronounce the word just pronounce the letter D really silly D D that is a

[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:11.280]  frequency it's a frequency and it has a spatial characteristic too where's the

[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.400]  sound coming from how loud is it how big is the sound how quiet is the sound how

[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.160]  masculine or feminine is the sound or you know what we're non-genders sound I

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.040]  don't know but it has spatial it has sound doesn't just have a frequency it

[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:35.400]  has associated characteristics has spatial characteristics where's the voice

[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.520]  coming from is it coming from this room it's coming from the next room is it

[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.320]  coming from yourself it's coming from somewhere else there's spatial

[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.640]  characteristics the sound has so I would argue yeah everything has spatial

[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:53.080]  characteristics and temporal characteristics and physics like your

[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.360]  feelings feelings they have a peak moment you know there's like you feel

[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.120]  there's a moment when something great happens and you feel great for a moment

[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.600]  there's that moment when it's the high and then it comes down and you and then

[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.520]  there's a low and then there's like you know people sometimes they'll drink the

[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.320]  hub drink and they'll feel high when they're drunk or when they have some

[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:20.720]  other drug they feel high for a while and then and then maybe the brain comes

[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.480]  down and they feel low for a while and like the next day someone sometimes

[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.920]  people feel very like sometimes people have hangovers after drinking the night

[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.640]  after drinking alcohol and they feel really low in the morning so they felt

[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.720]  high the night before and they feel very low in the morning and they're grumpy

[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.240]  in the morning because they're having a hangover and the brain the brain went

[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.400]  high but then their brain went low the low feelings might inspire them to drink

[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.600]  again because they want to feel good again even though the feeling bad was

[01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:00.640]  caused by by them you know taking the thing that made them feel good so they

[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.880]  keep drinking like oh it felt good when I was drinking and that feels bad so I

[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.920]  want to drink again to feel good but even though that it's but it's the

[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.680]  drinking that's causing them to feel bad and if they just gave it up then their

[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:24.920]  brain is like it is more you're just like imbalancing stretching the brain

[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:30.800]  you know for for all the highs that people get with alcohol there the lows

[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:42.040]  come later on as a result of as the price of that high sort of the the the

[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:49.240]  forces of of the physical and functional forces of tensegrity where we

[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:55.400]  have information as the physical and functional forces of tensegrity and

[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:07.840]  information where you can have basically a moment where I'm gonna say about you

[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:16.360]  know like there's this dialectic or conflict between two different ideas

[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.000]  where if you have like if you push again if one culture pushes against another

[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.720]  it builds its own sort of dialectic opponent you know if you have an

[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:36.720]  element of government saying okay well we we don't like that there's feminine

[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.960]  men in movies this is something that China was saying there they are in fact

[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.480]  when they come out with a statement like that okay we're gonna get we're gonna

[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.720]  like since for all effeminate men in movies so we don't see movies with the

[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:58.920]  feminine men anymore that is creating a sort of pushback sort of dialectic

[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:06.640]  opponent sort of functional tensegrity where the the information which is like

[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.640]  simultaneously basic but also electromagnetic is being generated to

[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:21.040]  sort of push back against that force being pushed on the rest of humanity

[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.240]  and that's that is the reason why authoritarian regiments eventually

[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.520]  topple it's because they're creating their own opponents and their opponents

[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.040]  keep growing because they're because their behavior is is you know creating

[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:44.000]  too many negative waves and those waves come back that's the sort of like

[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:51.640]  principle of opposing forces in a confined space eventually the eventually

[01:28:51.640 --> 01:29:02.720]  the the three chains will who are pushing to change other people's change

[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:13.080]  human culture to be what they see it all to be well we'll experience the push

[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.200]  back that they don't expect it will come in unexpected ways and so that could

[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:25.680]  that could involve some sort of revolution I don't know I don't know

[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.920]  what how that would manifest it could be it could be not a revolution but but

[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:45.560]  just another kind of unexpected change in the future that I don't know who the

[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.280]  people in charge of the country might be different people but it might be a sort

[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:58.200]  of non non non non-revolutionary revolution sort of a transition I guess

[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.080]  to a different group of people in charge who are a little bit more enlightened

[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:15.320]  and and progressive thinking but you know but then there's there's this that's

[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:21.000]  not good too far into that so yeah so this is some things like you know going

[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:29.520]  back to you know we've got your brain is capable of creating really complex

[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:35.560]  representations of sounds and images and we know that your brain is is listening

[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:42.360]  to your brain to you know neurons are listening to the neurons so that's the

[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:47.720]  observer right there that's them as the distributed man inside your brain you've

[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:52.640]  got part of your brain that's listening to part of your brain and and when you

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:58.840]  put it all together that's pretty simple that you know consciousness or a

[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:04.840]  conscious perception at least involves this component of your brain listening

[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.400]  to your brain's representations of reality and that's how that's how you your

[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.120]  brain is part of how your brain is building quality there's a lot of other

[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:20.440]  things you know especially with the studies of you know anesthesia in terms

[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:26.480]  of what gets turned off and in pyramidal cells and what's the difference in a

[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.400]  waking brain and a sleeping brain there's in studies of anesthesia it's lots of

[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:41.920]  great stuff but there's also the you know the question of well what's the

[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.480]  difference between conscious information and the information that's not

[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:50.200]  conscious like your brain is collecting stuff it's listening for firing patterns

[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.760]  but it's not like you're conscious of everything simultaneously and that is

[01:31:54.760 --> 01:32:04.160]  important because you know your brain has to in order for one thing to be paid

[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:10.000]  it to be in focus in one moment of time your brain has to inhibit something

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.120]  else it's like you've got to turn off a lot of switches in order to turn the

[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:22.680]  light on to the thing you're focusing on so there's always going to be this sort

[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:28.880]  of like you know in order to in order for there to be in order for your brain to

[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.000]  make differences between one type of pattern and none other you've got to

[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.400]  turn off the patterns that are not relevant while you're turning on the

[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.400]  patterns an arm element that is where the the interneuron inhibitory system

[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.800]  especially comes into power sort of it's sort of like a live real-time I think

[01:32:46.800 --> 01:33:00.680]  of the internet interneuron inhibitory system as sort of live real-time back

[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:09.360]  propagation system and it's kind of like okay well I see a cat's head and I'm

[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.400]  expecting to see a cat's tail but if I don't see a cat's tail then the

[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.520]  expectation of a cat's tail needs to become inhibited because there's no

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:21.720]  cast out maybe maybe the cat doesn't have a tail right or maybe it's not a cat

[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.800]  maybe it's actually a rabbit I've never seen a rabbit before and I just mistook

[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.280]  it for a cat it's a rabbit's very different tails it's like a bushy it's

[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:41.560]  like a bushy short bushy thing versus a cast tail is a long longer thing and not

[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:49.920]  as bushy and so if I so at that point you know hopefully the representation of a

[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:54.520]  long cast tail is not something and I see I might see the only way I'd see a

[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.640]  cast tail on a rabbit probably would be if I was you know doing some really hard

[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:05.160]  hallucinations right there's no there's no cast tail on a rabbit but if your

[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.440]  brain is functioning correctly you're gonna have you know maybe maybe start

[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.120]  out with this prediction that you're looking at a cat but then you notice

[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:16.720]  it's a bushy tail a small bushy tail instead and so instead of representing

[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.440]  the cat's tail what you get is is some of the features of an animal your brain

[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.840]  is gonna represent some of the features of an animal and those features are

[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:36.520]  going to they're gonna require some changes because because it's because the

[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.560]  features of it of a bunny are different from the features of a cat so we don't

[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:44.320]  want to give you brain is want to give you the memory of a cat must represent

[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.840]  the bunny accurately so in order to accommodate those changes what happens

[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.640]  is we've got what I what I think of as the train track train track system of

[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.760]  internet of the interneuron inhibitory system so the so the train tracks the

[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:08.160]  train tracks get thrown and and instead of seeing you know because there's no

[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.080]  cast tail there's a bunny's tail and that means a different feature that and

[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.200]  what was expected has been seen and so now the representation is an accurate

[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.800]  representation of a rabbit you tell us was quite different from the previous

[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:31.160]  representation of a cat okay and and so you can have the same sort of neurons

[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.240]  that fire the same office the same oscillatory network that fired to

[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:40.880]  represent a cat has now been changed because of interneurons because it does

[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.280]  though they're they're causing inhibitory changes and how the signals are

[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.480]  flowing in that same oscillator how the signals are flowing in that moment so

[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.120]  that they that that the pattern that's emerging where in the area where the cat

[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:01.280]  was is not no no no longer representing a cat pattern it's representing a bunny

[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:08.160]  pattern or rabbit pattern with a rabbit with a bunny tail bushy bunny tail

[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:18.960]  bushy a bushy pony tail and so this is a this this is this this means that

[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:29.320]  basically like the idea is that you have an oscillatory network can represent

[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:35.160]  completely different sets of patterns like you know and thanks in the

[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.920]  interneuron system so you can have you can you can say okay well your brain is

[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.400]  right now your brain is going to represent the bunny and the same neuron

[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.640]  that represented the bunny now they're going to represent a cat now that group

[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.520]  of neurons can represent a dog because different patterns get turned on and off

[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:55.080]  because because of the inhibitory neurons system so it's not like you're

[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:03.160]  just it's not like your neurons are just excited to really activating some

[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.400]  pre-existing you know hard learned pattern the pattern is going to change

[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:13.120]  basically every time but and it's also like you know that points to the fact

[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.160]  that you know when you have multiple brain regions if you if you have your

[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:21.320]  memories are like tapping in a distributed way where maybe if you'll

[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:28.000]  see like a dog and a house and if we look at Jack Glein's work you know the

[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.200]  semantic map that he created through with MRI of where you know he saw you know

[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.080]  a lot of brain activity when people are looking at pictures of houses and when

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.720]  people looking at pictures of cars people in pictures of cats and dogs there

[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:46.080]  was a core there's a spatial correlation and brain activity in certain areas

[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.120]  where the dogs and in cats were being noticed by your brain in terms of where

[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.160]  the blood flow was flowing afterwards and correlations between you know where

[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.320]  you know houses and motorcycles were being noticed by your brain where the

[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.160]  houses and the motorcycles would be closer together and the dogs and cats

[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.040]  would be somewhere else but closer to each other and so the computer could

[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.120]  then guess or if the person is like looking at a motorcycle or looking at a

[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:17.800]  dog based upon where the increase in blood flow is happening in the brain as

[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:25.840]  measured by MRI and that's that was the Jack Glein's labs semantic maps and his

[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:35.160]  experiments were pretty awesome Berkeley experiments and but the thing is like

[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:42.000]  okay well now what if we were to see a dog and a house at the same time right so

[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:50.160]  the idea is that not only you know so we have these these patterns that you know

[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.800]  the phase of patterns is like when phase of pattern is when a neuron fires out

[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.640]  of at a much higher frequency than the usual tonic frequency you get a bunch

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.800]  of neurons in different areas all firing at a tonic frequency and they all

[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.720]  have and there's this there's there's some of the internal so they've got

[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:16.760]  neural columns you guys know so you got micro micro columns you've got large

[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:23.200]  columns you've got small neural circuits or just groups of neural neurons firing

[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:31.000]  and in temporal firing patterns that may be really responsible for short-term

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.160]  memories and maybe long-term memories or are you know the result of sort of

[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:46.480]  like new proteins being generated that the sending receiving of long-term

[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:59.640]  memories or involve new protein synthesis that will modify the the patterns

[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:07.000]  that are the different neurons are going to expect and so you can have this

[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.080]  sort of like a sort of like the short-term memory is is what's happening you

[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:19.320]  know right you know what the sequence of patterns firing in a neural circuit but

[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.120]  in that sequences sequence of patterns is modified by the internal system like

[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.960]  you can have constantly have new patterns emerging in any area of the cortex

[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.480]  you have any other court any area of the cortex can be remapped to take on the

[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.400]  duties of any other like it for example if someone loses a hand and the parts of

[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:45.280]  the brain that were being used to for their hand then start to become used for

[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:56.040]  by the by the other regions of the brain right and so so in that situation you

[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:04.520]  get you get basically this you know it's David Eagleman talks about that how

[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:15.840]  like you know if you if one if one if you if person loses a limb then then the

[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.520]  rest then that part of their brain sort of gets taken over like a competition of

[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:30.760]  of a competition of rivals or a cooperation of rivals but basically it's

[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:38.600]  like each of your you know your visual cortex is is staking out a huge amount

[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:46.720]  of your brain's resources or so it's thought with to do visual visual related

[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.920]  tasks visual cortex would include the occipital lobes and in some extent the

[01:41:50.920 --> 01:42:00.320]  parietal lobes stretching into the into the somatosensory cortex a little bit but

[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.280]  within the somatosensory is more about touch but there's a lot of you know

[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.400]  hand-eye coordination happening so there's a lot of like reasons for the

[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:17.200]  activity in in the touch air touch areas their feelings tactile sensations to be

[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.520]  flowing back into the visual station into the visual areas for correlations so

[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.560]  so the visual cortex is is maybe two-thirds of your brain activity but

[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:32.960]  that might be intermixed with a lot of there might be a lot of

[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:40.000]  multimodal patterns traveling back and forth and and that's what it's kind of

[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.680]  I think that's what we see in the brain is that you know and neuron neural

[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:49.420]  column doesn't know if it's a visual it doesn't know if it's in the visual

[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.160]  cortex or not it doesn't know if in the somatosensory cortex or not all it knows

[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.520]  is the patterns it's receiving from from the adjacent sets of it's receiving

[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:01.520]  and sending to the adjacent sets of neurons to the left and to the right in

[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:10.080]  front and back and above and below and so you know if there are if someone

[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:16.320]  starts to have if someone loses some of their eyesight or they lose an eye then

[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:23.880]  then you're gonna have then you know in theory you're gonna have like parts of

[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.760]  the brain that we're processing I don't have an answer for that is there's

[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:40.720]  something up stop there's nothing to stop here siri turn off siri turn off

[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.040]  you

[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:29.040]  Anyway, so, um, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:44.040]  so, um, yeah, so the idea is that, you know, parts of your somatosensory cortex will be talking

[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:50.040]  to your parts of your visual cortex, to your parietal lobes, and vice versa.

[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.040]  And so you're going to have, you know, sections of the brain that are like,

[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:00.040]  It's part information that is from tactile sensations

[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.280]  and part information that's from visual data

[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.280]  and it's intermixing.

[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.600]  And then you're gonna have,

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.720]  there's the audio cortex and then,

[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.880]  but there's the audio pathway, the audio input pathway

[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.880]  from your ears to the old brain and traveling up

[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.880]  the old brain and towards the thalamus and the neocortex.

[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.200]  And that pathway is to a great extent an audio pathway,

[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:37.020]  but that is also going to, at some point,

[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.680]  those signals are gonna be intermixing

[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.560]  with where the visual cortex encounters

[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:47.560]  the audio cortex and where the audio cortex encounters

[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:52.560]  the somatosensory cortex and where the visual audio

[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.600]  and somatosensory cortex is the three primary sensory

[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.720]  cortex these can act with the prefrontal cortex.

[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.800]  In all the regions of the brain,

[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.120]  you know, there's, I guess the joke is,

[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:10.680]  there's a motor, there's, even though there's like a,

[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.680]  it was called the motor strip or the motor cortex.

[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:17.840]  Or the motor cortex is not really a motor cortex

[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.440]  because all, because more modern analysis of neuroanatomy

[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.600]  is that basically all the, all the, you know,

[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.720]  cortical columns have since have,

[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:31.400]  have an input and a motor output.

[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.700]  And so, so everything I'm, you know,

[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:38.880]  all the time, like I, as I'm speaking,

[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.400]  there's some part of me that's listening.

[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.720]  And so there's that, the listening is like input

[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:46.280]  and the speaking is motor output.

[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:50.600]  And even thinking, thinking for me to pass on a thought

[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:52.760]  from, from one part of my brain to another

[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:55.920]  to pass a signal from one part of my brain to another,

[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.160]  it's like there's a solid ton of wave that's traveling.

[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.120]  So from visual cortex, right?

[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.560]  Cause you have to think, information has to travel to get

[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.360]  to the part, to get to the prefrontal lobes

[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.920]  because there's no sensory input to the prefrontal lobes.

[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.080]  And in most of the neural columns are consists of

[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.440]  interneurons, which are neurons that don't have

[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.800]  a connection to, to sensory input.

[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.680]  So the neurons, most of the neurons in your brain

[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:25.580]  have no connection to the outside world.

[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.960]  And so because of that, patterns have to be able to travel.

[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.320]  Cause if I can't get a pattern to travel from my eyes

[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.560]  to the back of my head in a way that's like consistent

[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:42.720]  enough that I can reconstruct a pattern of reality,

[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.760]  then, then I've got a real problem because it's like,

[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.600]  well, then all the patterns would have to be represented

[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.240]  in the first, by the first cells, right?

[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.640]  And then the rest of the brain wouldn't be able

[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:57.920]  to be used for anything.

[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.680]  So patterns have to be able to travel.

[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.800]  And that's why the concept of salt on waves

[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.640]  is really interesting.

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.600]  It is a kind of wave, like a mechanical wave

[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.600]  or a magnetic wave that can contain information.

[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.320]  And so salt on waves, you can have a lot of different

[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  basic patterns happening.

[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.280]  There are such, there's so high frequency that

[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.680]  they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency

[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:26.480]  tonic wave oscillations in a big way.

[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  Like, like the, like the faster, faster frequencies are

[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:36.480]  cause all of the slower frequencies to pay attention.

[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.760]  Because then, because there's this sort of like,

[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.560]  you know, there's this,

[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.280]  the way oscillators work is that, you know,

[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.440]  they, that's the best thing.

[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.240]  There's like the principles of oscillators

[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:59.240]  of the physics of oscillators, not just in the brain,

[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.920]  but the physics of oscillators apply to the brain.

[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.360]  And so, you know, you can have a phasic signal,

[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.360]  a magnetic, soliton wave phasic signal oscillator.

[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.680]  And if it enters a big group of,

[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.880]  big group of tonic slower oscillators,

[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.160]  then the whole group is going to slow down

[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.280]  that faster oscillation and make it come into sync.

[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.800]  So it's going to like, and I described that again as,

[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.160]  it's like the piano note fading away

[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.760]  so the next note could be played.

[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  But it's also at that moment when it's being taken away

[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.280]  is also the moment when those other norms

[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.080]  that are in tonic oscillation are listening

[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.240]  and perceiving that pattern that was played.

[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.200]  And so, you have a pattern when you have a sequence

[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.040]  of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies,

[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.480]  that are like different tones, different piano tones.

[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.480]  Like imagine each piano key that gets played in the sequence

[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.880]  is a different phasic tone, okay?

[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.760]  And if we're talking about 3D audio,

[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.480]  we've got different phasic tones happening

[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.480]  in different places.

[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.200]  And you've got large groups of neurons

[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.920]  that are listening to all of this

[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.080]  because they're firing in sort of like a tonic pattern.

[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.760]  So they're always ready to fire in a phasic pattern

[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.640]  if they come into contact.

[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.480]  They're always ready.

[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.480]  That's why they're firing in a tonic pattern.

[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.800]  But then they're able to notice

[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.320]  because of the principles of oscillators

[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.920]  when one or more members of their group

[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.240]  is not firing in a regular pattern.

[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.280]  And because of how interneurons can basically multiply

[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.880]  the number of patterns that each oscillator can represent

[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.880]  or that interneurons, inter and inhibitory networks

[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:01.880]  can multiply the number of patterns

[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.880]  that can be represented by phasic firing neurons

[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.600]  inside tonic firing oscillators made of lots of neurons.

[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:20.120]  Then we have a system where and the mental image

[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.760]  or a mental sound can be listened to

[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:25.680]  by the rest of the brain.

[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.400]  And that's what I think the observer of our perceptions

[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.240]  is going to be.

[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.840]  It's going to be the large oscillators

[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.480]  that are oscillating at tonic frequencies

[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.840]  and the content of awareness.

[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.400]  So the tonic oscillation is the ground of being

[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.840]  or pure awareness or consciousness,

[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.400]  just being the observer.

[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.120]  And the patterns that arise in that place

[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.600]  of pure observation are the phasic firing.

[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.680]  Those are the distinctions from nothingness.

[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.520]  Those are the distinctions between,

[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.440]  you know, if you have, if everything in your brain

[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.640]  was firing simultaneously,

[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:08.680]  there'd be no distinction between anything.

[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:13.280]  Distinctions, like the distinction between light

[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.280]  and darkness, it means that something is different.

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.760]  And if you have an oscillator where everything is firing

[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:27.200]  at the same time, nothing is different.

[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.000]  What you get with phasic firing patterns

[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.320]  is you get a difference, a temporary difference,

[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:35.520]  because the oscillator will erase the difference.

[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.920]  But that temporary difference is a distinction

[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.720]  that your mind is noticing and listening to

[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.240]  in a physical way.

[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.960]  And that's why, you know, I sort of argue,

[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:51.960]  like, I don't know, what I just said is I don't know

[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:56.120]  if I've actually introduced any new ideas.

[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:00.120]  I think that science itself has solved consciousness.

[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.120]  And I'm just sort of like writing a narrative

[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:03.360]  of how the different,

[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.840]  how I think the different blocks fit together.

[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880]  I think there's sort of like, you know,

[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.880]  there's a global workspace component that is,

[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.120]  I don't want to think,

[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.600]  it's not an integration of information theory,

[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:27.600]  but it is an association of information

[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.000]  in sequence patterns, or in oscillatory,

[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  and it's a self-aware oscillatory network,

[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.800]  or a self-aware network that oscillates.

[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.160]  But the key is that the self-aware network

[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.080]  that oscillates is conscious,

[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.320]  because it's listening to its own representations

[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.040]  and it's listening to changes in its own representations.

[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.200]  But these representations,

[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.600]  because they manifest as phasic,

[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:12.680]  soliton waves that travel, and they need to travel.

[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.320]  Otherwise, most of your brain would be useless.

[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:18.400]  Patterns need to travel deep into your brain,

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.320]  so your brain is not,

[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.320]  you know, it's largely, most of your brain

[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.600]  is not connected to the outside world.

[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.120]  So patterns need to travel into your brain,

[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.880]  and that sort of means that your conscious patterns are,

[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.160]  it's like, think of your brain as like,

[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:41.160]  as like what you have all over the place in your brain

[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.640]  are piano keys that have been tuned

[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.120]  to certain kinds of representations.

[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:53.160]  And these piano keys are tuned to certain representations,

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.760]  they recognize certain patterns,

[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.200]  and they ignore certain patterns,

[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.600]  like they recognize what, you know, like,

[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.600]  it's only gonna fire, you're gonna have,

[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.480]  some patterns are only gonna fire

[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.840]  when you see a mock-up of Apple's new year of your headset.

[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.640]  You know, or some patterns are only gonna fire

[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.680]  when you see an Apple,

[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:14.520]  some patterns are only gonna fire when you see a mouse,

[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.600]  or a computer mouse, or a real mouse,

[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.080]  and or maybe a roach,

[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.600]  or maybe a joint,

[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.600]  so to play in words.

[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.360]  And, but these patterns are a location variant,

[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.360]  these are virtual patterns,

[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.400]  they're patterns that travel through the brain,

[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.360]  they have to travel through the brain

[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.320]  because you have, you know, multiple stages of analysis,

[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.520]  you have this prediction of what the medicine bottle's

[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.080]  gonna feel like, and then you have this,

[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.320]  then you, and then when you feel it,

[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:53.880]  it's like, does it feel the way you predicted,

[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.720]  or is it different?

[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:58.120]  Oh, this is different than I thought it was gonna feel like.

[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.720]  I was expecting one thing,

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.240]  and it was not what I expected,

[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.440]  or it is what I expected,

[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  because I have multiple,

[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.880]  multiple levels of representation,

[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.160]  I have predictions about how something's going to feel,

[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.520]  and then there's the actual moment feeling,

[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.760]  which is when the,

[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.680]  you've got those piano notes are being planted,

[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.760]  when you have the big,

[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.600]  actually potentials firing at higher phasic frequencies.

[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:26.360]  This is the thing that happened right now.

[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.400]  That's the higher phasic frequency.

[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.600]  Before that, the neurons are like,

[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.600]  listen, he's like multiple scales of data collection

[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:40.560]  from synapses to dendrites to the soma

[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.800]  to the activity output of an entire neural column

[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.800]  to an interneuron that travels between neural columns,

[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.200]  like a long distance interneuron

[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.360]  that receives, that basically allows patterns to travel

[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.320]  from one region of another

[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.320]  so that you can connect incoming audio data temporarily

[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.560]  with incoming visual data,

[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:11.640]  so that you can make a connection in your mind

[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.520]  between something you're hearing

[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.040]  and something you're seeing.

[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.200]  So if you see lightning and you hear thunder,

[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.080]  you can make a connection between lightning and thunder.

[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.600]  And if the lightning and thunder are in close proximity,

[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.680]  happening in close proximity,

[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.480]  then you know that the source of the storm is close to you.

[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.120]  But if the lightning happens in the thunder,

[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:37.880]  and there's a long time before you hear the thunder,

[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.040]  then you know that the storm is a ways off, is farther off.

[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.200]  And maybe it could be miles away

[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.840]  because the lightning is,

[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:50.840]  the light travels much faster than the sound.

[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.160]  And so if the storm is farther away,

[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.240]  you'll see it, you'll see the lightning flash

[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.480]  long before you hear it.

[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:57.800]  So you can kind of tell the difference

[01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:59.440]  of where the lightning is,

[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:02.360]  how close the lightning is from yourself.

[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.320]  But yeah, if you're hearing and seeing lightning

[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.240]  simultaneously, that means it's happening right above you.

[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:12.240]  Right, it's really interesting to experience

[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.800]  lightning storms in Texas.

[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.080]  I've visited my parents out there.

[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.480]  Lightning storms are really interesting out there.

[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.080]  It's a little bit different from,

[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:27.680]  I don't have that kind of experience out here

[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.720]  in California.

[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:32.160]  It's a little bit more mystical out there in Texas

[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:34.680]  to be in a rain lightning storm.

[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.680]  And I feel like the sky is partially alive.

[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.560]  It's the sky.

[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:52.320]  Anyway, so let's see.

[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:57.320]  So yeah, so your brain is making association

[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:09.040]  between sensory data that's coming into your ears

[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.920]  and sensory data that's coming into your eyes.

[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:15.040]  And your brain is, it's a lot of travel,

[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.000]  a lot of distance between stuff that's coming

[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  into your eyes and something that's coming into your ears.

[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.400]  But thankfully there are intern neurons that link

[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.520]  different brain regions together.

[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.600]  So you can have part of your brain that creates

[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.240]  representations of lightning, visual cortex,

[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:31.200]  surrounding the obstacle lobes.

[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.120]  And those representations have to

[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:39.200]  connect with the representations of the thunder,

[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:43.360]  which is where your audio cortex is gonna be representing.

[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.920]  Because, but it's like, here's the thing,

[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.640]  it's like, what's happening though, I think,

[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:52.640]  is that the audio cortex gets sort of used

[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.920]  to representing the particulars of thunder

[01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.800]  and sounds of thunder.

[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.720]  And the visual cortex gets used to representing

[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.240]  the particulars of lightning.

[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.600]  And it doesn't matter if the same pattern

[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:12.600]  never happens twice, it's not that your brain

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.600]  is creating fixed memories, it's that your brain

[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.600]  is getting tuned to be expecting certain kinds of patterns.

[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.200]  Or different regions of your brain are getting tuned

[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:27.560]  to expect certain kinds of patterns,

[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:28.840]  to look for certain kinds of patterns,

[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.600]  and to ignore certain kinds of patterns.

[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.440]  And which means that when they fire,

[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.480]  they're playing back certain kinds of patterns

[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:38.960]  that other parts of the brain are listening to.

[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.720]  So you have, the thunder comes in

[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:44.520]  and the first layer of your audio cortex

[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.000]  is representing that sound.

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.440]  And then beyond that, whatever part of your brain

[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.920]  is receiving that sound,

[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:55.760]  is representing that pattern at a,

[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:01.960]  is representing that pattern plus the patterns

[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.200]  that it's receiving from other groups of neurons.

[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:08.880]  So like, if you see that there's a cortical column

[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.680]  in between the visual and audio cortex,

[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.680]  it's exactly like 50%, it says 50% mark.

[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:19.120]  It's at the halfway point between

[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.720]  the audio cortex and the visual cortex.

[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:27.680]  That cortical column is halfway at the 50 yard line

[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:30.600]  between the audio and visual cortex.

[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:33.080]  It's gonna, that might be receiving,

[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.800]  let's just say for the sake of a thought experiment

[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:39.960]  that is receiving 50% of data

[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:42.640]  from the audio part of the brain

[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.520]  and 50% of the data from the visual part of the brain.

[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.320]  And so now it has to create patterns

[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.920]  that are half audio and half video.

[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.080]  And I'm only making that argument to say that,

[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.760]  how is the brain going to integrate your audio?

[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:05.680]  Well, first of all,

[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.680]  it travels from one cortical column to the next

[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.040]  because you have these long distance internals

[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:18.000]  that connect the different cortical columns together.

[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.080]  You have these rich club networks

[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.800]  or default mode networks

[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.160]  or large scale long distance networks

[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.480]  that connect different brain waves together.

[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.680]  So different, so that means that you can have

[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.760]  spatial and temporal synchronicity

[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.600]  in the firing of lightning and thunder

[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:38.000]  that you can consciously notice.

[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.240]  And so the apical dendrites,

[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.720]  especially in the sixth layer of the upper layers

[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:52.720]  of the neural cortex are gonna be really part of the key

[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.640]  of sort of like integrating information

[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.520]  from multiple lower level data collections.

[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.520]  So when activity of a whole column sends a signal,

[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:12.920]  you know, it gets activated with a pattern.

[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:15.680]  So the pattern that that whole column represents

[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.320]  could be a unique pattern every single time.

[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.320]  But that pattern gets sent up to the pyramidal cells

[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.240]  and it gets into the inter-neuron network,

[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:28.200]  to the rich club network,

[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.280]  and it becomes a high level pattern.

[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:35.280]  It's a representation of a lot of lower level patterns

[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.360]  connected together.

[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:40.200]  It's like a bundle of waves

[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.080]  that are different every time.

[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.560]  But it allows the patterns to sort of travel

[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.680]  and to join up in groups

[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.680]  and to become part of any of the different types of patterns

[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.640]  and groups and to become part of any bigger collection

[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.200]  of patterns and it becomes what you pay attention to.

[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.640]  Your brain is activating around

[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:03.760]  where your brain on a larger scale is activating around.

[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.440]  That has to be noticed by even larger oscillations.

[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.040]  And that's when you get to, I think,

[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  you know, sort of like the stuff that, you know,

[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.880]  why is it that when someone is,

[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.880]  when they take anesthesia and they're basically part

[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:34.920]  of the function of the apical neurons is inhibited,

[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:45.840]  then the brain isn't able to create

[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:48.920]  those like high level representations

[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:52.480]  that are integrating lots of lower level representations.

[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:58.760]  And so the sort of like integrating the apical neuron

[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:10.880]  is the point at which information becomes integrated

[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:17.200]  into large scale conscious representation

[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.800]  from the surrounding global workspace

[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:27.080]  of cortical columns and individual cells

[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.840]  and dendrites and dendritic branches.

[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:41.040]  So that's what I'm saying is like we have the,

[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.200]  you know, the global workspace is the whole brain

[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:49.200]  but the integration of information is into consciousness

[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:54.800]  is through the rich clubs that are represented

[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:03.560]  by the apical neurons in the rich club networks

[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:11.160]  that cross multiple regions of the brain.

[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:14.640]  So that patterns from multiple sensory regions

[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:18.400]  that, you know, basically large scale patterns

[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.720]  that incorporate low scale patterns.

[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:24.040]  So what that means is like, you know,

[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:26.240]  if you look at a keyboard,

[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:29.600]  there's lots of little letters, you know, or characters.

[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.840]  There's A, S, D, E, one, two, three, four,

[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:37.200]  you know, dollar sign, percent sign,

[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:42.200]  at sign, star symbol and so, you know,

[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.600]  at some point you learn letters

[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:46.880]  and those are low level features

[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:50.320]  and then at some point, you know, when you integrate,

[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.800]  if you, when your brain integrates all those patterns

[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:54.920]  into, okay, there's a keyboard

[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:57.040]  and the keyboard has lots of symbols on it.

[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:59.680]  It's a high level representation.

[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.800]  And then there's an office, okay,

[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:04.320]  now so you have, imagine you're in office

[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.800]  and there's a table and there's phones

[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.960]  and there's computer monitors

[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:13.960]  and all that stuff is made of a bunch of tiny representations.

[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:20.480]  But when you consider all these tiny representations

[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:22.400]  at a higher level, you're chunking up to a higher level

[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:25.120]  and includes all of these things on the table.

[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:27.360]  And each thing on the table has an incredible amount

[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:31.240]  of detail and the idea is that so you have,

[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.600]  when you chunk up to a bigger picture,

[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:38.600]  that bigger picture is, that's when you get to like,

[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:42.440]  that's the stuff you're conscious of right now.

[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.520]  It's the sort of like,

[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.520]  it's a picture that includes stuff you can see,

[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.640]  stuff you can hear, stuff you can feel,

[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:58.000]  you can feel your body, you can detect your hand,

[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  your face, your nose, everything in the room.

[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.160]  That's the higher level stuff of consciousness

[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:11.160]  where you have this pattern of one thing

[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.600]  is in the context of everything else.

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.560]  The pattern of a pencil is in the context of a room.

[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.160]  The pattern of a person is in the context

[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:20.680]  of everything else in space.

[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.360]  The context of, you know,

[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.000]  so we're defined by everything else, right?

[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.800]  The quantum weirdness of reality.

[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:34.200]  That everything is defined by everything else.

[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:38.680]  And so that's when you have this,

[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.040]  that's when there is consciousness

[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.560]  that is human level.

[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.800]  When all of these lower level representations

[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.400]  that are seen by small oscillators and large oscillators

[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.440]  of, you know, of individual neurons

[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.680]  as far as I'm representing aspects of individual patterns,

[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.200]  those patterns that are sort of,

[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.720]  they can be represented by,

[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.120]  in theory by any part of the brain

[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.720]  because the brain is a general learning algorithm,

[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:13.840]  but the brain becomes tuned

[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:15.520]  to look for certain types of patterns.

[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.440]  So if you're playing Tetris for six hours,

[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.720]  as some people have done,

[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:25.200]  you may start to see the shapes of Tetris

[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.800]  when you close your eyes or you're trying to sleep,

[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:28.920]  you can still see the game and you're playing it.

[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:29.960]  I mean, when you're trying to sleep,

[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:32.440]  you can still see as if you were still playing the game

[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.320]  because your brain starts to get used

[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.080]  to representing those patterns so much

[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.280]  that it continues to represent them

[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.360]  even when you close your eyes.

[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.440]  And that's sort of like my argument is that,

[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.520]  my argument is, someone else's argument

[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.720]  that the brain is a general learning algorithm,

[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:53.560]  that basically all the areas of the brain

[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.760]  are capable of representing anything.

[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.400]  And if you take one sort of like,

[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.800]  David Eakman talked about this,

[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.480]  Jeff Hawkins talked about this,

[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.480]  if you take an eye out of a rat's isoaca

[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.320]  and you plug that eye into the visual cortex,

[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:12.560]  the rat's visual cortex will learn to see

[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:15.880]  because the brain is really a general learning algorithm.

[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.320]  If you put an electric strip on someone's tongue

[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.160]  and connect it to a camera so that the pixels in the camera

[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:27.720]  are going to stimulate different parts

[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.480]  of the person's tongue based upon whether they're receiving

[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:34.160]  light or not and what frequency that light is,

[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.000]  then that person will begin to see via the signal center

[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.560]  of their tongue, even if they don't have eyes.

[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.000]  This has been demonstrated because the brain basically

[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.160]  is a general learning algorithm.

[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:48.280]  You can give it any kind of signals

[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.400]  and it can represent those signals.

[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:52.080]  You could plug in, this is from David Eakman,

[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:54.760]  you can plug in stock data into your brain.

[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.760]  Eakman, you're saying yeah, you could plug in extra cameras,

[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:03.680]  you can plug in stock data and the brain is going to learn

[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.040]  to represent that new brain activity.

[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  It's going to learn to create sensory representations

[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.320]  of any patterns that you give it

[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.680]  because it's a general learning algorithm.

[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:23.600]  But that also means that if you take patterns

[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  from one sensory input and you just send them

[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.840]  into a bunch of neurons and then those patterns

[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:33.360]  represent those patterns, then the next set of neurons

[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:34.920]  that receive those patterns that represent

[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.720]  the first set of patterns, they're also going to

[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:38.800]  have those patterns and you're going to have,

[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:41.240]  these patterns are going to basically ricochet

[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.000]  through the brain and that means that you can have

[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  different areas of the brain representing the same patterns.

[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  It means that basically we are virtual beings.

[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:02.600]  That the representation of my hands and my face

[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:06.280]  and my body and myself, it is a virtual pattern.

[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:10.040]  And it's like, think of the different groups of neurons

[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.360]  as like pianos and they can play music

[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:17.480]  or the piano can play light or the piano can play sound

[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:18.960]  or it can play movies.

[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.640]  It's like a piano that can play movies

[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.280]  or it can play feelings.

[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:28.040]  It can play the spatial and temporal characteristics,

[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:33.040]  feelings, emotions of any sensation.

[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.680]  Any part of the brain can do anything

[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.840]  because these are all temporal spatial patterns

[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:49.360]  encoded in between 0 and 0.02 hertz and 600 hertz,

[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.360]  temporal and spatial, phasic and tonic patterns.

[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.960]  I should say there are temporal and spatial

[02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.760]  phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns.

[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:03.640]  That's actually more accurate.

[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.440]  On top of tonic awareness.

[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:07.760]  Temporal and spatial phasic differentials

[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:09.440]  on top of tonic awareness.

[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.040]  So what we have is like an oscillatory

[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.520]  differential neural network,

[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.240]  or a software network is an oscillatory

[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:21.560]  differential network.

[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:34.560]  And so, wow.
