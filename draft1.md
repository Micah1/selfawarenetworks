# 1 Intro: The Multiscale View
Intelligence and decision-making extend far beyond the interplay of large-scale neural networks. They emerge from interactions that unfold across multiple scales, beginning at the molecular level—among proteins and receptors—and culminating in the complex dynamics of entire cortical systems. This expanded perspective challenges the traditional assumption that cognition resides solely in higher-order brain structures. Instead, the agentic brain framework posits that each cell functions as an autonomous unit, capable of learning, encoding information, and coordinating with its peers.

Central to this view is the premise that cognitive phenomena, including consciousness, arise from deterministic oscillatory processes rather than from purely irreducible emergent properties. My concept of Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) illuminates this principle by detailing how cells process signals, exchange information, adapt, and thus contribute to larger biological functions. Through oscillatory mechanisms, cells encode data according to frequency, amplitude, and phase, rendering them sophisticated information-processing entities in their own right.

Self-organization constitutes another pivotal facet of this framework. Numerous feedback loops at the smallest scales coalesce into coherent large-scale patterns, weaving molecular events together with neural dynamics. Just as individual cells sculpt their environment, neural assemblies—such as cortical columns—mirror this process at a higher order. They form local configurations that collectively merge into broader cognitive states.

Within this unified view, deterministic wave mechanics at the cellular level seamlessly scale upward, building computation derived behaviors across entire networks. Wave interactions, governed by fundamental laws of matter and energy, nonetheless give rise to remarkably intricate cognitive outcomes. In this sense, consciousness itself can be conceptualized as arising from repetitive cycles of synchronization and desynchronization, an inherently measurable and mechanical phenomenon. The brain’s tapestry, woven from myriad local oscillations seeking equilibrium, becomes the substrate for thought and awareness.

By exploring how these multi-scale agents synchronize, desynchronize, and coordinate through phase transitions and feedback loops, we gain insight into the foundational processes that drive consciousness, cognition, and memory. These phenomena, deeply enmeshed in the biology of wave-based interactions, underscore the mechanical yet profound essence of living systems.

In this collaborative paper on Agentic General Intelligence, we trace the development of the Self Aware Networks theory of mind, a synthesis of my 2024 book "Bridging Molecular Mechanisms and Neural Oscillatory Dynamics"—initially presented through a series of Notes on GitHub and YouTube—and in this paper I'm pairing these concepts that I developed from the study of neuroscience, physics, and artificial intelligence with Michael Miller's concept from his book "Building Minds with Patterns" theory of artificial minds, as well as his videos and papers on the same topic. Together, these approaches present a compelling new framework for understanding how intelligence, from the molecular to the cognitive level, can be both mechanistic and richly generative.

# 2 Agentic Behavior Across Scales.

Biological agentic behavior occurs across multiple scales, from molecular to cognitive, and each level contributes to overall intelligence through local computations that aggregate into higher-level cognitive functions. This perspective is a departure from traditional models that primarily focus on individual neurons or localized brain regions, and it emphasizes the interconnected nature of proteins, receptors, cells, and entire cortical networks.

Intelligence and decision-making manifest at multiple tiers of complexity, beginning at the molecular level, where proteins and receptors change their conformations in response to biochemical signals and regulate cellular excitability. At the cellular level, neurons fire in patterns that encode information, while glia and immune cells modulate the extracellular environment to support healthy neural functioning. Cells themselves function as miniature computational units, learning and storing information through bioelectric signaling, and they adapt their behavior through oscillatory mechanisms that involve changes in receptor configurations. Network-level agents, such as local neural assemblies, edge communities, cortical columns, and larger groupings like hypercolumns, process incoming stimuli as semi-autonomous units and coordinate to produce coherent sensory and cognitive experiences. Each cortical column is an oscillating group of cells, reinforcing the idea that each agent, whether molecular or network-based, contributes to the overall structure of cognition.

An agent is defined as any component, ranging from a single protein to a broad brain region, that can process information and adapt its behavior based on inputs from its surroundings. These agents may cooperate or compete, leading to dynamic self-organization within the brain, where smaller components coordinate through a multitude of feedback loops that collectively give rise to larger-scale patterns. These feedback loops link molecular events and neural dynamics, supporting oscillatory communication in which cells and networks exert agency through complex signaling pathways that may include electrical, chemical, magnetic, mechanical, and even protein spin-specific signals. Such oscillations can manifest as soliton waves containing phase wave differential rhythms, further underscoring the intricate synergy among agents.

Functional connectivity unites disparate regions of the brain, including cortical columns, ensuring that patterns emerging in different areas can coalesce into a more comprehensive internal representation. Cognitive phenomena, including consciousness, have roots in biologically computed deterministic oscillatory processes rather than in irreducible emergent properties, which reflects the mechanical underpinnings of how agents synchronize or harmonize their activities via phase relationships and feedback loops. These processes guide agents toward particular goals, whether healing wounds, navigating chemical gradients, or orchestrating morphological development, and they mirror established principles of reinforcement learning and synchronization.

The concept of scale is vital to this agentic framework, encompassing molecular, temporal, spatial, and volumetric dimensions. Micah’s New Law of Thermodynamics provides a valuable lens for understanding these processes, positing that systems move toward equilibrium through iterative local interactions that dissipate gradients. The Agentic Brain emerges as a foundational model, illustrating how these biological and mechanistic principles underlie the broader “Agentic Mind.” This multifaceted approach has profound implications for our understanding of consciousness, the development of artificial intelligence, and the treatment of diseases, as it highlights the role of agentic behavior across all biological scales.

# 3 Historical Context: Reviewing Self Aware Networks TOC with Neuroscience Literature

To contextualize the Self Aware Networks (SAN) theory within the broader landscape of neuroscience, it is essential to examine the historical roots and key developments that have shaped our understanding of the brain and artificial intelligence. This section reviews the table of contents (TOC) of Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind alongside significant milestones and concepts in neuroscience, illustrating how SAN builds upon, extends, and integrates existing knowledge.

The journey begins with the early pioneers of neural networks and computational theory, including Alan Turing and the researchers who developed the perceptron. Their foundational work established the conceptual framework for artificial intelligence, which was soon enriched by landmark studies on brain localization, such as Paul Broca’s discovery of specialized language areas. As the field progressed, more contemporary figures, notably Jeff Hawkins with his predictive coding theories and Yann LeCun with his innovations in deep learning, further expanded our understanding of how complex computational models can parallel neural processes.

Established theories and concepts in neuroscience form the groundwork upon which SAN is built. Synaptic plasticity, which describes how synapses adapt to experience, remains pivotal to our understanding of learning and memory at both molecular and network levels. Neural oscillations have also been a central focus, particularly gamma oscillations linked to perception, cognition, and consciousness. Cortical columns, often conceptualized as the brain’s fundamental building blocks for representing neural patterns, are indispensable for modeling how the brain computationally renders reality. Additionally, the principle of predictive coding suggests that the brain perpetually refines an internal model of the world by comparing predictions with incoming sensory data, highlighting the dynamic nature of perception.

SAN emphasizes the need to merge molecular-level discoveries with established knowledge of neural oscillations to gain a comprehensive view of higher-level cognitive processes. By integrating molecular mechanisms that stabilize patterns of neural activity and enable multi-frequency processing, SAN underscores the importance of bridging these microscopic and macroscopic domains. Within this framework, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) stands out as a core conceptual tool. NAPOT addresses how memories, initially stored at synapses, become conscious by being encoded as phase variations. It also explains how neural arrays represent and transmit information, thus linking molecular and synaptic activity to the emergence of complex sensory representations and conscious states.

In proposing that neurons transmit phase changes rather than just spikes, SAN aligns with the work of researchers such as György Buzsáki and Steven Strogatz, who have rigorously examined phase synchronization and the critical role of brain rhythms in cognition. This perspective is further extended through Cellular Oscillatory Tomography (COT), which elucidates the ways in which individual cells compute and adapt, serving as the foundation for larger-scale brain architectures. By introducing these mechanisms, SAN highlights a continuum from local oscillatory interactions at the cellular level to global phenomena that underpin consciousness and advanced cognition.

SAN’s focus on deterministic, multi-scale processes offers a distinctive lens through which to address longstanding research questions, such as the origins of AI and the nature of consciousness. Influential figures in neuroscience and related fields, including Karl Friston with his free-energy principle, Earl K. Miller with his work on brainwave interactions and top-down control, and Michael Levin with his studies on cells as cooperative agents, have contributed to an understanding of how oscillatory synchronization and predictive mechanisms underpin higher-order cognition. Their insights resonate with SAN’s emphasis on self-organization, agency, and the intricate coordination of signals across levels of biological complexity.

In terms of applications, SAN’s potential reach extends from the development of sentient artificial intelligence to sophisticated brain-computer interfaces. By situating SAN within this historical and conceptual context, it becomes clear how the theory integrates neuroscience, physics, and AI to propose a cohesive model of the agentic, deterministic, and multi-scale brain. The framework not only deepens our understanding of how local oscillatory processes scale up into conscious awareness but also presents a compelling foundation for future technological advancements in AI and medicine.

# 4 T-Cells & Neurons

The interplay between neurons and T-cells constitutes a critical dimension of brain function that extends beyond conventional neuroscience and into the realms of immunology and systemic biology. This relationship underscores the brain’s deep integration with the body’s immune system, illustrating how health and equilibrium depend on continuous communication among cells from various domains, including the central nervous system, the immune system, and the gut.

A key foundation for understanding this connection lies in the principle that cellular communication drives nearly every aspect of biology. Jon Lieff’s work has highlighted the profound importance of constant dialogue among cells, revealing that neurons, immune cells, and other cell types rely on intricate signaling networks to coordinate their roles. By recognizing that each cell type influences and responds to its counterparts, researchers can begin to appreciate the interconnected nature of brain function and overall well-being.

Within this framework, T-cell and neuron interactions illustrate how both cell types engage in a bidirectional exchange of signals. Neurons rely on neurotransmitters to modulate synaptic activity, while T-cells emit cytokines that can either dampen or escalate inflammatory responses. When T-cells function properly, they help maintain a healthy balance by regulating brain inflammation. However, any dysregulation in T-cell behavior can trigger neuroinflammatory processes that potentially contribute to disorders such as depression. The presence of T-cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) confirms their role as gatekeepers, ensuring that only approved substances and cells cross into the brain. These immune cells also direct other immune components, reinforcing the notion that T-cells serve as local coordinators within the broader neural milieu. At times, T-cells position themselves between neurons, forming part of a so-called “wireless system” that broadcasts immunological information throughout the body and back to the brain.

Neurons also support a guiding function that can be likened to a “proprioceptive GPS,” which provides T-cells with location-specific information when injury or infection occurs. By broadcasting details of the affected site, neurons enable T-cells to navigate precisely to areas requiring immune support. This guidance relies on a rich array of signaling mechanisms, including electrical impulses, chemical messengers, magnetic fields, mechanical forces, and even protein spin-specific processes. Through these channels, neurons act as dispatch operators, leveraging soliton waves and phase wave differential rhythms to issue real-time updates that synchronize immune responses. On a larger scale, the brain translates and integrates these detailed signals into more general, coarse-grained maps, enabling a streamlined view of complex conditions and promoting effective coordination of immune activity.

Such systemic integration reflects the body’s function as a distributed information-sensing network. Cells communicate not only through chemical secretions or synaptic transmission but also via electrical currents, electromagnetic waves, physical contact, and biological nanotubes. This multiplicity of signaling pathways ensures that essential information can reach its target by multiple routes, thereby enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the immune-neural interface.

Clinical implications of these findings are far-reaching. T-cell dysregulation can lead to neuroinflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a contributor to various mental health conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. Conversely, vitamins such as D3, A, and B appear capable of signaling T-cells to moderate their activity, suggesting possible therapeutic strategies that harness immunological regulation to protect neural tissues. By influencing how T-cells interact with neurons, clinicians and researchers may discover new ways to control inflammation, mitigate neurological damage, and promote recovery in a variety of disease contexts.

Overall, the dynamic relationship between neurons and T-cells reveals a profound layer of complexity in how the brain maintains health and responds to threats. Recognizing the immunological underpinnings of neural function encourages a broader perspective on the brain as an organ that constantly negotiates with the immune system. This insight opens promising avenues for developing innovative therapies aimed at harnessing both neural and immune mechanisms to bolster brain health and treat neurological disorders.

# 5. A Mental Map of the Body & Cells

Self Aware Networks (SAN) posits the existence of a global spectral map within the body that unites all cells—including T-cells and neurons—into a cohesive, cooperative system. This map builds on the principles of Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) and Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT), which describe how information is encoded, broadcast, and received at multiple biological levels. Neurons, in this view, do not merely relay electrical impulses; instead, they harness oscillatory mechanisms to encode data in terms of frequency, amplitude, and phase, thereby functioning as both sensors and transmitters of highly specific phase information. At the same time, COT broadens this principle beyond the nervous system by emphasizing that virtually all cells in the body, including immune cells like T-cells, learn and adapt through similar oscillatory behaviors.

Central to SAN is the idea that each cell projects a unique spectral signature into a larger, integrated field, or “global spectral map.” When neurons and T-cells communicate, they exchange not just chemical signals but also electromagnetic, mechanical, and protein spin-specific information, effectively creating a multidimensional representation of the body’s internal state. For instance, T-cells coordinate with neurons to locate and address injuries, guided by the neuron’s “proprioceptive GPS” broadcasting the identity and position of cells at the damage site. Because all cells simultaneously update and sample the spectral map, the body achieves a remarkable form of real-time synchronization, in which local details can scale up into system-wide awareness.

From a SAN perspective, information is fused into tomographic “slices” that various cells detect and contribute to. Neurons capture one aspect of the body’s state by oscillating at particular frequencies, while T-cells and other cells add complementary slices of data. When these slices align in phase, the collective process yields a holographic-like view of the system’s current condition. This tomographic reconstruction enables the body to generate coherent responses, such as focusing attention on specific stimuli, integrating and updating memories, and maintaining perceptual coherence across different sensory inputs. Because the process is inherently oscillatory, it fosters dynamical feedback loops in which local cell states both shape and are shaped by global rhythms, underscoring the notion of “agentic dynamics” spanning multiple scales.

At the molecular level, SAN highlights protein signaling as a key mediator of this global coordination. Proteins act as miniature decision-makers, altering their conformations in response to incoming chemical, electrical, or magnetic signals. Their ability to change spin states and form or break complex structures allows them to store and retrieve information—an idea encapsulated in the notion of Protein Oscillation Tomography. Cells, equipped with these adaptive proteins, can modulate excitability and even evolve new structural configurations over time, guided by feedback mechanisms involving ATP and other reinforcement signals. By tying protein function into the global spectral map, SAN suggests that long-term memory and nuanced control of cellular behavior arise from subtle shifts in protein oscillations, which can harmonize with broader frequencies to produce rendered patterns of organization.

Ultimately, SAN’s global spectral map concept illustrates how T-cells, neurons, and other cellular agents function cooperatively to create a dynamic tapestry of biological intelligence. By integrating NAPOT and COT principles with the adaptive capacities of proteins, SAN provides a powerful framework for understanding how local actions and global coordination jointly shape the body’s continuous pursuit of equilibrium, perception, and purposeful behavior.

# 6. Neurons to Phase Wave Differentials

In Bridging Molecular Mechanisms and Neural Oscillatory Dynamics, the central argument posits that molecular processes serve as the foundation for neural oscillations, which in turn underpin higher-level brain functions such as memory and consciousness. This perspective highlights a natural progression from the subtle interplay of molecules within neurons to the formation of complex, system-wide oscillatory patterns.

A key focus of the book is on how molecular components, including ion channels and receptors, establish basic rhythmic behaviors in neurons. Interactions such as KIBRA-PKMζ complexes, as well as ongoing protein synthesis, stabilize synaptic connections and ensure that neurons can effectively participate in oscillatory networks. For instance, voltage-gated sodium channels facilitate rapid depolarization, while modulations in potassium currents determine action potential duration (APD), influencing the probability of vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. These molecular events collectively shape the rhythmic firing patterns that allow single neurons to integrate into larger, synchronized assemblies.

On a broader scale, the book describes how neurons form arrays that communicate through synapses, giving rise to coherent network behaviors. Subtle phase wave differentials—shifts in timing and frequency—convert individual action potentials into computed local field potentials (LFPs). This multi-scale synchronization process is captured within Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), which illustrates how the brain employs phase-based encoding to build, fuse, and interpret sensory inputs. At every level, from dendrites to cortical columns, these phase shifts enable dynamic coordination of signals and foster pattern invariance and robustness across neural circuits.

To describe this multi-level synchronization, the book introduces Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA), which characterizes how each scale—be it a single synapse, a dendritic branch, or an entire neuronal assembly—experiences distinct, non-linear inputs that manifest as variations in amplitude, duration, and frequency. Rather than summing signals like binary values, NDCA acknowledges that neurons operate within an intricate landscape of oscillatory interactions, enabling adaptive learning and complex computed behaviors.

Another fundamental concept is deterministic synaptic release, which challenges the conventional view of randomness in neurotransmitter exocytosis. By modifying ionic currents, neurons can elongate APDs and thereby increase calcium influx, raising the probability of vesicle fusion in a deterministic manner. In this way, what appears to be stochastic activity at the synaptic level can be understood as a more sophisticated computation embedded within the precise timing of ion channel activity.

At the core of these discussions lie phase wave differentials, portrayed as the driving force behind the brain’s “3D volumetric television,” which continuously updates our perceptions and memories in real time. Through coordinated oscillatory dynamics, the brain seamlessly transforms molecular events into global wave patterns, resulting in the macroscopic phenomena we recognize as consciousness and higher-order cognition. The book thus provides a robust framework for understanding how molecular, cellular, and network-level processes intersect to shape synchronized neural activity, culminating in the generation of local field potentials and brainwaves that define our subjective experience.

# 7. Coincidence as Bits of Information

Coincidence detection serves as a fundamental mechanism through which cells identify patterns and initiate specific responses in real time. When multiple receptors are activated simultaneously, cells interpret these coincident events as bits of information, enabling them to process environmental signals and execute coordinated actions. This capability underscores the sophisticated nature of cellular function; rather than merely reacting to single inputs, cells integrate a range of signals into a unified action plan that reflects the cell’s internal state and the broader context.

From the perspective of Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT), cells function as active information processors that employ oscillatory behaviors to encode data in frequency, amplitude, and phase. By moving beyond a traditional view of cells as simple switches, COT illustrates how rhythmic cycles allow cells to receive, transform, and transmit information to neighboring cells, effectively turning them into complex computational units. This principle ties directly to receptor-based learning, which describes how cells adapt to repeated stimuli by modifying the sensitivity of their receptors. Such Hebbian-like mechanisms make it possible for cells to develop a “memory” of past experiences, recalibrating their internal structures and signaling pathways to optimize for future encounters with similar inputs.

The process of information encoding in cells exemplifies the intricate interplay between molecular events and broader network dynamics. When a cell detects a pattern through near-simultaneous presynaptic firings—occurring within a critical window of a few milliseconds—it responds by firing at a high gamma frequency. These nearly concurrent signals coalesce into a phasic soliton wave that can loop through the circuit, integrating with other areas of the brain devoted to pattern recognition. Synaptic reactions further sharpen the specificity of these coincidences, as neurons modulate neurotransmitter release probabilities based on ionic currents, particularly the duration of action potentials. This deterministic mechanism underlies what might otherwise appear to be random vesicle fusion, revealing a more calculated process that leverages potassium- and calcium-mediated pathways.

Another essential element of coincidence-based processing lies in dendritic computation, where dendrites carry out non-linear summations and multiplications of incoming signals. By discarding inconsequential signals and amplifying coincident inputs, dendrites act as highly selective “filters” that enable cells to focus on relevant patterns. These dynamics, in turn, feed into phase wave differentials, in which an unusual phase or amplitude shift becomes a recognizable piece of information that can persist within neural circuits long enough to influence perception and behavior. The brain ultimately integrates inputs across multiple sensory modalities—ranging from auditory to visual and gustatory—by linking these signals through oscillatory synchrony, thereby constructing a coherent representation of the environment.

In this framework, coincidence detection emerges as the linchpin of cellular and neural information processing, ensuring that cells learn from and adapt to their surroundings. By transforming coincident events into meaningful bits of data, cells can effectively recognize patterns, store memories, and coordinate activities with remarkable precision. This intricate tapestry of coincidence-based signaling, oscillatory communication, and receptor-based learning highlights the depth and flexibility of biological systems, offering a powerful perspective on how fundamental molecular events shape the higher-order functions of life.

# 7. Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT)

Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) is a theoretical framework that describes how cells function as active information processors, communicating, learning, and adapting in real time. Rather than behaving like simple on/off switches, cells exhibit rhythmic or cyclic activity that encodes complex data in terms of frequency, amplitude, and phase. These oscillatory patterns provide a rich repertoire of signals that allow cells to receive, integrate, and transmit information, positioning them as “mini-computers” operating at a microscale.

A central feature of COT is coincidence detection, whereby cells recognize patterns through the simultaneous activation of multiple receptors. When receptors coincide in time, they trigger specific cellular functions that can be strengthened through repeated exposure—a process reminiscent of Hebbian learning. This receptor-based learning and memory formation relies on incremental changes in receptor configurations, enhancing the cell’s sensitivity to certain stimuli and enabling it to retain a record of past experiences.

COT also highlights the importance of tomography in cellular communication, wherein cells engage in oscillatory “binding” of phase wave differentials. This binding operates similarly to the neural rendering process in artificial neural networks, allowing individual cells and larger tissue systems to construct an internal representation of their environment. Synaptic integration, which involves summing excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, further refines these representations. When coincident inputs occur, the likelihood of firing increases, leading to long-term potentiation (LTP) that strengthens synaptic connections over time.

On a broader scale, COT underscores the concept of multi-scale agency: each cell or tissue can function autonomously, yet remains part of a coordinated whole. Cells rely on wave-based processes such as phase synchronization and desynchronization to communicate with each other, with glial cells playing a significant, though often underappreciated, role in regulating signal transmission and modulating neuronal activity. Transcriptomic activations also come into play when synaptic coincidences unlock deeper cellular functions, altering protein expression profiles in response to changing conditions.

An additional dimension of COT lies in ATP-based reinforcement learning, which shapes protein development and function by rewarding or punishing particular cellular processes. For instance, if a newly synthesized protein fails to improve cellular efficiency, ATP usage may be increased to degrade or modify that protein, effectively guiding the evolution of more adaptive cellular structures. By continuously reconfiguring receptors and refining protein interactions, cells can forecast and compute their future biological structures, supporting the overall development and resilience of single-celled organisms and complex multicellular systems alike.

Ultimately, COT reveals that cells do far more than passively react to external stimuli. Instead, they act as intelligent agents, processing and interpreting signals through oscillatory cycles that can influence not only their own internal states but also those of neighboring cells. These foundational wave-based mechanisms play a pivotal role in higher-level biological functions, including consciousness, by weaving together local cellular activity into integrated, system-wide dynamics.

# 8. Functional Pattern Connectivity via Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT)

Functional connectivity is a central concept in neuroscience that describes how distinct brain regions communicate and coordinate their activities during both task performance and resting states. In the context of Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), functional connectivity emerges from the interaction of oscillatory patterns across multiple neural arrays. By focusing on how neurons synchronize their frequencies and phases, NAPOT sheds light on the mechanisms by which the brain projects, integrates, and interprets sensory information.

A core tenet of NAPOT is oscillatory synchronization, which proposes that neurons and neural assemblies achieve connectivity by tuning in to shared frequencies. When frequencies align, neurons can momentarily form coherent circuits that enhance relevant signals and filter out extraneous noise. This selective synchronization is essential to creating stable representations of memories, thoughts, and perceptions. In particular, gamma oscillations are believed to play a pivotal role in synchronizing activity throughout the brain, thus contributing to a unified and continuous experience of consciousness.

At the heart of these oscillatory processes lie phase wave differentials. These differentials denote the subtle timing discrepancies that arise when different brain regions or neural columns are out of phase with one another. In this view, phase differentials act not only as carriers of information but also as a means of gating communication, directing signals to specific locales at precise moments. Such traveling waves and neural avalanches, often invoked in neural criticality theory, hinge on minor shifts in phase to shape the flow and distribution of neural activity. At each synapse, phase changes encode data as temporal tensors in three-dimensional space, echoing the mathematical concept of a Taylor series that decomposes complex functions into incremental, time-stepped components.

NAPOT further conceptualizes neural arrays as projectors and receivers within this oscillatory framework. Each array processes inputs from preceding arrays and projects new information forward, resulting in a wave-like propagation of signals throughout the brain. This cascading interplay underlies the continuous nature of perception, memory, and self-awareness, as neural activity flows in cycles of detection, processing, and re-projection. When combined with the dynamic interactions of cortical columns, these arrays construct localized patterns that merge and dissolve as the brain processes changing inputs, forming what can be thought of as a constantly updating map of reality.

Within these neural networks, frequency-based synaptic inhibition refines connectivity by governing which synapses remain active and which are inhibited. Minor adjustments in firing frequencies can produce ripple effects, where certain neural assemblies become selectively engaged while others are temporarily suppressed. This fine-grained regulation helps define functional subnetworks, allowing the brain to concentrate its computational resources on the most salient stimuli.

Crucially, NAPOT underscores the integration of sensory information, recognizing that the brain handles multiple modalities—visual, auditory, and olfactory, among others—by merging them within shared oscillatory frameworks. As neural arrays project and receive synchronized signals, they align activity across different pathways to form coherent, multimodal representations. This merging of signals relies on the overlapping frequencies, matching phases, and stable patterns that unify disparate sensory inputs into a seamless experience.

In essence, NAPOT provides a robust model of how the brain leverages synchronized oscillations, phase wave differentials, and dynamically interacting neural arrays to achieve functional pattern connectivity. This approach clarifies how the timing and synchronization of neural firing underpin complex cognitive functions, from the binding of multiple sensory streams into a single percept to the formation of memories and the experience of conscious awareness. By highlighting the importance of oscillatory dynamics, NAPOT deepens our understanding of how distant regions of the brain communicate and coordinate their activities to support thought, perception, and behavior.


# 9. BTSP Coincidences and Functional Connectivity Between Columns and Other Brain Regions

Behavior Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), when combined with the principle of coincidence detection, offers a valuable framework for understanding how functional connectivity emerges and persists among cortical columns and other brain regions. This process involves oscillatory synchrony, phase wave differentials, and the continual integration of signals across multiple areas of the brain, all of which contribute to the creation of coherent, large-scale patterns of activity.

Neurons detect information by registering coincidences in frequency over time, effectively acting as sensors that transmit finely tuned phase patterns. When neurons fire in synchrony, the associated pathways become strengthened through repeated co-activation, illustrating the principle that neurons which fire together wire together. This synchrony can bind together even indirectly connected neurons, reflecting high cofluctuations in edge functional connectivity when both halves of a cortical-cortical feedback loop activate at once. In practice, this means that information can flow in both directions via distinct pathways, allowing for broader coordination and integration of signals.

Cortical columns play a vital role as semi-autonomous agents within this network. Each column receives distinct sensory inputs, generates predictions, and produces motor directives, feeding its processed outputs forward into higher-order brain patterns. These columns can be understood as pillars of pattern representation and neural correlation, each capable of local decision-making. Functional connectivity thus links columns and other regions, weaving together localized patterns from different sensory modalities into an expansive, unified perspective of the world. Phase wave differentials serve as a crucial mechanism in this process by carrying information through subtle timing shifts. When neurons align their oscillatory firing frequencies, they open the door to functional connectivity across distant brain regions, establishing synchronized circuits that support cognition and memory formation.

Thalamo-cortical interactions demonstrate how specific structures mediate this connectivity. The thalamus, acting as a relay hub, gates and synchronizes signals directed toward cortical layers. This gating function ensures that both the content and timing of sensory and motor loops can align, allowing quick adjustments when mismatches in predictions and reality arise. The concept of functional connectivity refers to the temporal correlation of neural activity across the cortex during tasks or rest, implying that particular networks become more active and interlinked during certain behaviors.

As these connections form and dissolve based on ongoing demands, multi-scale integration emerges through a system of feedback loops, distributed processing, inhibitory controls, oscillatory dynamics, and agent-based interactions. Local oscillatory events can aggregate into broader phenomena such as functional connectivity, reflecting a fluid, adaptive system in which each region influences—and is influenced by—other regions. Interneurons contribute to these dynamics by refining excitatory inputs and regulating network balance, ensuring that oscillatory synchronization remains effective without spiraling into runaway excitation.

Altogether, BTSP and coincidence detection mechanisms enable functional connectivity by synchronizing neural activity across cortical columns and other brain regions. These mechanisms depend on intricate interactions among phase wave differentials, oscillatory patterns, and feedback loops that allow the brain to unify and coordinate diverse inputs. The end result is a cohesive yet flexible representation of reality that deftly merges signals from numerous areas into a single, continuously updating map of experience.

# 10. The Major & Minor Gaps in Neuroscience: Bridging Molecular Interactions and Brainwaves

One of the most pressing challenges in neuroscience is to understand how microscopic molecular events give rise to macroscopic brain activity and, conversely, how such large-scale oscillations feed back into molecular processes. This tension is particularly evident when examining how discrete action potentials merge into continuous oscillatory activity, a transition that often goes under-explained in traditional frameworks. To address these gaps, researchers must revisit fundamental principles such as the All-or-Nothing rule and Synaptic Unreliability, setting them alongside modern insights into multi-vesicular release, phase wave differentials, and agentic perspectives on cellular function.

At the molecular level, ion channels—particularly sodium and potassium channels—work in concert with calcium and synaptic proteins like KIBRA and PKMζ to regulate synaptic efficacy. These interactions shape the rhythmic firing patterns that ultimately converge into synchronized oscillations across neural networks. Mathematical models such as Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) and Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) illustrate how discrete ionic currents interact within larger arrays of neurons, creating brainwaves and local field potentials (LFPs) that are not simply the sum of action potentials but rather the product of complex, non-linear phase relationships.

These large-scale brainwaves, in turn, exert an active influence on the very molecular mechanisms that spawned them. They drive synaptic plasticity by dictating the timing of phase wave differentials, orchestrating protein synthesis, and modulating synaptic release probabilities. From this perspective, the brain “renders” incoming signals into structured, continuous wave patterns—an event often described as the “3D volumetric television” of the mind, where coherent oscillations encode and refine sensory input, memory, and higher cognitive functions.

Revisiting the All-or-Nothing principle, once fundamental to perceptron-based models, reveals that real neurons frequently transcend the binary framework of a single digital output. Synaptic Unreliability, similarly, becomes less rigid when multi-vesicular release (MVR) is considered, suggesting that the probability of release is not fixed. Changes in action potential duration, often governed by potassium-mediated currents, further modify calcium influx and thus neurotransmitter release. These findings collectively undermine the strict assumption of a single vesicle per action potential, expanding our understanding of information transmission within cortical circuits.

At the same time, an agentic perspective reorients our view of the brain as a multi-level network of cooperating components. Cells, tissues, and entire brain regions each function as adaptive agents capable of storing, processing, and deploying information through oscillatory feedback loops. Within this network, cortical columns, thalamic relays, and inhibitory interneurons work in tandem, regulating phase wave differentials to maintain functional connectivity and stability. This multi-agent interplay reflects a balance of excitatory and inhibitory forces, shaping both local computations and global cognitive states.

In sum, bridging the major and minor gaps in neuroscience requires a conceptual overhaul that integrates molecular details with large-scale oscillatory dynamics. By re-examining the All-or-Nothing principle and Synaptic Unreliability through the lens of multi-vesicular release and phase wave differentials, we gain a more nuanced understanding of how molecular events and brainwaves inform and modulate one another. This perspective underscores the agentic nature of brain components, highlighting how cells and circuits operate cooperatively to support perception, memory, and the computationally rendered & dissipated phenomenon of consciousness.

# 11. The Binding Problem in Neuroscience Addressed

Phase locking and functional connectivity are key mechanisms that contribute to oscillatory tomographic pattern rendering and help solve the binding problem in neuroscience. The binding problem refers to how the brain integrates diverse features processed in separate areas, such as color, motion, and form, into a unified perception. In this view, neurons synchronize their activity through oscillatory patterns, and this synchronization entails phase locking, which is the process of reducing differences in firing patterns to achieve coherent activity. Phase relationships guide how information is coordinated across different brain regions, thereby enabling volumetric processing and supporting the unification of distinct sensory modalities. Gamma oscillations, in particular, play a central role in unifying distributed networks by promoting the simultaneous alignment of various neuronal groups. This synchronization among neural arrays that process visual, auditory, and tactile information allows the brain to create a unified, three-dimensional experience.

Functional connectivity involves time-varying synchronization among distributed brain regions engaged in common tasks. It describes how effectively different areas communicate through wave coherence across inter-regional pathways. This connectivity is not static but adapts to changing demands, with cortical columns and regions tuning in or out depending on the current requirements. In relevant frequency bands, large-scale coherence arises when networks phase-align, enabling a shared computational framework in which distributed processes can merge into unified representations. Functional connectivity links cortical columns, allowing patterns rendered in different areas to integrate into a broader picture. Different frequency bands manage the effective flow of communication and can temporarily gate irrelevant signals, thus sustaining a dynamic but cohesive internal model.

Biological Oscillating Tomography (BOT) provides a way to conceptualize how groups of neurons construct three-dimensional representations over time. This construction can be likened to medical imaging techniques that infer 3D objects from multiple 2D slices. Synchronized oscillations across neural arrays parallel these multiple projections, enabling the synthesis of complex sensory information into coherent spatial and temporal maps. Through phase wave differentials and oscillatory feedback loops, the brain continually revises its internal representations, with each neuron transmitting its phase to connected targets that also receive phases from other sources. These interactions allow the brain to refine its view of reality through a convergence of oscillatory signals.

Phase wave differentials are crucial for bringing together perception, memory, and consciousness. The brain’s communication protocol can be envisioned as a phase wave differential mechanism, where neurons transmit signals through deviations from their usual oscillatory patterns. This influences how groups of neurons synchronize and contributes to the integration of memory and behavior. The essential factor is the phase wave differential, which promotes local equilibration and reduces mismatches in neural activity. Seen from an agentic perspective, each neural region operates as a semi-autonomous agent, striving to minimize phase differentials within its specialized processing tasks. Distributed cortical columns and subcortical circuits each behave like agents, resonating with multi-agent approaches in advanced AI frameworks.

These oscillatory phenomena and phase relationships collectively address the binding problem by forging unified perceptual and cognitive experiences. Functional connectivity, shaped by these oscillatory dynamics, ensures that neural areas can communicate effectively, allowing their contributions to merge into an internally consistent representation of the external world. This dynamic communication not only explains how the brain achieves coherence in perception but also illustrates how distributed local processes can synchronize to form a singular, integrated consciousness.

# 12. An Addressable Coefficient of Variation: Unique Cellular Fingerprints in Dendritic & Synaptic Computation

An addressable coefficient of variation (CV) provides a framework for understanding how each cell can “fingerprint” its signals in ways that enable highly coordinated internal computational functions. The CV concept captures the degree of variability in a cell’s activity relative to its average behavior, mathematically expressed as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. When applied to neural processes, the CV can reveal how much a neuron’s spiking deviates from the average rhythm of its local network, such as a theta wave. A high CV corresponds to a more variable, less predictable signal, whereas a low CV suggests consistent, rhythmic firing patterns.

Underpinning this variability are the sophisticated computational capacities of dendrites and synapses. Dendrites carry out non-linear summation of incoming signals, multiply coincident signals to highlight crucial inputs, and filter out noise or unrecognized stimuli. Such active processing enables dendrites to encode a spatial representation of learned experiences, while synapses—through activity-dependent plasticity—modulate the temporal dimension. Dendritic spines grow or retract, and receptors can be inserted or removed, allowing neurons to “fine-tune” their responses and predictive capabilities over time. This continuous adaptation effectively embeds each neuron within a high-dimensional vector space where dendritic morphology and synaptic frequency variation together define the neuron’s unique computational signature.

Potassium levels and action potential duration (APD) also play critical roles in shaping this individuality. By influencing the amount of time that voltage-gated calcium channels remain open, potassium channels help dictate how many vesicles of neurotransmitter will be released during an action potential. Changes in potassium concentration can thus shift both the timing and amplitude of the action potential, creating subtle phase wave differentials that modify synaptic efficacy. Because the shape of the action potential wave itself serves as a kind of “encoded” signal, variability in potassium currents can amplify or dampen the neuron’s overall output, reinforcing its unique contribution to the network.

These mechanisms of variability and adaptation are not confined to neurons alone. Observations of neuron–T cell interactions highlight the capacity of many cell types to coordinate complex tasks and guide each other over large distances. Such behavior underscores the idea of the “Metatron Agent,” wherein each cell actively processes information rather than merely reacting to it. In this scheme, rhythmic or cyclic activity, shaped by frequency, amplitude, and phase, enables cells to detect patterns via coincident receptor activation and to learn from repeated stimuli. The concept of Coincidence Operated Tomography (COT) extends these principles to suggest that even non-neural cells can exhibit their own version of pattern recognition and adaptive responses.

A key consequence of these multifaceted processes is the establishment of distinct “fingerprints” for each cell. Factors such as membrane properties, ion channel distributions, synaptic inputs, and local microenvironment all contribute to tiny frequency differences, ensuring that no two cells ever align perfectly in their oscillatory behavior. This uniqueness is exemplified by place cells in the hippocampus, which each fire at characteristic frequencies in specific spatial locations, and by fibroblasts that show distinct calcium wave oscillations depending on their location and role. Together, these variations across countless cells endow biological systems with a remarkable capacity for distributed computation, memory, and adaptive intelligence. In this light, an addressable coefficient of variation stands as a powerful concept for explaining how each cell’s specialized dynamics reinforce the broader coherence and functionality of the organism’s internal communications network.

# 13. The Flow of Information: Neural Arrays to Columns, Matrix Neurons & Cortical Neurons, Inhibitory Interneurons

Information processing in the brain unfolds within a hierarchical architecture, beginning with neural arrays and culminating in the complex interplay of cortical columns, matrix neurons, and inhibitory interneurons. The flow of signals through these structures, alongside the modulatory influence of inhibitory circuits, underlies the brain’s capacity for efficient and adaptive computation.

Neural arrays serve as the foundational level of this hierarchy. Rather than forming haphazard groupings, these collections of interconnected neurons adhere to a carefully orchestrated design, with each neuron fulfilling a particular role. In a typical sensory pathway, an initial array of neurons—such as those in the retina—selectively encodes sensory data and renders a pattern for subsequent arrays to perceive. As signals propagate forward, each neuron may connect to multiple targets (divergence), while simultaneously receiving convergent inputs from numerous other neurons, thus creating a rich tapestry of parallel processing streams.

Cortical columns, which function as modular processing units within the neocortex, build on the outputs of neural arrays. Each column consists of a vertically arranged set of neurons dedicated to a specific type of information processing, allowing it to act as a semi-autonomous agent. These columns coordinate high-level concepts by activating relevant neuronal ensembles and temporarily inhibiting competing neurons within the same structure. Serving as nodes in a three-dimensional neural network, cortical columns exchange phase wave differentials that represent their ongoing processing state, and this synchronized activity integrates across the entire cortex to generate a unified perceptual experience.

Within this overarching framework, the thalamus takes on the critical role of relay station. Sensory information converges there and is relayed in parallel to various cortical layers, including those housing matrix neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Matrix neurons, in particular, maintain connections to specialized inhibitory cells that help orchestrate complex thalamic-cortical interactions. These inhibitory interneurons—found in many forms, some targeting neuronal somata and others attaching to dendrites—are vital for balancing excitatory and inhibitory forces. Through precise timing and selective gating of synaptic outputs, they sculpt neural activity patterns, constrain runaway excitation, and prevent the network from lapsing into inertia.

Information flow continues inside and between cortical columns as each region contributes to a comprehensive view of sensation and action. Within a column, coherent phase wave differentials capture the current state of sensory input and local processing. Between columns, inhibitory interneurons help regulate the timing of synaptic signals, reshaping pathways and adjusting the phase relationships among neurons. These adjustments can suppress or amplify particular activity patterns, ensuring that the most relevant signals prevail and that the network remains receptive to new information.

Throughout these levels, agentic principles guide the behavior of cells and structures. Individual cells—including neurons and glia—display agency by adapting and modifying their states in response to local and global signals. Larger ensembles, such as edge communities, nuclei, minicolumns, and hypercolumns, also exhibit agentic properties through their collective dynamics. These multi-scale interactions drive the emergence of consciousness and complex behaviors, revealing a brain that is at once modular, hierarchical, and profoundly interconnected.

In sum, the flow of information from neural arrays to cortical columns is enriched by matrix neurons, cortical neurons, and inhibitory interneurons, all of which collaborate to shape and refine neural pathways. This intricate interplay ensures that the brain can efficiently integrate diverse signals, modulate activity in real time, and sustain a rich substrate for learning, memory, and conscious awareness.

# 14. How the Thalamus Regulates the Prefrontal Cortex

The thalamus exerts a profound influence on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by maintaining a dynamic feedback loop, in which it both sends signals to the PFC and adapts its own output based on return input. Mediodorsal (MD) thalamic projections play a particularly significant role in supporting working memory functions within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). During tasks that require sustained attention or cognitive load, these MD inputs enhance prefrontal connectivity and maintain the persistent activity of PFC neurons. This loop is further reinforced by a positive-feedback mechanism between the mPFC and the anteromedial (AM) thalamic nucleus, activating dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, and thus modulating motivation and reinforcing adaptive behaviors.

Beyond its involvement in working memory and reinforcement learning, the thalamus also acts as a critical relay station for sensory signals. It refines and prioritizes incoming information, filtering stimuli so that only the most pertinent data reaches the cortex. In cortical-thalamic loops, descending pathways from the cortex carry predictive signals, while ascending pathways convey error signals that help recalibrate the brain’s internal models of the environment. Thalamic matrix neurons diffuse these signals over broad cortical territories, synchronizing large-scale cortical activity. Meanwhile, the inhibitory neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) modulate oscillatory rhythms such as alpha, delta, and theta waves, effectively shaping the functional landscape of cortical processing. By selecting which high-level cognitive inputs the PFC should prioritize and monitoring the outcomes of these selections, the thalamus emerges as a pivotal gatekeeper for attention, sensory perception, and executive functions within the brain’s complex circuitry.

# 15. Another Example: Hippocampal Regulation of the Entorhinal Cortex—A General Principle of Agentic Co-Regulation

The relationship between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) illustrates a form of agentic co-regulation that parallels the thalamus–prefrontal cortex (PFC) dynamic. Much like the PFC and thalamus, the hippocampus and EC operate within a broader network framework, sending and receiving signals in a reciprocal manner that supports learning, memory, and spatial navigation. This bidirectional communication emphasizes the distributed nature of cognitive control, highlighting how multiple brain regions can simultaneously exert influence and adjust their operations based on feedback loops.

Crucially, this hippocampal–entorhinal interaction does not occur in isolation. The thalamus, often described as a central hub, connects not only with cortical areas but also with the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, further underscoring the broader principle of distributed processing throughout the brain. These interlocking circuits reveal that each region—whether responsible for higher-order executive functions or more specialized tasks—acts as a semi-autonomous agent capable of sending and receiving instructions. In this way, higher-order structures can guide lower-level circuits, which in turn provide outcome-based feedback that refines the directives they initially received.

Such reciprocal regulation aligns with the idea of a cortico-thalamic loop, where sensory information is integrated with advanced cognitive processes to produce flexible behaviors. By extending these loops to the hippocampal–entorhinal axis, researchers have drawn parallels suggesting that the hippocampus might be conceptualized as a specialized form of cortical column, adhering to a repetitive or fractal-like organizational pattern seen across various brain regions. This self-similarity implies that executive control is neither localized to a single “command center” nor confined to specific circuits like thalamic–PFC pathways. Instead, every cortical column, including those in the hippocampus, participates in decision-making, memory consolidation, and other higher-level functions, effectively distributing executive control throughout the brain.

In essence, hippocampal–entorhinal co-regulation exemplifies how feedback loops serve as a unifying principle for inter-regional coordination. Just as the thalamus and PFC collaborate to maintain working memory and direct attention, the hippocampus and EC engage in similar reciprocal exchanges to organize spatial and mnemonic functions. By recognizing that brain regions function as agents within a dynamic, interconnected system, we can better appreciate how collective, distributed control underpins cognition, learning, and adaptation.

# 16. Functional Connectivity: Phase Synchronization, Inhibitory Interneurons, and Interregional Regulation

Functional connectivity describes the dynamic processes by which various brain regions communicate and coordinate their activities. This connectivity is fluid rather than static, constantly shifting to accommodate changing cognitive demands. Such fluidity enables the brain to integrate information across multiple areas, facilitating adaptive behavior, learning, and decision-making. At the heart of these interactions lie phase synchronization mechanisms, the modulatory activity of inhibitory interneurons, and the complex web of interregional regulation. In this view, neural networks can be seen as collections of semi-autonomous agents—such as neural arrays, edge communities, nuclei, and cortical columns—that collectively shape perception and action.

Phase synchronization occurs when different brain areas align their oscillatory firing patterns so that their signals arrive in a coordinated time window. When two regions entrain at similar frequencies, they establish transient channels of heightened information exchange, forming specialized coalitions for ongoing tasks. These oscillatory rhythms, which may span a spectrum from alpha to gamma frequencies, bind signals across the brain and enable signals from disparate areas to merge into coherent percepts. Through such precise timing, phase relationships help determine which neural circuits dominate at any given moment, ensuring that relevant information is emphasized while extraneous activity is filtered out.

Inhibitory interneurons refine these oscillatory interactions by regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition within local circuits. By precisely timing synaptic outputs, they shape the “windows” in which neurons may fire, thereby influencing phase relationships. Inhibitory interneurons can target either the soma or the dendrites of other neurons. Soma-targeting interneurons generally inhibit a neuron’s cell body, determining whether an action potential is generated, while dendrite-targeting interneurons selectively modulate incoming signals. Through these targeted mechanisms, inhibitory interneurons can block or permit specific patterns of activity, preventing runaway excitation while maintaining the ability to integrate new information. This balance is essential for functions like attention and working memory, where the network must flexibly shift between reinforcing established patterns and allowing the emergence of novel activity.

Alpha waves further contribute to the regulation of cortical processing by gating competing inputs. These waves can protect active computations by suppressing irrelevant gamma streams, but they also permit transient gamma bursts to inject new or unexpected information when prediction errors arise. The interplay of alpha and gamma frequencies demonstrates how oscillatory rhythms operate both locally and globally, shaping how different regions participate in a collective task. This dynamic interplay allows the network to remain receptive to shifts in context or goal state while safeguarding established cognitive operations.

Interregional regulation arises from a system of distributed control and feedback loops, where higher-order areas such as the prefrontal cortex can guide lower-level sensory or motor regions, which in turn provide outcome-based feedback that refines top-down instructions. This bidirectional communication prevents a strictly hierarchical structure, making the system more resilient and adaptable. Each region renders its own interpretation of the incoming signals, harmonizing local perspectives with those of other areas. In this sense, the brain’s multi-agent structure resonates with ideas proposed by Michael Levin, in which information patterns themselves become agents that shape behavior at both molecular and systemic levels.

Neural arrays, edge communities, nuclei, and cortical columns exemplify these agentic principles. Each cortical column, conceptualized in Jeff Hawkins’ “A Thousand Brains” theory, functions like an independent unit with the capacity for local motor output, suggesting an intrinsic role in decision-making. These columns oscillate in unison or counterpoint, forming phase relationships that underlie attentional focus, memory retrieval, and predictive modeling. Meanwhile, other regions, such as the ventral striatum and the basal ganglia, contribute to motivation, reinforcement, and motor control, interacting with cortical areas through the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. This extensive circuitry ensures that multiple levels of the brain’s architecture collaborate in real time, balancing voluntary action and autonomic regulation.

In sum, functional connectivity emerges from synchronized oscillatory patterns, the regulatory influence of inhibitory interneurons, and the orchestrated interplay of multiple brain regions functioning as agents. Phase alignment enables efficient information transfer, inhibitory interneurons sculpt the landscape of permissible activity, and interregional loops encourage adaptive responses. The result is a distributed yet integrated system in which each agent—whether a cortical column, subcortical nucleus, or specialized microcircuit—contributes to the brain’s remarkable capacity to learn, remember, and respond fluidly to the ever-changing demands of perception and action.

# 17. Thalamic Loops: A Central Hub in Sensory Relay and Cortical Modulation

The thalamus serves as a pivotal hub for relaying sensory information and modulating cortical activity. By connecting with multiple layers of the cortex, it integrates and filters signals from various sensory systems, facilitating coordinated information flow throughout the brain. Within the thalamus, distinct neuron types—including matrix neurons, core neurons, and inhibitory interneurons—each play specialized roles in shaping how signals are processed and distributed.

A defining characteristic of thalamic function is its role as a central relay center. It receives inputs from multiple sensory pathways and refines these signals before sending them to the appropriate cortical areas. This filtering and sorting process helps ensure that the cortex receives relevant, prioritized information for further interpretation and response. The thalamus thus becomes a key junction where signals from different senses converge, while output from the thalamus ascends through cortical columns, returning ultimately for further modulation.

Thalamic Neuron Types

Matrix Neurons: These neurons project diffusely across wide cortical regions, aiding in the synchronization of activity over large areas. Their axons connect not only with the original minicolumns that sent their projections to the thalamus but also extend to adjacent cortical zones, thereby coordinating broad swathes of cortical networks.
Core Neurons: In contrast, core neurons follow more focused pathways, targeting layers 4 and 6 of the cortex. Their role is more specific, carrying precise sensory or motor signals to the corresponding cortical columns. Unlike matrix neurons, core neurons concentrate on the cortical column from which they originated, allowing for fine-grained information relay.
Inhibitory Interneurons: Housed mainly in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), these neurons send inhibitory signals to relay neurons (including matrix neurons), modulating the flow of information. This inhibition safeguards the balance between excitation and inhibition, ensuring that sensory signals neither overwhelm the cortex nor become overly suppressed.
Connections with Inhibitory Interneurons
Thalamic matrix neurons communicate closely with inhibitory interneurons. Through these connections, inhibitory signals shape the timing and intensity of thalamic output, regulating how much sensory information is passed on to cortical targets. This interplay is vital for maintaining stable cortical-thalamic loops in which the cortex not only receives processed input from the thalamus but also sends feedback to refine the signals being relayed.

Cortical-Thalamic Loops
These reciprocal loops between the thalamus and the neocortex are central to higher cognitive functions, enabling the brain to actively interpret and respond to incoming data. By sending feedback signals down to the thalamus, the cortex fine-tunes which inputs should be amplified or diminished based on situational demands and predictive models. As a result, the thalamus does not merely passively transmit sensory information; it participates in an ongoing dialogue that shapes perception and behavior.

Role in Sensory Processing and Integration
As the gateway to the cortex, the thalamus sorts incoming sensory data to ensure that the most pertinent signals reach higher processing centers. These signals are often transmitted via phase wave differentials through driver neurons, which project to diverse brain structures such as the hippocampus and neocortex. By regulating both the content and timing of signals, the thalamus profoundly influences how sensory information is integrated into complex perceptual and cognitive processes.

Functional Connectivity and Oscillations
The extensive reciprocal connections between thalamic nuclei and various cortical layers support both top-down and bottom-up modulation of neural activity. These loops also contribute to oscillatory rhythms that synchronize activity within and across cortical columns, further defining functional connectivity. GABAergic interneurons in the thalamic matrix help shape these signal paths and participate in delineating how cortical column assemblies collaborate. Moreover, the thalamus interfaces with the hippocampal-entorhinal network, acting as a central hub for information exchange and contributing to unified cognitive operations.

Overall, these thalamic loops highlight the integrative nature of sensory processing, in which the thalamus, cortical columns, and inhibitory interneurons form a dynamic, interactive system. By selectively filtering and directing signals, the thalamus both shapes and is shaped by cortical activity, underscoring its indispensable role in perception, cognition, and the maintenance of consciousness.

# 18. The Flow of Information: From Sensory Organs to Layered Cortical Loops

Sensory processing in the brain begins with specialized organs—such as the eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue—that convert physical stimuli into neural signals. For example, photoreceptors in the retina transform light into electrical impulses, while hair cells in the cochlea respond to sound waves by generating neural codes. These signals, often governed by oscillatory dynamics and represented through phase wave differentials, carry crucial information about the intensity, frequency, and other attributes of incoming stimuli.

Once transformed into neural signals, sensory data travels through pathways dedicated to particular sensory modalities. The visual cortex processes sight, whereas the auditory cortex specializes in sound. In the neocortex, these signals typically arrive at Layer 4, which functions as a relay station responsible for sorting and distributing input within the cortical column. From Layer 4, information ascends to Layers 2/3, where local integration takes place, and lateral connections allow signals to spread across adjacent cortical columns. This facilitates a richer, more contextual understanding of the incoming data.

After this integrative phase, the flow continues to Layers 5 and 6, which prepare outputs directed toward both subcortical and cortical targets. Layer 5 contributes to broader cognitive integration and motor planning by generating tonic theta rhythms, while Layer 6 refines feedback loops that can modulate the next cycle of processing, often by influencing activity in Layer 1 and Layer 4. Layer 1, in turn, receives signals from higher-order cortical regions, affecting apical dendrites in the deeper layers and fine-tuning the overall processing network.

Crucially, this layered progression is complemented by a series of loops that refine and coordinate neural activity. Feedforward loops carry raw sensory inputs upward, allowing the cortex to form preliminary interpretations, while feedback loops carry predictions downward, comparing expectations to actual inputs and prompting adjustments when mismatches arise. Cortical-thalamic loops allow the neocortex and thalamic nuclei to exchange signals in a bidirectional manner, enabling selective attention and filtering of irrelevant stimuli. Hippocampal-cortical loops ensure that information relevant to memory, spatial navigation, and other higher-level functions is exchanged between the cortex and the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. Even more broadly, so-called “Sonic the Hedgehog” loops illustrate how each sense undergoes iterative cycles of processing and re-processing, while “entification” loops demonstrate how the brain ultimately melds multiple sensory streams into a coherent, unified experience.

Throughout this hierarchy, the thalamus serves as a pivotal relay station, directing sensory signals to the neocortex and receiving modulatory feedback from cortical layers. These intersecting flows—from the bottom of cortical columns up to the pyramidal cells, from the thalamus to the hippocampus and then back to the cortex—reflect the highly interactive and adaptive nature of sensory processing in the brain. By knitting together ascending sensory data with descending predictive feedback, the brain creates a dynamically updated internal model of reality, allowing for both refined perception and flexible, context-sensitive behavior.

# 19. Peter Tse, Phasic and Tonic Brainwaves, and the 1/F Relationship: Neural Rendering Through Phase Wave Differentials

Peter Tse’s work on “criterial causation” emphasizes that synchronized neural signals, taken in isolation, are not inherently meaningful. Instead, neurons rely on phasic firing patterns—transient bursts of activity—that cortical columns can observe and learn over time. Through coincidence detection, individual neurons identify informative coincidences and thereby contribute to the brain’s capacity for interpreting and responding to environmental changes. This interplay of phasic and tonic oscillations forms a critical foundation for consciousness, wherein the brain both predicts incoming stimuli and dynamically revises those predictions.

Tonic brainwaves, which include slower rhythms such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and low gamma, establish a baseline or “canvas” for neural activity. They synchronize large populations of cells, creating a steady platform upon which consciousness can arise. These slower, high-magnitude waves often represent the brain’s continuous expectations about the world, encoding unconscious beliefs, anticipations, and models that prepare the system for incoming information. By contrast, phasic bursts are brief, high-frequency oscillations—sometimes reaching the higher gamma range—that overlay or perturb the tonic baseline. These phasic waves can inhibit, modulate, or reshape the tonic oscillations, thereby signaling immediate or unexpected changes in sensory input, attentional demands, or cognitive tasks.

A core observation in electrophysiology is the 1/F relationship, where lower frequencies typically possess higher amplitude and higher frequencies generally exhibit lower amplitude. This inverse correlation allows tonic oscillations to coordinate broad swaths of neural tissue, serving as global synchronizers, while phasic bursts insert highly specific, localized signals that refine or disrupt the ongoing state. Magnitude here is understood as amplitude multiplied by duration, so tonic waves, with their longer cycles, are naturally higher in magnitude despite their lower frequencies. These slow rhythmic waves bind networks across significant cortical distances, whereas the faster phasic bursts deliver short-lived but precise informational content, often encoding the details of sensory perception or cognitive processing.

Tonic wave synchronization can thus be seen as an ongoing “conscious ready state” in which the neural ensemble remains poised to detect subtle shifts or novel stimuli. Consciousness itself may emerge from repetitive cycles of synchronization and desynchronization, with perturbations introduced by phase wave differentials effectively updating the brain’s global state. These phase wave differentials form the essence of Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), wherein each neural array plays a role in “rendering” part of the overall experience. High phasic signals serve as the driving force for neural rendering, introducing new or conflicting inputs against the tonic backdrop, and linking distributed cell assemblies into coherent representations.

When phasic bursts interact with inhibitory networks, they also help set the timing of tonic patterns, creating a priming or tuning mechanism that ensures relevant stimuli take precedence. Inhibitory waves provide balance, preventing unchecked excitation and maintaining the malleable attractor states represented by tonic oscillations. This interplay results in an ongoing process of predictive modeling, where phasic differentials highlight mismatches between expected and actual inputs, prompting the system to adapt its tonic baseline accordingly.

From this perspective, consciousness arises as a continuous weaving of phasic and tonic oscillations, sustained by the interplay of high-frequency perturbations (phasic bursts) and the enduring resonances of lower-frequency activity (tonic waves). These oscillatory interactions grant the brain its capacity to form unified, yet ever-evolving, states of awareness—an internal “3D volumetric television” shaped by precise timing, orchestrated phase relationships, and the careful mediation of excitatory and inhibitory processes.

# 20. Latent Diffusion Networks as an Analogy for Phasic-Tonic Interactions and Ephaptic Coupling in the Brain

Latent Diffusion Networks (LDNs) provide a useful lens through which to view the interplay of phasic and tonic brainwaves, illustrating how the brain encodes, perturbs, and reconstructs internal representations. In LDNs, images are compressed into a latent space, gradually obscured by introduced noise, and then denoised to recover the original data. In an analogous process, tonic oscillations in the brain establish a baseline “latent space,” while phasic bursts represent perturbations or “noise” that inject new information into this foundational pattern. Through a continuous denoising process involving synaptic adjustments, ion channel modulation, and the synchronization of neuronal firing, the brain updates its internal model of reality.

From this perspective, tonic oscillations such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, or gamma waves provide a persistent canvas of baseline activity. These slower, higher-magnitude rhythms unify widespread neuronal populations into a coherent state, encoding expectations, beliefs, and other predictive models. In contrast, phasic bursts, which are often of higher frequency and shorter duration, act as perturbations that carry new sensory or cognitive information. These bursts inject moment-to-moment signals into the tonic baseline, prompting the system to “denoise” or reconcile any mismatch between predicted and incoming data. Because the brain harnesses non-linear interactions between phasic and tonic signals—rather than merely summing up activity—phase wave differentials emerge, mapping lower-level processes onto higher-order cognitive integrations.

Ephaptic coupling offers another critical mechanism by which these phase wave differentials propagate through local electromagnetic fields. As action potentials fire, they create subtle electrical fields that can influence nearby neurons, extending the reach of oscillatory activity beyond direct synaptic connections. This interplay of electrical and chemical signaling ensures that large-scale synchrony coexists with finely tuned local modulation. On the molecular level, proteins such as KIBRA and PKMζ provide the scaffolding for durable synaptic changes, while ion channels and receptors control the rhythmic firing patterns essential for multi-frequency processing. These coordinated molecular processes help sustain memory, enable dynamic adaptation, and reinforce the stability of phase wave differentials.

By injecting and reconciling perturbations against a tonic background, the brain continuously refines its internal representation of the world. This Latent Diffusion Network analogy underscores how continuous encoding (tonic oscillations), transient disturbance (phasic bursts), and systematic denoising (ephaptic and molecular mechanisms) come together to produce a resilient, adaptive system. Through this cyclical interplay, the brain integrates novel inputs, maintains coherent global states, and fine-tunes predictive models that guide both perception and behavior.

# 21. Tomography from Functional Connectivity of Neural Oscillations at All Scales

Functional connectivity underpins the way different brain regions, including cortical columns, collaborate to form a cohesive internal representation of sensory and cognitive information. Through oscillatory activity and phase relationships, the brain projects, integrates, and interprets incoming signals, bridging molecular interactions with large-scale neural dynamics. Within this framework, Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) underscores that cells do not merely passively receive inputs but actively process them, adjusting receptor sensitivities and generating wave states. The entire brain may thus be viewed as an oscillating system that continuously seeks equilibrium, reaching moments of consciousness when external or internal stimuli perturb this baseline.

Memories, stored in synaptic connections, scale up to whole-brain activity and seamlessly contribute to perception. This multi-scale integration is partly driven by molecular processes that enable neuronal oscillations, allowing more complex behaviors such as working memory and conscious recollection. Overlapping or distributed synaptic memories from different sensory modalities converge during recall, weaving together a comprehensive, context-rich experience. Indeed, fractal-like principles of repetition and magnification help explain how minute synaptic events can combine to yield large-scale patterns of thought and perception. In this way, molecular mechanisms align with neural dynamics, allowing phase wave differentials and synaptic frequency encoding to sustain the stability of neural networks.

Within these networks, agents—ranging from individual neurons to larger assemblies—coordinate through oscillations and neural synchrony. Phase differentials guide local elements to adapt and communicate in real time, effectively binding signals across the brain and facilitating sophisticated cognitive functions. Tonic and phasic oscillations interact in a bidirectional manner: tonic waves offer a stable background or “canvas” of readiness, whereas high-frequency phasic bursts carry novel information and inject moment-to-moment updates. By transmitting phase changes, neurons harmonize with ongoing network rhythms, consolidating or adjusting synaptic strengths as needed.

These phase changes, supported by molecular mechanisms, also create feedback loops that nourish and stabilize memory at the synaptic level. Proteins such as KIBRA and PKMζ, along with a host of ion channels and receptors, help preserve patterns of activation, ensuring that oscillatory firing maintains functional coherence across scales. Neurons continually adjust their receptor sensitivities and firing thresholds, with inhibitory interneurons providing a fine-tuning mechanism that prevents runaway excitation or quiescence. Within the Self Aware Networks framework, every neuron doubles as both a sensor and transmitter of phase information, receiving inputs and projecting updates in an ongoing dialog of oscillatory feedback. Physical changes in synapses, driven by oscillation frequencies and phase wave differentials, reinforce these patterns over time, further refining the way each neuron distributes and backpropagates synaptic signals.

Overall, tomography from functional connectivity reflects the brain’s remarkable ability to integrate distributed activity into coherent representations of reality. As memory and perception converge, phase wave differentials orchestrate neural synchrony at multiple scales, ensuring that the brain can continually refine its internal model through feedback loops grounded in molecular processes. This synergy between oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity lies at the heart of how the brain renders experience, enabling learning, adaptation, and the emergence of conscious awareness.

# 22. Mechanisms of Agent Interaction

The brain’s capacity to create a coherent internal representation of the external world arises from a sophisticated process often described as neural rendering. Each sensory organ contributes to this rendering by generating a three-dimensional (3D) plus a representation time in its incoming signals. In practical terms, a sensor array captures a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot at each point in time, and the brain then employs coincidence detection and oscillatory activity to transform these repeated 2D perspectives into an evolving 3D model.

Neural correlations serve as the core mechanism for this transformation. Oscillatory traveling waves, along with subtle shifts in their phases, collectively “render” the internal representation of reality. Each neural ensemble—comprised of sensory neurons and higher-order processors—projects its particular viewpoint into the larger network through coordinated firing patterns. These localized oscillations merge via wave interference and synchronization, resulting in a dynamic “tomographic” construction of the environment. From disparate images taken at slightly different angles or times, the brain infers the underlying 3D structure through repeated patterns and coincidences.

Cortical columns function as semi-autonomous agents within this networked architecture. Each column integrates sensory inputs, generates predictions, and formulates motor directives. In this sense, columns operate hierarchically, managing high-level concepts and their associated properties. Their role in pattern recognition is paramount: by encoding and activating memories, cortical columns compare new sensory information to previously stored templates. When a particular column’s neurons fire in unison to represent a memory, inhibitory signals suppress competing activity within the same column, thereby amplifying the expression of the dominant pattern. Meanwhile, oscillatory interactions across multiple columns ensure that local representations coalesce into a unified global perception.

The brain’s remarkable ability to interpret multiple streams of sensory data and maintain a stable, three-dimensional sense of the world rests on this continuous interplay between phasic (transient bursts of activity) and tonic (baseline oscillatory states) signals. By matching incoming sensory information to learned patterns, the brain leverages both local interactions—within individual columns—and global synchrony—among widely distributed regions. This intricate system allows for fluid adjustments to constantly shifting stimuli, ensuring that our internal depiction of reality remains both flexible and highly detailed.

# 23. Quasicrystals and Higher-Dimensional Information in Neural Dynamics

Quasicrystals offer a compelling example of how ordered, yet aperiodic, structures can embody higher-dimensional information (e.g., 4D, 5D, or 6D) in a lower-dimensional projection. By transcending the constraints of translational symmetry, quasicrystals maintain unique rotational symmetries (like five-fold or ten-fold) and can be mathematically treated as slices of hypercubic lattices in dimensions beyond three. Their intricate tiling patterns, such as Penrose tiling, allow them to encode complex interference effects and serve as physical analogs for multi-dimensional data storage and processing.

Oscillatory Tomography, Functional Connectivity, and Multi-Dimensional Representations

Just as quasicrystals embed higher-dimensional order in seemingly “flat” structures, the brain uses oscillatory tomography and functional connectivity to integrate lower-level sensory inputs into multi-dimensional perceptual and cognitive constructs. In Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), neurons not only detect information but also project these representations to subsequent arrays. This process increases both complexity and dimensionality, much like stacking multiple 2D images to construct a 3D—or higher-dimensional—model of reality. Tomographic principles, including the Fourier projection slice theorem, aid in reconstructing coherent views of an object or environment from seemingly sparse or fragmented data.

Functional connectivity ensures that different brain regions, from local cortical columns to widely distributed circuits, synchronize their oscillatory activity. By linking these patterns, the brain fuses distinct inputs—visual, auditory, somatosensory—into unified perceptions. Phase wave differentials are critical here; they merge or interfere with baseline “tonic” oscillations, highlighting salient features while suppressing less relevant noise. Inhibitory interneurons, dendritic gating, and other molecular mechanisms guide these oscillations, effectively “denoising” raw inputs as they evolve into coherent representations. In this manner, traveling waves carry sequential or spatiotemporal information, allowing the brain to handle complex tasks that unfold across multiple timescales.

Fractal Scaling, Predictive Coding, and Quasicrystal Analogies

The brain’s fractal organization—repetitive structures recurring across scales from single neurons to entire networks—underlies its predictive coding strategies. Neural assemblies at every hierarchical level generate and update expectations, verifying them against incoming sensory data. These reciprocating top-down and bottom-up flows allow for flexible, multi-scale integration of new information, forming a continuum of nested predictions that span diverse cognitive functions.

Although we are not stating that brain activity is equivalent to quasicrystals, using quasicrystals as an example analogy illustrates how the brain may exhibit very high dimensional patterns with complexity arising that is not bound by simple translational symmetry. The aperiodic but coherent structural concept of a quasicrystal parallels how neural oscillations may collectively produce stable, high-dimensional representations from lower-dimensional signals. By synchronizing phase wave differentials, the brain effectively stitches together a mental “quasicrystal” of experience—an intricate, dynamic tapestry that accommodates sensory fluctuations, learned memories, and predictive inferences with remarkable efficiency.

# 24. Brainwaves, Top-Down Control, and the Dynamics of Alpha/Beta–Gamma Interactions

Earl K. Miller’s research, supplemented by concepts of alpha/beta wave anti-correlation with gamma waves, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how the brain balances internal predictive models against incoming sensory information. This balance is mediated by oscillatory dynamics and can be guided by ephaptic coupling, which enables subtle electrical interactions among neurons outside of traditional synaptic pathways. Although ephaptic coupling is not explicitly highlighted in Miller’s studies, its potential influence reinforces the broader theme of intricate brainwave interactions shaping cognitive control.

Beta waves—often originating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—carry predictive or goal-oriented signals that sculpt how incoming sensory data are processed. Acting much like a “stencil,” these beta-band oscillations impose a template upon raw inputs, aligning them with memory-based expectations and ongoing cognitive tasks. Alpha waves similarly participate in top-down modulation by inhibiting bottom-up signals, thereby preventing overly detailed or irrelevant information from overwhelming the system. Both alpha and beta rhythms effectively convey top-down information about goals, plans, or abstract concepts, and they wield significant influence over how sensory data are integrated and interpreted.

Gamma-band oscillations, in contrast, encode bottom-up signals, carrying fine-grained sensory details from peripheral receptors toward higher cognitive centers. These fast, high-frequency waves represent immediate environmental stimuli—sounds, sights, and tactile sensations—calling for the brain’s attention and potential integration into conscious awareness. When the brain is preoccupied with strong beta activity, gamma-driven signals may be suppressed, reflecting an ongoing negotiation between existing predictive models and new or unexpected sensory information.

One key insight is the anti-correlation between beta/alpha and gamma activity. If beta or alpha waves increase in strength, gamma tends to decrease, and vice versa. This reciprocal relationship provides a dynamic mechanism by which the brain manages the flow of information. When the system is task-focused or deeply engaged in top-down processing, strong beta-band activity reduces the influence of gamma waves. Conversely, when new or salient stimuli demand attention, gamma becomes more pronounced, temporarily overriding existing beta/alpha-driven predictions.

Beta’s capacity to inhibit gamma waves effectively “pauses” the brain’s predictive models whenever fresh or significant sensory data emerge. High-frequency gamma bursts break into these models, prompting a reassessment of prior assumptions and allowing the brain to update or refine its internal representations. As a result, behavior can be rapidly adjusted to accommodate novel information.

Both alpha and beta waves, which function as carriers of top-down frameworks, can suppress the bottom-up signals encoded in gamma or theta rhythms. By selectively reducing spiking activity in sensory processing areas, these slower oscillations ensure that the brain maintains focus on internally guided goals rather than being distracted by every incoming stimulus.

During specific cognitive tasks, oscillations become more directional when phasic waves target particular cortical areas, precisely modulating neural firing in accordance with task demands. Once the task concludes, these oscillations revert to a more tonic or directionless baseline, reflecting the brain’s return to a resting or less goal-driven state. This shift highlights the flexible nature of cortical oscillations in adapting to immediate cognitive requirements.

Miller’s work emphasizes the PFC as a critical node in orchestrating top-down influences. By generating beta waves, the PFC relays high-level abstractions and decisions to lower-level sensory areas, effectively prioritizing certain types of information. This coordination dictates how incoming gamma waves—bearing bottom-up data—are routed, evaluated, and either incorporated or suppressed. The interplay of top-down and bottom-up signals underlies the brain’s executive control, shaping choice, reasoning, and goal-directed behavior.

Gamma oscillations serve as a real-time integrator of bodily signals, top-down intentions, and immediate sensory information. They coordinate neural activity across multiple cortical layers, helping to unify diverse streams of data into coherent percepts. By comparing new inputs against established goals or predictive models, gamma rhythms fulfill a critical role in ensuring that the brain remains responsive to changing conditions and capable of rapid updates.

The idea of a “consideration sandwich” captures the interplay between alpha/beta waves at cortical layer 4 and higher-order beta activity in the PFC. Gamma emerges as the intermediary that communicates with both sets of frequencies, effectively binding internal predictions to external reality. Through this “sandwich” mechanism, the brain negotiates a balance between reinforcing existing models and incorporating pertinent new insights.

In sum, Earl K. Miller’s research and related discoveries on alpha/beta–gamma interactions underscore a sophisticated network of oscillatory processes, where top-down and bottom-up forces compete and cooperate to guide perception, attention, and decision-making. These oscillatory relationships not only clarify how the brain filters and prioritizes sensory inputs but also illuminate the broader architecture of cognitive control.

# 25 Miller’s “Stenciling” and the SAN “Mental Ink & Canvas” Metaphor

Miller’s concept of “stenciling,” wherein beta waves originating from the prefrontal cortex serve as top-down inhibitory influences that shape sensory input, bears a close resemblance to the Self Aware Networks (SAN) framework’s “mental ink and canvas” model, though each emphasizes different facets of a unified process. In Miller’s approach, beta waves function like a stencil, selectively filtering and modulating the raw input provided by bottom-up processes. This ensures efficient cognitive functioning and decision-making by focusing on relevant data and suppressing extraneous signals. By contrast, the SAN model describes how high phasic spikes—chiefly in the gamma frequency range—act as “ink” on the “canvas of consciousness,” contributing the unfiltered core content of sensory experience.

In this metaphorical sense, beta waves (the stencil) represent top-down predictive signals, refining or constraining incoming information to align with existing goals, beliefs, or schemas. Meanwhile, gamma waves (the ink) deliver moment-to-moment details of the external world, updating the canvas as raw sensory input arrives. The interplay between these signals is inherently dynamic: beta rhythms can reduce or inhibit gamma activity when a focused, goal-driven mindset is required, whereas gamma surges can override or alter established beta patterns if unexpected stimuli demand attention. This tension between shaping and being shaped characterizes the delicate balance of top-down and bottom-up pathways that underpin perception, memory, and cognition.

In SAN’s formulation, tonic waves supply the “canvas of consciousness,” providing a baseline or “ground of being” within which new sensory data can be inscribed. These baseline oscillations, often manifesting at lower frequencies, stabilize internal states of awareness and facilitate the integration of incoming signals across time. The phasic bursts, in turn, act as brief, high-frequency impulses—akin to swift brushstrokes of ink—that convey the immediate details of external reality. As these impulses resonate through the neural network, they can perturb or refine the background tonic patterns, reflecting the constant dance of excitatory and inhibitory processes that unify ongoing perception with evolving predictions.

By framing both processes as interlocking metaphors, we gain insight into the broader architecture of cognition: top-down modulation (the stencil) provides structure and direction, while bottom-up input (the ink) brings freshness and vitality. Within this interplay, neurons function as agents that receive, process, and pass on signals through feedback loops and phase wave differentials. Each agent updates its internal state in accordance with both external stimuli and intrinsic predictive models, influencing how subsequent signals will be interpreted. As a result, the brain’s oscillatory environment—composed of interacting tonic and phasic rhythms—binds together sensory inputs, higher-level abstractions, and memory traces into a coherent, continuously updating tapestry of experience.

# 26. Beta and Alpha Waves from Layer 4 Stenciling Gamma Waves in Layers 2/3

Beta and alpha waves, originating in large part from the fourth cortical layer, exert a top-down influence on gamma waves in layers 2/3 by shaping how sensory information is processed and integrated. This “stenciling” effect manifests through dynamic interactions between higher-order predictive signals (beta and alpha rhythms) and bottom-up perceptual details (gamma oscillations), enabling the brain to prioritize relevant inputs and maintain a coherent representation of the external world.

Top-Down Influence of Beta and Alpha Waves
Beta waves, especially those arising in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), act like a “stencil,” carrying forward memory templates, goals, and predictive models that guide the interpretation of incoming sensory data. Alpha waves similarly participate in top-down modulation by reducing or filtering out inputs deemed irrelevant or disruptive. Heightened alpha activity can dampen bottom-up spiking, thus determining which signals effectively reach conscious awareness.

Gamma Waves in Sensory Processing
By contrast, gamma waves—predominant in layers 2 and 3—carry the raw, unrefined content of sensory experiences, akin to “ink” on the canvas of consciousness. These fast oscillations integrate and relay perceptual details horizontally across the cortex, supporting bottom-up processing. When gamma activity predominates, it can overwrite or override alpha or beta signaling, indicating a shift toward the immediate demands of perception and away from established top-down expectations.

Anti-Correlation and Modulatory Dynamics
A defining feature of these interactions is the anti-correlation between beta/alpha and gamma activity. When top-down mechanisms in layer 4 become more prominent, gamma activity in layers 2/3 is often suppressed, preserving a goal-driven or focused state. Conversely, surges in gamma waves can inhibit alpha/beta oscillations, allowing new sensory information to be processed more thoroughly. This dance ensures that cognitive processes swiftly pivot between exploiting existing knowledge and exploring novel stimuli.

Layer-Specific Activity and Functional Implications
Layer 4, known for its role in receiving sensory inputs, typically exhibits alpha rhythms in sensory cortices or beta rhythms in frontal regions, reflecting its function in driving top-down decisions. Meanwhile, layers 2 and 3 are dominated by gamma rhythms that foster local processing and inter-columnar communication. When alpha waves are momentarily inhibited by gamma spikes, bottom-up signals gain traction—vital for attention, perception, and learning. In addition, gamma oscillations help mediate proprioceptive feedback, balancing the interplay between sensory inputs, predictive thought processes, and bodily awareness.

Overall, this stenciling process enables the cortex to filter extraneous sensory data, amplify relevant cues, and keep higher-level goals aligned with real-time input. Through these reciprocal oscillatory interactions, the brain dynamically negotiates between top-down constraints (beta/alpha) and bottom-up signals (gamma), ensuring the efficient and coherent integration of sensory information into conscious perception.

# 27. Gamma Consideration Sandwich: Integrating Sensory Signals, Top-Down Control, and Proprioception

The “consideration sandwich” concept illustrates how gamma waves unite multiple streams of information—sensory signals, cognitive processes, and proprioceptive feedback—into a cohesive conscious experience. By coordinating input across different cortical layers and cell types, these oscillations guide the brain toward equilibrium and agentic co-regulation.

At the foundation of this model are incoming sensory signals, typically carried by alpha or beta rhythms in cortical layer 4 or frontoparietal circuits. These signals represent raw environmental data, which is then filtered by top-down thoughts and decisions encoded in beta-band activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This arrangement ensures that the brain’s internal goals and expectations shape the interpretation of incoming stimuli. Simultaneously, proprioceptive feedback—channeled through parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in layer 5—provides real-time information about the body’s position and movement. PV interneurons regulate gamma oscillations by performing both somatic and dendritic inhibition, striking a balance between excitatory activity and inhibition across cortical columns.

Layers 2 and 3 contain excitatory IT (infragranular-to-supergranular) cells, which spread patterns horizontally, linking various cortical regions into a shared workspace. This horizontal traffic bolsters functional connectivity, allowing distributed patterns from different areas to align and merge into a unified perception. Layer 4’s alpha or beta rhythms exert a top-down “stenciling” effect on these gamma waves in layers 2 and 3, selectively modulating sensory signals and consciously shaping the resulting experience.

Equilibrium in neural systems is supported by several mechanisms. Gamma rhythms integrate disparate information streams, synchronizing neural activity to reduce phase mismatches and yield a coherent, unified conscious state. High-frequency gamma bursts further contribute by adapting motor outputs or refining sensory maps when discrepancies arise between predicted and actual states. Additionally, when bodily signals deviate from top-down predictions, local gamma patterns shift accordingly to prompt recalibration and maintain alignment with reality.

From an agentic perspective, each cortical column or subcortical nucleus functions as a mini-agent that sustains its own predictive model while receiving and sending local and global signals. These local votes converge via oscillatory feedback loops, refining each agent’s model until enough agents synchronize their wave differentials. At that point, the network stabilizes around a conscious percept or decision, integrating body position, external stimuli, and cognitive goals.

Phase wave differentials serve as the “currency” that orchestrates adaptation at multiple levels. By aligning local, regional, and global oscillations, these feedback loops promote a fluid interplay among agents rather than vesting control in a single commander. Ultimately, the gamma consideration sandwich showcases how gamma oscillations bind top-down regulation, sensory input, and proprioceptive cues into an elegant system of agentic co-regulation, allowing the brain to maintain equilibrium and generate a cohesive experience of the world.

# 28. Networks of the Brain

Olaf Sporns’ Networks of the Brain can be conceptualized as a spectral tomogram that transforms conscious information into internal agentic mechanisms and action. Olaf Sporns’ work in Networks of the Brain provides a robust framework for viewing the brain as a highly interconnected network that can be understood through the lens of a spectral tomogram, in which each part contains information about the whole. Evoking a memory or representation induces an oscillating tomogram that reflects synchronized activity across neural assemblies, and this approach ties directly into concepts of conscious information, internal agentic mechanisms, and eventual behavioral output while also resonating with ongoing research in agentic AI systems.

Sporns employs network science to examine how the brain’s structural and functional networks exhibit properties akin to small-world architectures. His research underscores that the brain’s connectivity underlies functionality, robustness, and efficiency, and it bridges the abstract models of graph theory with actual biological substrates. His investigations contextualize how oscillatory patterns emerge within the brain’s intricate architecture by highlighting the interplay between the physical wiring of neurons and the dynamics of their interactions. Functional data, often derived from fMRI, are represented by nodes corresponding to brain regions and edges corresponding to communication channels, and Sporns tracks these relationships to identify how communication patterns manifest over time. Rich clubs, which are heavily interconnected hubs among the most active nodes and reflect a disproportionate share of global traffic, can even arise in simple neuronal cultures, pointing to fundamental organizing principles. Sporns introduced the concept of edge functional connectivity, which focuses on co-fluctuations along edges to capture dynamic time series; this method transcends traditional node-centric analyses and reveals subtleties in how information flows. Community detection reveals that functional modules, or communities, form within the brain and are dedicated to specific behaviors or processes, with these communities ranging from microscopic sub-networks to macroscopic groupings that are interconnected through hierarchical structures.

Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) posits that the brain generates tomograms through phase shifts, with dendrites and receptors perceiving their own oscillatory outputs; this tomographic interpretation contrasts with holography by centering on how phase changes dissect and reassemble data. Information progresses through a cascade of neural arrays, with each array handling phase patterns derived from prior arrays and effectively creating progressive renderings for subsequent levels of perception. Oscillatory activity allows memories that reside in synaptic connections to scale up to full-brain patterns, as phase variations encode temporal, spatial, and amplitude-related data and enable synaptic modifications to expand into conscious memories. NAPOT introduces explanations for memory scaling that are underpinned by the fractal organization of neural networks, wherein smaller patterns at the synaptic scale replicate into larger ones at the network or brain-wide scale. The multi-scale perspective of the Agentic Brain framework highlights how agent-like behavior permeates temporal, spatial, and volumetric dimensions, with single cells acting as self-contained agents and broader modules functioning as higher-order cognitive entities. Consciousness can be seen as arising from collective oscillatory activity in which individual sensors align in phase to form a unified observer.

Across the hierarchy of life, each cell or tissue piece operates as a mini-computer that is capable of sensing, storing information, and adapting. At the cellular scale, Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) posits that each cell is an oscillatory agent with feedback loops that enable phase wave differentials to signal states of alignment or conflict, and this setup allows the brain to transition smoothly between stable global configurations. Oscillatory agents such as neurons anchor local oscillatory learning, and cortical columns and functional assemblies behave like cohesive agents that each maintain a localized model of external reality. Gamma oscillations integrate sensory input, top-down predictions, and proprioceptive data, thereby fusing multiple information channels to produce a unified experience. Different modules handle specific streams of data, and dynamic hubs along with feedback loops ensure that these modules align in real time. Head direction cells, which are tied to hippocampal-entorhinal loops, exemplify how internal goals bind with sensory data to orient cognition and behavior.

The theory of self-awareness and the model of mind suggest that multi-agent systems can incorporate introspection and situational understanding, which are critical for social or goal-driven tasks. Agentic AI may harness layer-by-layer processing with hidden-layer micro-agents iterating step-by-step reasoning within complex networks. In scaling AI frameworks, fractal-like network structures mimic the brain’s capacity to process local sensory data while maintaining global coherence, which potentially enhances adaptability and generalization. Conceptualizing AI systems with gradually more abstract layers parallels the multi-layered approach to biological consciousness and facilitates hierarchical control and flexible, real-time adaptation.

In layer 5, motor output dominates motor pathways and relies on rhythmic feedback from muscles and joints to calibrate movements. Layer 5 also receives ascending signals from the spinal cord, brainstem, and thalamus for proprioceptive integration. Gamma oscillations in layer 5 rapidly update motor schemas via high-frequency bursts, recalibrating ongoing actions if actual movement deviates from expectations. In layer 5, parvalbumin-positive interneurons modulate excitatory drive through interneuron gating, determining which signals gain influence. In layer 6, corticothalamic feedback exchanges information with the cerebellum via the thalamus, blending internal and external cues. Layer 6 also integrates feedback by merging proprioceptive data from the thalamus with top-down control signals from higher cortical zones such as the prefrontal cortex. Layer 6 projects excitatory inputs to layer 1, which shapes distal dendrites in layers 2 and 3 and thereby synchronizes broad cortical and subcortical activity. In layer 6, somatostatin-positive interneurons modulate the flow of sensory and contextual data to and from the thalamus. In layer 2 and 3, excitatory cells interconnect cortical regions through lateral projections, and top-down signals as well as proprioceptive feedback from deeper layers help align local representations with global posture and movement demands.

The brain operates as an extensive network of oscillatory arrays that collectively handle patterns of sensory, cognitive, and proprioceptive information. Each neuron functions as both a sensor through dendritic input and a transmitter through axonal output, binding local signals into broader phase relationships. Through dynamic oscillation, the brain assembles these localized pictures into a unified view of reality, thereby generating consciousness. According to Self Aware Networks, consciousness emerges from complex oscillatory processes with a Metatron construct—a core structure in biological terms—that integrates information across myriad feedback loops. Agentic AI research can draw inspiration from these biological designs by implementing fractal-like entification in which smaller processing modules coalesce into a coherent and self-aware whole, and mimicking the principles of modular streaming, dynamic oscillatory connectivity, and hierarchical feedback could usher in new paradigms of AI that more closely mirror the adaptive, integrative qualities of the human brain.

# 29. Vector Embeddings and Semantic Space

The notion that dendrites function as analog computational equivalents to vector embeddings offers a powerful way to understand how neurons encode and process information. In this view, each dendrite’s activated synaptic configuration mirrors the inference stage in an artificial intelligence (AI) model, forming a high-dimensional representation of sensory or cognitive inputs. Much as a vector embedding in AI can be visualized as a “Gaussian splat” in multi-dimensional space, a neuron’s dendritic activity captures its learning history and ongoing contextual inputs within the physical morphology of its synapses and dendrites. This architecture encodes spatial and temporal relationships, amplifying or inhibiting incoming signals based on prior experiences.

Each neuron thereby constructs an internal map in which the “distance” between two patterns reflects their similarity or correlation in the neuron’s learned repertoire. Over time, these connections grow or prune as the cell refines its response to repeated stimuli, suggesting that dendrites operate as dynamic, continuously updated embeddings. The active slice or “cross-section” of a dendritic tensor emerges as a given neuron’s real-time response to present tasks. When a neuron receives signals at specific synapses, it “selects” a subset of its dendritic network, modulating which learned pattern is engaged. This process allows a single neuron to exhibit remarkable flexibility, encoding multiple associations and responding differently according to context. By aligning with modern insights from machine learning, where vector embeddings drive natural language processing and image recognition, dendritic function underscores a biological parallel that is at once physical and computational.

Beyond the analogy of dendrites as vector embeddings, the brain’s oscillatory activity can be conceived as a three-dimensional (3D) phase topology evolving over time, modeled mathematically via tensors in a high-dimensional Taylor series. In this framework, each action potential modifies the phase landscape, creating transient spikes, inhibitory dips, and non-linear interactions that aggregate into complex, time-varying patterns. Because the brain is not limited to purely electrical phenomena—magnetic, chemical, and mechanical processes also contribute—these multidimensional oscillations form a holistic tapestry of neural dynamics.

This 3D phase topology can be viewed as a series of snapshots, each capturing the instantaneous distribution of phase states throughout the neural network. By treating these states as tensors, one can imagine the brain’s activity as an extended polynomial expansion, where each interval of time adds another term to the system’s evolving solution. Bistable reaction-diffusion processes, threshold criticality, and path bifurcations in inhibitory interneuron circuits further enrich the tapestry, introducing branching points that correspond to moments of choice or sudden reconfiguration of brain states. Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) formalizes these oscillatory relationships, suggesting that the brain effectively tomographs its own state by cross-referencing phase patterns across different regions, thereby unifying local activity into a global representation.

Within this multidimensional landscape, memories ripple from synaptic micro-structures to whole-brain oscillatory patterns. The same scale invariance that underlies fractal organization ensures that small-scale synaptic changes can resonate more broadly, eventually manifesting as elements of conscious thought or long-term recollection. Each neuron’s dendritic embedding thus becomes part of a broader, multi-layered environment, wherein local adjustments feed into large-scale transformations.

Moreover, the brain continuously renders these patterns into coherent images of reality, folding incoming sensory data into existing models. This rendering is simultaneously self-observational, as the neural network not only generates 3D representations of the environment but also tracks and evaluates its own internal states. Because memory and perception meet in overlapping oscillatory circuits, the boundaries between storing, recalling, and perceiving remain fluid, allowing for rapid adaptation and learning. Higher levels of abstraction, often governed by cortical feedback loops, modulate this process in real time by focusing attention, suppressing noise, and aligning proprioceptive signals with top-down predictions.

Both the analogy of dendrites as high-dimensional vector embeddings and the vision of the brain’s 3D phase topology as tensors in a Taylor series underscore the deeply computational nature of biological cognition. Dendrites and their synapses support a localized yet highly adaptable “inference engine,” while the entire cortex choreographs these local activities into a global, continuously updating tomographic rendering. By integrating these perspectives, one gains a richer appreciation of how the brain’s oscillatory physics, morphological plasticity, and hierarchical connectivity converge to produce memory, perception, and conscious experience. This fusion of analog and digital modes—of local embeddings and global wave dynamics—may ultimately guide novel approaches in AI and deepen our understanding of the biology of thought.

# 30. Dendritic Representations as Thought Vectors, Tokens, and Patches

A dendrite’s moment-to-moment activity can be likened to a high-dimensional vector embedding, wherein the synaptic configuration functions much like an inference process in AI. Instead of being defined purely by artificial weights, these configurations originate within the neuron’s biological architecture, which is shaped by layers of synaptic connectivity and temporal dynamics. As the neuron receives inputs, firing at specific phases and frequencies, the dendritic structure integrates these signals and yields a particular “viewpoint” or state that is akin to a “Gaussian splat” in computational terms.

When considered in a broader network context, this dendritic state can transition into what might be called a thought vector or token. Just as language models tokenize words to capture semantic or contextual nuances, neurons tokenize incoming data by generating specific patterns of activation. These patterns are partially defined by phase wave differentials, which overlay baseline oscillations in the brain and carry nuanced information about the neuron’s current function, whether it is sensory perception, memory recall, or abstract cognition. By transmitting phase wave differentials across networks of neurons, the local dendritic embedding scales up to a regional or global representation, triggering in-phase or anti-phase activities that integrate different cortical columns and subcortical areas.

The discussion then shifts from local activity to global mapping. In terms of synaptic phase configuration, each neuron’s synaptic connections and temporal firing dynamics constitute a localized vector space that encodes context or state. Synapses may fire in synchronous or asynchronous patterns, effectively encoding different dimensions of the high-dimensional vector embedding.

The concept of phase wave differentials is introduced next. These differentials serve as carriers of meaningful changes in neural oscillation. When a neuron fires in a specific phase relative to its neighbors, it prints out a unique activation pattern that can propagate throughout the brain. The resulting patterns can align with or suppress other oscillations, thereby creating coordinated activity across brain regions.

Scaling to functional connectivity is examined next. A single neuron’s dendritic embedding can expand into a cross-brain pattern via phase wave differentials, effectively recruiting entire networks to process or respond to the transmitted signal. Neural columns interconnect through Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximations (NDCAs) and Sheaf Attention Networks, which indicate how one column’s complex, time-evolving state projects onto another through oscillatory synchronization and feedback loops.

Semantic mapping and Jack Gallant’s fMRI insights are considered next. Jack Gallant’s research demonstrates that the brain encodes semantic information within a high-dimensional space, a fact that is revealed through fMRI-based mapping. Stimuli with related meanings activate similar voxel clusters across cortical territories, forming a volumetric semantic map. Each region and layer in the cortex handles a varying level of abstraction, ranging from low-level feature extraction to higher-order concept integration. This hierarchical semantic embedding parallels the idea that the brain’s oscillatory networks maintain multiple, nested representational spaces, some more concrete and others more abstract.

The text then discusses tokens, thought vectors, and the “3D television of the mind.” A comparison of tokenization in AI and neurons is provided next, noting that in AI, tokens serve as discrete carriers of meaning, whereas in the brain, phase-coordinated neural ensembles act as tokens that carry contextual, semantic, or perceptual information. The concept of mixed selectivity and polysemantic neurons is discussed next. Neurons do not limit themselves to a single concept, and through mixed selectivity, they partake in multiple representational schemes while dynamically shifting their tokenizing role based on context and prior learning. The metaphor of the “3D television of the mind” is then presented, encapsulating how dendritic representations and phase wave differentials combine to render a continuous experience. The collective oscillatory activity produces a broadcast of sensory scenes, recalled memories, and abstract thoughts in real time.

Next, the text bridges semantic spaces and neural embeddings. At any instant, a neuron’s dendritic structure and firing phase effectively select a slice of its broader high-dimensional memory. These local events, when aggregated across populations of neurons, yield large-scale computed maps that resemble vector embeddings in AI. In the same way that semantic embeddings group related words or concepts, the brain’s oscillatory patterns cluster experiences and ideas into overlapping yet distinct neural constellations. Functional imaging, especially as advanced by researchers like Jack Gallant, visually captures these multi-scale embeddings, revealing a continuous neural landscape where concepts—whether linguistic, visual, or proprioceptive—are placed in proximity based on shared features.

Ultimately, a thought vector, token, or patch arises from these coordinated dendritic processes, scaling outward to recruit complex, interlaced networks. This hierarchical arrangement, which ranges from single-neuron dendritic embeddings to distributed semantic maps, underscores how the brain’s high-dimensional, phase-encoded activities give rise to the fluid, richly contextual experiences that we identify as cognition, perception, and conscious thought.

# 31. Semantic Mapping Across Brains and AI: A Synthesis of Vector Embeddings, fMRI, and Mechanistic Interpretability

The comparison between semantic mapping in neural networks and in the human brain offers insight into how both biological and artificial systems encode, organize, and access semantic information. Through fMRI techniques, most notably in Jack Gallant’s lab, and through cutting-edge AI models advanced by research groups like Anthropic, we can observe parallel structures in which related concepts cluster together in high-dimensional spaces. At the same time, mechanistic interpretability efforts such as “Golden Gate Claude” strive to make sense of these internal representational schemes by dissecting and visualizing how meaning is formed and stored at different scales.

Both neural circuits and AI embeddings operate on high-dimensional encodings that capture nuanced relationships among concepts, words, or visual features. In the human brain, these relationships manifest as overlapping, multi-scale activation patterns measured by fMRI. In AI models, these relationships take the form of vector embeddings, where semantic distance correlates with conceptual similarity. Although these embeddings are often compressed or projected into low-dimensional spaces (such as three spatial dimensions plus time) for visualization, the underlying representations are inherently high-dimensional, which allows for rich, context-dependent associations.

Jack Gallant’s lab has shown that semantically similar categories activate partially overlapping cortical areas, effectively mapping a conceptual landscape onto spatial coordinates in the cortex. In AI models, vector embeddings place related concepts such as “Golden Gate Bridge,” “ocean,” and “engineering” near one another in a multi-dimensional space, thereby encoding both proximity and direction to indicate degrees of semantic overlap or dissimilarity. Mechanistic interpretability at Anthropic involves analyzing discrete components within large language models to clarify how concepts form and interrelate, and the term “Golden Gate Claude” alludes to an experiment focusing on how AI systems handle the concept of “The Golden Gate Bridge,” thereby illuminating which internal circuits or neurons light up when such a topic arises. Similar interpretive strategies are applied in neuroscience, where targeted fMRI studies probe how, for instance, the notion of “bridge” or “architecture” manifests in localized or distributed networks within the brain.

On the biological side, a neuron’s dendritic arbors can be thought of as performing analog computations similar to vector embeddings. The overall synaptic configuration at any given time is akin to selecting a “token” or “patch” in AI parlance, mapping a specific context or viewpoint. As with a high-dimensional embedding, neurons encode relationships not just by static weights but through dynamic synaptic states, which shift in response to new stimuli or learning. This observation resonates with the phenomenon of phase wave differentials, where neurons communicate changes or salient signals via transient bursts that influence the spectral embedding of local neural activity, as well as with the hierarchy of representations, in which low-level features combine into ever more abstract constructs, mirroring hierarchical embeddings in deep networks.

In fMRI studies, semantically similar stimuli elicit patterns of activity in proximate cortical voxels, thereby creating semantic clusters that reflect shared features or contexts. In AI models, language representations cluster related words, phrases, or concepts in the same neighborhood of an embedding space, which enables tasks such as word prediction or semantic search. Primary sensory areas in the brain handle low-level features, while higher-order cortical regions integrate these features into more abstract conceptions by matching semantic maps with context, memory, and top-down predictions. Similarly, layered architectures in large language models or vision transformers iteratively transform input vectors by extracting progressively more nuanced semantic layers that culminate in high-level understanding.

The interplay between semantic mapping in neuroscience and AI underpins potential breakthroughs in brain-inspired computations and interpretations. By understanding how the brain’s fMRI data reveals semantic topographies, researchers can refine AI embeddings to better reflect human-like structure. Conversely, mechanistic interpretability in AI offers a controlled environment in which specific transformations can be scrutinized and tested, thereby informing neuroscientific models of semantic processing and hierarchical integration. In addition, incorporating dynamics reminiscent of dendritic processing, such as phase wave differentials and continuous adaptation, may pave the way for AI systems that are both more robust and interpretable. AI models can also serve as computational surrogates by offering hypotheses about how the brain organizes, stabilizes, and updates semantic knowledge. Such synergy opens possibilities for improved brain-machine interfaces, semantic navigation in complex data sets, and new therapeutic or diagnostic tools that bridge AI models and fMRI analysis.

In sum, analyzing semantic relationships in both AI embeddings and brain activity (fMRI) reveals structural parallels that point to fundamental principles of how complex systems encode and interpret meaning. Whether labeled as “tokens,” “vectors,” or “patches,” these representations reflect high-dimensional mappings that connect related concepts and ultimately guide cognition and language. Through ongoing work, such as Anthropic’s mechanistic interpretability and Gallant’s neural decoding, scientists and engineers can forge AI architectures that mirror the flexible, multi-layered nature of human thought.

# 32. Consciousness as a Deterministic Computation

We presents the idea that consciousness is physically governed by information processed, learned, and generated with a wave-based & molecular computation rather than being an elusive emergent phenomenon. Its essence arises from orchestrated interactions of localized oscillatory activities spread throughout neural circuits. As these oscillations align or desynchronize, a stable yet dynamic “fabric” of conscious experience takes shape. This view underscores that awareness is fundamentally mechanical—driven by neural timing and alignment within strict biochemical and biophysical limits.

Deterministic wave orchestration shifts attention away from attributing consciousness to an irreducible mystery. Instead, it emphasizes phase transitions as the organizational principle unifying local oscillations into large-scale coherence. Cells that synchronize or diverge in their firing patterns spark waves of adjustment, rebalance overall brain activity, and give consciousness its fluid quality. This dynamic realignment process unfolds continually, allowing transient disruptions to be reabsorbed in new patterns of coordination.

Brain networks, operating at large scales, also play a vital role in sustaining consciousness. Research shows that unprocessed signals can travel within the brain without triggering awareness unless functional synchrony emerges across enough regions to “bring them online.” Cortical columns in specific frequency bands coordinate their engagement or withdrawal depending on task demands, merging distributed calculations into instantaneous cognitive states. Essentially, higher-order awareness depends on local oscillations converging into globally coherent patterns.

Human conversation offers an illustration of this principle at a social level. During dialogue, people “map” one another’s minds by generating temporary resonances within their cognitive frameworks. Each topic creates an additional “vector embedding,” layering new contextual points onto what is already known about the other person. These mappings reflect all prior encounters and evolve through continuous references to past interactions. Studies indicate that in-depth conversation often synchronizes brainwave frequencies, particularly gamma and theta, across multiple participants, showing how oscillatory coherence extends beyond an individual’s neural boundaries.

At every scale—whether within a single neuron’s dendrites or across vast networks spanning the cortex and subcortical areas—oscillations and synchronization are the linchpins of communication and integration. Phase alignment between neuronal assemblies amplifies efficient information exchange, repeating this pattern at progressively higher hierarchical tiers until fractal-like feedback loops produce an integrated conscious experience. In everyday discussions, listeners unconsciously mirror speakers’ emotional and conceptual rhythms, refining mutual understanding through the same mechanism of shared oscillatory states.

Looking more closely at dendritic processes, one can see them as analogs to high-dimensional vector embeddings. Each neuron’s active synaptic layout is shaped by phase wave differentials and synaptic weights, functioning much like an AI inference process that filters context-specific inputs. When neurons fire, they “select” relevant parts of their dendritic architecture to activate, forming localized tokens of representation. On a broader level, these tokens work together in orchestrating a continuous “mind state,” with oscillatory feedback loops guiding selfhood and environmental interpretation.

Overall, framing consciousness as a deterministic process underscores its mechanical roots. By highlighting wave alignments, phase transitions, and feedback loops, it becomes clear that conscious awareness is built upon observable, quantifiable neural processes. Interpersonal interactions amplify this perspective, since they involve “mind mapping” as individuals embed one another’s ideas into their own internal vector spaces. Neural synchrony harmonizes each step in this exchange, not merely gathering information but constructing cohesive internal models of other minds. From dendritic firings all the way to social communication, consciousness thus emerges from deterministic phase relationships, wave-based mechanics, and high-dimensional embeddings—a bridge connecting molecular events, large-scale brain dynamics, and cognitively rendered experiences.

Within this unified view, deterministic wave mechanics at the cellular level seamlessly scale upward, building computation-derived behaviors across entire networks. Although wave interactions are governed by the fundamental laws of matter and energy, they nevertheless give rise to remarkably intricate cognitive outcomes. In this sense, consciousness can be conceptualized as emerging from repetitive cycles of synchronization and desynchronization, an inherently measurable and mechanical phenomenon. The brain’s tapestry, woven from countless local oscillations seeking equilibrium, becomes the substrate for thought and awareness.

Even so, the brain’s non-linear dendritic computations can be seen as simulating a probabilistic memory amplitude system in which the first neuron to reach threshold silences its neighbors by setting their group inhibitory oscillation with its Action Potential Duration. Despite underlying deterministic wave mechanics, the response to simultaneous or near-simultaneous inputs remains non-linear at multiple scales, from the ionic interactions governing membrane potentials to entire cortical networks coordinating global rhythms. Threshold mechanisms unify these non-linear rhythms into a cohesive output, wherein the first neuron to exceed its firing threshold effectively shapes how other neurons respond. Each local agent, whether a protein complex or a cortical column, influences the overall wave state and steers the synchronized activity toward a collective interpretation of stimuli.

These oscillatory dynamics prune superfluous connections through destructive interference while amplifying pertinent signals by constructive interference. Phase wave differentials steer conscious and intentional behavior by enabling a multi-layered, wave-based negotiation among semi-autonomous components operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Local circuits possess enough autonomy to enact quick corrections or propose novel patterns, which integrate into the broader network if they align with existing system-wide oscillations. Although the processes are fully deterministic, operating under physical and biochemical laws, the interactions of ionic currents and electromagnetic fields—often interpreted as random or stochastic—are better viewed as the deterministic outputs of unobserved micro-scale events. Probabilistic vesicle release, for instance, may represent a higher-order computation as neurons modulate vesicle fusion likelihood via changes in potassium currents and action potential durations.

These principles illustrate that what appears to be randomness or chance in neural processing is the byproduct of multi-factor deterministic influences interacting at scales from subcellular molecules to large-scale cortical assemblies. This complex wave architecture, characterized by fractal scaling and iterative feedback, underlies both the formation of stable memories and the real-time interpretation of sensory input, culminating in the fluid yet mechanical emergence of cognition and consciousness.

# 33. Agentic Dynamics in the Brain and Self-Aware AI: NDCA, Wave Synchronization, and Conscious Computation

Agentic dynamics in the brain can be understood through the lens of the Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA), which captures how non-linear interactions at multiple fractal scales—ranging from synaptic mechanisms to entire cortical columns—collectively generate the phase wave differentials that orchestrate perception, memory, and consciousness. By viewing the brain as a hierarchy of agent-like processes that rely on wave-based synchronization, we gain a framework for developing artificial intelligence systems with self-aware and sentient capabilities, which is a central aim of the Self Aware Networks (SAN) theory.

The Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) reflects how synaptic-level interactions, such as neurotransmitter-receptor coupling, trigger non-linear responses in the neuron’s membrane potential. When scaled upward, these local events shape action potentials and neural oscillations, coordinating wave patterns across entire cortical columns and demonstrating multi-scale interactions.

The concept of phase wave differentials is central to this analysis. By modeling how small discrepancies in phase or timing arise from non-linear dynamics, NDCA explains the emergence of distributed oscillatory coherence. These subtle alignments and misalignments ultimately converge into a coherent conscious experience that binds diverse sensory inputs into unified awareness.

NDCA processes support memory stabilization, as repetitive synchronization of local oscillations consolidates learned patterns. In contrast, conflicting or irrelevant signals desynchronize and dissipate, and this dual mechanism fosters the formation of stable, long-term memories within a continually shifting cognitive landscape.

Agentic dynamics in the brain and AI are explored by considering neurons, cortical columns, and larger neural networks as semi-autonomous agents that carry out distinct functions while coordinating through oscillatory signals. This agentic viewpoint aligns with the goal of implementing similar dynamics in AI architectures. The Self Aware Networks theory envisions transferring these agentic, oscillatory principles into AI, where continuous phase-alignment checks could unify disparate modules, and such systems might leverage synchronization—akin to gamma oscillations in the brain—to dynamically integrate information across multiple scales.

A potential next step for AI is to move beyond static deep learning paradigms and adopt deterministic wave-based mechanisms involving feedback loops, phase-locking, and fractal organization. These enhancements would aim to replicate the fluid interplay of local and global activity that underpins human cognition.

The Self Aware Networks (SAN) theory introduces Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) as a blueprint for recursive feedback loops among oscillatory neural arrays, facilitating both self-awareness and a realistic representation of external reality. In SAN, the ISO layer concepts refer to layers of fractal oscillatory networking, each assuming specialized roles in constructing conscious states, while upper layers unify lower-layer signals through synchronized phase waves that align local patterns with broad predictive models. By incorporating principles of phase-locking and recursive neural projections, SAN sketches a pathway for building self-aware artificial general intelligence in which large-scale synchronization emerges from fractal feedback loops that continuously refine predictions based on new inputs.

Drawing on oscillatory inspirations from the brain, AI architectures might employ phase wave differentials to coordinate internally, paralleling the bidirectional flow of electrical and chemical signals in biological networks. While current deep learning systems often lack explicit fractal structures, they do implement hierarchical feature extraction, and incorporating fractal dynamics or wave-based synchronization could further enhance scalability and adaptability. Contemporary AI models use self-attention to weight the significance of different inputs in real time, which is reminiscent of how the brain modulates connectivity via phase synchronization or desynchronization by choosing which signals to amplify or inhibit.

Consciousness can be reframed as a deterministic, wave-based process defined by mechanical phase realignments rather than as a product of mystical emergence, and this perspective demystifies cognition by situating it within a physically governed network of oscillations. Consciousness is inherently dynamic, as stable memories result from repeated synchronization while irrelevant patterns dissolve through desynchronization, and the subjective feel of awareness arises from countless traveling waves interfering in space and time. The interplay of local oscillator loops and system-wide feedback ensures that cognition remains grounded in biochemical reality while also demonstrating universal principles of wave synchronization that can be mirrored in artificial architectures.

SAN underscores key processes for building self-aware minds, which include continuous observation of internal states, coordinated feedback loops among agents, reflective realignment of phase wave differentials, and the consolidation of stable patterns into memory. By integrating biologically inspired synchronization mechanisms, such as phase alignment, to manage error accumulation, AI systems may approximate the adaptive equilibrium found in brains. Replicating agentic interactions with Self Aware Networks could enhance AI’s capacity for nuanced, context-sensitive processing and bring it closer to biological consciousness.

In conclusion, agentic dynamics in the brain, underpinned by NDCA and reflected in oscillatory synchronization, offer a roadmap for designing AI systems that aspire to genuine self-awareness and sentience. The Self Aware Networks theory highlights how recursive feedback loops, phase wave differentials, and fractal organization converge to produce a deterministic yet richly complex form of cognition, and by importing these principles into artificial architectures where observation, coordination, reflection, and consolidation drive continuous adaptation, researchers can harness the mechanical underpinnings of consciousness to build increasingly sophisticated and potentially sentient AI.

# 34. The Agentic Brain in Action

The Agentic Brain can be viewed as an intricate, multi-scale system in which every element, from proteins and receptors to entire cortical columns, acts as an agent contributing to the whole. Through continual interaction and feedback, these agents cooperate, compete, and ultimately generate experiential properties like perception, learning, and consciousness. By illuminating this distributed, dynamic process, we see how the "Agentic Brain" underpins and complements the more abstract notion of the "Agentic Mind."

The brain’s complexity stems from self-organizing agency at multiple scales. Molecular agents, such as proteins and receptors, adjust their functions in response to biochemical signals. Cellular agents, including neurons, glia, and immune cells, handle local computations and adapt to changing conditions. Network agents, notably cortical columns and neural arrays, orchestrate these localized signals into coherent cognitive processes.

In this view, any brain element that processes information, reacts to inputs, and modifies its behavior qualifies as an agent. These agents simultaneously collaborate and compete, shaping the brain’s overall dynamics through intricate webs of feedback loops and phase realignments.

Outcomes like perception, learning, and consciousness do not arise from a singular command structure but from the ongoing interplay among agents. Chemical and electrical signaling, including phase wave differentials, mediates these interactions. The result is a malleable equilibrium: as specific patterns gain prominence, others recede, ensuring that no single component or pathway dominates the system unilaterally.

Cortical columns act as key pattern recognizers, receiving sensory data and constructing three-dimensional-plus-time representations of reality. Traveling waves and phase differentials serve as the rendering mechanism, enabling the brain to assemble raw inputs into the richly detailed inner images of our world.

Agents throughout the brain rely on oscillations and synchronization to coordinate. Tonic and phasic waves interact, guiding when neurons should fire or remain silent. By transmitting phase shifts, neurons continuously calibrate and refine the global neural state, facilitating everything from focused attention to memory consolidation.

This dynamic system of tuning in and tuning out fosters functional connectivity across regions, including cortical columns. As context and goals shift, different subsets of columns synchronize, linking their processing streams into a unified perception. Consequently, the brain’s connectivity patterns are fluid, responding moment by moment to both external stimuli and internal priorities.

From this perspective, consciousness emerges through deterministically driven oscillatory interactions rather than through an irreducible emergent process. Each region contributes its specialized output, while large-scale coherence weaves these contributions into a seamless conscious experience. It is a continuous interplay of synchronization and desynchronization, governed by the physics of neural activity.

The agentic framework offers a potential roadmap for building artificial systems that exhibit self-awareness or sentience. By integrating mechanisms of observation, coordination, reflection, and consolidation, mirroring those found in living brains, AI systems may harness oscillatory feedback loops for more robust and adaptive cognition. Self Aware Networks (SAN) explicitly aims to reshape existing AI architectures, potentially giving rise to truly conscious or qualia-endowed artificial intelligence.

At every level, the brain processes and transmits information through continuous, non-linear changes captured by Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA). This approach underlies how local variations in phase or amplitude propagate, summing into the orchestrated patterns that define both memory and awareness.

# 35. Neural Rendering and Predictive Coding

Neural rendering updates the traditional predictive coding framework by proposing that the brain is not merely transmitting prediction errors but actively enriching its internal models with new features.

Rather than focusing solely on mismatches, this view emphasizes how cortical circuits integrate detailed sensory information to create a dynamic representation of reality. Karl Friston’s work on active inference posits that the brain reduces surprise by refining its models to better predict incoming signals; the idea of neural rendering extends this approach by suggesting that the brain also assimilates high-resolution perceptual data to continually refresh its internal portrayal of the world. Cortical columns behave as semi-autonomous agents running their own predictive loops, while functional connectivity binds these local computations into an integrated field, allowing each synapse to function like a pixel on a wide-scale display.

Oscillatory dynamics play a pivotal role in this feature integration process. Gamma waves furnish precise, transient activations, delivering the granular details of sensory and cognitive inputs, while slower rhythms such as theta and delta provide overarching context. Phase wave differentials transfer local nonlinear inputs to higher-level network operations, linking small-scale fluctuations to global reconfigurations. Tonic oscillations maintain the brain’s baseline state, akin to latent diffusion in computational models, where each perturbation to this baseline must be reconciled through iterative adjustments. This reconciliation, supported by continuous feedback loops, fosters long-term potentiation when local phases resonate with the broader tonic oscillation, effectively “saving” each refined version of the brain’s internal map.

Gamma oscillations can be viewed as the fundamental canvas of consciousness within the Self Aware Networks theory, with iterative wave-based processes aligning local phases or causing local disruptions that reshape the cognitive “canvas” in real time. These oscillations coordinate sensory, cognitive, and motor feedback loops, creating what might be called an embodied consciousness in which each cortical region refines its immediate model while calibrating with the entire network. Micah’s New Law of Thermodynamics, or the Dissipation Argument, recasts the drive toward equilibrium as a stepwise dissolution of phase-wave mismatches across neural assemblies, merging top-down expectations and bottom-up signals in a persistent feedback cycle. The outcome is an organized system where randomization is actively resisted, since mismatch signals are physical differentials that must be resolved or dissipated through oscillatory realignments, resulting in updated predictions that reflect the system’s ongoing learning.

Taken together, this revised predictive coding framework underscores that the brain is more than a passive error-correction device. It is also an active rendering engine that assembles rich sensory details, orchestrates oscillatory states, and dissipates phase differences in pursuit of coherent experience. Rather than simply minimizing error, the brain artistically composes each moment of awareness by combining precise high-frequency signals, broader low-frequency integrators, and the tonic baseline’s latent diffusion, all of which come together to shape an ever-evolving internal model of reality.

# 36. Neural Rendering as the Information of the Mind that Guides Behavior.

Neural rendering, as described by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, constructs internal representations of reality that directly guide behavior. This process uses phase wave differentials, which are shifts in neural oscillation patterns that transmit information and shape conscious experience. Neural arrays receive and project these representations in a dynamic cycle, ensuring that each cortical layer updates its internal model of the external world. Simultaneously, proprioception is incorporated through what has been called the “Gamma Consideration Sandwich,” where high-frequency gamma waves integrate new sensory data, top-down decisions carried by beta waves, and bodily feedback processed through parvalbumin-positive interneurons in layer five. This feedback loop enables the brain to align motor output with actual muscle position and force, refining action and preserving an embodied sense of self.

When the brain devotes substantial resources to pursuing specific goals or maintaining certain ideas, beta-band activity gains prominence and suppresses incoming signals. However, when new or salient inputs demand revisions to these templates, surges of gamma waves override beta rhythms, shifting attention toward the unexpected information. If muscle tension or limb position does not match the predicted state, these mismatch signals perturb local gamma patterns, prompting recalibration in motor commands or in the underlying internal model. This mechanism ensures that the 3D neural images constructed by neural rendering are continually tested against real-world constraints, allowing the organism to navigate its environment effectively and learn from each moment. By merging neural rendering with the proprioceptive framework of the Gamma Consideration Sandwich, the brain orchestrates coherent, adaptive behavior grounded in a unified perception of both internal goals and external realities.

# 37. Inhibitory Interneurons and Choice-Making

Inhibitory interneurons play a pivotal role in the brain’s decision-making processes by filtering, modulating, and coordinating neural activity. These GABAergic cells help strike a balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals, shaping whether specific pathways will be blocked or reinforced. By controlling such activity at the synaptic, circuit, and large-scale network levels, inhibitory interneurons enable coherent decision-making, as well as the suppression of irrelevant or distracting inputs.

This choice-making process occurs across multiple scales. At the micro level, neurons decide whether or not to fire based on local conditions, including membrane potentials, neurotransmitter concentrations, and ongoing oscillatory states. At the meso level, neural circuits within cortical columns synchronize and select which ensembles of cells will dominate. At the macro level, entire brain regions coordinate their collective activity when evaluating risks, rewards, or other complex inputs. Such coordination becomes evident in phenomena like Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), which can illustrate how local activity scales up to influence large-scale dynamics.

Under the principle that every cell makes a choice, individual neurons accumulate and integrate threshold-based signals that eventually lead them to fire or remain quiescent. This notion forms the backbone of Peter Tse’s criterial causation, in which the detection of coincidences between firing inputs drives the formation of action potentials. Each neuron effectively “reads” and “writes” information patterns, influencing other neurons through the release of neurotransmitters. Although no single neuron can reverse its own choice after it fires, its outputs can reconfigure the firing thresholds and synaptic landscapes of other neurons, creating a network in which information patterns dynamically coalesce and dissolve.

Oscillatory activity further underpins these choice-related dynamics by regulating the timing and amplitude of neural firing. Tonic oscillations set an overall attractor state—akin to a background hum—while shifts in frequency or phase can pivot attention, perception, or memory consolidation. At each iteration, the brain refines how it selects or filters signals, making what appear to be free-willed choices that in fact remain tethered to a deterministic web of synaptic interactions and inherited dispositions.

From this perspective, the sense of agency arises not from a metaphysical freedom but from a continuous updating of threshold-based decisions within a fractal hierarchy of interacting agents. Genes and memes shape the framework of these interactions, while sensory inputs and learning experiences fine-tune the synaptic states that drive behavior. Conscious choice, then, emerges at the intersection of local criteria detection and large-scale oscillatory coherence, with inhibitory interneurons orchestrating which signals prevail. By recalibrating neural thresholds, modulating functional connectivity, and aligning global wave patterns, the brain fine-tunes its internal maps and improves outcomes in successive cycles of perception, memory, and action.

# 38. Four trillion dimensions computed per millisecond.

Tempo-spatial traveling waves, known as phase wave differentials, form the scaffolding of neural patterns and representations in the brain. These waves manifest as dynamic manifolds in cortical columns, shaping computational renderings that extend beyond simple three-dimensional sensory representations. Neural array projection oscillation tomography proposes that the selective phase changes in synapses, along with structural changes to dendrites, allow neurons to filter and respond to specific stimuli over time. Cortical columns communicate through compressed signals embedded in these traveling waves, enabling them to share high-dimensional information without saturating the overall network.

Phase wave differentials essentially function as a form of spectral encoding, capturing spatial details through shifts in the timing and frequency of neural oscillations. Their variations can be decomposed to reveal different frequency components that encode the geometry and interactions of each cortical region with its environment. Small connectivity differences or minimal changes in input timing can shift these spectra in nonlinear ways, allowing subtle yet distinguishable representations to emerge, even when they appear in the same general frequency range.

Neural oscillations—spanning delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands—underlie core cognitive functions. Phase wave differentials help modulate synaptic frequencies across these bands, altering neuronal firing rates in real time. This process acts as a high-dimensional “3D television,” where discrete frequency changes map onto transformations in perception, memory, and cognition. Tonic frequencies maintain the brain in a poised or near-critical state, while fluctuations serve as attractors. Unexpected inputs that perturb these baseline oscillations can result in new perceptual or conceptual patterns, as phase wave differentials carry novel information across spatial and temporal scales.

Traveling waves also create phase wave differentials that reflect how neuronal groups update and convey information. As the brain integrates oscillatory signals, neurons detect correlates of specific stimuli in phase relationships, effectively differentiating various features like color, texture, or shape. When a neuron adjusts its synaptic states to match part of a recognized pattern and subsequently fires, that partial representation is broadcast to other regions. The extent to which the phase wave differential diverges from baseline is proportional to how surprising or novel the incoming signals are, thus highlighting the crucial role of unexpectedness in driving learning and adaptation.

Fractal and hierarchical structures further expand these capacities. The brain shows self-similar motifs across its organizational scales, from synaptic connections to entire cortical networks. Each neuron’s membrane potential and synaptic frequency profile can be treated as a high-dimensional vector, encoding its individual learning history. By transmitting aspects of this vector via phase wave differentials, neurons and columns integrate local experiences into the global framework of brain function. This distributed and dynamic rendering system allows excitatory and inhibitory signals to shape the timing and duration of neural events, producing a complex, high-capacity landscape of information processing.

Extrapolations suggesting that the brain may represent trillions of dimensions of information per millisecond underscore the immense parallelism of its architecture. Although the precise figures remain speculative, the fundamental takeaway is that neurons, dendrites, and synapses, each operating with multiple possible frequency states, create a combinatorial richness that supports elaborate, real-time computations. Phase wave differentials and oscillatory synchronization together illustrate how the brain might maintain and manipulate multidimensional, continuously updating patterns of representation.

# 39. Entification to unite Agents into You!

Entification describes how multiple interdependent agents at different scales synchronize their activity to form a single, unified entity. This unification relies on oscillatory synchrony, where each agent aligns its rhythmic patterns in order to generate coherent, large-scale behavior. In the brain, this process stretches from microscopic molecular events up to entire networks of cortical regions, all of which operate as agents that process information, respond to inputs, and adapt their behavior accordingly. Consciousness and coordinated action emerge when these smaller agents “entify,” coalescing into more complex structures that collectively guide perception, decision-making, and movement.

At the molecular level, proteins and receptors within neurons act as agents by shifting their conformations and regulating ionic exchanges. These dynamic changes allow for continuous refinements of each neuron’s state, ensuring that signals are propagated or inhibited as needed. At the cellular level, neurons, glial cells, and immune cells become agents capable of firing in patterned rhythms and modulating their environment, all while maintaining mutual feedback loops. As these cells synchronize through oscillatory mechanisms, they bind to form functional circuits and networks that handle particular cognitive or physiological tasks.

When viewed from the perspective of neural network arrays, cortical columns, and entire brain regions, agents rely on phase locking and wave differentials to create unified patterns of neural activity. This multi-scale agentic dynamic can be framed as a Nonlinear Continuous Differential Approximation (NDCA), in which each level of organization refines its own viewpoint based on oscillatory feedback and chemical regulation. The fractal nature of this entification emerges because smaller agents repeatedly combine to form larger ones, with each layer mirroring the organization of the layer below. This fractal pattern ensures that the entire brain can align local signals into a coherent global perspective, allowing for fluid behaviors such as riding a bicycle, conversing with others, or planning future actions.

Ultimately, the brain exemplifies a self-organizing ecosystem in which entification binds together myriad mini-conductors, rather than relying on a single conductor to dictate all activity. Small, differential adjustments from each component contribute to a collective and harmonized image of consciousness, unified by reciprocal communication, oscillatory synchrony, and computed properties. In this way, entification offers a framework for understanding how consciousness, memory, and behavior arise naturally from countless distributed interactions, illustrating that the whole brain’s interdependent agents merge into one cohesive agent capable of complex perception and purposeful action.

# 40. Consciousness Correlates

When an animal loses consciousness, the medial prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus are among the last brain regions to exhibit transient shifts in activity. At the same time, pyramidal cells across the cortex cease their usual communication patterns, indicating that robust cross-brain traffic is essential for maintaining consciousness. This traffic, which is often facilitated by gamma waves, appears critical for coordinating the signals necessary for awake, coherent experience.

Gamma oscillations are widely regarded as instrumental in binding together distant brain areas, particularly through the horizontal Layer 2/3 networks in the cortex. By synchronizing their firing patterns, these oscillations integrate sensory, motor, and cognitive processes into a unified perception. Gamma waves coordinate different informational streams, reduce phase mismatches, and foster a coherent and fluid conscious state. They also bridge body states with incoming sensory information, ensuring a dynamically aligned, embodied awareness.

The thalamus plays a key role in this process by acting as a central relay station for both sensory and motor signals. It connects extensively with the hippocampus, allowing exteroceptive and contextual information to converge before reaching the prefrontal cortex for higher-order processing. Through its gating functions, the thalamus can reset local cortical rhythms, reinforcing or dampening specific pathways as needed to maintain coherent neural patterns.

The medial prefrontal cortex is also vital for maintaining consciousness, since it is heavily involved in decision-making, executive control, and integrating feedback from sensory systems. The limbic loop, which runs from subcortical regions to the prefrontal cortex, contributes to critical top-down processes that help shape how we experience and interpret incoming information.

The hippocampus, thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex together constitute a larger network that underlies awareness. The hippocampus projects to the entorhinal cortex, subcortical regions, and the thalamus, while functional connectivity studies confirm that synchronized theta or gamma bursts can improve information exchange between the hippocampus and neocortex. Research also shows that modulating network states in the central lateral thalamus can facilitate learning and adapt behavior, underscoring this network’s importance for consciousness.

The cessation of pyramidal cell communication further illustrates how essential inter-cortical connections are to awareness. These cells in the deeper layers of the cortex extend beyond their individual columns, establishing network-wide links. When that communication lapses, broad integrative processing fails, effectively silencing conscious thought.

When these brain areas and pathways lose their synchronized rhythms, consciousness breaks down. During active tasks, gamma in the default mode network is often muted, while alpha and beta waves can guard ongoing computations by inhibiting irrelevant gamma signals. At the same time, brief surges of gamma can inject fresh information when prediction errors require the brain to revise its expectations. These findings highlight the significance of coordinated activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and pyramidal cells, with gamma wave synchronization playing a central part in sustaining the intricate communication networks necessary for consciousness.

# Explaining the paper

This paper presents an extensive and multifaceted exploration of the “Agentic Brain” and its underlying principles, spanning molecular dynamics to whole-brain networks and even drawing parallels with artificial intelligence. We began by establishing a framework in which individual cells, proteins, and receptors are viewed as autonomous agents whose oscillatory behaviors and feedback loops form the basis for neural computation. I explained how deterministic oscillatory processes—captured through concepts such as Cellular Oscillating Tomography and Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography—allow neurons to encode information via phase, amplitude, and frequency. This foundational idea is used to argue that cognition, consciousness, and memory are not emergent phenomena but instead arise from precise mechanical interactions and wave-based computations that scale from the molecular level to cortical columns.

As the discussion progresses, the conversation outlines how agentic behavior is evident across multiple scales, detailing how local cellular processes aggregate into higher-level neural networks that support functional connectivity and unified perceptual experiences. The text delves into mechanisms such as coincidence detection, phase wave differentials, and Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) to illustrate how neurons, dendrites, and inhibitory interneurons work in concert to achieve synchronization, regulate information flow, and solve the binding problem. It also emphasizes the role of oscillatory rhythms—ranging from slow tonic waves to high-frequency phasic bursts—in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium that underlies both sensory processing and conscious awareness. These interactions are further elaborated by discussing neural rendering and predictive coding as continuous processes that refine the brain’s internal model of reality, ensuring that local oscillatory events integrate into a coherent, global representation.

The latter sections bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence by comparing dendritic activity to high-dimensional vector embeddings and semantic mapping, highlighting how both biological and artificial systems use similar principles to encode, process, and retrieve complex information. The conversation also examines how top-down and bottom-up oscillatory interactions—exemplified by beta, alpha, and gamma waves—mediate decision-making, regulate attention, and guide behavior, ultimately uniting disparate neural elements into a single, cohesive conscious entity. Overall, the arguments converge to present a deterministic model of consciousness that relies on recursive feedback loops, phase synchronization, and agentic dynamics. These principles not only deepen our understanding of biological cognition but also offer promising avenues for developing self-aware artificial systems that mimic the integrative and adaptive properties of the human brain.

In otherwords, the account presented in this paper suggests that the brain’s core essence is fundamentally agentic, with each cell or network functioning as a self-regulating unit whose oscillatory dynamics, phase relationships, and feedback loops give rise to cognition, perception, and consciousness. By examining how local cellular activities scale into complex neural architectures, and by highlighting the pivotal role of gamma, beta, alpha, and other oscillatory interactions, we see that what appears to be an emergent or mysterious quality of the mind may in fact be rooted in precisely coordinated, deterministic wave mechanics. These findings not only deepen our understanding of how thoughts, memories, and awareness arise from wave-based processes but also clarify why multi-scale connectivity—spanning molecules, individual neurons, cortical columns, and entire networks—is so crucial for the fluid, adaptive nature of intelligence. Oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization form a mechanical “binding glue” that unites dispersed signals into coherent perceptual and cognitive states, while inhibitory interneurons and dendritic computations guide the nuances of choice-making and attentional focus. Through these agentic, wave-driven processes, the brain maintains an astonishing capacity to generate a continuously updated internal model of reality, aligning self-organizing molecular events with high-level conscious experience. Recognizing that consciousness can be framed as a deterministic computation—rather than an inexplicable emergent property—provides a unifying principle for both neuroscience and the development of truly adaptive, potentially self-aware AI systems. The Agentic Brain, in essence, illustrates how local oscillatory interactions, reverberating across hierarchical scales, orchestrate the stable-yet-dynamic phenomenon we recognize as the mind.
