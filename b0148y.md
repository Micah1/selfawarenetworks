Representation Prediction Reactions

00:00

Imagine a temporarily and spatially active. Response able representation, right? It's, it's consciousness is not just a rendering in your head, but it's it is rendering that, that responds to reality the response to what you see here and feel and it responds to a yourself, your own muscle movements, your voice movements, your hand movements, your feet movements.

00:47

It's a representation that responds. It is response able and think about the, the work responsibility response ability, you have the ability to respond to something. You are response. Abled and that's that's exactly what we're. It's exactly what it's not. Just an illusion. It's a response able rendering or representation and that's and that is and and you say well is it a driver or is it a just an observer?

01:40

It. We're responds and reacts, okay. So what I'm saying is that, you know, with with any kind of choice that what you have is basically multiple futures being predicted and your mind predicted independent. Like, I'm imagining that I could go to two different places. Right now, one of them being south end growing club.

02:15

Or I could go to the grocery store. I can't, I just came from the grocery store where I could go to my gym or if I could go to the south end. And then my gym, each of these different things that I mentioned is a prediction. That was a, it's a prediction.

02:31

It's like a sequence of steps that I am imagining or rendering in a sense computationally rendering and imaginary path, that I imaginary pass that I could take. I could take multiple difference in past and, you know, so you get to this point where there's multiple different paths and you say, okay, now I'm going to choose one path or another.

03:01

All I'm arguing. Is that in a sense? You know, I my my mind is is set up in such a way that I am reacting to whatever I think is has the best path, just pass it. Fist my criteria that matches. My my criteria is my list of arguments, my reasoning, my reasons for why I would do this for that.

03:38

And say, well, okay, well, maybe I'm gonna choose to skip the rowing club because I have a reason today to not go there first, and I want to go to the Denver. So I want to go to temperature something at the gym that I want to use today, and let's see.

03:58

And so what I'm saying when I'm into is that that my choice is it's essentially a of reaction to a predict to prediction. It's a reaction to a rendered prediction. And so, where I'm at right now is rendered predictions where I can go. Next is a is the series of rendered predictions and the in the render prediction that and that that might that I'm selecting.

04:43

You can call it a choice. The cheaper from another pointer perspective. You could call it. A reaction, a response. You call it a response, right? Well, would you like chocolate cake right now? Which is like a glass of orange juice or both and maybe you pick one maybe pick the other and maybe you pick both, or maybe you pick none.

05:12

But you can call those things choices. You can call those things responses. You can call those things reactions and and I'm calling them reactions and what your reaction, what you reacting to or what's reacting, what is what what's happening is that? There's there's a prediction rendering of of where you are now and where you could go next.

05:49

And there's a there's a series of reactions between, you know, going to point eight point eight from where you are to where you're going next, you're gonna go from point A to point B to my C but it is reactions and it is the point is these are the the collection of all the data points in each rendering is like this like okay we'll set, you know, maybe you are.

06:23

What is the modalities that that your picturing in the context of? Like, let's see past in front of myself right now or something. My my mind is rendering, it's rendering what my eyes are shape, right? But I'm also, but I also imagine. Okay, well, imagine the gym. And for me, there's a visual representation where I imagine exam and maybe I think about the words, the letters GYM, but there's the representation and there's been, there's this link.

07:02

There's a swing between two representations and, you know, maybe the representations are calculated in different different areas. Maybe the, the word Jim is represent is being represented in the auditory context in the and and where I am now is represented and the visual cortex and there's an intern, neuron or intern neurons that are linking together.

07:32

These two different areas in coordinating activities. So that that also influenced my muscle movement, as to, where where my, you know, how my legs are gonna move, and where they're gonna take me and service, like I'm like, describing what what happens is for human being and mechanical terms. So like this is like, you know, if we can create a robot that does this, it basically renders where it is now, the rand is where it wants to go and rivers are packed and in what I'm saying, what I'm saying with rendering, you know, the term,

08:16

Subscribe to a computer that is.

08:25

Taking implants and putting together a 3D model on a that you had a human being, would perceive from the screen. It's basically rendering is is here in the computer generating, a 2D or 3D image front and it's a sequence of ones and zeros that have been engineered to fire off on a, on a street.

08:53

But more than that it is the rendering is the service programmer for hat, for how the rendering is the process of rendering is the instructions that lead to the image that you're proceeding at the moment, right? And so we're going to visual concept for three, but right, it's it's it's in terms of like taking something, what we need is a sort of concept for taking something that is what is in zeros and at the root but transforming those ones and zeros into up into a a pattern that's far from one to six like a square or a cube that you see on a screen.

09:57

Okay. The reason why this concept of rendering is important not just for visual stuff but for describing what you know, audio stuff is because you're and what touches touch is not. It's not necessarily something that you're going to see. Although I guess you could have a visual representation of touch as well or you have visual representation audio, you have user representations of electromagnetism.

10:28

I've and but but these things are Now we've touched the checking and stuff in the audio system. But it's still that something that your brain is sort of receiving piecemeal, like you're getting a lot of tiny impressions tiny impressions that the networks of your brain are putting together into larger impressions, right?

10:57

It's it's that that's exactly what a neural network does is. It takes a lot of tiny impressions and it it's figures out how they are related to one another how you know all of these. How all of these got that are on and all of these thoughts that are off and some higher level of recognition, there's a line that's recognized and the line could be a part of the letter, A, or it could be an edge or could be the perception of alignment, distinguishes.

11:37

The difference between one object and the next could be and And neuron is a multimodal, 3D neural network. And So I see. So, okay, so we're gonna have so okay, pause
