The flow of information in the brain was an audio recording in which I was trying to ascertain how information flowed after leaving the thalamus, how the visual cortex sent information to other parts of the neo cortex, what routes signals traveled, this led to the idea of neural arrays, edge communities as layers in a 3D neural network, with local rendering, and magnification of memories from representations as synaptic connections, recognized by downstream arrays, or downstream cortical colums, and the binding of detected features across the brain via brainwave synchronization which is enabling the entification, or the hallucination of rendered features, but as I considered it further I realized this was like the sketch of consciousness, a tree without details, then I began to imagine how the synchronization of brainwave activity was actually occuring in 3 dimensions, in a six-dof axis from each cortical area, so my tree of consciousness when from something like a 3D graph network with screens at each interval, to a tree with leaves, bark, roots, and abundant details, in that now I could see how every adjacent or nearby cell, every local cluster of nuclei that was close enough to receive signals was part of the 3D entification process, so that the virtualized mental renderings can literally flow through the brain like water. Where you point your head, it's like the volume of space you see is represented in the volume of your brain tissue in some way, and when you turn your head you are changing the rendering in the brain tissue, and all your sense of space, light, color, sound, feelings are volumetric renderings that are changes in the phase (frequency) in space, a difference in the frequency pattern at some location in your brain.

So with the first model I described, one that starts out like a 3D graph neural network, the brain has organized flows of information in 6 directions, up down left right forward and back, for every cortical column, and to a lessor extent for every cell.

However there is an organized structure, there is a path from the sensory organs, eyes, ears, nose, touch, and taste, along nerves, to the thalamus & neo cortex, and then intersecting flows from the bottom of cortical columns to the top to the pyramidal cells back to the thalamus, and simultaneously from the thalamus to the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex

there are organized flows

but then there are brainwaves which escape the known boundaries, electric & magnetic brainwaves with their own distinct organized patterns, their detectable 3D formulations, there are also vibration or mechanical waves in the brain, there are heat waves, blood flow patterns, pressures, and all of this is activity that neurons can detect,

the TMS-EEG experiments helped to illustrate that brainwave activity electromagnetic brainwave activity can be shot around the mass of brain cells, it can flow, it ricochet, like water in a fishbowl, with water being the electromagnetic & sonic brainwave activity, and the fishbowl being the mass of cells making up the brain.

The organized flow of data in the brain is set up perfectly to adjust to and recognizes these changes in global brainwave activity flows, each section of the brain will detect changes to the firing rates that are resulting from oscillatory timing changes in response to brainwave activity, and eventually the brain is going to put together mental imagery of that flow, it is probably what emotions & feelings are made out of, the detection of large scale brain activity changes.

You say well a Rasberry Pi does not have the same hardware as the brain so how could it do emotions, well that is where WebXR & game engines come in. You see if we can simulate a 3D point cloud, or create a fluid dynamics simulation, and map the simulation of brain activity to the corresponding points in space representing the locations of our artificial neurons, then we can correctly simulate what happens in the human brain to make emotions, virtually, and since representations in the human brain are virtual or location invariant anyways, it won't make a difference.
