What if every mass is a time crystal?

The idea is that mass isn't curving the geometry of space, it's increasing the density of time in the area around mass. At a large scale we experience this as gravity, the curvature of paths in space, and effects like time dilation. At the quantum scale what is happening is that space is updating more frequently in areas near mass, and this creates the gravitational interaction, instead of a gravitational force, it is changing the odds that a particle will move towards mass. As the additional density of time, is at the quantum scale the same as an additional area of space, it is warped space in time.

In the second article I note that we can test this by attempting to use this theory, and the equations derived from this theory to make more precise predictions for how light bends with Gravitational Lensing. General Relativity is not very precise when it comes to predicting how light bends, and ideally this theory will help improve our understanding of Light bending under the effects of Gravitational Lensing with new degrees of precision.

To explain in more detail I have included a long article about it, two long articles, both of the articles contain equations, the first article has some drawings. I will answer all serious questions about this theory. Please be a nice person though if you wish to have real dialog.
