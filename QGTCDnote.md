What if every mass is a time crystal?

The idea is that mass isn't curving the geometry of space, it's increasing the density of time in the area around mass. At a large scale we experience this as gravity, the curvature of paths in space, and affects like time dilation. At the quantum scale what is happening is that space is updating more frequently in areas near mass, and this creates the gravitational interaction, instead of a gravitational force, it is changing the odds that a particle will move towards mass. As the additional density of time, is at the quantum scale the same as an additional area of space, it is warped space in time.

To explain in more detail I have included a long article about it, two long articles, both of the articles contain equations, the first article has some drawings. I will answer all serious questions about this theory. Please be a nice person though if you wish to have real dialog.

First article:
New Unified Field Theory: Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation: explains quantum mass as a time crystal dilating time at quantum scale & making gravity by increasing time frames. https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-unified-field-theory-called 

A second long article exists that was posted to the group earlier, but since this article was originally deleted for having a description that was too short I decided to write a longer description to explain more what it is, and include a link to the second article as well so you can read a ton of information that was written about this theory if you are so interested.

Second article:  
Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation breaks the assumption that gravity equals metric curvature alone.
