(category, theory, field,, tomography, vector, fourier) Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations

Introducting the Fourier Neural Operator: They made neural networks more efficient at solving partial differential equations. It learns to map function spaces the result is a neural network that is more finely grained in its learning resolution compared to mapping vector spaces (the x, y, and z)

"AI has cracked a key mathematical puzzle for understanding our world"

The human brains 3D tempo-spatial phase-field learning neural network is likely also learning resolution invariant & scale invariant patterns, that map not just topological vector spaces but also map functions.

When I think about mapping functions I also think of category theory, A -> B is a map of how A transforms into B, the function is the isomorphic operation between A and B that transforms one into the other.

What a fourier neural operator can help solve is in transforming the function or the arrow between the transforms into a sparse representation, a neural network can find the sparsest representation that is the isomorphic function equivalent of what was observed.
