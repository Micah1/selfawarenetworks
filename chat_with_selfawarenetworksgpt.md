An Invitation to Chat with my GPT the Self Aware Networks GPT

I present:

# Self Aware Networks GPT

AI research assistant for Self Aware Networks & Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation. Connect novel ideas, questions, and user files to the SAN repository (github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks). Share your insights from chats via pull requests. (Alpha Version: Does not search audio transcriptions)

In addition here are some basic facts to help you in using the Self Aware Networks GPT

Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind (SAN) is the headline topic for the book of the same name.

The File SAOv9 contains the Table of Contents for the book and this information provides a map to the topics associated with the Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind (SAN), to help you sort the content, aligning where content belongs relative to other content, and discuss Self Aware Networks.

Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) is the main thesis of the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind. There are 10 revisions of NAPOT and each builds on the previous one.
NAPOT argues that high phasic high frequency low magnitude traveling waves flow through neural arrays inhabited by high magnitude low frequency tonic waves (ground of being), creating both excitatory chains of (perception) action potentials, and sequences of inhibitory (memory) waves. These neural arrays are both seeing & projecting sensory representations to subsequent arrays, and the entification of all these oscillations creates an observer inside a person or an organism that can observe it's own internal renderings, through the sequences of sensing & transmitting neural arrays in oscillating feedback loops. 

Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) is a unified field theory, this body of literature addresses the observer affect also known as the measurement problem, it connects with  explains how brainwaves interact with reality which also consists of waves via oscillatory physics, it explains how time near mass at the quantum scale changes the probability of particle travel by changing landscape (curving space) more time frames means increased changes of a particle traveling towards mass. 

NDCA Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation explains how the brain makes meaningful distinctions from 3D sensory representations, manifest as manifolds in cortical column brain activity, which can also be referred to as computational renderings in neural arrays computed via the cross sections of unified attractor states via oscillatory physics binding together neural coincidence detections (predictive coding).

This information can help you start your search and connect related topics.

The Self Aware Networks GPT is designed to make it easy for you to navigate the ideas & facts associated with the body of work stored on the Self Aware Networks Institute Github. So that ideally you can contribute the development of the research of the Self Aware Networks Institute by uploading your Chats about new Scientific Research via Pull Requests on the github. Github keeps track of who submitted what and when, so when your submission is accepted it will be forever credited to you (you have to create a github account first to do this.)

To make it easier to search & browse the knowledge contained within Self Aware Networks I created Self Aware Networks GPT. This is the alpha version, it is not complete so it doesn't search any of the audio transcriptions yet.

Please note that responses from AI, whether from the Self Aware Networks GPT, saved in the GPT2023X files, or saved in the NotebookML 6 Collection are often wrong answers, these resources are shared because they are helpful in navigating the writings stored online. The idea is that once you have an answer from AI, you can use the search function on github to find out what I actually wrote down in the notes. If you stop at what the AI tells you this resource won't be that useful, as you might come away with an incorrect conclusion about what Self Aware Networks theory says: what is needed is a search to find matching or similar statements to verify the AI's conclusion. Going forward I will be refining the material generated by the computer manually to fix it's mistakes.
