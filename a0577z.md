What do you think Ben? Is this a plausible form of real intelligence at work?
How Trees Communicate (Video) - Waking Times : Waking Times

Researchers at the University of British Columbia are concluding that trees are interacting with one another in a symbiotic relationship that helps the trees to survive. Connected by fungi, the underground root systems of plants and trees are transferring carbon and nitrogen back and forth between ...

Sounds like a buncha goddam hippie crap to me.
Seriously, though, I've found these studies fascinating since I first found out about them. They're definitely thought-provoking.
I think the question really depends on the definition of "communication." Cells in a sponge or slime mold communicate with one another in an organized fashion. By the same token, you could argue (and some have) that ant colonies and beehives are actually meta-organisms whose individual members correspond to the neurons in a brain. But no one (as far as I know) is going around saying these organisms and meta-organisms have anything like a true CNS. 
I think the main distinguishing factor between those informational architectures and, say, a vertebrate brain is that their communication patterns are emergent and bottom-up; there's no corresponding network of inhibitory connections that interfaces with the bottom-up network and imposes order on it in any centralized way. Another major point is that these networks lack the kind of fractal symmetry that's very obvious in functional nodal architectures even in the nervous systems of simple organisms like C. elegans.
I'm not ruling out the possibility that these fungal networks could have evolved built-in checks for factors like stimulus salience, etc. - but I'd say calling it "consciousness" is reaaallly stretching it. Especially since we still don't have a precise scientific definition for "consciousness."

"corresponding network of inhibitory connections that interfaces with the bottom-up network and imposes order on it in any centralized way" this was very interesting, I hadn't thought of my inhibitions as imposing order in a centralized way, in fact I usually think of my neural patterns as packs of wrestling dogs competing for dominance by inhibiting their neighbors until only one pattern reigns supreme, sort of like a three dimensional game of GO. Much mor chaotic than a centralized imposition of order.

"Packs of wrestling dogs" is, on the whole, not a bad analogy for the experience of being conscious. I didn't mean your personal inhibitions, though; I meant the networks of inhibitory neural connections that impose order on the excitatory connections in other parts of a certain functional network, helping shape activity in a goal-directed fashion - for example, the inhibitory cortico-thalamic connections we find in thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits.

our life experiences shape the strengths of different pathways in the neo cortex resulting in a modeling of sensory input and the significant links between what we sense and favorable outcomes, resulting in a consciousness that can be reduced in its function to a memory based prediction resulting in the coordination of our whole structure.

yes, that's true...i'm not clear on what exactly that has to do with inhibitory/excitatory synaptic connections, though.

When I said my inhibitions I actually meant what you meant, the inhibitory neurons in the neocortex that regulate impulses from the lower brain structures, in addition nearby neurons, carving out a highly complex neural path that generates highly complex thought, and coordination.

OK, I think I understand what you're saying now - neither inhibitory nor excitatory activity is more centralized than the other; it's the tension between the two that emergently generates complex thought. Yeah?

When you were giving your speech at TEDx I remember thinking that your dark continent analogy was really cool, but if we magnified the brain so that a neuron was the size of a star we would be talking about something that is bigger and more complex than the milkyway galaxy. I think that yes there is back and forth excitation and inhibition between the lower structures and the higher structures, but vastly more so whats interesting in the development of neural patterns is taking place almost entirely within the neocortex, yes shaped to a small and not insignificant extent by interacts with the lower structures, but you could say that most of the experience of being human is taking place in the very top of the human brain. Its mostly about the competition between energy surging through rival pathways strengthened or weakened by life experience in the neo cortex.
