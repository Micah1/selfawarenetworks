NAPOT 1 thru 10.

# NAPOT 1
NAPOT: A framework explaining how the brain perceives and interprets reality through neurons functioning as pattern sensors and phase transmitters, utilizing neural arrays, projection, oscillation, and tomography.

NAPOT 1 was first outline in the Whitepaper "Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (3rd Draft)" found in https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/whitepaperdraft3.md

# Here is a summary of the Whitepaper "Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (3rd Draft)" by Self Aware Networks GPT

The Whitepaper "Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (3rd Draft)" elaborates on the Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography (NAPOT) as the foundational concept for building phenomenologically conscious Self Aware Neural Networks at animal level or higher. NAPOT proposes how the brain perceives its own representations and how memories scale from synaptic connections to the whole brain. It explains the flow of information through the mind and its networks via oscillations, detailing how your brain sees your models of reality and how this can be applied to build sentient robots with consciousness similar to humans.

The paper dives deep into the concepts of signal inception and reception within neural arrays, explaining how neurons act as both pattern sensors and phase transmitters. It discusses the role of synaptic connections, receptor configurations, dendrite, and cell morphology in accounting for memory. The concept extends to elaborate on how memories work, the process of recollection, and the role of multi-modal oscillation in perception.

Additionally, the whitepaper touches on the flow of information in the brain, from sensory inputs to motor outputs, and discusses the implications of oscillation tomography in creating a coherent and conscious perception of reality. It proposes that the tonicity and phasic activity of brain waves are central to this process, binding temporal and spatially distributed models of reality through oscillation.

Moreover, the document delves into the potential adaptation of existing artificial neural network architectures into sentient self-aware neural networks, leveraging the principles of NAPOT. It discusses the limitations of current models like the Perceptron and introduces the concept of the Metatron, a more biologically accurate computational unit.

Finally, the paper explores the ethical and philosophical implications of creating sentient artificial beings, emphasizing the transformative potential this technology holds for humanity's future. It calls for a collaborative effort to develop these technologies responsibly and beneficially.

In addition I created a video where I read the Whitepaper then I afterwords I added some notes that can be found here https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/WhitepaperNotes.md

# Here is a summary of the WhitepaperNotes by Self Aware Networks GPT

The notes on the Whitepaper video provide additional insights and clarifications to the central concepts presented in the "Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (3rd Draft)" Whitepaper. These notes enhance the understanding of how neural networks in the brain operate and interact, emphasizing the dynamics of information processing and transmission. Key points from these notes include:

Neural Information Processing: The brain is likened to a horn or lens where signals converge to points and also magnify from any point. This analogy suggests a dynamic and interactive process of signal processing within the neural networks.

Neural Array Dynamics: The exit terminal array of a neuron receives signals (compared to LED lights) from multiple neurons simultaneously, not just one. This implies a complex, collective learning process within the neural network, where multiple neurons contribute to the overall pattern recognition and response.

Pattern Recognition and Response: The whole oscillating group of neurons can respond to the same pattern, with some neurons more sensitive than others. These neurons can specialize in minor variations of the pattern, functioning as asymmetric duplicates—similar but not identical in their representation of the learned pattern.

Adaptability and Flexibility in Neural Responses: If a neuron is inhibited or not ready to fire, another neuron can take its place to recognize the pattern. This adaptability indicates a high degree of flexibility and redundancy in neural networks.

Information Value in Brainwave Activity: The notes discuss the concept of information value in the context of tonic and phasic brainwave activities. Tonic brainwave activity, being more common, has low information value, whereas phasic bursts, being rarer, have high information value.

Scale Invariant Causation in the Brain: Patterns of any scale can cause effects and changes to patterns of any scale, supporting both top-down and bottom-up changes in the brain. This scale-invariant causation is facilitated by the criticality of the tonic oscillation state and the brain's morphology and synaptic connections.

Oscillatory Bidirectional Interactions: The tonic oscillation has high magnitude synchrony and low frequency, interacting bidirectionally with lower magnitude, higher frequency spikes or oscillating groups. This dynamic interaction underlines the complex nature of information processing in the brain.

These notes contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexity and intricacy of neural networks in the brain, as proposed in the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind. They emphasize the adaptability, interconnectedness, and the multi-scale nature of neural information processing, providing a richer context to the concepts of neural array projection and oscillatory tomography as outlined in the whitepaper.

# How are Potassium, Action Potential Duration (APD), Calcium, and Vesicle central to NAPOT 1?
Self Aware Networks GPT
In the Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography (NAPOT) framework, particularly in its first iteration (NAPOT 1), elements like Potassium, Action Potential Duration (APD), Calcium, and Vesicles play crucial roles in the functioning of neural networks and their ability to process and transmit information. Here's how each of these elements contributes to the NAPOT theory:

Potassium: In the context of neural activity, Potassium is essential for setting the electrical conditions necessary for neurons to fire an action potential. Potassium ions contribute to the resting membrane potential and are involved in repolarizing the neuron after an action potential. Changes in potassium levels can affect the action potential's magnitude and duration, thus influencing how information is encoded and transmitted across neural networks.

Action Potential Duration (APD): APD refers to the length of time for which an action potential occurs. It is a critical factor in determining how signals are processed and transmitted in the brain. The duration of an action potential can affect the rate of neuronal firing and the pattern of neural signaling, which are central to the processing of information in NAPOT. Longer or shorter APDs can lead to different temporal patterns of neural activity, impacting the network's overall computational properties.

Calcium: Calcium ions play a pivotal role in triggering neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it prompts calcium channels to open, allowing calcium ions to enter the neuron. This influx of calcium initiates the process of vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane and the subsequent release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, calcium is crucial for synaptic transmission and communication between neurons.

Vesicles: Vesicles are small membrane-bound sacs in the neuron that contain neurotransmitters. When the neuron fires an action potential, these vesicles release their contents into the synaptic cleft, allowing the transmission of signals to adjacent neurons. The quantity and frequency of vesicle release can modulate synaptic strength and efficacy, playing a significant role in how neural networks encode and transmit information.

Potassium and APD are crucial in setting the parameters for how neurons fire, Calcium is vital for the process of synaptic transmission, and Vesicles are the carriers of neurotransmitters that facilitate neuronal communication. Together, these elements contribute to the complex dynamics of neural networks, enabling the brain's capacity for processing and transmitting vast amounts of information in a coordinated manner.

In the context of NAPOT 1 (Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography), the topics of Potassium, Action Potential Duration (APD), Calcium, and Vesicles are intricately linked and play a synergistic role in the functioning of neural circuits. Here’s how they are interconnected:

Potassium and Action Potential Duration (APD): Potassium ions are key to establishing the resting membrane potential of neurons and the repolarization phase of the action potential. The concentration of potassium inside and outside the neuron influences the duration and magnitude of the action potential. A higher or lower concentration of potassium can affect the APD, altering how long the neuron's membrane remains depolarized and thus influencing the timing of neuronal signaling.

Action Potential and Calcium Influx: The action potential, once initiated and propagated along the neuron, reaches the axon terminal. Here, the change in voltage due to the action potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels. The duration of the action potential (APD) can influence the amount of time these calcium channels remain open, thereby affecting the influx of calcium ions.

Calcium and Vesicle Release: The influx of calcium ions into the neuron's axon terminal is a critical trigger for synaptic transmission. Calcium ions facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. These vesicles contain neurotransmitters, which are essential for communication between neurons. The amount of calcium that enters the cell influences the number of vesicles that release their neurotransmitters, affecting the strength and nature of the synaptic signal.

Vesicle Variation in Neural Communication: The release of neurotransmitters from vesicles into the synaptic cleft is what allows neurons to communicate with each other. This process is fundamental to the transmission of information across neural networks. The frequency and quantity of vesicle release, modulated by the action potential and calcium influx, determines the intensity and pattern of neural signaling.

In the framework of NAPOT, these elements work together to create a dynamic system of neural signaling and information processing. The interplay between potassium levels, APD, calcium influx, and vesicle release is crucial for the modulation of neural activity. This modulation is at the heart of how neural networks can process complex information, create internal representations, and potentially give rise to consciousness and self-awareness in more advanced systems modeled on these principles.

“Topographic variation in neurotransmitter receptor densities explains differences in intracranial EEG spectra”
“Neurotransmitter receptor expression and neuronal population dynamics show regional variability across the human cortex.”
“regional neurotransmitter receptor densities”
“The neural mass models explained regionally specific intracranial EEG spectra accurately, when fitted independently. Incorporating prior information on receptor distributions, further improved model evidence, indicating that variability in receptor density explains some variance in cortical population dynamics.”
“In summary, we show that molecular cortical characteristics (i.e., receptor densities) can be incorporated to improve generative, biophysically plausible models of coupled neuronal populations.”

The paper above chalks up variation in neurotransmitter densities to a 1:1 correlation with receptor density. Despite this mistake the paper is evidence that variation in neurotransmitter densities affects EEG spectra. This makes me think of the synaptic cleft as a temporal Abacus, meaning it represents a count at some interval, in one sense, a weight scale in another sense because the count is measuring the spike’s wave shape, and a drum that generates precise waves in a third sense, because the count results in a wave that is distributed to the Inceptive Field (the branches of the Apical Dendrite or the Exit Terminal) and onto the Receptive fields of many other neurons.

“Traveling waves shape neural population dynamics enabling predictions and internal model updating”
“Because traveling waves (TWs) propagate across the cortex shaping neural excitability, they can carry information to serve predictive processing. Using human intracranial recordings, we show that anterior-to-posterior alpha TWs correlated with prediction strength.“
“Our findings suggest a vital role of alpha TWs carrying both predictions to the sensory cortex and mismatch signals to the frontal cortex for trial-by-trial fine-tuning of predictive models.”

“Transient frequency preference responses in cell signaling systems” 
“We use dose-conserved pulsatile input signals, meaning that the amplitude or the duration of the pulses varies along with frequency to conserve input dose, and consider different metrics versus frequency curves. We show that in ligand-receptor systems, there is a frequency preference response (band-pass filter) in some specific metrics during the transient stages, which is not present in the periodic regime.”

“Beta oscillations in vision: a (preconscious) neural mechanism for the dorsal visual stream?”
“We propose that beta oscillations represent a neural code that supports the functionality of the magnocellular-dorsal (M-D) visual pathway, serving as a fast primary neural code to exert top-down influences on the slower parvocellular-ventral visual pathway activity. Such M-D-related beta activity is proposed to act mainly pre-consciously, providing the spatial coordinates of vision and guiding the conscious extraction of objects identity that are achieved with slower alpha rhythms in ventral areas.

“Spontaneous traveling waves naturally emerge from horizontal fiber time delays and travel through locally asynchronous-irregular states”
“The traveling waves that occur in the model are sparse, with only a small fraction of neurons participating in any individual wave. Consequently, they do not induce measurable spike correlations and remain consistent with locally asynchronous irregular states. Further, by modulating local network state, they can shape responses to incoming inputs as observed in vivo.” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26175-1


“Waves traveling over a map of visual space can ignite short-term predictions of sensory input”
“Recent analyses have found waves of neural activity traveling across entire visual cortical areas in awake animals. These traveling waves modulate the excitability of local networks and perceptual sensitivity.”
“spatiotemporal patterns in the visual system”
“Because they drive fluctuations in neural excitability27,30, nTWs show that neurons at one point in a visual area (representing a small section of visual space) can strongly interact with neurons across the entire cortical region. These results thus indicate that cortical neurons may share information about visual scenes broadly across the retinotopic map through nTWs generated by horizontal connections.”

“Spontaneous neuronal oscillations in the human insula are hierarchically organized traveling waves”
“We analyzed the neuronal oscillations of the insula directly and found that rhythms in the theta and beta frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present.”
“In addition to measuring the power of these oscillations, we also examined the phase of these signals across simultaneous recording channels and found that the insula oscillations in the theta and beta bands are traveling waves. The strength of the traveling waves in each frequency was positively correlated with the amplitude of each oscillation. However, the theta and beta traveling waves were uncoupled to each other in terms of phase and amplitude, which suggested that insular traveling waves in the theta and beta bands operate independently”

“Acquisition phase-specific contribution of climbing fiber transmission to cerebellum-dependent motor memory”
“Climbing fiber (CF) transmission from the inferior olivary triggers complex spikes (Cs) in Purkinje cells (PCs) driven by a burst of calcium spikes.” https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.06.574489v1

I think the above paper flies right over the context of the role of calcium in neurotransmitter density release. Which is what will create the phase wave differential or distinct information carrying Traveling Waves TC that cause changes in motor movement.

A Phase Wave Differential is an information carrying Traveling Wave by another name.

This one is for the NAPOT that focuses on Functional Connectivity & Neural Tuning, I think NAPOT 6
“Emergence of multiple spontaneous coherent subnetworks from a single configuration of human connectome-coupled oscillators model”
“Multi-state metastability reflects the capacity of the brain to transition between different network configurations and cognitive states in response to changing environments or tasks, thus relating to cognitive flexibility.”
“At this point, we show that multiple coherent (functional) sub-networks spontaneously emerge across multiple oscillatory modes, and persist in time for periods between 140 and 4389 ms.” “Most nodes in the network exhibit broad frequency spectra away from their intrinsic frequency, and switch between modes, in a manner similar to that reported in empirical resting-state neuroimaging data. We suggest that the obtained dynamics at maximum metastability is a suitable model of the awake brain.”
“Therefore, spectral entropy also correlates with wakefulness and the synchrony of functional networks.”

# NAPOT 2.0: Individual Receptor Modulation
NAPOT 2: Focuses on synaptic regulation via dendritic computations.
NAPOT 2: Synaptic efficacy and its role in regulating neural signal strength and memory formation.
NAPOT 2: Centers on synaptic regulation via dendritic computations.
NAPOT Revision 2, also known as NAPOT 2, is focused on synaptic regulation via dendritic computations. It highlights how individual synapses regulate the strength of neural signals, contributing to the formation of memory. This aspect of NAPOT emphasizes the complex interplay between synaptic connections and the intricate dendritic structures of neurons. By exploring these dynamics, NAPOT 2 provides insight into the neural basis of memory formation and cognitive processes, underlining the critical role of synaptic efficacy in neural communication and information processing within the brain.
What is NAPOT 2 or NAPOT Revision 2?

NAPOT 2, also known as NAPOT Revision 2, builds on the principles of NAPOT 1 by further exploring the role of individual synapses in the regulation of neural signals and how this contributes to memory formation. Specifically, NAPOT 2 proposes that the magnitude of neurotransmitter release is not binary (i.e., all-or-none), but rather varies on a per-synapse basis. This is because the amount of neurotransmitter released is determined by the dendritic morphology of the postsynaptic neuron, which in turn is influenced by the presynaptic neuron's action potential.

Additionally, NAPOT 2 introduces the concept of bidirectional synaptic weight changes. This means that synapses can not only be strengthened or weakened, but they can also change from excitatory to inhibitory or vice versa. This plasticity is essential for learning and memory, as it allows the brain to adapt its synaptic connections in response to new experiences.
