There is a medical definition of consciousness that I think is a little bit vague. I will talk about this. I think Max (I forget who Max is) was saying that there's like 12 different ways to describe consciousness.

I think you can ask does consciousness have to involve self-awareness?

It's surprising to me some people think that you can have like sort of like consciousness or maybe just perception and doesn't include self-awareness and that's interesting.

If you ask Jeff Hawkins, he thinks that machines (like computers) can be conscious (with the right software & sensor/transmitter configuration, and I agree.)

His idea is a little bit different from mine in that he thinks that if you basically just replicate the important functions of the neocortex digitally, the computer will be able to conscious without emotions, without a will that has desires to accomplish its own goals. Artificial consciousness that has no agenda.

There's a lot say on this topic. A lot to unpack around it.

I can say that basically I think that it basically comes down to

01:55

internal representations.

I think that an internal representation or qualia or like let's say if you are inside a room, or if you're inside a building and you're seeing the floor, you're seeing doors, the ground, the sky, or the roof.

And all the things you're seeing, hearing, and feeling, all of your sensations are volumetric representations.

The environment & the objects around you are representations or renderings in a computer sense of 3D graphics.

Think of a video games, virtual reality, and volumetric video. They are 3D representations, they're four dimensional representations, because there's an element of time, that would be the fourth dimension right? So what I'm saying is every emotion, feeling, concept and perception is a four dimensional entity, every feeling is four dimensional or a pattern that has spatial and temporal properties.

A feeling has an onset then it goes. It comes on, there is a peak, and there is a sense of where it is, how great this feeling is, is it big, is it small, is it overwhelming, is it in my chest, my heart, my head, where is it. Our concept of how the feeling feels usually includes references to topological (spatial) distributions, and references to temporal quantities, like how long did I feel that feeling, how impactful was that feeling, it's in the past, it's behind me now. I feel it coming on again. I feel it all over. I only feel it in my finger. It's like a fast or slow or hard or soft feeling.

Smell is four dimensional also. When did I smell it, what were the characteristics of the perfume.

Describe the texture, taste, feel of the wine, and the aroma. How did it come together in your senses?

Notice the properties of just about any sensation, thought, feeling, emotion, smell, or taste are analogies of patterns in time and space.

Even when it comes to heat there a temporal dimension to describe and a spatial or topological dimension to feeling heat.

There's a moment when something feels a certain way, and then later that same something feels a little bit less or different somehow.

I think the temporal-spatial concept is true for all our sense, concepts, emotions, feelings, tastes, smells, sounds, sights, for everything that we understand and can relate to one another.

There's a point when you smell something.

When it's strong that's the peak, when you walk away the smell decreases with distance, that's the spatial & temporal pattern changing in your brain as you walk away from a smell.

Think about the richness of coffee?

If you really put the coffee up to your nose, some 4 dimensional olfactory pattern is activating in your brain. Imagine you are smelling a flower, but think about spatial dimension of that smell, how it's spatially different from the coffee smell. Spatially & temporally different as you smell it over time.

Understanding all your thoughts as being in a four dimensional analogy is a little bit abstract to think about but you can thinking about it. It's always there for you to think about.
