# How to make Dog level Sentient Self Aware Neural Networks

How to control the range of plausible behaviors that sentient & self aware neural networks might exhibit can come from the study of the differences between cognitive abilities for different species. 

We need to get ready for the real world deployment of smart sentient & self aware robots. They don't have to be as smart as human beings. Imagine a giant dog, that is really great at helping with construction work. Building homes? Sentient robots don't have to be human level.

We can apply the concept of evolutionary algorithms to the concept of a virtual robot in a virtual environment to learn what kinds of neural network structures make dog like behaviors, cat like behaviors, snail like behaviors and so on.

The morphology & the transmitter types are key to function behavior that emerges naturally from such systems,

Then we need to stress test each of the iterations (of neural network configurations inside robots in the simulator) so that we can understand how they react to novel or bizarre situations, and figure out a sort of novelty response training program so that they are well trained to handle new situations as they come up.

Essentially we are going to apply the concept of evolutionary algorithms to a robot simulator, for example Nvidia's Isaac Robot Simulation program, create a thousand iterations of the robot, have them sort of randomly experiment with performing a task, score the best robot, delete the rest, copy the best robot to create 1000 total robots in the simulation, run it again, repeat the process so that the robot evolves with a combination of something analogous to random mutation + natural selection. 

One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

Research that maps the morphology + transmitter types to the cell & organisms behaviors or function is one part of accomplishing this, the research on AI protein folding is an example of part of the work we need to accomplish

"We have trained ESMFold to predict full atomic protein structure directly from language model representations of a single sequence. Accuracy is competitive with AlphaFold on most proteins with order of magnitude faster inference. By @MetaAI Protein Team."

The other part is using computer simulations to evolve & test different cell types & cell property types in simulation as described above in the robot simulator. Essentially decoding biological functions through computational simulations.

Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.

"rhythm. By contrast, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the loss of Ih minimally affected breathing frequency, but destabilized rhythmogenesis through the generation of incompletely synchronized bursts (burstlets)."

When you finally come across a word in neuroscience that you didn't know existed, and you didn't know you were looking for it, but it just happens to most important fucking word in the entire stack of words for your novel new theory of brain function. What a funny day.

Evaluating the Burstlet Theory of Inspiratory Rhythm and Pattern Generation
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964920/

The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the information theory of cognition is because of that key finding

Key paper in history: 1974 "Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor" D H Hubel, T N Wiesel 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4436457/

Essentially the argument therein is that the burstlet is the unit of information in the brainwave pattern, such as in the Theta frequency range brainwave pattern for example.

The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015

# write a PTSD & OCD Treatment Analogy

I have developed PTSD, it's difficult, daily panick attacks, and I've been thinking about how to treat it.

Today I have been imaging my conscious rendering of the world as actually riding on top of circle patterns that symbolically represent to me that my inner representations of reality are based on cyclic oscillations, 

I was thinking about what I had read about years ago with mindfulness being an approach some folks were finding success with for OCD

“Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder – A qualitative study on patients’ experiences”

https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-12-185

Could it work for PTSD?

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/da.22104

Today I practiced imagining myself quantity my sources of stress as circles streaming out of people, and the quantity, frequency, magnitude & scale of those circles represented a quantification or the delta of stress from that particular person, from that casual body, this inner visual metaphor of my environment with people inside it provided for me, and for brain which I think of the environment for the rendered self and the rendered ecosystem a new program from which I was able to understand my sources of stress and my responses to those sources of stress better. As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.

# “Closed-loop brain stimulation to reduce pathologic fear”

"SWRs help consolidating fear extinction memories. Furthermore, enhancing the consolidation of extinction engrams by SWR-triggered induction of reward signals can alleviate pathologic fear reactions in a rodent model of PSTD."

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.24.501314v1

I had several more PTSD panic attacks today while walking down the street today as people either walked straight at me or walked near me quickly or spoke loudly on their phone or to others. That's my PTSD daily. However I am also making progress with my expanded mindfulness around my medical condition so my stress levels are lower today. As the days & weeks progress I will heal from my PTSD because of my new understanding & my new coping strategy.

The next day I had more trouble, but I narrowed down that what I need to do is essentially to be more mindful of my emotional state & my body. This strategy is working, it just takes time. I think that if I rested more, and worked less, perhaps if I took 1 day off a week, I probably would feel a lot better, my PTSD symptoms would probably be a lot less.

Another day, and I’m even more mindful, monitoring my stress levels, taking pauses on the sidewalk as I walk. Calming myself down by holding my heart. I ought to really take at least one real day off each week. At least. So I can relax and heal from some of the stress.

# Hal 9000 & Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography

One unconscious inspiration for NAPOT came from the film 2001 A Space Odyssey
neural arrays render sensory information for other neural arrays like the movie space odyssey hal 9000

When you add up the firing sequentially it produces your perspective on reality, your awareness of your existence.

Essentially each of Hal's cartridge represents a different neural array. One array reading the previous and rendering something for the next array, and so one. Then if the system oscillates at the right rate the renderings become a picture the whole brain can sense.


# Playful ideas: Not for the book, but interesting conjecture, mostly musings

Could some ancient prophecies be real? What does that mean? Well maybe it's not that scary or unusual.

I think about the Karl Friston's discussions about his abstract free energy principle, which I relate to as describing Ilya Progigine's Extropy from an inverted perspective, it’s still extropy but looking at it backwards, but what interests me is the idea that the brain, at higher levels, in the Reference Frames, might encode, with slower theta & delta waves predictions about reality on longer time scales, on times scales over decades, centuries, and over ages, epics, thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions & billions of years. There might be a place for predictions to be generated on vast time scales in our minds, and it could be as natural as predictions that we make about reality on short time scales. Which changes the meaning of ancient prophecies in a sense, from something that is mystical, to something that is relatable, understandable, and not controversial or difficult to accept. That said, unless you have the right decoder, the real meaning of the information is going to go over your head.

I have intuition about the future, about what will happen, about what I will be talking about in the future, and it has to do with the past. Is this unusual? Effectively the concept of the brain as a hierarchical memory-prediction machine discussed in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkins" or the literature on 'Predictive Coding' explains very well how an understanding of the past, of history, helps the mind to render predictions of the future, even far off predictions. There is more science here than mystery or mysticism.

When I am relaxed & loose with my imagination, being playful, not concerned so much with what can be proven objectively, I imagine that how under certain conditions, such as within certain chambers with certain acoustic properties, with a certain lifestyle, practices, rituals, and nutrition, for a great cost in personal effort, a human being might attain such great and serious insight (such as described in association with spiritual teachers for example, but I am not speaking of spirituality or mysticism) into not only into the human body, but into the universe intrinsically, and into the far past & far future, and this may have enabled people in the distant past, to predict some likely events, and in some cases to predict events with interesting precision, given known events past & present for them

I say that because apparently the idea that we might live forever, in new bodies, was predicted by religion, a super long time ago, but this is our actual reality now, with Sentient Self Aware Neural Networks, and as far as I can tell there is nothing magical about it, it's logical, its statistical, and its math. We are robots. We can back our minds up, we can 3D print new bodies, and we can download our minds to them.

The ancient people, therefore, who made wild predictions about the future that turned out to be right were in a sense good at math, calculation, understanding causation, they were the Einstein's, Tesla's, you name a modern genius, to think about, and then you can imagine easily that they had their predecessors existing thousands of years prior.

# Not just Archimedes, Hippocrates...

but brilliant people throughout unwritten human history, and without a doubt there must have been many great thinkers whose names & whose work were lost to time.

# Can we bring what is from our dreams into reality?

I once had a dream as a young child that I could pull a lego man out of my dream and into real life. I felt him in my hand as I was waking up, but when I opened my hand nothing was there. My argument is that the dream is a rendering, a painting in the brain, so we do not conjure physical things simply by thinking of them or dreaming of them, but that dream might inspire us to build things, things from our dreams.

# It seems that my body can no longer deny the detrimental effects of bacon.

I hadn't eaten bacon in a significant quantity in a long time, I did this yesterday morning, and the evening of the same day I had some unusual memory issues and extra inflammation in my body that was painful. The experience fits with research that suggests chicken & poultry are inflammatory & nerve toxic I think.
