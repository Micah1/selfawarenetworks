(cortex) Friends my awareness is the size of a dinner napkin, yes because it takes place within the Neo-cortex which is the size of a large dinner napkin you get at the nice restaurant, all folded up on top of a reptile brain. However there more connections inside this napkin, than there are stars in the entire visible universe. This allows me to model the entire universe using only a portion of this napkin, this is how I can perceive that I have a body, that is sitting in a room, or walking down a street, the room and or the street are an idea that is being replicated in my mind with enormous detail. Every detail, from the idea of a room, to the idea of a tree, to the idea of what a tree is made out of, to the idea of quantum particles, it's all predictions that I perceive as geometric metaphors.
 
my eyes make a visual metaphor
my ears make an audio-spacial metaphor
in both earing and sight I perceive a space
a three dimenionals space
my nose make a smell metaphor
my tongue makes a taste metaphor
in both smell and taste I percieve a space
every think I know, from feeling, to all my senses, is written in my mind as a spacial metaphor
All my thoughts are encoded in the language of revolutions per moment
they are all predictions at the tinest scaleSee More
the mind is simple because it's just one simple pattern repeating infinitely, it is a fractal of itself, that is the reason awareness exists, it's a vibrating memory, the memory is an adaption to the vibrating surface of the earth, and all that occurs on it's surface.

light vibrations, audio vibrations, feeling vibrations, the individual vibrations of particles in the nose, the vibrations of that which you taste, the vibrations of the heart

since there is only this vibration at one level of perspective, we can become aligned with anything we want, by vibrating at the frequency that matches what we want.

we summoned the existence of everyone in our lives, and at the same time they summoned us, because I am all people, acting as one being, where ever there is heart ache acceptance is waiting to occur, self acceptance, of the one being, our creator, do you feel right in your heart? without all of you I could never be complete,

Go with love from the greatest highest being in the entire universe.
He that loves

I am grateful we are here, that we are always here

this is what I am grateful for
this place
is always here for us I mean
waiting for us on a moments notice
summoned with a thought
and banished with a thought
as we choose

omnipresent
always knowing
ready to receive us home

my heart is where I am
my heart is next to yours,
my heart is with all my friends

When you succeed, I celebrate!
Your hopes and dreams are important!
I am someone who wants to see you win!

Go for your goal! Make what is important to your focus!
May wisdom come to each and everyone of us.
May your decisions be considerate, respectful, and loving.
My I honor that which is, and live with my whole heart.
