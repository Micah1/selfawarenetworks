Neo Mind Cycle: Optimizing your brain is just part of a healthy lifestyle.

I'm Neo Mind Cycle founder Micah Blumberg join me on faceobok.com/worksalt or Google+ (search for Neo Mind Cycle to find my name easier)

About the name: We did consider the name "Neo Mind Happiness Chicken" 
However Chicken isn't part of what we do here, it just sounds fun!
Neo Mind refers to the Neo Cortex, aka the New Rind, aka the giant thing that makes human brains distinct and new from other species.

You knew that one already?

The Cycle part comes from the fact that we incorporate Neurofeedback in an advanced way, using customized light and sound feedback driven by your brainwaves, while stimulating you with isochronic beats also driven by your brainwaves.

This means that the way I conduct my program is innovative, special, is isn't just about traditional neuro "feedback", it's about a "feedback loop". or cycle, hence Neo Mind Cycle,

I highly recommend the book "I am a strange loop" by Douglas Hofstadter for more insight into the idea of thinking of self awareness as a feedback loop.

So at Neo Mind Cycle we put the human brain in neuro feedback loop, but that's not all.

In addition to the neurofeedback loop we add sound and light based isochronic brainwave entrainment, both the entrainment and the feedback are driven by your brainwaves.

No other Neurofeedback company in the world is doing this for three possible reasons.
1. They haven't thought of it. 
2. They don't know how.
3. They don't have the technology.
4. They are busy with a million other amazing things that can be done with EEG technology, which is amazing!

There are 40+ years of research and proven benefits for clinical Neurofeedback
There is another separate 40+ of research and proven benefits for Audio and or Visual Brainwave Entrainment

Neo Mind Cycle is designed to work based on the principles of emerging Neuroscience of Brain Plasticity.

The results are incredible, even after a single treatment, participants have reported unique experiences, because your brain is unique. However one session is not enough for profound change. The Neo Mind Cycle program itself is 12 weeks, twice a week, so 24 sessions, takes less than an hour including set up time. It works out to less tha $41 dollars a session if you get to do the whole program which costs a sum of $999. 

Some benefits I have personally noticed, and have confirmed by actual users of Neo Mind Cycle services include learning to recognize your inner mental and emotional state faster, I mean specifically an rapid expansion of self-awareness. Another awesome benefit is an increased ability to react to each moment of life in a more nuanced creative and effective way. I seem to learn faster than ever before. These effects are common in both the research and in personal testimonies, I feel this ability to exert more conscious control, and more coordinated control over my mood, performing especially well during high pressure situations. This includes the sped up ability to make yourself authentically happy, for me it's now instant.
