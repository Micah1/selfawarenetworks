Any set of points that you feed into the system's oscillating array they come out larger afterwords, like the enlargement function of a photocopier. The action potentials total area is magnified by a factor larger than 1 because it impacts a lot of other cells via the vesicle releases following the Soma burst event.

it doesn't matter which neurons fired just as it doesn't what image you place on a photocopier

all the activated cells in the array are enlarging a pattern sequence

all sets get expanded in area

the transformed pattern, enlarged essentially retains an isomorphism to the original pattern, in that the cells that fire next at a higher level are representing components of a scaled up pattern, one that connects with other scaled up patterns which causes oscillators in the brain to integrate each others patterns, but also to scale down patterns, because 

so a neuron's dendrite learns a pattern, that changes what it is capable of detecting, but its essentially reducing a network pattern to synaptic states, and then its passing on that learned pattern to other neurons via the exit terminal, and each neuron on the exit terminal is sort of learning a different perspective on that scaled up pattern, but that helps the brain learn multiple perspectives that can act like an auto correcting or natural back propagation process, as the different perspectives can in essence vote in a way that corrects stabilizes and improves learned feature improving the robustness of the learning process, via neural tomography.

The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.

The dendrite is perhaps averaging all of its incoming signal patterns from the synapses into its action potential, its responding phase pattern represents the averaged sum of its received phase patterns.

So then oscillators are learning and recalling scaled up phase patterns, and these scales up phase patterns are the fabric of organisms internal representations, or its inner screens, because its what neurons everywhere in the brain are communicating, with pattern recognition at the synapse level scaled up to be observed as an effect on the global oscillator which is then observed by neurons the same way that the outside world is observed by neurons. The oscillators propogate an inner rendering to neurons deeper in the brain, but the signature of those oscillations may appear to be similar because they are scaled up patterns

The oscillator doesn't represent long term memory, it represents the in the moment reality.

entropy is like an equilibrium state destabiling information structures

information is a desynchronizing signal that is formed by a synchronization of signals, one group of oscillators disturbing other oscillators

information as a coincidence pattern is what neurons are set to detect via their active synapses

the exit synaptic configuration of that neuron must also represent that learned pattern to the larger oscillator.

So the synaptic configuration of the exit terminal is passing along its pattern to the array that is its connections, that arrays nodes each represent phases patterns to other receptive arrays

essentially an arrays pattern reacts to incoming stimulus in a way that magnifies what it detects, while other arrays further back redo the same process, along the way the brain learns the same patterns at different scales from different points of view, that turn into what we see, hear, taste and smell.
