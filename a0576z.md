"We never told it during the training, 'This is a cat,'" Google fellow Jeff Dean told the newspaper. "It basically invented the concept of a cat."

This is something similar to the computer who won a chess game against world chess champion! haha...

Micah Blumberg
No actually it's not.

Andreea Epure
why?

Deep Blue, aka the computer that beat the chess champion did this "The system derived its playing strength mainly out of brute force computing power. It was a massively parallel, RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120 MHz P2SC microprocessor for a total of 30, enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in C and ran under the AIX operating system. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful supercomputer according to the TOP500 list, achieving 11.38 GFLOPS on the High-Performance LINPACK benchmark.[12]" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)

Google's tech uses "Hierarchy of Memory" the programs simulate what neurons and synapses do. This machine was fed data, randomly selected from youtube, and in looking for significant patterns, (like the neo cortex in humans) it taught itself to recognize cats, it create the concept of the cat automatically, no one told it to focus on cats, no one told it what a cat was.

A neural network of computer processors, fed millions of YouTube videos, taught itself to recognize cats, a feat of significance for fields like speech recognition.

Yes I agree, judging the probabilities of everything is a brain inborn skill. I guess the computer that thought itself recognized the probabilities of a cat appearance and then it gave it a name. The same happen to our neural pathways.

Micah Blumberg
The two kinds of computing have vastly different strengths and weaknesses. The point is that the mechanical process of brute force calculations used in deep blue is fundamentally different from the simulation of neural activity in predicting concepts based on noticing significant patterns in spacial/temporal data.

Andreea Epure
Object and face recognition is based on edge extraction and in order one to attain object permanence and object constancy need a certain amount of experience. Face recognition is an inborn human ability. So, recognizing significant patterns in spatial/temporal data on a huge amount of information is guided by trial-error and learning. learning was used in the software that won against the chess player. it was trained and it used previous experience(so called memory). You know, one genetic make-up can lead to specific phenotypes based on the variables included around the genome. Here, the variables are the data: one is chess strategies the other is shape/pattern! It's not sarcasm, but I think it's the same principle.

There are real similarities between the two systems but your writing does not illustrate them. I think I have put you in the position of looking for similarities as a counter argument. That was counter productive of me to do. You would be far better served, in the pursuit of expanding your own knowledge base, to create your own counter argument, to your own argument. To do this, you must abandon the search for similarities, and learn instead about what makes Deep Blue and Google's Cat Recognizing Machine very different. Since you proposed the comparison. I am also researching the differences in order to remake my case with many more references. I think that with your quick analysis illustrated in the previous paragraph here, you would be valuable as a cooperative component in building a case against yourself. If you don't mind the challenge.

What I wanted to say is that the cat recognition, from the paper you posted, resembles object and face recognition in humans brain. The two systems are different in humans due to an inborn (genetic) ability of humans to recognise human faces and with training the superior temporal sulcus ( fusiform gyrus, if my memory is right) can be active in recognising also cow faces. This ability has been acquired over the course of evolution with learning facial features and genetic make-up develops it due to highly necessity i survival of the species. Also, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990624080203.htm, it is known that face region fires at the appearance of novel objects. Object recognition starts with edge extraction( read about gestalt theories, young and young 2002 model so on) and that could trigger a pattern to which ( under a high chance of probability of appearance in the model) it allocates a name. I bet the computer did not labeled cats as "cats", not did the other chess software know it's playing. Chess. What I wanted to say that they have a common ground on which captures operate and it's amazing to see the variety of appliances which it disclose. My English is bad and often my ideas are well described. I appoligiese in advance. Also, I know that differences in programs as concrete tools are more than similarities. What interests me is the pattern and silogisms they use to attain this results. Good job!

Brain Region Used In Face Recognition Is Active In New Object Recognition

When a long term memory is made, it involves the creation of a protein, which moves to the nucleus of the neuron, and this protein shape helps instruct how the neuron is connected to other neurons. It's as if the memory is both in the protein, and in the connections that neuron has formed with it's neighbors. Well actually that's only one idea of how long term memory could work in a human brain, as you know there are many ideas, and more comprehensive descriptions. The reason I say this, is that if the protein, is the memory, and all it needs to do is enter the nucleus of a neuron to become an active long term memory, then it is possible that long term memories could move from person to person, through transplants, blood transfusions, or the process of human reproduction. If so, it's possible that inborn traits are really just like any other kind of long term memory.

Andreea Epure What I am looking for is similarities between brain specialisation and artificial computation. I agree that chess and cats stuff are different, but they started from the same premises. My interest is related to cognitive neuroscience and it's computer based approaches. The google artificial brain resemble the ventral pathway of the visual system. That's what I wanted to say in my anterior comments more than similarities between chess and cats.

Micah Blumberg It's friendly enough to point out that looking for similarities between the Blue Brain and Google Brain is backwards, when you would be better served, in achieving your goal, of understanding the similarities between cognitive science and neurology, by first understanding the major differences in theory between what the Blue Brain did, and what the Google brain did, because they are profoundly different, and if you don't research it for yourself, then you will filter out acceptance of any idea I share with you.

Micah Blumberg If you simply read the google brain pdf that I linked above, with new filters for looking for and understanding the differences between previous facial recognition approaches, and their new facial recognition approaches you would begin to realize something valuable in terms of understanding the similarities between machines and human brains by understanding the differences between machines and previous machines. These distinctions add whole dimensions of understanding to what the human brain is doing.

Andreea Epure Hey, you put word into my mouth!! What I have said is not going against what you claim, I think it's complementary. Yes , I made a statement about chess stuff, and then I only talk about the visual perception and how it resemble what google people did. I Might be biased now, but I am still keeping my idea that google cat experiment resemble at a very high level human visual perception. Also, i don't know if that computer decided by itself to select YouTube videos and analyse then and then it said, wow I found virtual cats! It was trained, if you read the paper you will found out that it was trained! .... The chess software( that we've learnt at school, did not read your deep blue stuff) was created pretty similar, but for different purposes. I guess I understand pretty well artificial intelligence, and if it took years for you it does not mean that it's going to ale years for others( not talking about myself, but in general). I am not interested in the concrete world, cos its ever-changing! When I get to a pc I will show you a few models of what I am talking about. And don't forget that evolution brings up the usefulness of predecessors! You can't talk about human brain ignoring the brain of Apes ! Everything has its own value and all we do leads to future developments. The moral reasons are not the use or aim of science!

Micah Blumberg It seems that the google brain built it's own high level conceptual abstraction of the features of a cat, without being asked, without being trained, and it was a complete surprise. Unlike the chess stuff, they did not instruct this google brain on what to learn, they just fed it random images from youtube. They did not choose the images. They did not tell it to learn cats or human bodies. If you read the pdf more closely you would see this. Conventional AI does not create it's own concepts.

Richard Pomfret As much as I've found each of your points fascinating, I'd just like to interject for a moment and say...I fucking love Google.

If anyone will make Skynet a reality, it'll be Google. ;)

Richard Pomfret p.s. I'm very impressed that Google have managed to create A.I that can create a concept of a cat and identify it from....not just stationary 2D images but moving youtube footage. That's a leap forward too. I guess it confirms what we all suspect, dogs are wankers.

Micah Blumberg I keep trying to make a distinction between conventional AI and simulating neurology in a machine, but when you reply, it's as if you don't know that this distinction exists. Further it seems that you are very insistent that this distinction doesn't exist, as illustrated by your previously mentioned belief that computers will rival human intelligence when they can match the raw processing numbers achievable in the human brain. It's not simply a matter of raw processing numbers. It's a matter of a distinction that I can't even tell you about, because your mind seems set to filter out even the existence of this distinction, as if computer processors and human brains were the same machine only with different processing capabilities. It's like thinking that a refrigerator is the same as a ultra sonic jet, with the only different being how many cylinders it has. Then when someone like me tries to say that Ultra Sonic Jets and Refrigerators are profoundly different machines with profoundly different ideas behind them. It's like your saying "No I don't think so, I'm pretty sure Ultra Sonic Jets and Refrigerators are the same thing, they both consist of metal parts, contain engines, coolant, give off heat, pretty much a more powerful refrigerator will become an Ultra Sonic Jet someday." It's like thinking that traditional AI will someday be really intelligent. It won't. It's like not realizing that computing that simulates Neurology is an Ultra Sonic Jet, and Not traditional AI which is more like a Refrigerator.

It's not significant at all that it can create a concept of a cat, what's significant is that it did it without being instructed to do so, second it did not scan moving youtube video, it learned from static images that were extracted from youtube video. Third a youtube video is just a stack of stationary 2d images for a computer, it doesn't perceive it as a video.
