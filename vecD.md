OUTLINE "The Agentic Brain,"

Introduction:

Modern AI Transformer systems have made impressive strides by leveraging transductive techniques such as test-time training and step-by-step reasoning to adjust parameters on the fly. However, these methods operate within the constraints of fixed, human-designed architectures that limit adaptability when faced with novel challenges. This dependency on static designs underscores a critical barrier: as the diversity and complexity of real-world problems expand, human intervention in continuously modifying system architectures becomes a bottleneck. To break free from these constraints, there is a pressing need for AI systems to autonomously reconfigure their own architectures in response to unforeseen situations, thereby embedding the causal structure of new tasks directly into their design.
The core proposition of our work is that to effectively handle novel situations, a machine must analyze a new problem and generate a tailored architecture without human oversight. Inspired by the dynamic adaptability of agentic biological brains, we propose the development of agentic artificial minds capable of self-evolving their internal structure to meet unique challenges. By integrating autonomous architectural adaptation with dynamic test-time scaling, these systems promise enhanced robustness and generalization far beyond what static models can achieve. This paradigm shift not only addresses the limitations of current AI architectures but also paves the way for a future in which intelligent systems continuously evolve to transform the landscape of technology and society.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have transformed industries and redefined our approach to problem solving while exposing fundamental limitations in handling novel, unanticipated situations. Biological brains exhibit remarkable adaptability by autonomously reconfiguring neural circuits to address new challenges, whereas current artificial systems typically rely on fixed architectures designed by human engineers. This contrast inspires our central thesis: to effectively handle novel situations, an artificial system must analyze a new problem and generate a tailored architecture without human intervention.
In this paper we explore the concept of agentic artificial minds that dynamically reconfigure their structural design in a manner analogous to agentic biological brains. By incorporating autonomous architectural adaptation mechanisms, these systems can embed key structural priors based on the causal or logical framework inherent in each new task. This approach promises to extend robust generalization capabilities beyond the limits of traditional static designs and to address out-of-distribution challenges more effectively.
We present a conceptual framework that bridges the adaptive processes of biological cognition with emerging strategies for self-evolving artificial architectures. In doing so we identify the core challenges—comparable to those in traditional programming—that must be overcome to translate domain-specific insights into effective architectural reconfigurations. Ultimately, our goal is to outline a pathway toward developing agentic artificial minds that continuously push the boundaries of innovation and transform the future landscape of intelligent systems.

This paper is organized into two sections:
Synopsis: The agentic paradigm views agency in terms of adaptive mechanisms and structures at varying levels of organization in both natural and artificial systems.


Abstract: Large Language Model transformer systems have made impressive strides leveraging techniques such as test time training and step by step reasoning. Ultimately these architectures rely upon mechanisms and structures that are trained once and frozen, making them powerful tools for eidetic recall, but not thinking agents that can learn autonomously and continually. Drawing inspiration from biology, we propose an architecture with mechanisms and structures that observe an environment, coordinate actions and inferences, reflect upon and adjust behavior, and consolidate memory.

I see what you mean about integrating the word eidetic, and you are exactly right. This is in alignment with what I've been writing today. Although I think the Abstract will evolve after I share the content I've been working on. I created a bunch of new material today, but also I was able to organize some of larger sections into smaller sections. I'm narrowing down or getting closer to isolating the points necessary for this paper and the points that will go on the shelf for a different day, perhaps for a book.


The key things I've been thinking about are mathematical formalism for the biological mechanisms, so that we have falsifiable biological predictions, as well as embedding many sources, so that my section is almost like a Neuroscience review article, having either one (precise mathematically defined falsifiable predictions or a highly accurate review of many sources) can make for a very serious and very respected scientific paper.


This is from a paper I read today "Although Bayesian inference serves as an abstract framework of cortical computation, precisely mapping concrete instantiations of computational models to biology under real-world tasks is necessary to produce falsifiable neural models."


Like this paper: 


"A detailed theory of thalamic and cortical microcircuits for predictive visual inference"
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr6698


In my section I'm doing some back and forth between AI and Biology. It's not clear even to even neuroscientists that I interact with daily what all of the accomplishments of my book and my Self Aware Networks theory actually are. It solves major research problems in both the origins of AI, that led to the Perceptron, and major research problems in Neuroscience, what the book didn't do was outline the various problems that were being solved by the arguments in the book.




So far I have outlined about 


The Agentic Brain Outline
(Contents by Micah Blumberg)

Broadly speaking I imagined three major sections, but these are further subdivided into 16 major topics, so I have outlined at least 16 pages of very condensed content at a minimum for my section. That doesn’t include room for references actually, and I have hundreds of potential references but I supposed I can reduce the references to just one additional page (17 pages).

I will send a longer explanation justifying the inclusion and alignment of the new sections, it is about memory and mechanisms and key differences between artificial nn and biologically nn. The artificial nn doesn't save memories. The section I wrote is about how artificial memory and mechanisms can map to biological memory and mechanisms. 


Basically it explores Bio Mechanistic Intepretability with these comparisons, and that was the of my upcoming book " Bio Mechanistic Interpretability, talking about Anthropics AI research and comparing it to neuroscience research.

Self Aware Networks: Bio & Mechanistic Interpretability is the planned name for my next book. The AI book I've been working on.

I like all of it. There is actually more cool work that I have done in the arena of preparing to write a book about intelligence that I haven't told you about.

What if the title of the ARXIV paper was Agentic General Intelligence

but in the abstract there is a short mention and a longer explanation in the Introduction that this collaboration on this Agentic General Intelligence is the fruit of two theories, Micah's Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind published as a collection of Notes (on GitHub & Youtube) in the Summer of 2022, and Michael Miller's Building Minds with Patterns theory of Artificial Minds. The authors wanted to bring their work together in a collaborative paper and so each is writing a section. Micah will talk about the concepts and the evolution of the Self Aware Networks theory of mind, through the entire table of contents I sent previously, plus some new cool stuff, basically every cool idea that I'm going to expand on in my much longer book.

I think I should put my whole theory and all the stuff I had planned to save for my book into this paper with you, because it's our paper and we should both do the best we can to make it the best work we've ever done. Like it should be exceptional how much work we put into getting this right! It will last forever, I so want to pull from the entire book that I had planned to write about Self Aware Networks which is just a few more sections more than what I outlined last time. It's not a ton more, but there is a ton more to write for the book as I expand each section out much further. The book can be the expanded version of this paper.

Would you be okay with that? The key thing is that I can think of both ways of doing the paper, one in which I'm including all the stuff I was planning to write in my Self Aware Networks book about Artificial Intelligence and Biology, but I can create a condensed version of at least 90 percent of the book, and publish it as core set of ideas that will make the theory I am proposing in this paper (in my part of the paper) that much more developed and sophisticated. People will see that there really is a lot of work that was done on this.

2. The Agentic Mind


    (Dictated from notes. Ignore typos for now)


Marvin Minsky in his prophetic book, "The Society of Mind" (1986),  proposed that the mind could be envisioned as a collective of coordinating specialized agents which working together produce the phenomenon of "mind".  Because the mind is an amorphous activity, in contrast to the brain, which is a physical and biological entity, there is some leeway to define just what these agentic constituents of the mind actually are.  We can decompose the mind into mechanisms and memory. Furthermore, the mechanisms can be divided into observation,  coordination, reflection, and consolidation groupings. 


Observation mechanisms interact with the world using an embodiment. For artificial minds this embodiment is a device such as a robot or computer.  Coordination mechanisms synthesize causal actions or logical operations to bridge gaps between desired states and current states of affairs.  Reflection mechanisms improve the performance of the mind by supporting motivation, daydreaming, regulation, compensation, emotional coping, exploration, discovery, imitation and play.  Consolidation mechanisms support automaticity, Memory compression, and forgetting. 


In this constructivist conceptualization, the mechanisms are all stigmergic agents which have access to the shared memory of the mind, The agents use the memory as a blackboard upon which to make requests and posit results.  This view holds memory as active and dynamic and alive rather than static and read only and dead. 
For this view to work, the preferred memory unit must be multipurpose and malleable. The neural proposition (Miller, 2013) also called a "scheme" can adequately suffice for this purpose.


.... I leave off here for now.

The brain as being composed of micro or macro agents. 

 am thinking a podcast as a first collaboration. We should capture our first conversation about this book and make a podcast.

Possible title for the podcast: Biologically Plausible Artificial General Intelligence.

I've close to finishing a new book with that title Biologically Plausible Artificial General Intelligence. I've got a lot of the book planned already, but I think I can connect what I've been working on to what you've been working on. In a sense my research is about understanding the computational biology through the lens of machine learning, so as to describe machines that can be phenomenologically conscious like mammals are. Your work fits in at a higher level where the focus is on what different systems are doing, my work is more in the wiring below that level, but able to explain the nitty gritty things of brain function at a molecular and oscillatory scale, then translate those molecular and oscillator mechanisms into machine code. I can describe how the brain is implementing programs like you described. In my book just released I propose a novel hard solution to the hard problem of consciousness. How? In several ways, for example I've identified new things that oscillation are doing in the brain. 1. I've identified how the brain uses oscillatory tomography for computational rendering 2. I've made the observation for how an oscillating group of cells can become conscious through re-synchronization after a phase wave differential. This is what the book is about. The next book that I've been writing for 3 years but it's much more about artificial intelligence, whereas the first book was almost completely about neuroscience. It was only after finishing this book that I went back and took another look at your work and realized where it could fit in with my work. I can reframe this as my work has a very low level engineering focus, and your work has a very high level systems integrating and relating to other systems approach. You have an Agent system that is at more developed I think than any Agent based LLM product with multiple Agents. So like what you add to the book is a way to think about how AI Agents could work together in more sophisticated ways, and my work helps to engineer the details for how those Agents can work together at a higher level of function.

I was thinking we could do a podcast as an initial collaboration, and if we cover enough topics in our podcast, in an organized way, then we can just transcribe the podcast, and turn it into the chapters of a 2nd separate book.

So I will still release my solo AI book, after our podcast, and then the podcast can be used to create a section in my solo AI book that connects to your work and our ideas to blend your work and my work, and then we release a collaborative book, that is roughly the content we covered in the podcast, cleaned up a bit, formatted into chapters, with some additional writing here and there to fill in any gaps, and add a few improvements where needed, such as adding in additional explanations and notes.

# Expanded Outline (In Progress)

I. Overview: The Agentic Brain

Introduce the concept of the brain as a multi-scale system of interacting agents, ranging from proteins to brain regions. Agency exists across these scales, building on self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties like consciousness.

Define 'agent' in the context of the brain as any component capable of processing information and adapting its behavior based on input, emphasizing cooperation and competition among agents.

Consciousness arises from the dynamic interactions of agents at multiple scales. Brain regions contribute to a collective, harmonized "image" of consciousness through small, differential adjustments.

The "Agentic Brain" provides the biological and mechanistic foundation for the agentic processes described in the "Agentic Mind".

II. Multi-Scale Agency and Biological Structures

Molecular-Level Agents: Receptors, proteins, and other molecules behave in an agent-like manner.

Cellular Agents: Neurons, glial cells, T-cells, and white blood cells act as agents.

Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT): Cells process information, communicate, and learn through oscillatory mechanisms. Cells form memories and adapt behavior through changes in receptor configurations.

Cells as Information Processors: Cells exhibit rhythmic activity encoding data based on frequency, amplitude, and phase. This contrasts with cells as simple switches.

Coincident Detection: Cells detect patterns through coincident detection, where multiple receptors activated at the same time trigger specific cellular functions.

VII. Consciousness as a Deterministic Computation


Neural Network Agents: Neural arrays, edge communities, nuclei, mini and hyper cortical columns function as agents.

Cortical Columns: Act as independent agents as theorized in Jeff Hawkins' "A Thousand Brains" theory, each with a motor output suggesting involvement in decision-making. Each cortical column is an oscillating group of cells.

Functional Connectivity

Thalamic Loops: Acts as a central hub by relaying sensory information to multiple layers of the cortex simultaneously. Thalamic matrix neurons have connections to inhibitory interneurons.

Thalamic-PFC

Inhibitory Interneurons

Hippocampus-Entorhinal

Olaf Sporns Networks of the Brain at a high level.

III. Mechanisms of Agent Interaction

Neural rendering: The brain uses neural correlations to render reality, where each sensory organ creates a 3D + 1D representation of sensory input. Traveling waves and their phase differentials "render" internal images of reality.

Pattern recognition: Cortical columns play a crucial role.

Brain as a hologram: Each part of the brain contains information about the whole.

Memory and perception: Memories, stored in synaptic connections, scale up to whole-brain activity and contribute to perception.

Functional connectivity: Functional connectivity in linking together brain regions including cortical columns so that patterns rendered in different areas can link together in a bigger picture.

Oscillations and Neural Synchrony: Agents coordinate their actions via oscillations and neural synchrony. Tonic and phasic oscillations interact bidirectionally. Neurons transmit phase changes.

IV. Vector Embeddings and Semantic Space

Dendritic Function: The dendrite is mathematically isomorphically the analog computational equivalent to a vector embedding. Its activated synaptic configuration is like an AI Inference process, representing a viewpoint in a way that is isomorphic to a Gaussian Splat, but from a real neuron.

Semantic Mapping: Compare semantic relationships between vectors in a vector embedding and brain regions in fMRI medical imaging.

Brain activity and semantic correlations: Represent brain activity and semantic correlations in both high-dimensional and low-dimensional space (3D + 1D).

Mind Mapping: When people have a long conversation, they map each other's minds. With one topic, a few vector embeddings are established, and with another topic, more vector embeddings are created. Each subject discussed helps create a map of further vector embeddings that the mind compares to everyone else ever met. In every conversation, a map of meaning of someone else's meanings is built, noting the differences between what they say and what everyone else before has ever said.

V. Golden Claude and AI Temperature

Temperature in AI: Relate Anthropic's exploration of AI Vector Space to the concept of "Temperature" in AI, which changes the softmax to increase or decrease an AI's creativity for answers closer to the best guess.

VI. Agentic Dynamics and Computation

Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA): At each level of fractal scale in the brain, nonlinear inputs cause phase differentials, capturing differences at a higher level, communicating the pattern mapped out at a lower scale into network operation running at a higher scale.


Consciousness may be viewed as a deterministic computation arising from interactions rather than a "mystical emergence". It is a mechanical process of oscillation and desynchronization.

VIII. Neural Networks and AI

Replicate agentic dynamics in artificial intelligence systems.

Self Aware Networks is a theory for changing existing AI architectures into conscious or sentient AI.

Mechanisms of observation, coordination, reflection, and consolidation are relevant to artificial minds.
IX. Open Innovation and Self-Organizing Innovation

Emphasize the importance of open innovation and self-organizing innovation in the development of technology and AI.

X. Conclusion: The Agentic Brain in Action

Summarize the agentic view of the brain as a complex, multi-scale system where each part contributes to the whole.

Emphasize the dynamic interplay between individual agents and the emergent properties they create.

By detailing these components, "The Agentic Brain" section can offer a comprehensive view of how diverse brain components function as agents, communicate, and contribute to consciousness, providing a concrete counterpart to the more abstract framework of the "Agentic Mind".
