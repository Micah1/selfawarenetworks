# Self Aware Networks Theory: Computational Phenomenological Consciousness.

I like to contemplate the meaning of the existence of my mind in the most abstract sense.

The mind is a point when reality is convex, when reality that has a form is now sort of doubled back on itself.

I mean to argue that forms exist in nature, in the mountain, the river, the snow, and the land & sea. But these are not actors, they have no intentions, no mental organization, no goals, it's just physics.

A human being, or an animal with a brain is also just physics, but this is a different physical system because it's flow is self referential, it's flow is a feedback loop, it's flow has the structure of a brain, a 3D neural network, evolved to have special functions, a self-replicating dissipative system, an evolved computation.

We can argue that the nature of the evolution of the universe is like a 3D neural network that evolved from the harmonic oscillating field of space, from the physics of oscillation, which clumps together overtime, increasing in extropy in one area while increasing in entropy in another area

I think of consciousness as something that arises from a set of memory-prediction-rendering arrays (that are firing off patterns in tempo-spatial sequences) but specifically the firing represents some extended interval of time and what I mean by this is when a video is playing you have one frame playing back on one screen at a time,
but when a conscious entity does video playback it is like 100 simultaneously different videos playing back on 100 different screens
(or if one neuron is a screen defined by its inceptive field or its exit terminal array then you have 86 or 87 billion screens and 86 or 87 billion variations of the video)

In an artificial neural network, such as a deep neural network, there is an input layer, then there are hidden markov layers, and finally there is an output.

Effectively NAPOT (Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, the main argument of Self Aware Networks theory) is arguing that each layer in the brain's neural network is a neural array, is an input layer (array) and an output layer (array). In fact each node or neuron is both an observer (input) and a display (output). This contradicts Daniel Dennet's work Consciousness Explained which claims we don't have an internal display in the brain, I'm arguing that we do, it's just distributed. The neural array projections are the displays, and the eyes are the receptors, the dendrites, and the somas, and the observers are the oscillating groups of cells.

Where as a diffusion neural network renders only the output the neural networks process, in the human brain each output from each neuron is the rendering,

Metaphorically you can imagine that there is no central canvas, no computer screen where all the renderings show up, because the rendered outputs are distributed all over the place, and absorbed by the brain for the next iteration of the rendering.

The rendering of the content of the mind is both distributed & constantly changing, but it's organized by neural pathways that are organized into feedback loops, and the neural pathways are constantly changing at the synaptic scale, like train switches, redirecting the flow of traffic, and this process develops new patterns, the patterns are also bounded together by the physics of oscillation taking place in both time & space, with brainwaves serving as attractors that regularize the oscillating feedback loops into a coherent pattern, with the perturbations & deviations from that regular pattern serving as a qualia or the rendered information content of the mind.

Ultimately the output of the human brain is muscle activity, your voice, your eye movement, your hand movement, your body, etc...

but there is a display, it's just embedded & distributed across your cells, as differences or phase wave differentials in signals that flow through the oscillating feedback loops of your brain.

Scaling up micro changes, in distributed micro-displays, defined by the inceptive fields of neural arrays transmitting or projecting to the receptive fields of the next set of neural arrays we have to imagine how micro changes, that we are not aware of, at the individual synapse scale, transform into information forms that we are aware of, in the experience of phenomenological consciousness,

The argument is that these forms are consistently replicated, or variations of isomorphic replications are oscillating enough times across enough of our neural arrays to change the macroscale of information formation in terms of brainwave oscillations. 

In other words when the microscale changes are compounded through many iterations across many of our internal screens into persistent forms or forms that persist over time, we become aware of them when they achieve some threshold of pattern dominance in brain activity, that is when the forms of the mind are hallucinated into mental existence, the synchronous repetitive or repeated firing of the same or similar pattern means it is hallucinated or lucinated into consciousness, a pattern become lucid or or lucidated or lucinated. To play with the words hallucination and lucidity. That's when rendered information becomes conscious information.

Then we have Distributed Muscle Output: Learned & high coordinated muscle movement is also stored as a Sparse Distributed Memory that when activated projects, and via oscillatory synchronization the projections of many sparse distributed muscle memory predictions are bound together, I refer to this process as Oscillatory Tomography, and it defines how many independently activated muscle reactions in the brain send signals to modify central pattern generators in the nervous system to guide movement.

Similar to how the accumulation of electrical charges via synchronized firing results in muscle movement

# The core knowledge of how rhythmic neural networks control muscles comes from the study of the stomatogastric ganglion.
"The stomatogastric ganglion is a collection of about thirty neurons that sits on the dorsal surface of the foregut (stomach) in decapod crustaceans. The neurons it contains form two central pattern generators (CPGs), namely the pyloric and gastric mill CPGs. The pyloric CPG controls striated muscles that dilate and constrict the pyloric region of the stomach in a cyclic three phase rhythm. The gastric mill CPG produces a slower six phase rhythm that controls muscles that produce chewing by three ossicles in the gastric mill."

# The core knowledge of how individual neurons work came from the giant squid axon.
"In their Nobel Prize-winning work uncovering ionic mechanism of action potentials, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley performed experiments on the squid giant axon, using the longfin inshore squid as the model organism.[7] The prize was shared with John Eccles. The large diameter of the axon provided a great experimental advantage for Hodgkin and Huxley as it allowed them to insert voltage clamp electrodes inside the lumen of the axon."

# "Central pattern generators and the control of rhythmic movements"
"Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that when activated can produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking, breathing, flying, and swimming in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information."

# Central Pattern Generation of Locomotion: A Review of the Evidence
"Neural networks in the spinal cord, referred to as “central pattern generators” (CPGs), are capable of producing rhythmic movements, such as swimming, walking, and hopping, even when isolated from the brain and sensory inputs."

# Coordinated alpha and gamma control of muscles and spindles in movement and posture
"Mounting evidence suggests that both α and γ motor neurons are active during movement and posture, but how does the central motor system coordinate the α-γ controls in these tasks remains sketchy due to lack of in vivo data. Here a computational model of α-γ control of muscles and spindles was used to investigate α-γ integration and coordination for movement and posture."
"In particular, the function of γd was to gate the αd command at the propriospinal neurons (PN) such that antagonistic muscles can accelerate or decelerate the limb with proper timing. Independent control of joint position and stiffness could be achieved by adjusting static commands. Differentiation in the model indicated that accurate static commands of αs and γs are essential to achieve stable terminal posture precisely, and that the γd command is as important as the αd command in controlling antagonistic muscles for desired movements."

I'm suggesting of course that there is another kind of "Central Pattern Generator (CPG)" for Cognition, and that microcolumns, minicolumns, and cortical columns fulfill this role, instead of coordinating phase wave differential signals into muscle movement, these Cortical Column Pattern Generators CCPG are coordinate phase wave differential signals into sensory tomography, (via NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography) which later becomes coordinated muscle movement. These CCPG's are using NAPOT to bind low level sensory inputs into patterns that when sent through the feedback loops of their mind produce phenomenological consciousness or the experience of being someone who is observing the ecosystem that the organism is in.

If you notice how when cooking & eating with other people the repeated phrases, catch phrases, memes, quips, or expressions get voiced on a daily basis by the people around you, and by yourself, that would be an example of the result of CCPG, Cortical Column Pattern Generators, that basically store, retrieve, and oscillate our learned patterns in memory & language that your brain activates with minimal energy, and they are modified only slightly by sensory inputs.

My argument is that the physics of oscillation, general to physics and applicable to biology, to fireflies, to clocks, and to neurons, are what bind together our rendered representations of reality, the co-occurrence of similar representations, the neural correlates of which are oscillations in the brain will bind together to become a cup, a table, a chair, a room, a tv screen, the content on the tv screen, anything we see, hear, feel, taste or touch, anything in our ecosystem or in our bodies is presented to the mind as set of patterns from a set of arrays that are bound together with oscillation and lasting for a space of time, or spatially for a duration.

Our decisions that arise from mental imagery, from our predictions of consequences, our predictions of possible futures, result in sparse distributed muscle coordination actions sequences, and again the commonalities in patterns rendered over the many arrays determine the rhythms of cell firings that lead to specific muscular signals, to specific muscular activity, and to coordinated movement, action, speech, writing, and planning in the world.

Oscillatory Physics is the organizing principle of perception, thought, consideration, entification, phenomenological consciousness, planning, choices, movement, speech, all of it. Beyond the electro-chemical dynamics, oscillatory physics is what binds our minds together, and the simulation of oscillatory physics is what can bind artificial minds together.

We also have the synchronization of similar renderings, from different screens (the inceptive fields of neurons representing activated or inhibited neural arrays) that accumulated or compound via temporal repetition via oscillatory physics ie oscillatory synchrony into a conscious image which is a persistent pattern defined in space for a time (for a duration), that is to say the rendering in the mind is a persistent pattern that is detected by the mind the same way a rock in the world is a persistent pattern that is detectable by a computer with a neural network with a semantic segmentation program

That is to say that for as long as you are looking at an object such as a car there is a persistent neural rendered pattern of oscillations representing that pattern in your brain as some pattern that is mathematically measurably distinct from whatever other baseline tonic oscillation pattern exists. Meaning that if the whole brainwave oscillation pattern could be captured & rendered in a computer, the rendered pattern that represents the object that you are looking at can in theory be isolated from the tonic baseline firing pattern.

The isolated pattern would be a variation, I don't want to say of a Platonic form, 

because on the one hand I don't believe in Platonic forms as having some material existence 

but we can argue that platonic forms can be abstractions like numbers that have some universality which is some persistence of meaning beyond an encoding that is relative to just one system locally, 

that is to say that the form of knowledge of redness or of broccoli, or of a cup might be a variation relative to the brains tonic oscillation it will also be comparable in terms of its information properties to the knowledge form of redness, of broccoli, or of a cup in some other brain

I am arguing that your inner representations are somewhat subjective and somewhat objective simultaneously, inner representations & inner renderings of the the world, of persons places things and trajectories or actions and choices, the renderings of nouns and verbs, these things are rendered relative from a baseline of tonic oscillation and they can be distorted with modulation to that baseline, but they are partly also translatable & decodable such that they could be recognized by other tonic baselines rendered by other brains,

a brain is capable of both distorted thinking and of objective thinking, and the normal course of brain activity is a spectrum of states in between lucidity & delusion

Imagine that we could breakdown the etymology of consciousness into something new consisting of parts like context, rendered contextual comparisons, self being a rendering in the context of other renderings in the context of visual renderings in the context of auditory renderings, in the context of feeling renderings, in the context of touch renderings, 

A rendering is a substantial pattern, not a mirage, or an illusion, unless you are defining a mirage or an illusion as a rendering that is temporary, or fleeting,

A rendering is a substantial pattern that is the output of some computable process.

and consciousness of renderings is like putting these renderings in a feedback loop
for some reason I imagine these renderings in a feedback loop as like clothing that is tumbling in the dryer although the analogy is loose and broken

but imagine the signals in your mind that make up the renderings of what you are focused on are loosely like clothing tumbling in a dryer, the clothing fundamentally maintains its form, its informational structure, even as it is tossed around in a cycle, the dryer that is tumbling the clothing or the informational forms that the conscious mind is focusing on would be the feedback loops of the neocortex, of the cortical columns, the cortical thalamic loops, and the hippocampal entorhinal loop, the fact that signals are tossed around in loops is the comparison to the dryer, and the the fact that the tossed forms, maintain their essential structure, is the significance of the brain passing soliton waves or information containing waves, that are both stable waves, and waves that are distinct from the tonic oscillation of brain activity

consciousness is context referencing context, self referencing self, where self is a rendered pattern that is a distinct information/energy configuration, that oscillates inside a feedback loop that is made up of brain state elements that alternately render & detect renderings, 

what it means to be conscious of something for the rendered pattern of that thing to be referenceable in the context of the other things that are reference-able in the awareness which is the substrate and the virtual substrate, the stage and the state of the feedback cycle of the brain and its neural phase states.

Self referential thinking: think of phenomenological consciousness as a cycle of contexts (that are reach rendered patterns)

Consciousness is a feedback cycle of contexts that are rendered information patterns bound together by oscillatory physics.

The oscillatory physics that bind information patterns include magnetic binding, electric binding, and mechanical wave binding, this oscillatory binding mechanism is also involved in the movement of muscle.
