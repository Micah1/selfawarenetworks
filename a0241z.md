Once the way the brain produces consciousness is public knowledge people will use Phi from IIT for a different purpose I predict, not as a measure of consciousness, but a measure of something, I will talk about that in my book.

They will use Phi to measure the resolution of consciousness

the neurons "phasic" mode is indicated by a faster firing rate, so the frequency of its electro-magnetic pulsations, both its physical expansion, creating a tremor like soliton magnetic wave, and an electric frequency variation that differs from the main oscillator, but then is pulled back into tonic pattern alignment with the rest of the oscillator, like two oscillators merging.
