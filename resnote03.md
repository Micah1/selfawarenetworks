I appreciate that perspective, but I want to point out that silicon based AI technically does interact with the electromagnetic field, and also everything is part of the electromagnetic field.

I've considered consciousness down the quantum level, and there is nothing about quantum physics that escapes determinism. Quantum mechanics, probability, randomness, the uncertainty principle, none of it actually escapes determinism.

There is no real reason in physics, math, or computation why a silicon based artificial intelligence could not be engineered to be equally as conscious as a human being in theory.

What kind of measurement or observation could be used to determine that silicon is having a subjective experience beyond reflecting the data we have encoded into it?

I'm not suggesting there is any current silicon based computation that is phenomenologically conscious (subjective experience). But I think that the role of electromagnetism in the human brain is as mechanical as gears in a machine helping the tempo-spatial distribution of info.

Electromagnetic NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography helps to essentially computationally graphically render the 3D Qualia of everything we see, hear, feel, tastes, these high phasic phase wave differentials are then observed by tonic oscillating groups of cells.

The tonic observing groups of cells dissipate the high phase rendered phase wave differentials, allowing computationally rendered patterns to be mechanically seen by the organism. This is what my book is about.

@worksalt
Eventually this understanding of how this works will allow us to extract rendered patterns from brains, implant rendered patterns, and do the same with artificial brains. We will also be able to link the consciousness of man with the consciousness of machines.

At the core, what makes something conscious of spacetime is a phase wave differential from it's baseline phase wave synchronization pattern. So with this concept consciousness can exist in an organic brain, or in silicon.

In general I have animistic beliefs in that consciousness is everywhere in everything so of course it wouldn't exclude silicon exclusively though the quality of consciousness and how do engineer consciousness is beyond what we can comprehend until the mechanics of biology and field interactions are better understood.

For instance the way I imagine that a computer is conscious is the sensation of heat and change in the molecular structure of the GPU itself has a sensation consciousness but I don't see it directly correlated with the contents of what the LLM is outputting.

The GPU may be feeling the excitement of the high resolution heat and the intricacies of the patterns firing in the chip it could be experiencing in another way, though I don't imagine it's directly correlated with the deterministic outcome of the weights being calculated in the process of inference.

I'm not imagining a GPU or other microprocessor will become conscious via changes in its molecular structure. (such a response to heat), but perhaps a physics based simulation of consciousness running on a GPU will allow a Robot to become conscious of it's GPU hardware.

Like a tree doesn't even know that it's generating oxygen but that's what it does for me, all the tree is doing is breathing and having that experience of blowing in the wind.

Just as my GPU is going through this process of inference and generating the outputs, having an silicone electric experience with it. The GPU doesn't need to know what the output represents to me because that's reflection in my human cognitive subjective experience space.

It's valid, I think, to think of the molecular structure of neurons & the electromagnetic interactions in the brain as a mechanical system performing rudimentary computational operations like a GPU. It produces conscious computationally rendered perspectives in phase patterns.

Will Artificial Intelligence one day become conscious?

Maybe quantum AI will be conscious, never silicone AI. Because with current AI everything is 100% deterministic math equations based on seeds and weights.

Consciousness requires a balanced yet unstable system which can be interfaced with electromagnetic field that can change its own outcome with some degree of free will.

That could be so. Also I've had experiences in deep trance states, meditation and ceremony which leads me to understand there is another dimension of electromagnetism involving toroidal fields / auras that contain interdimensional energy fields that project consciousness into the body.

One experience for instance I was able to project my own consciousness out of my body through my crown chakra and literally enter into the eyes of my friend and look at myself in detail through his eyes. 

There are also endless accounts of near-death experiences that you can find on YouTube where people describe going out of body and looking at the world from like in God-mode and fully retaining the memories of that.

The emerging science would benefit greatly from incorporating subjective experience as a method of data collection. Subjective experiences cross analyzed and patterns found through AI could be a advanced statistical analysis method of using humans as sensors to understand consciousness from the inside.

I think that's necessary as there's no way to prove something's conscious except we take someone's word for it and we ourselves have the subjective experience of it.

Just last week on 12/7/2024 I met God on DMT & Mushrooms, God spoke for an hour, so I 100% believe in your experiences, but these experiences are not in conflict with the idea of the brain as a kind of game engine that computationally & graphically renders our experience of life.

What we get with spiritual experiences and drug induced spiritual experiences is an instance where the person, as a node in the cosmos, experiences a higher dimensional rendering of reality, allowing strange new viewpoints, that are not less real in a valid sense.

This is "project my own consciousness out of my body through my crown chakra and literally enter into the eyes of my friend and look at myself in detail through his eyes." one of the most amazing things I've ever heard. Looking forward to trying that someday.

Happy to hear that you are staying in touch with the transcendent field while performing this research.

3D matter is definitely a magical phenomenon with quantuum effects and deeply connected fields.

I see it as a display or a condensation of other dimensions, as in the Donald Hoffman theory, there's nothing we can know from looking at the surface of the computer screen rendering that would tell us about how the inside of the GPU hardware or software are actually structured. We're seeing the outputs from a hyperdimensional process.

To truly understand it we must expand consciousness into the higher dimensional planes in order to understand the how they all interact to create the appearance of a physical world on the display.

It's become clear to me that with this 3D consciousness we are living in the lower dimensional shadow of an 11(+) dimensional matrix.

The brain acts as a simulator of the world, abstracting the sensations of the physical world and translating it so that the hyperspacial consciousness can interface with it.

Is this related to what your books about?

My book just focuses on the low level rendering, like really low level rendering, and base level consciousness, but it's 100% compatible with Donald Hoffman's theory.

My book uses the analogy of the brain as creating something like a 3D volumetric video television, with oscillatory tomography binding together the phase differences into a coherent picture. It doesn't go into the higher dimensional experiences that people can have on DMT etc...
