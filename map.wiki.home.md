This page represents the table of contents for the book and will serve as the page for navigating to the book notes (still in-development)

To start with I am going to just link text notes to this table of contents, then those notes will be replace with new wiki pages. It's a matter of prioritizing organization over format in the order of operations.

NAPOT.Exit bumping each of them, but perhaps the total signal strength transmitted is somehow divided by each of the branches so that it is dissipating its energy spatially

###: Reading & Writing your thoughts and internal representations. Connecting the human brain to artificial intelligence.


Cycle 1.x Ilya Prigogine: Whole Brain Physics as a dissipative system
**Entified**
Phenomenological Consciousness is the rendered & temporally entified volumetric representation of reality passing between Oscillating Neural Arrays that Project or Incept Renderings to subsequent Oscillating Neural Arrays that "perceive" in their receptive field the information of the previous arrays. Rendered information is perceived in the oscillating sequences of neural arrays in physical information vortex of the brain, resulting in the generation of phenomenological consciousness.

Thermodynamics * maximum entropy (convergent integration of information configuration (synaptic cohesion) in a harmonic resonance field)

the number of possible states range from a single oscillation, between existence and non-existence, between 0 and 1

Why is the brain a Finite State Machine? The total sum of all possible calculations.

maximum extropy divergent dissipative chaotic resonance

Cognition as the dissipation of energy via oscillation, neurons doing collective memory sensation via oscillation + learning via changing connections that encode oscillatory patterns.

equation for cognition, qualia (internal representations) & phenomenal consciousness



A neuron is transmitting its learned synaptic morphology as a phase change, or its learned network connections to the rest of the network when it fires.

Low Persistence

John Carmack: Why I think he went from VR to AI, meaning that I think of how a VR headset works as a possible building block for understanding that the human mind has to create representations of reality, sort of like a game engine, for your eyes to see in the VR headset. The analogy of what a VR set is doing, rendering your perspective, based on your head position, gives us something to think about, in terms of how the rendering in our minds has to change with our head & eye position.
