# "The Role of Exosomes as Mediators of Neuroinflammation in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease"
"Exosomes are secreted by multiple types of cells and regulate a variety of signal pathways through the transmission of various signal molecules, participating in the information exchange between cells (Valadi et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2020)."
Exosomes are Vesicles, lol, that is where a whole bunch of research on Vesicles (I mean Exosomes) was hiding. (humor intended)
"The Main Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease"
"These insoluble Aβ fibrils accumulate and spread to the synaptic gap, which interferes with synaptic signal conduction (Rabbito et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), leading to the formation of insoluble plaques"
"Exosomes are lipid bilayer vesicles with a diameter of 30–150 nm"
"Exosome membranes are mainly composed of phospholipids and proteins" so a vesicle is not just a sack of fat (humor) there is protein in it.
"As an inflammatory mediator, exosomes induce neuroinflammation through information exchange between neurons and glial cells. They can diffuse in interconnected neurons and transport Aβ and tau proteins through the endosomatic pathway and axonal transport (Polanco et al., 2018)."
hmm... endosomatic pathway
"neuroinflammation, neuron loss, aging, gene mutation, metabolism and oxidative stress could also promote the development of AD (Yin et al., 2020), especially neuroinflammation, which is considered to be the third characteristic feature of AD."

# "Protein Clumping Found to Be Common in Normal Aging Process"

Since Covid-19 causes lots of artificial oxidative stress, increases lots of inflammation, arguably we will see the population age more rapidly, and develop more neurodegenerative diseases compared to previous generations of people.

Which is bad for a lot of people. The good news is we might solve aging this year, based on this line of research.

Okay lets rethink this, the protein clumps are causing inflammation, and neuroinflammation is causing AD, and the vesicles or exosomes are transmitting the inflammation that makes us age. 

So really addressing neuroinflammation is a treatment option for slowing AD. Hmm... reminds me of that note on carbohydrates providing neuroprotection

# "Breakthrough study demonstrates the pivotal role of p62, a protein, in suppressing neurodegenerative disorders via selective autophagy"
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/07/220701102759.htm

"Previous studies have reported that the abnormal accumulation of the tau proteins may be selectively suppressed by autophagy pathways, through the p62 receptor protein (which is a selective autophagy receptor protein). Says Maiko Ono, "This protein's ubiquitin-binding ability helps in the identification of toxic protein aggregates (like tau oligomers), which can then be degraded by cellular processes and organelles.""
"Overall, the findings of this study prove that by eliminating and, hence, preventing the aggregation of oligomeric tau species in the brain, p62 played a neuroprotective role in models of dementia."

# "Melatonin ameliorates Parkinson’s disease via regulating microglia polarization in a RORα‐dependent pathway"
"Neuroinflammation caused by microglia activation is one of the most important mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease (PD)1. The death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is multi-factorial and mechanisms responsible for the cell loss remain largely unknown. As the barrier of innate immunity and a main mediator of inflammatory response, microglia cells can be activated, secreting a variety of pro-inflammatory factors2. Microglia activation and increased inflammatory burden exacerbates the pathological consequences of PD3. However, the relationship between microglia activation and DA cell loss needs more investigation."
