the brain reacts to information
"We have scientific data supporting the idea that environment shapes behaviour."

Reasons inform behavior. Not the environment.

Wind speed and air temperature over time make do not shape what color socks you choose to buy.

The brain is able to instead react directly to information patterns, with advanced neural circuits that compile vast memory databases of complex coincidence patterns mapping out associations between causes to allow the brain over time to predict shapes and other sensory based metaphors through which it builds an information based understanding of the world we inhabit so that information patterns that we call understanding are actually the patterns that drive human to move or make complex decisions like choosing to buy a Tesla vehicle.

The environment isn't doing very much to shape behavior, its mostly reasons, aka criteria causality.

Some of these ideas I learned about from Peter Tse https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neural-basis-free-will
