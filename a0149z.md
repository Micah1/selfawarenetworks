# 3D Phase Topology over time in the brain imagined as Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor series.
3D phase topology over time in the brain imagined as tensors in a high dimensional Taylor series, oscillatory physics transformations with bistable reaction-diffusion, threshold criticality & choice via path bifurcation of inhibitory interneurons circuits.

I want to say that if each action potential event creates a phasic pattern, and that a sequence of phasic spikes, high phasic spikes, tonic spikes, and inhibited spikes will produce something like a non-linear sequence that could alternatively be considered to be a dynamic linear sequence if we are just considering the sum of the brain's state at something like millisecond intervals of time. It's a dynamic linear sequence temporally in terms of the activations in the brain's 3D graph of neural arrays. The phase change at each synaptic cleft is imagined to have the significance of a temporal tensor in 3D space. We could compare the phase states at each interval or frame of time as components of a Taylor Series, like the phase changes are imagined as Polynomial Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor Series.

Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

So that a sequence of action potentials is effectively recognized by the brain as a series of coincidence patterns in time & space.

Even in the inhibitory interneuron areas of the brain the highly branching nonlinear neuropaths can be compared to 2 dimensional Taylor Series Polynomials being tracked by the brain.

Perhaps the frequency / duration patterns at the neuron level are being converted to frequency / amplitude patterns at the dipole or EEG scale of brainwaves.

So the question is, if each action potential phase in a phase sequence can be considered like a vector changing it's value as a polynomial in a Taylor Series (Calculus), that provides one way to think of how the brain might turn bits of detected data in a neural array, like the eye, into a recognizable shapes in the visual cortex. As the sequence proceeds a curve, if there is a curve, emerges, sort of like a continuous function being learned by a Universal Approximation Theorem, except that in this case the neural firing sequence is able to physically map to contours of learned 3D visual representations, but the same geometric learning process could be at work for all the other senses, and that might explain why we can think of our other sensory representations as having spatial & time characteristics or characteristics that change over time and area. Such as feelings that have a start, a peak, a low, an end, feelings that start in our feet, chest, neck, head, or some other space that we can describe to others.

This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

Consider:
"We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."

Consider:
The phase field of the fovea appears to have a topographical distribution over time.
"with center frequencies that decrease from the center (i.e. the fovea) toward the periphery of the visual field"

Consider 
# Object-centered population coding in CA1 of the hippocampus
"Only a small number of cells fired consistently at the object location, or at a fixed distance and direction from it; yet the majority of the cells showed some change in their spatial firing patterns when the object was introduced. At the neural population level, these changes were systematically organized according to the animal's distance from the object."
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.07.499197v1

In both situations you can describe changes in the spatial distribution of frequencies, in other words a topological phase pattern over time. 

In my thought experiment I am taking the Taylor Series from Calculus and applying it to a 3D grid of phase changes. 3D Calculus. With each phase change that is tracked by the brain representing a different step in a Taylor series representing the information content of the rendered mind *At least the phase topology as a brain state is an attractor point for the mind's oscillations. 

Consider
# "Multidimensional Taylor Series and Symmetric Tensors"
https://0fps.net/2011/08/30/multidimensional-taylor-series-and-symmetric-tensors/

In essence the rippling of memories, evoked from the connections of single neurons, to it's inhibited exit terminal, to the next neural array, are going to, in an inhibitory interneuron network area of the brain represent a sort of 3D Taylor Series, that can represent any kind of learned pattern, in high dimensions, basically via Universal Approximation Theorem & Calculus.

"Widespread ripples synchronize human cortical activity during sleep, waking, and memory recall"
https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2107797119

So the action potentials that are initially triggered represent either the beginning, middle, or end of a learned sequence (in what I am describing as a 3D Taylor Series in something like a Laplacian Matrix whose virtual fabric is the 3D brainwave state transforming over time.

Choice as a Neuropath

IE what I said about choice at the neural circuit scale yesterday 
"In my opinion, choice, at the neural circuit scale, is the neuropath taken by action potentials in interneurons, not located in one region of the brain. Memories ripple across the whole brain. PRH is one convergence point for visual/tactile decisions. Looking forward to your paper/poster."

Appeared in a paper today. Coincidentally. Of course it's not a new idea anyways. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.08.499294v1

Here is another supporting source of the idea that memories are distributed across the whole brain, and that what is read out from an area like the PFC (Prefrontal Cortex) or PRH (Perirhinal Cortex) is just one part of a whole brain network activity with a distributed memory structure that interacts with memories that ripple across the brain.

points back to the work of Steven Strogatz, György Buzsáki, and others on oscillations & sync (in physics & neurophysics)
The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

Here are some quotes I pulled from the article: 
"Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
"if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
"Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

To go into more depth on how the physics of oscillations might manipulate information states, consider that information is not just a change in a phase pattern, but it's also a change in the synaptic pattern, and the phase patterns are not just electric, magnetic, chemical, there are also anything receptors are receptive to, such as mechanical vibrations, but the understanding the potential interactions of these phase based brain state transformations via the physics of oscillations will require some mathematical physics modeling.

However the above topics are about the physics that govern how our minds transform information, like how we process inputs into organized patterns, but this a topic area that you can crunch down into a folder and label "transformations that happen to the topological phase field over time" that the neural network of the brain is tracking like a 3D Graph of Tensor Polynomials in a Taylor Series (Calculus) for 3D Neural Networks.

# Main Point:
These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

Interesting paper from 2020
# "Integrating information in the brain’s EM field: the cemi field theory of consciousness"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7507405/
"I describe the conscious electromagnetic information (cemi) field theory which has proposed that consciousness is physically integrated, and causally active, information encoded in the brain’s global electromagnetic (EM) field"

One of the main differences I have from 'the cemi field theory of consciousness' is that I think of brainwave oscillation as an attractor point, but the neurons are the decoders, and without decoders the information in the brain's electromagnetic spectrum has no meaning, it's just a wave. So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave projects at multi-cellular scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.

# None of this can happen with just an electromagnetic field alone.

I argue that the electric field and the magnetic fields in the brain are EACH relevant as attractor points in the brainwave oscillations (of tempo-spatially distributed phase changes), and these brainwave fields serve as attractors that drive oscillatory activities such as coupling, decoupling, synchronization, desynchronization, tuning, detuning, phase precession, and oscillatory phase coherence/decoherence (and my argument is that the phase differences are information states, like short term expectations, or attractors (that serve as information configurations) for short term memory oscillations)

The electric & magnetic fields, as brainwave patterns, as fields of phase changes, help maintain the oscillatory state transitions of your mind's information, meaning they represent some part of your mental expectation in this moment, and the transition to the next moment. Also while the Electromagnetic field is one thing, there are big differences between what is happening with the magnetic dipoles and what is happening with the electric dipoles, according to EEG & MEG measurements.

In short, with reference to  'the cemi field theory of consciousness' I think it's oversimplifying things a bit. In other words it is handwavy to suggest that a singular EM field is itself a conscious entity.
