# 3D Phase Topology over time in the brain imagined as Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor series.
3D phase topology over time in the brain imagined as tensors in a high dimensional Taylor series, oscillatory physics transformations with bistable reaction-diffusion, threshold criticality & choice via path bifurcation of inhibitory interneurons circuits.

I want to say that if each action potential event creates a phasic pattern, and that a sequence of phasic spikes, high phasic spikes, tonic spikes, and inhibited spikes will produce something like a non-linear sequence that could alternatively be considered to be a dynamic linear sequence if we are just considering the sum of the brain's state at something like millisecond intervals of time. It's a dynamic linear sequence temporally in terms of the activations in the brains 3D graph of neural arrays. The phase change at each synaptic cleft is imagined to have the significance of a a temporal tensor in 3D space. We could compare the phase states at each interval or frame of time as like components of a Taylor Series, like the phase changes are imagined as Polynomial Tensors in a high dimensional Taylor Series.

Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

So that a sequence of action potentials is effectively recognized by the brain as series of coincidence patterns in time & space.

Even in the inhibitory interneuron areas of the brain the highly branching non-linear neuropaths can be compared to 2 dimensional Taylor Series Polynomials being tracked by the brain.

Perhaps the frequency / duration patterns at the neuron level are being converted to frequency / amplitude patterns at the dipole or EEG scale of brainwaves.

So the question is, if each action potential phase in a phase sequence can be considered like a vector changing it's value in a Taylor Series Polynomial, that provides one way to think of how the brain might turn bits of detected data in a neural array, like the eye, into a recognizable shapes in the visual cortex, because as the sequence proceeds a curve, if there is a curve, emerges, sort of like a continous function being learned by a Universal Approximation Theorum, except that in this case the neural firing sequence is able to physically map to contours of learned 3D visual representations, but the same geometric learning process could be at work for all the other senses, and that might explain why we can think of our other sensory representations as having spatial & time characteristics or characteristics that change over time and area. Such as feelings that have a start, a peak, a low, an end, feelings that start in our feet, chest, neck, head, or some other space that we can describe to others.

This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assembles will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns as that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

Consider:
"We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."

Consider:
# "A model of the early stages of the human visual system: functional and topological transformations performed in the peripheral visual field"
that the phase field of the fovea appears to have a topographical distribution over time.
"with center frequencies that decrease from the center (i.e. the fovea) toward the periphery of the visual field"

Consider 
# Object-centered population coding in CA1 of the hippocampus
"Only a small number of cells fired consistently at the object location, or at a fixed distance and direction from it; yet the majority of the cells showed some change in their spatial firing patterns when the object was introduced. At the neural population level, these changes were systematically organized according to the animal's distance from the object."

In both situations you can describe changes in the spatial distribution of frequences, in otherwords a topological phase pattern over time. 

In my thought experiment I am taking the Taylor Series from Calculus and applying it to a 3D grid of phase changes. 3D Calculus. With each phase change that is tracked by the brain representing a different step in a Taylor series representing the information content of the rendered mind *at least the phase topology as a brain state is an attractor point, for the mind's oscillations. 

Consider
# "Multidimensional Taylor Series and Symmetric Tensors"
https://0fps.net/2011/08/30/multidimensional-taylor-series-and-symmetric-tensors/

In essence the rippling of memories, evoked from the connections of single neurons, to it's inhibited exit terminal, to the next neural array, are going to, in an inhibitory interneuron network area of the brain represent a sort of 3D Taylor Series, that can represent any kind of learned pattern, in high dimensions, basically via Universal Approximation Theorem & Calculus.

"Widespread ripples synchronize human cortical activity during sleep, waking, and memory recall"
https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2107797119

So the action potential's that are initially triggered represent either the beginning, middle, or end of a learned sequence (in what I am describing as a 3D Taylor Series in something like a Laplacian Matrix whose virtual fabric is the 3D brainwave state transforming over time.

Choice as a Neuropath

"These data suggest that projection-specific sampling of brain-wide inputs provide a circuit design principle that enables feed-forward transfer of visual threat to be independently adjusted to produce context specific behavior."

# Choice Inhibitory / Interneuron ref fig 11.5 Buzsaki 2006
IE what I said about choice at the neural circuit scale yesterday 
"In my opinion choice at neural circuit scale is the neuropath taken by action potentials in interneurons, not located in one region of the brain. Memories ripple across whole brain. PRH is one convergence point for visual/tactile decisions. Looking forward to your paper/poster."

Appeared in a paper today. Coincidentally. Of course it's not a new idea anyways. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.08.499294v1

Here is another supporting source of the idea that memories are distributed across the whole brain, and that what is read out from an area like the PFC (Prefrontal Cortex) or PRH (Perhinal Cortex) is just one part of a whole brain network activity with a distributed memory structure that interacts with memories that ripple across the brain.

points back to the work of Steven Strogatz, Buzsaki, and others on oscillations & sync (in physics & neurophysics)
The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequences for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

Here are some quotes I pulled from the article: 
"Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
"if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
"Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."
