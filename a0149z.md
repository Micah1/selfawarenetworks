I want to say that if each action potential event creates a phasic pattern, and that a sequence of phasic spikes, high phasic spikes, tonic spikes, and inhibited spikes will produce something like a non-linear sequence that could alternatively be considered to be a dynamic linear sequence in terms of the activations in the brains graph of neural arrays that we could compare the phase states at each interval or frame of time as like components of a Taylor Series Polynomials.

Further, that non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

So that a sequence of action potentials is effectively recognized by the brain as series of coincidence patterns in time & space.

Even in the inhibitory interneuron areas of the brain the highly branching non-linear neuropaths can be compared to 2 dimensional Taylor Series Polynomials being tracked by the brain.

Perhaps the frequency / duration patterns at the neuron level are being converted to frequency / amplitude patterns at the dipole or EEG scale of brainwaves.

So the question is, if each action potential phase in a phase sequence can be considered like a vector changing it's value in a Taylor Series Polynomial, that provides one way to think of how the brain might turn bits of detected data in a neural array like the eye, into a recognizable shapes in the visual cortex, because as the sequence proceeds a curve, if there is a curve, emerges, sort of like a continous function being learned by a Universal Approximation Theorum, except that in this case the neural firing sequence is able to physically map to contours of learned 3D visual representations, but the same geometric learning process could be at work for all the other senses, and that might explain why we can think of our other sensory representations as having spatial & time characteristics or characteristics that change over time and area. Such as feelings that have a start, a peak, a low, an end, feelings that start in our feet, chest, neck, head, or some other space that we can describe to others.

This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as a phase variation sequence, and spatial & temporally derive the shapes of patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array.
