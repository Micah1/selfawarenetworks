a narrative about conscious perspective probably not going in the book
As I see it the physics or Isness that created me guides the braincells interacting with the ecosystem of life to develop predictions in reaction to life experience, and sequences of patterns over predictions becomes my inner life narrative, a song sung by the 200 billion plus vibrating neuron instruments in a symphony of I amness through which my musical soul is inspired to achieve G_d's greatness, my intuition is a narrative crafted by the physics of the Isness defining my souls path, my intentions, wants, desires, actions and results are defined by this mathematical creation preceding consciousness even, to what then is the illusion of a choice that defies the law that I am, the law pf physics, no choice can be independent from the truth of the divine nature within us all, and this is why hatred is immature, this is why destruction of another is from another point of view the destruction of self.

Life is a dissipative system, consuming energy and exporting chaos to maintain some stability as long as it can, it is fundamentally isomorphic to the spinning hurricane, or the spinning galaxy, or the spinning possibilties of a quantum particle in super position.

We are not in the cosmos, we are it, the human mind has more connections than we have visible stars in the sky. Your mind is on the scale of an entire galaxy, its that massive inside.
