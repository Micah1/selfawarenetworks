(criteria, causation, neuron) 
you lack only criteria satisfaction causation * a new idea, the only thing that causes muscles to move, and dollars to be spent, is criteria satisfaction

criterial satisfaction causation, when cells are satisfied by information criteria, muscles move   

I think criteria causation, the process that allows neurons to become pattern detectors, is how information becomes reasoning which drives choices and decisions. So it's the criteria satisfaction causation that makes people choose this or decide that. This idea is a fusion of choice and determinism really. So to answer your question, if a person didn't choose to be single by choice then they are not in the driver's seat of their own life, they are letting circumstances decide their fate, all of which is an illusion anyways, the powerful person, who has really good fate, is forced by criteria satisfaction causation, to believe that they are making really good choices and living in a choice universe. While any person who is single who doesn't think they are single by choice basically doesn't have any money, or any power. Yes it's my choice to be single, although criteria detected by my nervous system is the reason behind my reasoning.
