When you think, when you come about like, okay, let's say like, well wait a second, what is the difference between a television and a human being? What's the difference between a television and a human being, right? What if the television was, what? If every pixel what was learning every that the when it was going to fire, right?

00:29

So what if every pixels learning when it's going to fire? So it's learning visually everything that comes through the television. Okay, but then it's like okay so every pixels learning when it's gonna fire and then you have a lot of pixels that are learning to, let's say that you chain link a lot of pixels together.

00:55

So it's not just the x and the y coordinates, but it's also the Z coordinates. So there's z-coordinate pixel. So it's like, imagine you have a TV screen that's just not, it's not just the screen itself, but it's layers and layers of of pixels. Just so you have a TV screen and behind that if another TV screen and find, that is another TV screen and behind that is another two screen until you have, as many pixels in depth is you have horizontally, and vertically so it's like a cube, instead of like a TV screen, the TV cue, right?

01:32

And every pixel in this TV cube is learning when it's going to fire. It's going to learn to say, oh I see that all these other pixels are lining up. So I think I'm gonna fire soon. And then at some point like Every time I see the word bike, I'm lighting up.

01:57

I know I'm gonna fire every time I see wheels, I know I'm gonna fire. So I know that the word bike and the pixels associated with wheels our associated because they keep happening together in some and some temporal, spatial and physic coincidence. Okay? And then and then like, even if there is no like, at some point like even if they're like, even if there's a distance between the temporal phasic and and spatial coincidence, even if there's a dissonance, it would be possible for me to recognize bicycle after a certain amount of time with this with this.

02:43

If all I had was a, a cube, a television hue, okay, that learned okay. But then but then at this point, I'm only representing visual information that could include words. I can include words right there or the coincidence of words can be connected to the coins to acquaintance of the of the objects of an object.

03:10

The coincidence of words can be connected to the principles of an object, right? So I can make those connections. So then so that's at this point. I have like a sort of visual language memory like a visual language. It's like language visual component language and the in the pixels.

03:31

Okay. Would I what what comes next are associations to other modalities? What another modality would be like hearing audio if I can hear, if I can hear. What's going? What's happening then? Okay, so let's get back to. Okay, so but what is the observer? So the observer, so this is the this is this is the magic here.

03:58

The observer is this you have a temporal, you have a temporal oscillation and the supercheus net in superchasematic nucleus, that's 20 million neurons. But a lot of the brain has these big groups of of neurons oscillating that I'm going to argue, is the observer. And what's being observed are the different, or the differentials that that that happened to individual neurons in the observer in the oscillator, so that the differential.

04:31

Right? So like when something so one, something particular, like I see a red shirt, okay, red shirt. I see a registered across the street, have all these neurons, they're gonna fire for to light up. A concept of red shirt in my contest, thought space. Okay, right. And I have all these, all these what happens is, they're all firing in, they're all gonna cause a bunch of normally oscillating.

04:55

Temporal oscillators to fire out of the normal sequence, a bunch of a bunch of micro. So like all to see, when you have a neural oscillator, you have a lot of neurons that are all oscillating together and when you have a something significant happening like a red t-shirt, then what happens is you're going to get to a point where I your causing a disturbance from the norm and the oscillation of a sac oscillating themselves and some of those cells are going to have their temporal firing patterns become misaligned with the group.

05:42

And that causes all the neurons in that group to recognize that pattern because the act of recognizing that we can because they're all physically altered by that pattern. Because what happens is, the group has to pull that the diversion oscillator neuron back into equilibrium as a whole. So, if the group is oscillating at like 20,000, if a group of neurons, is operating at, let's say it's 20.

06:15

Let's say the groups neurons system is oscillating at 20 hertz. Okay? And then you have what you have is you have a red shirt and the red shirt cost us a small number of neurons to have an oscillation deviation of approximately three milliseconds. So they become three milliseconds out of sync with the oscillating hole now, because the oscillator has to, there has to be an equilibrium between the neurons that that were two or three milliseconds out of sync with the normal oscillation and the normal oscillation.

06:58

So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.

07:33

It's what I'm arguing is, I'm arguing that when an oscillating when oscillator gets out of sync, right? Because of a trigger. The whole oscillator. Brings it into sync again, but the the, the journey. So what I'm saying is like, in order for that to come and sink, you have to have energy in the higher oscillator that's dripping down into the lower oscillator.

07:58

I think so. I think it's gonna be like instead of, instead of it's gonna be like 20. And so, let's see. The all the neurons are oscillating at like 20 Hertz. Well then if you have one that goes up by three milliseconds it's it comes out of alignment by a matter of milliseconds, you know, five milliseconds, 10 milliseconds, two milliseconds, whatever, it becomes out of alignment.

08:20

With the oscillator. What I think I'm gonna argue is that maybe the oscillator goes from a 20 hertz. Oscillator to a 19.997 oscillator and that's the total oscillation is decrease or increase by the activity of individuals gradually and a very granular scale. So, what's happening is, you're getting an equilibrium.

08:48

I think between the micro oscillators and the macros layers or there's any, there's an equilibrium that's being sought but that would change that which change in my new way. It's a total oscillating pattern, but whether it does or doesn't, maybe everything gets back to 20 hertz, okay? Maybe it doesn't change that much.

09:10

It doesn't really have to change because just a fact that you have you have something. It's like it's gonna be like, it's gonna feel like there's a magnet, right? That's exerting. An electromagnetic force on the things around it. That's what it's going to feel. Like for the austers. The oscillator knows.

09:30

There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.
