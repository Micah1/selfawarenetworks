New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

Each map page is a time-stamped copy of a wikipage. The wiki pages ought to be time stamped but I have not yet discovered where it can be shown.

  32: ⟪ 360 characters skipped ⟫ns allowing it to observe, learn from, and coordinate activity pattern learning on each column of neocortex, allowing the whole brain to be in spacetime holistically aware of every part of itself. As frequency patterns in the brain play out across time, space, at at multiple scales. 

a0010z.md:
   8: space is particles with either energy or mass, and the energy state is the frequency of light speed times mass, frequency and amplitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as amplitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.
  16: spacetime is the frequency 
  26: in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator
  46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel.

   45: imagine the rest of space is also a computed phase field that is relative to the minds computed phase field but it does not have the same dense spatial frequency configuration that the brain has that allows for sophisticated systems like short term and long term memory, just like how a leaf does not do the same thing as a cpu you or a gpu
   59: ear is a frequency analyzer
   62: taste frequency
   65: the visual cortex is responding not to patterns but to frequency wave forms
  149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)

a0020z.md:
   8: as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation
  10: A tonic Alpha oscillation might respond more to the sensory frequency expectations of day time, whereas Delta frequencies are slower and closer to the expected sensory frequences during the late night and early morning.
  12: but perhaps the expectations of feet are going to be attracted to a different powerband that better scales its frequency patterns which ought to be different from

  4: What if our brain's ability to more accurately control devices that read brainwaves are influenced by the feedback we receive through our senses. That is to say what if there is a certain sound frequency or visual patterns that act as a feedback to say we've given the correct signals to the EEG (?) that our brainwaves are on the right track?

  42: gamma ray bursts are high frequency patterns in the hologram
  68: 7. extremes of heat/cold is expansion in the space axis, but the neutral temperature of space is at oscillatory equilibrium and represents the tonic frequency of space
  70: 11. The maximum frequency of space is equal to the maximum oscillation, where they become each other. A single oscillation, that splits into two, then four, then eight, and it doubles for infinitity and then back to maximum, like a finite state oscillator pendulem of spacetime

a0027z.md:
   9: the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.
  25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

  11: but many of the incoming sensory paths are in the alpha powerband frequency range, so maybe alpha, beta, and gamma frequences can be considered phasic
  17: I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia

  439: If I build a wax cylinder audio recording device I have decided to model the vibrating air molecules with a groove cut into the wax. The audio frequency response of the system is limited by the physics of the diaphragm and needle that is cutting a grove into the wax. I select the hardware in this system to give it the frequency response I need for the application (human hearing range). The grove in the wax is a model.
  445: If I digitize the vibrating electrical signals from the microphone into a stream of bits, and store those bits on a flash memory card, the electrical charge patterns on the flash drive is not my model of the vibrating air. As the engineer, I choose the sampling rate of the A/D converter and the simple frequency which sets the dynamic range and frequency response of the model. These are all parameters of the model I select as the engineer of the system. The fact that I decided to use a digital format that had fixed rate sampling and linear encoding of the samples at 16 bits in stereo, are all parts of my model. I could have selected 8 bit using A-law algorithm for dynamic range compression instead of linear.

  15: This interesting visual of an AI attempting to correlate changes in the brain state at a macro level with speech processing in an artificial neural network. The visual correlation they created in the above link I think provokes the idea of sensory data traveling in waves anywhere & everywhere, distinguished from other sensory criteria by the frequency or part of the powerband spectrum, which is why heat is distinct from vibration and that is distinct from sound, and that is distinct from light, and yet all these different frequency range patterns in the em spectrum can be correlated into a unified or entified pattern or rendering for the conscious person to experience because they have common spatial & temporal occurances across the 3D grid of the human brain & body.

  197: particles orbiting other particles to expand space when their phases )time frequency does not match
  211: the fusion of patterns of the same frequency causes time to exist for more slowly moving patterns whose configuration now takes longer to iterate because it is moving more slowly through time

a0048z.md:
  17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

   84: a rock doesn't have an information learning feedback loop, or a strange loop as Douglas Hofstadter describes with some frequency.
  153: but when you understand that consciousness is an array of information signals shaping a network structure, and is shaped by that structure, or that structure is also shaping itself via a specific frequency range of phase coincidence and inhibitory coincidences and alternating decoherences.
  206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  208: In neuroscience the freq amp relation is called the 1/f frequency.
  210: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets
  253: the expansion of space time is like amplification of space through the slowing frequency of time
  255: the density of mass is like the contraction of space through the increase in time frequency
  309: the frequency of time is the inversion of the frequency of space

  13: so the neuron is physically capable of learning a vast number of representations that sculpt its action potential into a frequency pattern that represents so something like an instance of a modality for one frame of consciousness, you would need many such hertz firings perhaps to represent a painting, temporal hertz patterns of many spatial hertz to represent that painting over time as you were moving in front of it. The rows of neurons that are collecting the electrically charged ions are doing the physical act of listening the collecting charge is the screen you are watching, the molecular structure is recording to the electric charge and the observer is the tonic oscillator while the words of the mind, and the content of the mind including our sense of space itself arises inside the notebook or canvas of the mind that is a spectral electromagnetic graph, with magnetic and electric dipoles as created by the oscillators interacting and the differential between them and phasic firing neural circuits in multi-level fractal patterns
  15: ⟪ 396 characters skipped ⟫l pattern in the grid of cells consisting of hertz frequence patterns as initated by action potentials of all sizes, from synaptic to axon. ie our neurons are creating our screen as a hz pattern or a frequency based topogical  electro-magnetic pattern on oscillator graphs at multiple scales and our other sensory representations are connected into it as fast phasic firing rate neural activity on branching topological patterns that represent actived areas of the tonic firing graph and also the quieter inhibited area creating a sort of dot matrix printer for inner representations, everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and feel. Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

   56: How many dimensions does a echolocation image have? Intensity, Frequency, and Time for each ear.
   63: Micah Blumberg But you still have to put the intensity frequency and time in the right location spatially, with a lot less information about where things are, so there is a lot of figuring out space with little information to go on
   72: Juan Carlos Kuri Pinto We don't have the Color, X and Y dimensions in echolocation. Blind people use the intensity disparity of both ears and the intensity disparity in time in order to induce spatial structure. Blind people use the frequency asymmetry of patterns in order to induce the different sound sources.
  210: and spatial/temporal representations of each higher level of the hierarchy (again without knowing the data in that hierarchy, it's filled in by the hierarchy, the spatial/temporal association is built by the frequency of activity in each sector.
  212: or you could store the timeline locally, on the actual hierarchy, like a dendrite. each node in the hierarchy has nodes that count the frequency in which they become part of a representation identified by the upper level or lower level.

So that your brainwaves are driving an isochronic stimulus which sort of massages your thinking in a broad range of frequency patterns specifically for peak moments in gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta brainwave activity.

  12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?

  19: It's a self-aware network in 4 dimensions rendering a 4 dimensional pattern to itself that is reactive to the world and able to make prediction-based models of reality with sparse spatially & temporally distributed frequency/phase patterns that represent coicident neural firing or coincident neural inhibition deviating from the oscillatory norm of a given oscillator on some level as observed by the neurons in the oscillator, and by oscillators or circuits or cortical columns linked across the brain thanks to the activity of interneurons and major intersections of traffic such as the thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, the tempo-parietal junction, Werneck & Broca's areas and other areas of the brain that are highly connected or connecting multiple regions of the brain together.

a0080z.md:
  11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as

   95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
  111: ⟪ 523 characters skipped ⟫-type models (such as Kuramoto, for ex.). You can consider the spike as a delta pulse (for mathematical tractability), but you can also consider it an alpha function with variable latency, amplitude, frequency, rise and decay times. You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..

   7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency
  11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
  19: The idea is that because of the All or nothing principle the duration of the action potential is more precisely inverse to the frequency. 
  21: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
  23: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
  27: So the idea is that when we have high frequency bursts the duration will be lower, and when we have low frequency bursts the duration of each burst will be higher, because there is an inverse relationship between the duration & frequency. 
  31: Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

a0090z.md:
  30: I think this is also one of the mechanism for how people's EEG Powerband spectrum becomes in sync with another person's EEG Powerband spectrum when they speak to each other. It's that the frequency of the words are translating
  32: the frequency of the transmission from one person's voice to another has an entrainment value, like listening to brainwave entrainment, binaural beats, isochronic beats
  38: the soliton waves representing a virtual data object, a hz, that was put out by part of the brain. It's a hertz or a frequency, like light is a frequency, but its also a stable wave, that represents a pattern that is part of a pattern when combined with the other patterns.

    78: ⟪ 619 characters skipped ⟫, the signal traveling doesn't resonate the full network of forks, so the ones that dont are inhibitory to the signal coherence of the information, whether encoded by the on/off analogy or the actual frequency variations
    81: see I was in a discussion the other day, talking about how the synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable amplitude and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
    82: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.
    83: but the amplitude of the wave matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and amplitude also.
   146: dont they need a coherent beam with a predetermined frequency before being sent through the other wave source in order to properly extrapolate the change the coherent hz experiences
   166: so what if you were to measure the frequency from the electrodes and group them into categories like
   230: well tones synchronize better if they are closer together in frequency, like 10hz apart
   351: so in theory, any frequency with additive syncronized//harmonic resonance
   373: the brain is firing in all frequency patterns all the time, awake, asleep, it's all there, feel free to combine them.
   481: you will want to guide each person, to perhaps listen to each specific frequency for a length of time before beginning the eeg recording.
   482: to give their neurons time to tune into the frequency
   629: also you can type in any other value into any of the nine frequency values
   743: You should know I am waiting until I get my new computer, install all my software, and get back to San Francisco before I begin the frequency tests with brainwave graphs. The project is going to start in the beginning of May. I wanted to tell you about the delay so you don't think I have forgotten this research.
   976: I was thinking about attention binding in the brain today, as a temporary frequency acceleration that creates a kind of field distortion,
   980: it's a strange idea, because the frequency difference creates a contrast, that is a polarity from the entanglement equilibrium
   986: I've actually looked into attention and awareness as a field of specific sequences of neural frequencies and activity patterns directed by a functional argument that describes different types/levels of attention/awareness, where the field is sort of like a superposition of entangled frequency values and their composite subset entanglements
  1008: ⟪ 313 characters skipped ⟫ result from q-variants and invariants within the full sequenced field, which the neural networks measure and relate perceptual neuroanalysis of data variations and connection parameters etc, between frequency and composite frequency variances and invariants within the sequence measure and determine such values from equilibration nature between q-em energy exchanges/ entropy between different q-state entropy differentials within the sum sequential the quantized field?

  19: so space is expanded because its area is the high amplitude of a low frequency
  21: stars are crunched because the high frequency (velocity, relative time of action) corresponds with less area less space and less amplitude

  11: The point is he takes the Sx variation, maximizes the information content (his dialog about max and min reminds me of how a dendrite sensor branches out to maximize its data sensation potential, and minimizes its data collection to a phase pattern with duration & frequency properties and then passes that phase change to the array represented by its exit terminal)
  21: I gather that one can encode the abstract prediction of a JEPA as a frequency that resonates away into its layer after some number of intervals related to its duration and that would bring JEPA closer to biological realism, or JEPA could be combined with back propagation or combined with reinforcement learning, but interestingly in this model neither back prop nor reinforcement learning is necessary for JEPA to differentiate and reason about it's goals.

  36: Micah: I mean with EEG frequencies in the brain, isn't an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency observed and referred to as 1/f? I guess I could be misunderstanding the use of 1/f.
  40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

  6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

  93: Today I practiced imagining myself quantity my sources of stress as circles streaming out of people, and the quantity, frequency, magnitude & scale of those circles represented a quantification or the delta of stress from that particular person, from that casual body, this inner visual metaphor of my environment with people inside it provided for me, and for brain which I think of the environment for the rendered self and the rendered ecosystem a new program from which I was able to understand my sources of stress and my responses to those sources of stress better. As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.

Tse dismisses the notion that consciousness could be quantum, because the brain is too warm for quantum coherence, (the temperature would scramble the "you" frequency). He also thinks that indeterministic quantum fluctuations could interfere with the timing of a neural oscillation just enough to make a human unpredictable to any machine that was not able to simulate or predict all the quantum noise in a person's brain. That's the boring part.

  14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync
  37: sparse quantum pattern learning/prediction is probably better for high frequency low amplitude senses, such as olfactory, maybe taste, but taste is also texture which is about high amp high surface area. smell, emotions, and point clouds have a lot less mass and a lot more energy, so quantum signals represent a sparse sample learning spread over a large area
  45: beta, high frequency, smell, emotion, wind
  59: ⟪ 300 characters skipped ⟫ expansion in time of the phase field phasically firing parts of the grid pattern that includes each interval of time which expands or enlarges the entire pattern of one set in another set. The scale/frequency ranges up scale patterns up, and the brain also scales patterns down thanks to sparse signalling over greater distances, this kind of signalling might be good for balance. But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales.

  6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  58: at the quantum scale the frequency is higher, but the amplitude is less, and perhaps this allows the brain to infer patterns from smell, and patterns from sparse quantum clouds that could represent emotion
  64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
  79: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
  80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

  113: "neural spikes which are the carriers of information" Yes AI people who have opinions on neuroscience largely think this is so, but I don't agree. What I am saying is just opinion based on actual neuroscience I have read. I think singular neural spikes can represent just noise. While bursting and or higher frequency patterns can represent but one form of information transfer. Most of information transfer in the brain is probably subthreshold (brain-activity that does not cause a neuron to spike) There is probably a lot of chemical activity involved in information transfer that is subthreshold. I view spiking as a sort of retroactive indicator of brain activity, like blood flow it allows us to "read minds" or "plot" the activity of minds, via implanted electrode chips, eeg, meg, or fmri. The spike, I think, it's just a discharge, like a waste product, removing an excess, and like blood flow it's about removing heat, and reducing the inflammation of cells.

  23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends.

We find that the surprisingly rapid frequency-dependent broadening of APsyn is enabled by a unique molecular combination of Kv1.1/1.2 channels with the Kvβ1 subunit. Indeed, this small broadening of the APsyn mediated by Kvβ1 has a tremendous impact on synaptic transmission as the loss of the Kvβ1 subunit blocks synaptic facilitation even during paired-pulse stimulation without altering initial vesicle fusion (Figs. 4–6).” https://www.pnas.org/content/117/47/29937

   4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.
  17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

  13: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
  15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

   12: how high frequency has low amplitude and low frequency has high amplitude
   16: from reading Buzsaki I dialed into the fact that frequency is the inverse of time.
   18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
   28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

Cells can detect patterns by firing at a high Gamma frequency ONLY when a specific pattern is recognized via a multiple possible path of near simultaneous presynaptic neuron firings within about 3 milliseconds of one another resulting in the recognition of a pattern via a phasic soliton wave that will cycle through a neural circuit being recognized by other parts of the brain doing pattern recognition.

  23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.

  7: When you have an experience, that is actually a sequence of sensory moments linked together in time. Each of those sensory moments is correlated in the brain by a group of cells that fire together. If they fire together with some novel frequency they begin to associate with one another, so that when you have a slightly different experience, that is vaguely similar to the experience you had previously a different group of cells fires that may include one of the cells from the other previous group of cells the fired, because one member of the original group of cells fired, it's associated partner cells shift into a ready state, they are now expecting to fire. This is the basis of memory-prediction in the brain. Now it might be that when you have a thought, you are having somewhere between 100 thousand and 100 million memory predictions being triggered in close temporal and spacial proximity. However despite these large complex numbers, the essential mechanism of memory-prediction is the same.

It is a three part protocol, increasing brainwave frequency for one session, and decreasing for another, similar to the research by Dr. Olmstead for treatment of ADHD/ADD http://www.avstim.com/manuals/olmstead_dissertation.pdf. I further enhanced the sessions by starting at delta and using Dr. Len Och’s technique of stimulating ½ HZ above or below the most dominant brainwave for each of the brainwave groups. These sessions are to be done once a week, not on consecutive days. The third session is a maintenance session based on Dr. Och’s protocol of alternatively stimulating a fraction of a HZ above or below your dominant frequency in 2 minute intervals between a 3- 30 HZ range. A video of him describing this technique and its overwhelming success can be seen at MindPlace’s YouTube site. http://www.youtube.com/themindplace#p/u/17/RMcoB98xKts .

Though more rapid than beta waves, gamma brainwaves have virtually unnoticeable amplitude and can be found in every part of the brain. Gamma waves serve as a binding mechanism between all parts of the brain and help to improve brain function and perception.
  10: Beta  are the brainwaves of our "normal" waking consciousness, of our outward attenion, of logical, conscious and analytical thinking. High frequency beta ("splayed beta") is seen with restlessness, stress, anxiety, panic or while our inner critic or commentator is active. Splayed beta can be differentiated from the low frequency beta of the awakened mind, when thinking feels clear, alert, creative and to the point.
  20: Theta brainwaves are the second slowest brainwave activity. Theta occurs when your conscious mind is disengaged, such as in dreaming sleep, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and deep meditation or self hypnosis. Many adults only attain the Theta brainwave state in their sleep, and can not seem to reach or sustain the Theta state when they are awake. Interestingly, the planet Earth resonates at a Theta frequency of 7.83 Hz, a frequency known as Schumann Resonances.
  31: Delta brainwaves (3 - 0,5 Hz) are the brainwaves of the lowest frequency and represent the unconscious. If we only produce delta we will find us in dreamless deep sleep, but we also see delta in various combinations with other brainwaves. They may then represent intuition, curiosity, a kind of radar, hunches or a "feeling" for situations and other people. Delta is often seen with people who work in therapeutic environments or professions and with people who have had traumatic experiences and have developed a "radar" for difficult situations.

Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors.

It's probably close to the truth, but I also have a good argument for why the neural network cosmos is not conscious everywhere all the time. 1. is that you are not conscious everywhere all the time, 2. your brainwaves fall into powerbands, the whole spectrum of possible brainwave frequences is not activity, just certain powerbands, certain frequency ranges with names like alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma, high gamma, etc...

That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas).

The electric dipole activity and the magnetic dipole activies might also be detected and correlated by the human brain.

  288: It's like frequency and distance. All right, so space and time are
  291: Frequency and distance.
  294: Oh shit, space and time are frequency and distance. So essentially what I'm saying is like the distance as is a space frequency, distance is a space frequency, share? Okay, it's a frequency and and which spaces more slow. And slowness is distance and and, and it's called. But but where space is more dense.
  303: Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.
  549: He can lower frequency and mass increase.
  552: Actually, the diversion of frequency and and amplitude. So masses, the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
  555: Is it masses? The amputee. That's inverted to the frequency of energy because mouses energy moving out more stories and masses. So mass is the energy.
  558: By dancing with energy for they to the frequency of
  561: To have to relate to the frequency, and positive, two planets for. So planet, that rotates is ultimately flashing positive and negatives.
  786: Different things is interesting. I guess the magnetic field is a different frequency range compared to the electric field. Maybe has created here. Then mechanic works have even greater skip.

   36: It's kind of like these are they're different phases, different phase patterns, different phase speeds. It's really the different phase velocities, right? That's the difference between I would say this, that's why a neutron and a positron. And and I try and do not merge. It's because they have different a different frequency patterns and and they have different amplitudes.
   54: It's frequency increases, then it's going to be smaller and faster, but it's going to be smaller and faster and
   99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  102: Or as I say increases with increasing mass or decreases with, and increasing frequency,

b0059y.md:
  37: So you have more that you can go to the from the parameter cells to the intern neurons, to the thalamus and get to the thalamatic radios. Things through about like the delta frequency, right? It's a much slower frequency. The top of the court six layer and it moves more slowly.
  40: It's lower frequency, higher amplitude. And I think of it, as more of the observer of macroscale patterns time, and then I think a
  46: So but it's interesting that there are gamma whereas there's so there's like a low 40 hertz camera and the Delta frequency rates it shows up. It's very interesting that it doesn't. So, but I would say that I would suspect that the the high frequency
  52: But just a hypothesis it's gonna be like this rate is like the frequency gets reduced over time, but the amplitude grows up and that means that the the sixth layer is like the observer. And are they like the? It's like the that's where the it's like it's like when you look around the world imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull a little bit.

b0064y.md:
  44: They're being made at in the Delta frequency across the layer. Six of the so it's like decisions. High level decisions are gonna be made made across the entire top of the brain which is the slower moving part of the grand district or in that that's part of it like this.

b0065y.md:
  25: And and so this allows to have this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency, right? And, and so sense.
  49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  55: And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?
  61: It's really a lot slower than sensory and potato but it's but it's, it's bigger picture. It's it's a higher amplitude. So it's it's more network. It's when the network comes together, the highest levels and the Delta frequency.
  64: But yeah, so but think of your reality. Like when you look around, like, when you walk outside Mercedes, you're inside the opera frequency. Innocence you're being your video perspective. On reality has been rendered inside the alpha pregnancy and the lower reasons of your cortex, the visual stuff in the visual reports, the auditory stuff, and there's an audio cortex or auditory cortex.

   43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  327: This triggers some ideas for amplifying the human sense of smell, by considering how the shape of a dog's olfactory bulb, and the rates & types of its signal pathways are different from the human nose. I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

  101: It's that by the, it's different, it's it different in the face field, right? So color is a different frequency, but the frequency is to your brain, is just a difference, relative to everything else. And so, your brain has this sort of like, mental map of functions that are sort of, sort of rendering color based upon the comparison of contrasts and a phase field, right?

Then they're going to start to, but put in a lot of energy really fast, right? Because they're transmitted, they're sending energy faster, but if they arrive slower, what's going to happen is, they're this because there's a one F relationship between amplitude and frequency in the brain.
  94: What's going to happen is that these neurotransmitters are going to, they're going to basically a, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a high amplitude, low frequency burst, which is going to, which is going to, which is going to

   31: Can be easily compared to another pattern. In terms of the the changes in scale, sorry the changes in relative scale between functions. So you have a pattern that has that is about planets and stars and it can be like a pattern that's about the the different different scales between stars and planets and in terms of like, what is the frequency of
   63: Frequency from the Neurotransmitter or it's only receiving the phase change and each of its synapses and a phase changes instructed to and instruct us and give the synapse instructions. I want to do next or some sort of rule. It's an absence follow as far as what they do if they receive different types of signals.
  102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.
  363: The patterns inside have such a high temporal frequency of correlation that as soon as one fires it fades away but in but but many other parts of the brain simultaneously, catch it and then they've been in, they catch it and then they transmit it. And then their transmission is caught by other parts of the brain and then they catch it and transmit it.

So, the seeker is this sort of, like, high frequency, basic seeking this pattern. It's always like incomplete and always hungry and always wants always desires and always leads to suffering but also always leads to life.
  265: And it has has, and it's not, you can even render. Tactile sensations. The render that patterns associated with feeling. You could render them but it's the it's it's it's not just the, the pattern is looping together in a feedback loop. It's also the frequency, it's the, it's the it's specifically the temple.
  268: What makes us human like what makes our minds human? Like is the temporal spatial frequency of the oscillations of these patterns.
  271: Of the oscillations of these matrices of patterns. This is temple space for frequency. So you could have the I should say, more than that, it's the temple spatial frequency of the of this circuit that interlaces different sets of of patterns together.

   9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  95: Open up a lot faster depending on what receptors are over there. And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.

b0103y ctpr.txt:
   31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
   93: And, and the rush of potassium opening would would either inhibit the cell or it would cause cell to shorten the action potential, right? And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
   95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to Facebook burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
   97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
  103: Maybe even like high frequency, it would be gamma. That's what I imagine that. You gonna have a little bit more of that, I have to check. And then the the towards the, you know, the top, the at the pyramidal cell level actually, when you get into, you know, I would expect to have more delta up there and because
  105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  229: In the third layer, it's going to be activated by the, by the coincidences that are below it and so it can detect. So because it's like a sparse pattern detector, right? It's looking for, really just like connections between two points that is paying attention to within within a certain frequency range, right?
  291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,
  293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  319: Okay. So, but what is interesting, is that, you know, in experiments with, you know, like low frequency trains. So so they use high frequency to to high frequency stimulation to evoke long-term potentiation, right to evoke action. Potentials which have that's when you are going to have more spikes, more, high frequency spikes and it's going to create inhibitions I guess as a reaction to those bikes.
  321: But when you feed the brain, a lot of low frequency trains like of electrical simulation like one hurts that that might inhibit basically inhibit short-term memories. In the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude, low frequency,
  323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better. Have studied LTP and LL DP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude, low frequency LTD signals, basically, stimulating the brain with like, a one herbs frequency, that is going to de-synchronize groups of neurons. That is going to not be synchronized.

  317: So duration of it is going to be longer or and and that will affect how many vessels get really. So a longer duration or longer duration I so I'm still trying to figure out if the longer duration of the action potential means of phasic.

b0116y.md:
   17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
   20: But low frequency. So I'm interested in financing but I also want to know if the way form the action potential is is characteristic of and information containing electrical patterns such as a soliton wave that would contain a wave shape. That could convey a tone, right? (it doesn't have to be an audibe tone, because it's in the context of information theory it's an information pattern because of the rarity of its distinctive signal relative to the tonic signals nearby. So it creates contrast in the mind of the brain that the organism's collection of cells is perceiving at multiple scales)
   29: So, their information is contained because they are distinct. Distinct tempo. Spatial frequency characteristics. As if the four dimensional temple, spatial frequency is being transmitted.
  119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

b0124y ctpr.txt:
   11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
   13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.

  37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

   17: Lets talk about the value of trying to convey meaning, through tonic repetitions contrasted with higher frequency deviations. Like trying to create waves of meaning with songs or hymns or verses like repetitive tones versus surprising tones, like 5 hmms and 1 hey. The hey is surprising, and information theory that hey has more meaning than the repetative hmms.
   25: In the recording I sound out different tones and I speculate that the beginning of spoken language may have been just differences in tones. (A tone is a frequency pattern that has time & space characteristics). Distinctions in phase patterns are good enough for us to make sense of words, to listen, speak, write, but this is also what our brains process, they detect information as coincidental firing phase sequences (sequences of frequencies over durations).
   62: As signals pass through each area, the deviations that are happening (by deviations I mean decoherence patterns deviating from the tonic synchrony in the alpha, beta, theta, or delta frequency power bands) modify our perception of reality in real-time. The deviations in cells especially in the exit from the cortex to the thalamus modify and are modified by the signals from (or going to) the neo cortex, enabling whole brain activity that brings together our history of learned memories with new information from the environment.
   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
   84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.

  12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  14: Like everything that's like below high gamma. So like low gamma and high and all the betas and alpha data and delta like those power bands are perhaps you're like low amplitude neurosurgeon set attract coop cooperation because they're low amplitude.

  44: But oscillator itself is going to insert a sort of attraction to pulling that smaller.

   4: Soliton Waves Neurons Pattern Frequency
   8: For it's going to become inhibited from depolarizing. And either situation, the reason other neurons noticed that is because they were going to, they were expecting a certain like they're expecting a certain cadence, right? And that cadence is the time frequency and the tonic frequency is being so there. So with their with their feeling first and foremost is their own skirt, okay?
  16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
  22: I cannot hear frequency. I could turn like a piano tune could be playing a scent like this out and like audible frequency but now audible to human years. It's sort of like it's an electromagnetic frequency that only
  44: So, for salt and away is going to refurbating with the same hurts frequency as the action potential, okay? Is the at the shape of the action potential is going to define this the this, the results and wave mission. And this also and it could be that they the neurons are so complex.
  74: So the dendrite is noticing the cadence. It's going to be coming. Inhibited from the pull up from the horizon and either situation, we telling us that this is because they were expecting, they were expecting, neurotransmitters at autonic frequency, and then they either they eat those neurotransmitters in order to complete a certain pattern.

  47: Every time it's a reflector of water, it's there physical manifestation of movements that changes. The, the reflections in terms of I'll let your magnetic frequency in terms of the shape, the shapes of electromagnetic frequencies and then in turn and that reflection. And then in turn is detected by the end transform and encoded by the detected, by an encoded, by an embodied.

  12: Spatial and phase characteristics. What frequency? Each part of the space-time grid is his active and and so the brain is able to track and build a model of the, some of the frequencies and sort of like trace. The in almost like trace to path, like by representing by representing different, like through movement, different parts of the model of the universe.

b0162y ctpr.txt:
  65: That could be a fourth dimensional. Meaning, there's there's fourth dimensional. I mean, there's there are spatial properties to emotions in. There's temporal properties and there's also phasic properties. It's not just spatial and temporal was also the phase in each location of the temple. Spatial as it's actually have a frequency and and and if you could draw if you could draw a frequency through just one dot through one through one point of one vector.

b0167y ctpr.txt:
  11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.

b0174y ctpr.txt:
  23: He was saying, basically no point in plotting out the three three dimensional location of of the source localization because all that data is contained in the and the frequency data, right? He just doesn't believe this any point in fighting it out.

b0187y ctpr.txt:
  17: Uncensored. Little and common, besides basic, besides either, like a basic frequency pattern, or they might have a temple inspiration. It's not like, there's actually more physics. It's not like there's obviously some work business between associated with opinion and so the way that was created,
  31: It's the field of photons that are bouncing off of everything. Causing the that the light to change. It's frequency based upon the color of what is refracting off of. So that your eyes can collect that frequency and then interpret the world as a 3D model that you the character are walking around inside and crawling around inside or lying around inside.

b0194y ctpr.txt:
  15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?

b0195y ctpr.txt:
  242: Not really, I think. AP is actually the wrong word is think of the is the sort of electrical spec from the dendrite and the electrical space from the dendrite. They go to the Soma, right? And you need to have a certain number of these arriving, was in a certain frequency to, to represent a pattern that has been that, you know, that that the that it means that neuron has detected a certain pattern.
  264: So even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired it sooner or later than it normally fires, that's just this temporary pattern but this actually what we want. Because like imagine that when you move from the left to the right, not only is it the case that neurons need to fire.
  326: This is the event baboon, I don't know if that's right. Maybe that's something I sound but but that is a, that is a different. It's not a tonic frequency, that's a phasic frequency, it's a phasic pattern. It's phase of frequency pattern and so you can say it, we can go into.
  328: Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.
  330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that Facebook firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
  352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.
  376: The right. That is a frequency. It's a frequency and has a spatial characteristic, too. Where is it sound coming from how loud? Is it? How big is the sound? How quiet is a sound? 
  379: But it has spatial. It has sound, doesn't just have a frequency. It has associated characteristics. Has spatial characteristics. Where's the voice coming from? Does it come from this room? It's coming from the next room. Is it coming from yourself? Is coming from somewhere else? Just spatial characteristics, the sound has.
  437: And but the thing is like, okay. Well, now, what if you see a dog and has the same time, right? So idea, is that not only, you know, so we have these these patterns that. Yeah, the basic patterns is like when phase of pattern flat is when a neuron fires out of at a much higher frequency than the usual tonic frequency.
  439: You get a bunch of neurons and different areas all firing at a time frequency and they all have. And then there's this. Some there's there's some of the internal so they've got neural columns. You've got no micro micro columns. You've got large columns, you've got small, neural circuits or just groups.
  473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
  507: And then there's the actual moment feeling which is when that you've got those pianos are being planned. When you have the big action, potentials firing if higher physic frequencies. This is the thing that happened right now, that's the highest frequency before we land. The neurons are like listening, seems like multiple scales of data collection from from synapses to dendrites, to the summer, to be that to the activity output of an entire neural column to to an intern neuron that travels between neural columns like a long distance, internal that receives that that basically allows patterns to travel from one region of another so that you can connect incoming audio data temporarily with incoming visual data.
  565: I really mean if you put an electric strip and someone's tongue and connect it to a camera so that the so the pixels in the camera are going to stimulate different parts of the person's tongue based upon whether they're receiving light or not. And what frequency that light is and that person would be able to see via the signal sense of their tongue.

b0209y ctpr.txt:
  29: Now you say well now wait a second. If if whatever you feed individual neurons gets wiped out. Because here's his thing is, we're thinking there's this thing. There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
  41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.

b0229y ctpr.txt:
  37: Types of properties, it's in. Those could be frequency time mean.
  39: Space frequency timing and space frequency. I mean like the face is frequency and microscopes like hurts, what is a regular frequency and then the timing
  43: Sound like a deviate but it is going to sound like an idea in terms of frequency, but it's also going to be in terms of timing and in terms of space, all at the same time, like any change in any one of these is going to result in changing and the others.
  45: But what kind of macroscale, right? You see, lots of neurons that are making lots of sultan ways each with a number. So it's like each one has a position property right? X y and z, where the x is the frequency. The y is the timing.
  47: Why is sequence time? So there's a frequency. There's a sequence time.
  61: Now, the way, that's the reason I said, waves it, so the action potential has a waveform, right? The shape that determined by an amplitude and duration. So has an amplitude and a derision. Now, it was a second. It has a frequency an altitude duration, the amplitude, but they're all that it's tied together the duration.

b0230y ctpr.txt:
  25: That is manifested in terms of like it's either going to. It's either going to have a faster frequency and there's with a smaller scale or it's going to have in slower frequency with a broader impact. And so because there's two possible situations, the firing speed of, the neuron could be excited.
  31: It's in between excited. So they're looking for a frequency that's going to allow just going to allow frequency, it's going to allow it to be on the edge of either excitation or in addition

b0232y ctpr.txt:
  13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
  31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?

b0233y ctpr.txt:
  15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  21: The way that the greenness represents a phase pattern, a phase pattern is accomplished by the frequencies of light and so yeah. So, you're your phase in it. Your year on frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern, The frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern. And so if you have but actually is all right.

b0234y ctpr.txt:
  29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
  57: The, the brain has to has to tune into a frequency pattern and then sort of copy it. But if you have two brains and they can each tune into a frequency pattern and you start them on dramatically different frequency patterns, then how do the two brains come to sync?

b0235y ctpr.txt:
  87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.

b0236y ctpr.txt:
  31: So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.
  43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.

b0241y ctpr.txt:
  27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  33: Because okay, here's the thing. If you have in the supercharges medic, nucleus? Right? Let's say if I, it hires that, what what does it fire at? Oh gosh. I forget, but let's just say fires like you have 20 million neurons. They're all firing at the same frequency, all right?
  41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.

b0252y.md:
  343: ⟪ 297 characters skipped ⟫ples of EEG per one sample of of MRI data, but we can sort of like say that we can we can look at this and we can, we can create a correlation or in our data between the EG data and and in the slower frequency MRI dear and they were doing that with afternoons and some people still do that with avengers because regular affairs is slower than EG.

b0263y ctpr.txt:
  81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?

b0267y ctpr.txt:
   49: Frequency information. That's not right. There are there are people who are you know? What's that? It's Bill Murray. Yeah. There there people are people who like who are super smart researchers, but they're deep learning researchers and they honestly believe that neurons are dumb. They think that neurons are just dumb like, you know, like like they're not capable of understanding patterns, they're not they're not capable of distinguishing between do two types of patterns.
   63: Between like these are these are non-neuron cells that can do this and neurons are more capable than these non neurons cells, so I have this opportunity here to sort of like basically like design a new perceptron a new artificial neuron a new artificial neural network, that is not just frequency information but it's.
   65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
  113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  228: Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.
  231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

b0269y ctpr.txt:
  6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?

b0271y ctpr.txt:
   79: So that's the idea of the artificial neuron is it's going to convey information by attack by a by touching that same neuron three times instead of in one instance three times in one instance. Because so it can so yeah so that's patient information so it's like yeah, we have a frequency information frequency is like I can tap you three times.
   83: In two places at one time and three places at one time and one place at one time in no place at one time and then in two places. And so I can send a spatial I can encode spatial patterns. Abong the frequency patterns I can code space patterns on the frequency patterns.
   87: I'm gonna send you a spatial pattern with every with every frequency pad. So, it's like you get a frequency pattern. We get a frequency get a special pattern. You gotta okay we see this thing it's not us. This is the frequency pattern can also have an opportunity. So you can have basically the temple spatial and a face.
   93: No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.
   95: What's interesting is that is that in the book? On intelligence, he talks a lot about how there's their temple patterns and there are frequency patterns. And. It's really a really there's three types of temporal there's frequencies and there's phase. Pair and the thing is like, okay, so. The reason those are different is because I'm sorry no this.
   97: I'm sorry it's. So actually so there aren't so there's temple other frequency but those can be converted into like you can have a wave light that can convey combine frequency so it's actually there's temple there's spatial where you're checking stations, okay, you can you could decode space your information as frequency information you could okay, but the problem is that.
   99: That you're. Taking something that is you're convert your converting. Right so anyway, so you have your phase information so basically yes, so you have so if you have a frequency a frequency could encode beats like binary beats and you could. Decode spatial information from frequency information, right but. You're still losing a lot so I'm talking about it's like yeah this but here's the thing say so you're you're.
  105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.

b0276y.md:
  579: So I pass on different frequency patterns to other people.
  582: In fact the fact of speaking. Different frequency patterns are being transmitted in each stage of a word being spoken in each step of award being spoken and it's probably none see Asian of any word to be spoken. Those are sequences that are represented by different.

b0277y ctpr.txt:
  69: So you have so you have you have imagined your tree and it collects all these diverse inputs. Now what happened was in computational neuroscience, they reduced they reduced them that single spike because it's not because spike is like it's not just spike. It's a frequency rate of spikes. So you got to reduce the end of the spike you're like well, okay, well we could pass along more information if we do like, You know.
  81: So they got more out of a neural network. So the original perceptron was just on or off. And like okay, we'll use a vector representation we'll get more information out of it, but you're still only getting frequency information or or time domain information and. But so we'll multi-vestical release means spatial information so you've temporal information and you're missing spatial information and and this is a hypothesis but I but I that I had that it means spatial information and in fact that's true because if you you're not has between 0 and a neuron has been a neuron in the neocortex has between 0 and 3 vesicles.

  198: Within the radio frequency range that had affected them just wondering if you could win on this and just wondering if you know, whether this type of thing has been weaponized. I'm just curious. I was intrigued by the story. So, I actually haven't heard of it. Is this something from the UN circle?

b0302y.md:
   322: Energy if we talking about the full spectrum of the frequency from sonic vibration and then to static EEG and then from static EEG and then they go higher to light and then our is our reading devices are targeting into the correct spectrum of the original signal to the brain to trigger some action and or metrics of memory to trigger a movement or something so is the researchers aware that the full respect.
   325: Of the frequency that we are researching now they are limited to the EEG limited to a light lightweight but do we look into the area of the spool spectrum and the change reaction of the energy change form so that we can drew into the most foundation of the original signal was created and done speaking this year.
   328: Okay anybody want to go? I don't know the answer does anyone else want to answer it? I am. Of what you are saying sorry Dave, but um, are you talking about the actual frequency is in like what hurts um, like how many hurts like for example? I use low intensity repentive transcranial magnetic stimuli stimulation, which is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and we use that to modulate those neural pathways and you can use for example one hurts.
   334: Field point of view you are reading from the frequency point of view but the full spectrum of energy transformation that if you are doing how to say do master the whole change of the transformation, then we might only research on the certain area in a gap that we don't know that after this EEG from one hertz a vibrate intensively a transform into another and other type of energy that can be measured also so so I'll be reading at.
   343: Signal of for example calcium signal or chloride signal then we can also visualize that activity. So we can and then the frequency actually did some work recently where a changed basically a memory from. Like. I I listened to the long-term memory with high frequencies simulation and then I turned down this memory like I did compulsive behavior.
   346: I I generate a compulsive behavior specific one to a specific movement and turned it into a compulsive behavior with high frequencies stimulation and then I did low frequencies stimulation that is known to introduce LTD like long-term depression and then I, Got that that compulsive behavior back to our normal level with it, so frequency matters for simulation.
   368: The measurement of the neuron of the energy of the neuron. What is the are we doing like core screened measurements or you know, basically getting like very precise changes in energy and infrequency and an amplitude and and and so on I I want to say that there we can add more to what what's being detected in terms of like amplitude and we can go even in it in more detail back to Kettering in a second, but the reason what Katerina said was very was a great.
   374: What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.
   377: You know basically but then the other thing that that Caterina said was that the the grant in terms of you know, the granularity of the encoding when you're talking about, you know, like first of all eliciting elicit illicitating a long-term memory with with high frequency stimulation and then generating compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation, so basically making this like stimulating this neuron so they can basically or micro, you know, micro circuit or micro column or cluster of neuro cluster of.
   380: Cells it represents the neurosur circuit whatever catering stimulated in and you welcome to give us more detail on that in a second that caused the animal to have a high frequency response that what what generated compulsive behavior and then Caterina reversed it by using LTD long-term depression to issue a look frequency stimulation.
   383: I mean to use low frequency stimulation to basically calm down the animals behave. Or to slow down the the high frequency firing of that neuron or that micro cluster of neurons and and it this is this extremely profound because it speaks exactly what David is saying about the the the granularity of the of measuring and stimulating or the course coarse grained measurement and coarse grained stimulation of of energy at the neuronal level and the micro micro circuit micro neural circuit level so I want to go ahead and hand it back to can arena if you want but I just wanted to.
   389: Yeah you explained that's really what? Thank you so much. And sometimes explaining it. Because I'm doing the work so it's sometimes you're stuck in the subject so it's harder for you to explain it but yeah that's um that exactly what we are seeing that the the frequency of the stimulation that type of which which type of input is stimulating these brain cells and in the slice at least which which doesn't always mean it's one hundred percent also and, Vivosystem the same way but at least in the slice we can see also that the location of where we stimulate in the dendritic arbor makes also a difference, so we need to weigh less, um, Way less um synapses to be stimulated on the distal areas of a dendrite in the striatum then in if you get closer to the solar then you need more more sign up to the activated and that's because the the dendrite the dendritic arbor the shaft like, Not this fine the the eyelid selves the chef they ask thinner, so I bet the spine size is still the same so the impact of those mines being activated is bigger, so um strong inputs of chorus.
   503: I'll show you the experiments of it helps anyone the thing is those all those organisms don't have a skull they won't. Whatever bacteria you're viruses, they don't have a skull and also those papers that came up that 5g is make something called arranged that on and those those don't it was shown that those high frequency they don't go through the skull at all, it's really really hard actually to get signals deep into the brain so I.
   506: I'm quite doubtful of that being if if that would be the case it would be actually very happy we wouldn't need to do all those brain surgeries you could just blast things and people would improve like practice there there's TMS with very very high magnetic fields, you can simulate brain regions and there's a bunch of studies like that then at MIT and others where you change plus the city depending also on the frequency, but you need really really powerful.
   885: And it so goes back to I so I was at the the grocery store and I had this idea because I was listening to Katarina. And the other day and another talk where we had some other great speakers and so the idea was so Katerina was just saying that earlier before many people came that she was she she managed to stimulate a mouse to basically she elicited long-term memory with high frequency stimulation and then generated a compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation and the mouse has had like impulsive behavior.
   888: And and then she used a low freak frequency stimulation to induce LDT and long-term depression and that caused the the animals compulsive behavior to go away. So that's an upcoming paper that she's working on. It sounds really exciting but what was what what I was thinking about a lot was well, what is the role of of high frequency stimulation and and low frequencies this?
   897: We over ourselves and so people who have less self-control who interrupts too much that maybe they they're they're interneuron system is damaged and you know, and maybe people have or ADHD have a dysfunctional internal system or in him. Atory system and and and then and then maybe we could solve that if we gave people low frequency stimulation to induce LTD in those areas that were really, you know, they had too much stimulation.
   909: And they found that a disregulation of the immune system and the brain can lead to such complicated behaviors like social anxiety. Which then explains a lot about autism disorders. So yeah, it's a really cool thought and is we're going on towards that direction. Frequency versus low frequency stimulus a you're talking about the electric stimulators.
   924: So it's I was just gonna say it's really interesting that the same paradigm also applies in a less precise way with clinical RTMS where you know, 10 hertz high frequencies stimulation as opposed to increase activity of the dorsal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but if you, Stimulate at one hertz which is relatively low frequency it actually inhibits and what people do is they'll use high frequency on the left hemisphere and low frequency on the right hemisphere because of somewhat dated ideas that there are some laterality in depression pathologies such that you have under activity of the left hemisphere and over activity of the right hemisphere.
   927: So it's it's really interesting to see the same sort of pattern of high frequency low frequency stimulation of sort of being sort of recapitulated at a larger scale. Yeah interestingly totally.
   930: Easily so we you know, we all are more complicated than we realize and you can you know, you can do a lot of work finding out and tracking and mapping these um inhibitory pathways and excited to pathways and because obviously if you stimulate with high frequency and inhibitory pathway, you're actually then inhibiting that part of the brain even though you're using excitatory simulation.
   936: Then it's you know, there's extra layers. I guess to. So the light the frequency your printer is the pulse frequency is there right and yeah exactly so the the light the blue light opens up, um positive ion channels which then do polarizes the cell and then generate some action potential and then we have the opposite effect if one puts on puts in the cellular adoption with the yellow light, you would activate a chloride pump so it have high.
   978: Oh so in terms of the the granularity with an early ink or with oxygenetics potentially like what what the catarano did was she listened to long-term memory with high frequency stimulation generated compulsive behavior with high frequency simulation in a mouse and then so so maybe I don't know if that means like the animals hand was was was moving compulsively or something like it's it's arm but then with low frequency stimulation the the long-term depression was induced and the animals a limb stops moving in the Then I I've been thinking about this idea well what if for a couple days actually what if the inhibited inhibitory interneuron system that Katarina was talking about yesterday what if that dysfunction is sort of like responsible for things like attention deficit disorder and it turns out that is that's that's that's um, that that was a good guess because there's a lot of research in that area there is you know, Ketteringer product that the inhibitory neuron system might be damaged in the case of of Alzheimer's and then, It was it Alzheimer's and then also I think the one that came up was autism and nervousness if that was another thing that came up which is these are all very interesting things that so basically we're talking about like okay well would would a person gain more agency if they had more low frequency stimulation basically inducing more more long-term.
  1128: But. If you want to be precise at some point and to really fix tissue again in a precise way. I think you you have to one day go that route because you know that those implants. Doesn't matter he does different simulation and humans because it isn't neurosurgeon and you have also over time that you have tissue dimensional electric stimulation and then it doesn't work anymore after a while and then you have to adjust the frequency or the view implants and, And so on and so forth like the electric stimulation how we do right now and humans have also a lot of complications so.
  1251: I mean, they're pretty easy to entrain with different firing rates, you know, especially how genetics we do that all the time with the rhythmic systems is can these subset of cells and train the rhythm in order words in other words, like what is the minimum necessary amount of cells that you can stimulate within a repeated fashion that's in a different frequency than that of the normal biological frequency and can you entrain that rhythm so that It resets it and you can kind of figure out the underpinnings of what is the minimum necessary circuit in order to take control of whatever function is that you're measuring and we do that all the time but yeah, it's a you know, it's an interesting thought that you know, perhaps we don't necessarily need to stimulate as much as we do you know, you can you can take three neurons and control 30 of them something like that.
  1390: I should see if I can if I can pull my notes up right here, she was able to basically elicit a long-term memory that involved height frequency stimulation from an animal and then she had another animal to generate the compulsive behavior with high freest high frequency stimulation that matched that frequency and then so the animal then began to exhibit the the, Compulsive behavior right because because it was based in this high frequency stimulation, but then she used low frequency stimulation to to induce LDT which is a long-term depression and what happened was the animals compulsive behavior went away such so that's sort of thing is like has been demonstrated in a mouse what's also a demonstrated amasses is them, you know, taking a scanning base the basic primitive memories like fear and, Like a fear response to a certain thing and then transferring that with opportunities to another mouse so that's it's an example of reading and writing to the human to to a brain and when we have the high definition of neural link we're gonna have high definition reading and a high definition writing capabilities in the future, so maybe a high definition image.
  1669: In one area you may have a compulsivity disorder right you may have you may interrupt people too much you may I don't know you may have too much stress to you know, like maybe maybe there's some length between PPT SD and certain or OCD and a certain parts of the brain that are stimulating like basically over stimulated and so if you could if you could basically estimate the stimulate those those parts of the brain with, With a low frequency stimulation and induce LT LD LTD low, basically the idea is that you could make that behavior go away and and you could so basically by using you know, either high frequency stimulation like 10 hertz or low frequency stimulation at one hertz to stimulate or inhibit different areas of the brain.

  36: The amount of information that one neuron can pass along and to the rest of the network but but and so the the whole the whole thing is like everything in deep learning and deep learning is like reduce to you know, you have this network but it only is processing frequency information for the most part it's not processing spatial information and when when you can if you could, Wait, like we can say like now with the latest research that has been that this the perceptron is basically invalid it's based upon this this space upon.

b0308y.md:
  126: Yeah did he say something about a frequency versus timing issue? In different yeah, he did that he was talking about. When you're doing like so hit that but that came up in the context of the scalp measurements with eg and he was trying to say that with the. You're getting like.
  129: I think I think it was something the fact like you get it you're you can get a time series but when you're talking about the power bands, you're not you're not you're getting a frequency and it's not also it's not like sort of disconnected from the time series like if you just use a four-year transform it's like just frequency is not also time but then like if you use like wavelets and use the the the other kind of fourier transform, I forget what it's called, but.
  132: Then you can oh yeah, so like so if you're doing for if you're doing like a 40 transformer on I'm not not on the whole not on all of time, but basically on a very discrete amount of time or if you're doing like wavelet then you could. Then you could have both time and frequency domain if that makes sense.

b0309y.md:
  71: I think that would it wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control but but it might change the the oscillation frequency of your. Of your. Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.

   656: What he had ever experienced before so so he started have some serious health issues and and so then but then he so after he had this, you know months later he started to to reconsider basically TMS is basically like being a descendant of electrical therapy. I know it's it's it's there's a lot of differences, you know, I've looked into it a lot there's a lot of you know, I guess you can get very specific about the frequency patterns and the direction of where you're sending the stimulation and and and so it's not if It's.
   710: Right on right on I and by the way, I'm I so I guess if was the founder of TMS was at Lenox. I don't remember there have been so many people revised the technology, I mean, we had a Japanese person in our lab who further refined the coil and frequency technology after that and we had another postdoc who did from Caltech actually she came from Caltech and she quotes called she created another new coil design so you could say that there was an originator yes.
   764: It is a brain stimulation device that uses red and so so infrared and near infrared light to kind of like, Basically penetrate through the skull and stimulate the brain and kind of entrain the brain to fire at a particular frequency. So for example people's Alzheimer's they find that when they use EEGs stimulate study people with Alzheimer's with the EEGs, they find that they have a reduction in in the gamma band and the gamma band is associated with you know, some of the higher order cognition, you know, like insights creative creative endeavors.
   770: ⟪ 722 characters skipped ⟫e light at the tip of it and then on both sides of their temples, they have this electrode with a light and So these electrodes have powerful lights that fire at the at the infrared and near infrared frequency and so these these these lights are supposed to be powerful enough where they can penetrate the skull and and then these lights are meant to oscillate at the gamma frequency.
   773: So when when when Alice Congress patients are stimulated with this brain stimulation device with is all it is as a light it's light at the infrared frequency in the near and freight frequency and they flicker the light and I think It's like 50 hertz that could be wrong about the exact words, but whatever hurts is the gamma frequency the gamma band and they flicker the lights at the gamma frequency.
   776: And and they've found that this treatment actually has FCC in treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's and what they found is they in order to kind of like come up the next donation of how it works is through some mysterious mechanism, we don't know what the mechanism is whenever is a brain is stimulated by light that's at a particular frequency so somehow the neurons detaches that they're being stimulated by light and they will do this thing called entrainment where they will synchronize with the frequency that is being.
   779: Stimulated so I mentioned earlier that people with Alzheimer's have a reduction in the gamma band in in injuries, so when you stimulate the brain with a gamma frequency and the neurons, you know, the they will tend to synchronize with the gamma with the stimulation so you can you're kind of like training the brain to recapitulate its ability to fire at gamma and this is this has been shown to work this has been shown through clinical trials it initially worked in rats, so they developed.
   980: Um, I think I'm well, I guess I guess I'm what I'm trying to narrow down sort of like. Because there was a guy a scientist who proposed a way that quantum effects could affect memory. And and but it doesn't is um, it doesn't directly connect to some other ideas of memory and so there's that in there and then there's if people who talk about you know, how basically, you know, the quantum quantum range is if is a frequency range, I mean it not sorry do I misspoke maybe I'm getting tired and definitely haven't but so now the quantum range is like we're talking about very small things right this is this is common knowledge and we're talking about.
   986: Of atoms and electrons and and particles. And electromagnetism we're we're there we're at that frequency I guess but I mean, but still it's it's it's it's I don't know if so but then there was this guy so there there's this guy who. I guess let me pull up his name real quick, so if you look at the Wikipedia for.
  1021: They're fun ideas. I mean, absolutely I'm also wondering about the frequency. I feel like you know. Maybe it's like a certain brain frequency that helps you that like there are certain times when you can like not psychic powers turned on you know what I mean? Like when we were talking about the gamma rays and all of that before.
  1036: If you are if you're next to somebody long enough you can begin to learn their their circadian rhythm. Right. You can begin not just their circular. You could begin to learn their rhythms like they're behavior rhythms. Your mind will just remember the frequency at which they do certain things.
  1097: ⟪ 277 characters skipped ⟫ere the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  1121: Okay, so okay, can you explain it's a super primitive question because I usually think about the brain is just having like temple and spatial frequencies but but but maybe someone else can argue the brain has temples facial and phase frequencies, but what is what is phase in this context it's shifting the frequency so instead of sending like 450 gigahertz you spend you send 451 or you modulate between 400 and 451 and you do it in increments of 20 megahertz and as you do that.
  1223: ⟪ 663 characters skipped ⟫eresting very low cost so so in I just I came in a little bit late but to be clear you're developing a technology that is able to measure the let's call the biological oscillation or the vibration or frequency of what you pre-engineer design as the frequency that corresponds to the genetics that people represent as.
  1226: The first COV2 virus or what causes covet. We just detect the virus using its electromagnetic signature in a similar way to how radar is able to bounce some radio waves off of a plane and characterize which planet is yeah, okay like spectral information or spectrographic technology now how are you characterizing the signature frequency that's specific to the star COV2 virus has it has yet to be isolated when?
  1236: Or of this whether the virus is within your finger or whatever so you've mapped the signature frequency of covet to a level of specificity or tolerance. That you can put something on your skin and then that is pre engineered to receive whatever you and you organize it to have or engineer it to have it can read that highly highly highly highly specific signature frequency.
  1246: I'm just saying in regards to they're being for let's call on base pairs or for nucleotides that are really a wide variety of combinations all of those combinatorial matrices or experiences creates a quote unquote individual frequency or vibration the idea that you're able to one get those nucleotides to get.
  1276: Can you I didn't miss the earlier discussion, can you repeat the keyword to search for the radar the the Google SOLI SOLI yeah so many censored by Google a tab advanced technology something so um, I was wondering I don't know if you've heard of race in the race machine but I'm wondering if you could potentially target the frequency and I think it was like from the 1930s and the idea was that you could find out the frequency of the like molecule that.
  1363: So we don't suffer as a as a species. Oh, so just to be clear there is upon but I just don't have any idea if it's accurate or I would guess it's probably not but um, if you haven't seen it, I can get the coffee. Certainly What would you ask Um in terms of a good frequency database like there is one that the associated with the right machine but I don't have any idea for the accurate.
  1405: Rephrase the question sure so so one person's biofield is is being broadcast within the frequency range of another person's biofield are each of those persons biofields powerful enough to change the phase temporal and spatial patterns of of the other part of someone else's DNA and someone else's biopia field.
  1545: It's about three minutes, right? So here even though there's a one you showed a technical graph. I saw it as actually the frequency is that about 3G 3G hertz and there's the, You can you can have a very talk. You have a slight not area of difference of the two virus you can discriminate right?
  1548: Yeah. Yeah, so so okay, so that's a limited picture of the frequency range though, so that's that's only part of the slide that we were instructed to show we wanted to show more of the slide but we wouldn't allow us to show more of it. Oh sure. So that duck gives me a rough, you know, what what what you're you know trying to do is it's a fascinating can already, you know be able to get a noise ratio signal to noise ratio that it can enable you are able to make it a product but that's that's that.
  1662: On the similar frequency to resume and maybe something will come out of it. So making a positive contribution. So I think that's a what I'm you know, in terms of spectroscopy, I mean, the high energy physics just recent days there's a so there's some you know new experiments from the formula.
  1746: And but so like um in if we're gonna like if we're gonna if if I if we're talking about like just a matter of like so I guess my question is like just in terms of using the EM frequency range theoretically to just change the the amplitudes and the the the frequencies and the in the phases of RNA and DNA how what's the upper bound on the kinds of changes we can we can cause what what what can we change exactly and maybe the limit?
  1770: A cytosine or uracil or whatever. So we're talking about like with with EM frequencies, we're changing the we're changing the shape or the orientation or both. Just just the the shape of the frequency response changes based on the different molecules, so the guanine lava different response from agony. I'll try to pull it up tomorrow if you're on here or whatever next time on I'm on here.

b0311y.md:
    57: Okay and then so would you would you is it correct to say that that we can consider the EKG is really like the the the frequency range of the cardiomyosite pulsation.
   195: So so I so I so what I thought was that since you can measure single cells with with the electrodes that you that you're injecting on the tip of a needle or basically right that's what you're using or you can measure basically the broader activity like like maybe of many cells and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.
   450: Alright just basic stuff and then another layer is going to take higher level features. It's a hierarchical model of learning. And then so the idea is that so information for the brain at the lowest possible bit bit rate is just like a coincidence pattern. It's it's to have two things on to two neurons in a at least two neurons within a certain frequency range and a certain spatial parameter firing at a lower at a lower level or maybe at the input level.
   799: Basically custom tracks that had ISO chronic beats and I was using the line I was so there's this guy named Lennox in the 1980s and he Lenox Delano. Oaks protocol was basically a biofeedback frequency program where he was capturing EG patterns and then using them to to change light basically light he didn't really have sound at that point.
   802: So he was just changing light effects like the light would flash with the frequencies of your of your brain activity and, But he would also encode it with with with frequency with certain frequency ranges certain frequency patterns as well. And he he reported that that his patients had some significant success with their own in many cases with their with their issues.
   808: And but I wanted to do it in VR so basically I would have your brainwaves driving light and sound effects and they would change what you see in here and they're encoded to isochronicbeats and and they would they would really cause us like intense sort of like self-awareness. I made like them some meditative state and if I change the the frequency patterns that I was encoding of course, you know, then that would that would affect that your the changes in your mental state, but it was just it was very particular it was very interesting because I began to feel as if I was listening to I began to feel so of getting.
   886: And and this is what we did. I think if you look I I think it might be the video you see the one of the spheres but no I see the one with like the frames and I think you have different frequency bands represented for a stream of frames right yeah, so that was that was the later version of the project so in the in the beginning.
   892: ⟪ 677 characters skipped ⟫t is one thousand spheres it's it's it's two basically is I don't I don't think it's labeled at that point so it basically we had the two electrodes and each electrode was divided into five different frequency ranges that left and right alpha beta theta gamma delta and and then we had not only did they move up and down in sort of a times here, what is the time series it's a 3d time series and so they moved up and down basically so each incoming signal we assumed.
   985: The more that to what was happening the more that they're they're they're beta waves would rise up high and the beta waves are a certain frequency range it's usually often associated with with you know, if you have a cup of coffee, if you're really paying attention if you're really concentrating sometimes you're beta waves might might be more active and guess in some studies, it can be other brain waves but and in our in our particular case, it was beta waves and, So we would tell people yeah, that's because we really pay attention.
  1012: You have to be very careful with the ultrasound. Brain. But as long as you're okay with whether you're just to make sure the frequencies that's all I'm not familiar with the frequency numbers, but I'm sure. Of you. Yeah, I mean to to your point you can use ultrasound to do surgery it's as it can be a scalpel it can be extremely dangerous, so right?
  1015: But if you but if you're if you are if you're doing things exactly right like using the exact frequency of ultra ultrasound you can instead of cutting in there on you can just stimulate it you could just make it fire.

  1042: You guys are familiar with the technology court transcranial magnetic stimulation, but this is a technology that's through the waves radio frequency, you can stimulate certain bytes of the brain and and and it's something that's been used for actually treatment of of depression because we do know some of the centers how they're caused or are responsible with the physio pathology of depression or how depression happens and we do know that if you stimulate these centers patients can have temporary relief of their depressed.

There's some evidence that you can definitely stimulate increase levels of dopamine and stereotone and using this this idea of cerebral and trainment.
  328: Oh hi shunt. I was searching for following up with a glimpse added type on the on the Google I remember read that this article. I mean, it's basically my bookmark list that lives by this doctor at a Washington University's Franklin Falls in the so the title of the paper is the cleansing power of a deep nice sleep and a it just to address one of my popular like practical question that the the frequency of the waves this is.
  330: This seems to is confirms that a this function the cleansing function of this circulation of food is only for the deep sleep, right so it's debate that the the what it called the what's the slowest this is the data delta wave so there's this arm and off like like per second frequency is that correct he came from that yeah sure so yeah delta wave is generally the slowest waveform so you see, you know wonder.

  133: I'm so sorry it was pointed out. I guess Adam pointed it out that that the frequency of of EG is is usually much faster than than the. That you know, then then your blood flow which has to react to to your neurons firing right and and but I sort of wonder about how that how it works exactly because there is a there's like a path between you know neurons firing and at in a cortical column and then you know, basically that activity being large enough that you're gonna have dipole activity which is a large scale, you know, global brain dipole activity, which is which is what is is gonna be picked up by the, Sensor and and so I wonder about the timing of that and in how that how you know, because so that so it's what I'm saying is like so there's a delay also between when eat when when when you're neurons fire at a low level and when when the dipole is gonna fire to similar to how there's a delay between when you're you're you're neurons fire, and when blood flow happens and I just this so the timing the timing issue, there is is very.

Can EEGs pick up is it 80 hertz is it? 60 hertz does it depend on which EEG electrodes are being used this is Sharena and I am done speaking.

The 80, you know hurts it's hard for like it's hard to get that but I think there's also a positive correlation between the density of the EG in other words the number of electrodes and that capacity to for acquiring that frequency but you know, like on I mean, I know that like it can acquire like 40 30 and it's it's not good at acquiring.
  157: Yeah. What I was thinking about it at first I read that sentence but they use the word acquired and that using the word of acquisition makes me think about it that maybe they're using this word because of showing that this is the frequency that they can catch using their sets.
  172: Yeah actually I think so if you if it talks about the brain waves frequency, it's based on what also chirina mentioned that it might come from denyquist equation that you need at least two times more than sampling rate to capture that frequency and your signal so if it would be for example one to 28 hertz for sampling yeah definitely the brain beam should be less than 64 hertz to get captured in the signal.
  187: But yeah good points. I have a question regarding the frequency that you guys were talking about because when you guys talk about something great frequency makes sense, but when when you start talking about the frequency of the brain, I don't know exactly what you mean since I'm not a neuroscientist.
  190: I'm not training that field so when you talk about the frequency of the brain what? I'm having a hard time picturing a bunch of neurons. You know extracting away a single point a single quantity of frequency from a bunch of neurons faring so can you guys help me clear that?
  193: Yeah and the brain it has numerous different frequencies happening all of the time and a lot of times it has multiple frequencies that are superimposed upon each other for example if brainwaves that my lab has discovered is a very high frequency oscillation that only happens at the peaks of data waves so as this 130-ish hurts frequency that happens on top of these about eight to fourteen hurts frequencies, so there's the question of okay.
  202: And well the people they popping at different rates, okay that is that is some sort of frequency it is a lot of noise but it is it's a bunch of clapping and it's a bunch of signals they were to to collapse such that half of the people thought that one rate and the other people thought that another rate then that then you can determine two different frequencies from that and, It is kind of strong because multiple people are in sync with each other so it's kind of similar with brain waves and if everyone in the room was to clap at the same frequency then that would create a very large and strong brain wave and this phenomenon is known as the one over f rule otherwise known as a a power frequency dynamic that happens in the brain so if you have brain waves that are at higher frequencies then you'll generally find that they are lower in power, but if you have, Waves that are high.
  205: In power then you'll usually find that they are alone over infrequency. And so the whole idea to keep in mind is synchronization between different neurons and how well synchronized they are. So that if a lot of people are clapping at the same time, then it will produce a lot of power but if there are a bunch of different people clapping out a bunch of different rates that may be a higher number that may be a high amount of frequency but not very much power because it's not as synchronized.
  298: Exposed I. I think. You guys that's a great point yeah. China good. This is Sharina and I think that when it comes to attention conditions what will tend to happen is that the signal that is collected will generally be noisier maybe it won't need to be trained upon but it would be noisier not just at one frequency but across a range of frequency is.

  187: The radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second it's not not close to the same frequency of what our what our brain is is detecting and and and and also like if you don't have a decoder then then that information means nothing it's like the it's like the the it's like the bumps on a CD CD on a record or the or the dots on a CD ROM, if you put your if you look at the dots on the CD ROM, it doesn't look like music to you if you pay your hand on our record, you don't hear.
  190: From music it's just so you can have the radio waves enter your brain it doesn't mean you understand the the signals from the radio and and and your brain is certainly not not not tuned to to that a frequency and but but but but but anyway going back to what would David and and, You know in Daniel we're saying that the there there there is and I was trying to explain this earlier there is a very simple explanation and the explanation is that is that human beings can record patterns or rhythms you can remember a rhythm you can remember a rhythm that can be an expectation or a future prediction of when you're going to receive the a certain like a rhythm to be like well when does the the next node in the song happen and if that note doesn't come then you then you think all the well, there's something wrong with?

  796: Graph or you want to sharpen all the edges or you want to make some kind of overall change you what you would do is apply a filter in the frequency space so you to blur everything you could go to the outer edges of the frequency space and remove all the outer edges and that takes away all the high frequencies which means all the quickly varying portions of your of your picture, so all the all the edges go away and become blurry and so you can make these changes to the entire picture with a very localized or specific targeted change to the with a filter in the frequency domain.

    54: And the very sort of systematic way and we're able to say things like five hertz stimulation at this part of the brain induced panic like responses versus two hertz stimulation at this part of the brain induced euphoric license and I'll get the author for you but I think that was an interesting way to maybe look at perhaps there are frequency dynamics also so it's not just that anatomy but perhaps their electrophysiological signatures and by way of the communication that, Tells us something about an emotional state of a person.
    57: ⟪ 298 characters skipped ⟫ and then there were these kind of oscillations that would difficult to pin down in terms of their relation to behaviors and so there's, Good evidence to show that that both actually pair and the the frequency of oscillation relates to the distance of functional connectivity, so the message passing is modulated from a particular area according to its frequency so as an example like gamma ban frequency firing in the ventral striatum are basically the speaks a distant connectivity to other parts of the brain.
    60: And I don't want to sound overly kind of new aging but the kind of an integration a recruitment of wider network of areas so the effect that you might see from stimulating in reverse one part of the brain with a particular frequency would invoke the appropriate pairing of other regions which would then entrain the emotional states, so yeah those two things there's yeah if you just look for I think one paper is an example, but there's a whole bunch of.
   181: Which I evolutionarily there were more um, many hundreds of years ago, um, so I do know that um, although I would have to touch up things research more to discover the frequency, although there's. Almost like sharks. Um and also wasps that essentially are almost entirely psychopaths yeah. I didn't know they have the um span of empathy among them but.
   303: Of of the world and and yourself in the world or yourself as part of it and and the movie, you know, I imagine that fundamentally it's it's made out of frequency patterns and and and spatial patterns that that these are just a building blocks of of representations of visual auditory smell representations feeling representations, it's all temporal spatial patterns that and in we have a whole bunch of reoccurring temporal spatial patterns in the brain the brain is constant.
   309: Frequency. Your patterns and certain areas of your brain and how that might alter the the conscious experience and that is that's eventually relevant to building conscious AI. So all of these might so might take is that all these microbiome microbiological topics are ultimately related to sentient AI if we can understand their effects in terms of their temple spatial frequency patterns and how they're changing these the state of your conscious experience, which is a highly coupled.
   838: What kind of the more semantic level to find a conscious yeah so frequency yeah, thank you that is yeah, very intriguing.
   992: I appreciate you for asking that question brother because I feel the same way you could once say that that the consciousness or ideas and thoughts are just frequency turned into. A geometry and then geometry being converted into mathematics. I mean numbers zeroes and ones because that's how we perceive information and our reality so my idea is when speaking back on the photons photons could be an exchange of information because they're just one degree to the next so if it all starts off vibrational or frequency if one want one wants to say the exchange continues just like every other thing in our universe our sales atoms everything continues.
   998: ⟪ 291 characters skipped ⟫ the two we can't separate if you separate them then you won't understand so if things are waves and vibration and then that vibration exchanges into electricity then how hard is it to understand the frequency is changes into light and you know, like how hard or geometry then these information transforms into light and then I mean, it's just to me.
  1196: I I just have the feeling that his that his uh what he's referring to is like um is like an engram and and that um, he's talking about like a court if course grain is like for EEG is it is a is a frequency pattern and um, so maybe he's talking about like for him.
  1199: I've been skimming his paper for the past two hours while listening to this audio and and I'm, Thinking that. It's like you know at a high level high level idea is a temple of spatial frequency pattern like like let's say that like, you know how like a if you have a if you have a a song that's played on a piano, right imagine your brain is a piano and the engram is the song and so the brain is like the piano keys that are like they're playing they're playing the tune but it doesn't but it's but it's it's the tune itself is virtual in the sense that different parts of the brain can play different parts of that tune, like you know, how like it's not not it's not necessarily true that the same neurons are gonna find.
  1208: I mean, I was just thinking about just imagine what if there's something to. Like a neural correlate of that that there was sort of like relates to like you know basically high level of macroscopic frequent temple spatial frequency patterns that are representing what what Rachel's thinking about and then and then by thinking about it you're in in changing the context you're you're changing the tune and you're but you're changing the tune of a virtual virtual concept that now is gonna be played a different way no matter which piano in your brain is gonna play it and and so I just thought that was a cool idea and I wanted to share it.

However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.
