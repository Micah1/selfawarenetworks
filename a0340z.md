I would like to have my own fmri machine, and other technology too!
there are things I could discover with my own team
just people who specialize in areas, for instance there is a guy who is encoding and decoding images and words from regions of the mind with fmri
and the people at Numenta have a really special technology
that I would like to use to predict EEG data, and if I had fmri I would use it to predict that too
right now EEG technology is being used interactively
to control video games and machines
but I think that if we used something like either the google brain, or what numenta has to recognize EEG
that our ability to mentally control characters in games and robots is going to be thousands of times better, meaning faster, more precise
soon the computer will be a window into the mind, and in between minds, we will see what others think
so imagine that we build the perfect brain to computer interface, and then we link two people, perhaps a husband and wife, so they learn each others mind in a new way
imagine at some point, entangling the minds of a cat and a bird, so they begin to act as one system, then a human and a cat and a bird, one system of thinking, the cat's mind becomes a very cooperative component, learning from you as if you spoke the same language, and the bird, well the bird could be a spy for you
