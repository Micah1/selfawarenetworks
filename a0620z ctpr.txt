The conversation with Joyce Waterhouse shifted my attention & focus to fungal infections. Specifically I'm zooming into how fungal infections might cause Mitochondrial damage, which is intrinsically related to a neurons ability to function over time

What if we exposed cells possessing Lewy Bodies to mechanical waves in frequencies across the entire spectrum (that can interact with tissue without destroying it) to understand which frequencies trigger nuclear deformations that clear artifacts like Lewy bodies or proteins like Alpha-synuclein

Interesting Gamma-synuclein is present in breast cancer

Shockingly there is a link between Blood Cancer & Parkinson's Disease that I became aware of last night during my research. That gives me hope that there could be a single solution to treat both. Oddly enough.

"ABSTRACT The synucleins are a small, soluble,highly conserved group of neuronal proteins that have been implicated in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The synuclein family consists of-,-, and-synucleins (-syn)" https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1096/fj.07-8379rev

May 22 almost 10pm, just 4 days to left to prepare for my clubhouse meetup on Parkinson’s Disease & Blood Cancer. 

The high similarity between Russia in 2022 and Nazi Germany in 1945 + the psychopathic dialog on Russian TV caused me to look to see if there was a link between cocaine & Parkinson's Disease. In fact there is. Putin might have Parkinson's Disease & Blood Cancer from cocaine use.
