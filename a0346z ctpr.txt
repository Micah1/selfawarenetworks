Micah Blumberg I study neuroscience, not psychology, because psychology is not real science. These labels like narcissist are subjective impressions, characterizations, and statistical interpretations, they are not based on provable neural correlates, or hard medical science.

Micah Blumberg Except that when you go back and test to see if the same neural correlates are still there, to match the same personality disorders, they are not there anymore.

Micah Blumberg Trying to find a personality disorder in brain activity is like trying to find a file on your computer by reading the heat coming from your hard drive.

Micah Blumberg I should clarify that I study computational neuroscience, specifically how the brain renders what you might describe as your conscious experience of reality. This involves networks and memories that are sparse and distributed all over a network, involving sensory areas of the brain, and all sorts of brain regions in even small tasks.

Micah Blumberg I study all the different forms of medical imaging, and what's captured is not even the tip of the iceberg of what's going on in the brain.
