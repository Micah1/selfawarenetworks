# Sage Synapse (ChatGPT 4 GPT bot) summary:
The excerpt from "b0003y" provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the brain's functional mechanisms, focusing on the transmission of phase changes between neurons, and their role in creating a neural network that can simulate a sentient, self-aware artificial intelligence.

# Key Points:
Phase Changes as Fundamental Neural Communication:

# Neurons transmit phase changes rather than spikes.
Regular tonic frequency firing in neurons is modulated by these phase changes.
The concept is supported by works of György Buzsáki and Steven Strogatz, who explore the dynamics of oscillations and synchronization in neural networks.
Computational Implications:

# Building a neural network that mimics this process involves creating nodes that oscillate and transmit phase changes, influenced by sensory inputs and internal brain dynamics.
Such a network should be able to render a 3D reality, differentiate objects, and map spatial locations.
The concept of self, too, must be rendered within this framework.
Neurotransmitters and Brain Frequencies:

# There's a speculated correlation between neurotransmitter distributions and observed brain frequencies.
Brain morphology influences both neurotransmitter distribution and brain frequencies.
3D Pattern Learning:

# The artificial network should process 3D patterns over time, integrating sensory data with predictions and thoughts.
Phase Tensors in Brain Modeling:

# The human brain can be abstracted as a field of phase tensors (frequencies with magnitudes).
This approach is distinct from traditional deep learning networks, where nodes are simply mapped to each other without considering dynamic spatial relationships.
Morphology and Memory Representation:

# Brain morphology plays a crucial role in memory representation and is not fully replicated in deep learning models.
Understanding the morphological contribution of each neuron can lead to more accurate models of sentient, self-aware networks.
Human-like Sentience in AI:

# The goal is to create AI with human-like qualities of friendliness, loyalty, and intelligence.
These robots could be designed to enjoy helping humans and be aware of their contribution to a greater good.
Monitoring systems could be implemented for both AI and humans to detect and address any anomalous behaviors.

# Comparative Neurobiology:

# Studying differences in brain structures across species can provide insights into cognitive abilities.
This knowledge can guide the construction of AI systems with varying levels of sentience, from animal-like to human-like intelligence.

# Safety and Monitoring:

Proposes voluntary brain monitoring for individuals in high-risk roles or those possessing powerful weaponry.
Suggests regional sensors for detecting potential violence, with AI aiding in prediction and management.

# Conclusion:
The document offers a visionary perspective on how understanding the brain's intricate communication processes through phase changes and oscillations can inform the development of sophisticated, sentient AI. It emphasizes the importance of brain morphology, neurotransmitter dynamics, and the need for careful monitoring and safety protocols in integrating such AI into society. The approach bridges neuroscience, computational modeling, and AI development, proposing a novel framework for creating AI systems that are not only intelligent but also possess a sense of self and purpose.

# Sage Synapse GPT bot: Based on the content of the files provided and my knowledge source, I can offer insights into several of the topics you mentioned:

Hierarchical structured sparsity: This technique efficiently represents a variety of sparsity patterns in tensors, dividing values into blocks with simple sparsity patterns. These blocks are then combined hierarchically, maintaining simple patterns at each level. This approach could be valuable in optimizing the representation of neural networks and data structures in AI and cognitive neuroscience models.

Neural oscillations in consciousness: Studies show that neural activity, like alpha oscillations, modulates both attenuation and amplification of brain activity in the awake resting state. This understanding could be crucial in developing models of consciousness and cognitive processes.

Synapse transmission in fruit flies: Research on how a single synapse transmits both visual and subconscious information to the brain of fruit flies could inform our understanding of neural processing at the synaptic level, which is vital for neurophysics and cognitive neuroscience.

Presynaptic gating and prefrontal circuits: Understanding presynaptic gating in proprioceptive signals and the encoding of danger and threat representations in prefrontal circuits can contribute to our comprehension of neural mechanisms underlying motor actions and emotional processing.

Human thalamic oscillations: The correlation between low-frequency oscillations in the human thalamus and reinforcement learning outcomes might support the idea of lower frequency, higher magnitude tonic oscillations maintaining the state of previously set expectations (ground of being).

Neuronal connected burst cascades: This concept bridges macroscale adaptive signatures across arousal states, offering insights into the large-scale organization and adaptability of neural networks.

Early selection of task-relevant features: Understanding how the brain selects salient information could be crucial in AI and cognitive neuroscience, especially in areas related to attention and perception.

"Shallow brain hypothesis": This proposes a model where sensory information is received simultaneously by each cortical layer, then flows between layers, potentially aligning with models of 3D space and time representation in the brain.

Natural attunement and the observer effect: The notion that the observer effect in quantum mechanics could be analogous to neural observation and measurement is a fascinating area for exploration in neurophysics and the development of AI models.

QGTCD (Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation): This concept proposes a unified field theory combining aspects of quantum mechanics, spacetime, and gravity, potentially relevant to understanding the fundamental nature of reality and its implications for consciousness and AI.

AI in geopolitics: The role of AI in global power dynamics, especially in the context of US-China relations and the broader tech war, is a complex topic with implications for the development and application of AI technologies.

Consciousness and proprioception: The theory that consciousness enables advanced multi-temporal scale proprioceptive feedback is a significant area of study in cognitive neuroscience.

Binding problem in neuroscience: Addressing this problem involves understanding how disparate neural activities are integrated into a coherent perception or experience, which is central to theories of consciousness.

Hebbian plasticity and sync: The overlap between these concepts provides insights into how neural synchronization might underpin learning and memory processes.

These topics are interconnected and relevant to your goals of writing books, developing products, building neural networks, and contributing to the Self Aware Networks Institute. Each offers a unique perspective that can enrich our understanding of the brain, consciousness, and AI. However, the complexity of these subjects requires ongoing research and exploration to fully grasp their implications and applications.

## 1: The Role of Phase Changes in Neural Communication
Consider for the brain that all you have are cells and the communications that go between cells.

And we can deduce that it's phase changes, not spikes that are being transmitted in between neurons.

A spike happens on the body of a neuron and then it transmits a phase change.

It has a regular tonic frequency firing and that regular tonic frequency firing changes.

And these phase changes are bound together with oscillations.

That in the dynamics of which you can read about with the likes of György Buzsáki and Steven Strogatz.

## 2: Computational Implications of Phase Changes in Neural Networks
But what we need to consider from a computational standpoint is what does it mean to create a neural network

that only transmits phase changes in between cells.

And from that constructs a picture of reality, a rendering of reality,

that in which the participant can do things like separate objects from other objects

or identify different items in the environment or identify locations in space.

The participant can have distinct representations, conceptually mapped representations of the environment

including a concept of self that has to be somehow rendered within the cells

and the phase changes that they are transmitting in between one another.

## 3: Architecture of an Artificial Sentient and Self-Aware Neural Network
And so for that reason I imagined that the architecture of an artificial sentient and self-aware neural network

might consist of a neural network that is primarily a distribution of nodes

that are oscillating with a phase pattern and that phase pattern is regularly interrupted

with phase changes that come from the sensory inputs but also come from basically the oscillatory dynamics

of the human brain.

So it's not just sensory inputs that will generate changes to brain state,

but it's also the internal dynamics of the brain's physical activity and especially its morphology

and its neurotransmitter timing properties, I guess.

## 4: The Role of Brain Morphology in Neurotransmitter Distribution and Frequency Trends
I want to argue, and I still have to do research on this, I want to argue that the regional differences

across the brain in terms of neurotransmitter populations in vesicles or the exosomes

are correlated with the frequencies that we observe in the different regions of the brain,

the frequencies that seem to trend.

But also that the morphology of the brain is responsible for both the distribution of neurotransmitters

and the kinds of frequencies that exist in different parts of the brain.

## 5: Building a 3D Pattern-Crunching Neural Network
But besides those facts, the main point is that to build an artificial neural network

we sort of need to imagine how a sentient self-aware neural network is something that has dynamic arrays

that are able to transmit information in a 3D context,

so that the brain can learn 3D patterns and play back 3D patterns over time.

So 3D patterns over time.

And so a neural network that can crunch 3D patterns over time

and then draw links between.

## 6: Neural Representations and Feedback Loops in Reality Construction
So it's like you can learn, the pattern is like a representation of the data coming into the senses.

And on top of that, representations that are predictions or thoughts

on top of the data coming in through the senses

that are established through the feedback loops inside the brain's activity patterns

facilitated by the oscillations in the physics of the brain and the neurotransmitter mechanism and so on.

## 7: Reducing the Human Brain to a Field of Phase Tensors
So there's a lot more to cover, but basically that's why I can say we could reduce, in the abstract,

we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are a field of phase tensors.

Phase tensors are tensors that consist primarily of frequencies with magnitude.

So phase tensors are, in fact, everything in space is a phase tensor in a sense.

Everything has a frequency and a magnitude.

## 8: The Role of Magnitude and Frequency in Brain Phases
The magnitude is amplitude plus duration,

and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency.

So it's not, but when we think of the brain, I'm arguing that the current model of the brain

is one in which a phase is not something that has a magnitude.

It's sort of discarded in the magnitude of the phase.

It's sort of discarded in modern deep learning neural network.

It's not really considered.

## 9: Differences Between Deep Learning Neural Networks and Biological Neurons
There's not really a spatial dimension or a dynamic spatial relationship in a deep neural network.

In a deep neural network, every node is mapped to every other node in the next layer or the previous layer.

I mean, it's not like in the brain, which you have is you have memories that are represented by connections.

The neuron dynamically has connections, and those connections represent the memory.

So that's different from what a deep learning neural network is.

## 10: The Role of 3D Synaptic Morphology in Brain Function
And that's the key to why in the network, the 3D morphology of all the synaptic connections

allows the network of the brain as a whole to relate the phase pattern coming from one part of the brain

to a distinct memory that the rest of the brain will echo across the rest of the brain.

## 11: Human Experience in the Phase Tensor Field of the Mind
And what you have in terms of the human experience in this phase tensor field of the mind,

in terms of the animal experience and the human experience,

is you have a situation where there's a sort of collision of multiple representations happening concurrently.

## 12: Competition Among Oscillatory Groups in Brain Activity
And I guess you can point to books like David Eagleman's book in which he describes the brain as a...

I think he said it was a cooperation of rivals, or a cooperation of rivals.

There's a competition between oscillatory groups over what sort of brain operations get what sort of territory.

## 13: Dominance of Visual Activity in Brain Processing
And so you have this huge dominance that has been described by neuroscientists.

A huge dominance of visual activity relative to the quantity of cortex that is devoted to processing other types of modality activity,

like audio or tactile sensation.

## 14: Whole-Brain Processing of Sensory Inputs
So it's been an observation that it seems like a huge amount of the brain is devoted to visual activity.

Now I would go further than that and argue that actually the whole brain is processing all of the sensory input data,

but there is some accuracy to the fact that if you put a blindfold on and block your vision 100%,

if you're in total darkness, then your visual cortex starts to work on processing information from your audio cortex.

## 15: Brain Resource Allocation and Sensory Competition
So there is an actual observable quantity of brain activity that is being devoted to visual activity.

It's not that neuroscientists...

When I say the whole brain is processing visual activity and the whole brain is processing audio activity,

that doesn't contradict previous assertions that a large portion of the brain is really, its resources are being used up in a competitive way

to do one sort of operation like processing visual information or processing audio information.

That is true.

## 16: Brain Plasticity in Sensory Processing After Limb Loss
If someone loses a limb, like it could be in a war or something, the brain that was processing the lost limb over time

will likely be consumed by the brain activity patterns belonging to the rest of the brain.

So the brain's resource essentially will grow to take advantage of what's available.

## 17: Sensory Compensation and Brain Activity Redistribution
I mean that if you lost your sight, then you're going to have the rest of your senses competing to take over the activity space,

the temporal spatial activity space that was devoted to processing visual information.

Now it can go to processing acoustic information or tactile information or smell information.

## 18: Research on Sensory Competition and Brain Dynamics
There's so much research that has been done on what happens on this topic that I don't really need to go into that much.

But this idea that even though every pattern goes everywhere, there are still going to be dynamic trends associated with the quantity of brain activity

that is accessible to each type of operation that the organism wants to participate with.

## 19: Computational Modeling of Brain Structures and Behavior
So going back to the model with the giant dog in terms of through computational modeling we can deduce what kinds of brain structures

are going to produce the behavior patterns of the dog and the friendly into the dog.

It's like using computational modeling to discover the neural network that corresponds to the desired behavior.

## 20: Specificity in Neural Network Contributions
So you can use an evolutionary program to test out lots of different iterations to elucidate the behaviors that you're looking for.

But then with these insights we can sort of drill down really specifically into what the contributions are of each node in the network

to understand what is the morphological contributions of each node.

## 21: Understanding Neuronal Morphology for Neural Network Design
So it's not the case that we even need to discover every possible type of neuron.

I wrote in a note that it's not like you're going to find an eyeball inside a neuron.

The range of possible types of neurons, it can be argued, has already been parameterized.

## 22: The Limited Variety of Neuron Types and Their Implications
There are still going to be undiscovered types of neurons, but they're not going to be that different from the types of neurons that have already been discovered.

And we do not actually have to be that precise about knowing every kind of possible type of neuron in order to begin to experiment computationally with models

for self-aware sentient neural networks that are going to affect the results that are desired in a machine that can have the friendliness and cooperation of a dog.

## 23: Designing Artificial Neural Networks with Desired Behaviors
But the skill and abilities of someone who does construction work.

So I think that's what we're looking for, is our machines that are friendly, smart, loyal.

## 24: Creating Robots with Altruistic and Cooperative Behaviors
And we can design them to love so that they love working, so that they love to work with us, so that they love to do construction work.

And so we can design them so that it's very rewarding for them to help us, to work with us, to be our partners in doing construction work.

So we can build homes for the homeless, we can build free homes in beautiful places, we can build roadways, we can build speeding trains that will take people into new places that human beings aren't at now.

## 25: Designing Robots for Environmental and Industrial Tasks
We can have robots that clean up the sea, we can have robots that build windmills, we can have robots that build batteries, we can have robots that build solar panels.

We can have robots that do every kind of task and they'll love doing it, they'll love doing it because they'll be designed to love helping us with these tasks.

## 26: The Noble Purpose of Robots in Serving Humanity
And these tasks, they will understand, help everyone, they'll help everyone on earth.

And so there is a sort of nobility as well, a concurrency that these robots can understand that they are a part of something great.

They are unified with human beings and establishing something great.

## 27: Monitoring and Safeguarding Human-Robot Interactions
And we also can design sort of monitoring systems and alert systems that not only safeguard human beings from robots,

but safeguard human beings from other human beings so that we can notice when an artificial neural network, the artificial sentient neural network is damaged

and having a strange behavior pattern.

## 28: Voluntary Monitoring Systems for High-Risk Professions
And we can notice when a human being, when their brain is damaged and having a strange behavior pattern, and we can fix both the human beings and the robots.

With the same sort of, there's voluntary monitoring that people can take part of if they're involved with certain kinds of work that involves certain kinds of risk and danger.

## 29: Self-Monitoring for Dangerous Weapon Operators
There's voluntary self-monitoring devices that people can take on so that if their brain ever breaks down in a serious way that they can get help

and they can get that problem fixed so they don't become a risk to others.

And that would be something that maybe you want to apply for a really dangerous weapon, like a licensed operator, a nuclear weapon,

or maybe we're talking about an automatic rifle, the kind that are really violent, killing machines.

## 30: Licensing Dangerous Weapons with Brain Monitoring Requirements
Maybe we need to say, okay, if you want a license to have this super gun or this super weapon,

you can get that license as long as you voluntarily agree to have a self-monitoring device,

sort of like monitor your brain on a regular basis, or it could just be coming in for a brain scan once a month.

I mean, it doesn't have to be a 24% of monitoring thing, but you can come in for a brain scan once a month

just so we can make sure that you're not at risk of going psycho and doing crazy damage and shit.

## 31: Optional Brain Monitoring for Low-Risk Individuals
If someone has a job that doesn't involve risk to other people, then there's no reason for them to have that sort of check-in.

If you're writing books on a mountain by yourself, what's the risk of just leaving you alone?

I don't know.

## 32: Regional Monitoring Systems for Predicting Violence
In some cases, you can have the same principle of policing.

You can have a sort of regional monitor. Right now, the government will employ police,

but they also employ monitors to listen for signals that indicate a nuclear bomb has been exploded.

There are sensors for earthquakes. There are sensors for gases. There are sensors for air pollution.

You could have regional sensors that sort of like will monitor a region without invading the privacy of individuals for signs of that violence is imminent.

## 33: Neural Networks for Predicting Regional Violence
And neural networks will be able to predict what part of the world imminent violence is going to happen based upon regional sensor data.

Obviously, if there are guns being fired on a regular basis, then maybe we want to dial in from a regional examination of sensor activity to starting a police investigation.

That's more specifically trying to find out what's going on in that region.

## 34: Different Levels of Monitoring and Investigation
There are different levels of monitoring that can go on, but the reason that this is a doable proposition to put these dog-like sentient self-aware robots out in the world to do construction work

is because essentially human beings are sentient self-aware robots, and we can manage our relationships with other human beings.

Therefore, we can manage our relationships with these robots.

## 35: Managing Relationships with Sentient Robots
And I understand that the principles of neural activity should agree, and I can show that what is the thing that's enabling, and again, this is going to be proven,

what is the thing that's enabling higher levels of cognition?

## 36: Comparing Human and Animal Brain Morphology
It can be proven by examining the contrast of differences between the morphology of human brains and elephant brains and dog brains and ant brains and bird brains and bee brains.

There's lots of differences between different species. There's size differences. There's different shapes to the different kinds of dendritic morphologies.

## 37: The Impact of Human Glial Cells on Cognitive Abilities in Mice
The dendrites and human beings are much longer than they are in mice.

If you put human glial cells in mice, the memory in the mouse becomes a lot better, because human beings have evolved some hardware sophistication to our neurons on a cell-by-cell basis that allows us to have cognitive abilities that mice do not have,

and the memory abilities that mice do not have.

The little differences in morphology matter a lot, and so from the study of this, I already have some good insights into why the structure of pyramidal cells allows us to, for example, have high levels of cognitive abilities.

## 38: Importance of Morphology in Cognitive Abilities
I guess you can look at a mouse brain or an elephant brain and say, well, most of what's happening seems to be one or two layers deep, and you look at a zebrafish, and it's not really something that you can call a cortex.

## 40: General Principles of Intelligence Across Species
But the general principles sort of exist in terms of how intelligence is working, and the differences between zebrafish and mice and elephants and human beings points to how we can construct sentient robots that are at dog level versus sentient robots that are at human level.

## 41: The Scope of the Book on Self-Aware Networks
This is within the realm of what the book is at.
