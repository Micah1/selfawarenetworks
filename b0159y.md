Four kinds of neural transmission Oscillator

00:00

The pixels of reality, the idea is that we got a picture of like close-up pixels and show how from far away. Close-up pixels at up to a picture, but up close, there's the most thoughts, okay? And then you compare that to the firings of neurons or the absence of firing, some neurons, in the argument is that each and neuron or negative each action potential or negative axis action potential is the deviation and oscillation that is like the pixelation of screen the oscillation screen and then we have the neuron, which is going to be basically the

00:59

The the pixel on the screen on the oscillation and it's either going to go dark, like, negative or brighter, which is like changing. It's color and it doesn't look like much until you consider a lot of them simultaneously. And then you have a screen in the observer of the screen is the oscillator, right?

01:26

The ice later is the one that can recognize patterns at that emerge as differentials from it's oscillation. And as the oscillator itself, takes the deviations and ropes them back in electromatic, magnetically to the pace of the oscillator. That, that process to of one oscillator consuming. Another is causing physical effects.

02:12

It felt it's causing felt effects to the oscillator and and all the neurons involved. Allowing them to encode. The feeling of those pixels of those positive and negative. Potentials. Okay. So, so we get a picture and resume it out because I am. I am very literally seeing when I see with my eyes.

02:50

I'm seeing.

02:55

A picture that is very, very literally made up of positive and negative. Potentials positive and negative potential. It's very literally and you say well okay now the the the neuron isn't passing along like it's not passing a potentially from one neuron to another. No, but when but when potential flow when current flows into a neuron, nice significant amount of that potential is leaking out of the neuron into the extra cellular into the into the space, around the dentray.

03:53

And that leaking, current could be the current that makes up the brain wave, right? So you have. So, basically what I'm saying is like a certain percentage of of the electricity just travels down the axon, but at the same time, a certain percentage of it leaks, out of the membrane.

04:20

Every single time you are going to have leakiness happen and the action, potential surge, it is going to be an event where a lot more, leakiness happens. And the leakiness, the leakiness that's happening is just as important as the surge itself. So this, so the neuron itself as registering a massive event, but it's leaking out, a massive event everywhere in the three dimensions because the whole membrane is leaky and because of whole neuronics expanding, it's not just an electrical event that's leaking out.

05:08

It's a vibrational event. It's a magnetic event. It's us, there's assault and wave event. The whole point is that the neuron is not just emitting a chemical transmission to the isolator. It's, it's emitting a vibration and it's admitting a magnetic communication to, to other neurons and an electric transmission to other neurons.

05:44

So there's an electric transmission, there's a vibrational transmission. There's so there's an electric transmissions, vibrational transmission magnetic transmission and a chemical transmission and and by chemical I mean there's not ionic transmission that if that literally affects the body or wall of a membrane of another neuron. So that's already four different kinds of transmission.

06:15

And and we're in in four different kinds of transmission. But with two different polarities. So the positive and negative transmissions in the sense that there is a it's there's a negative transmission and in the sense of like there's the oscillator has groups of neurons firing together at regular intervals.

06:42

And when a neuron is inhibited more quickly, when you get a negative action potential and you're on is inhibited such that it doesn't fire at the regular tonic rate. That is a negative action potential in effect. And so that is creating a the absence of the regular magnetic vibration.

07:12

The absence of the regular magnetic emission, the absence of the regular Electric diffusion electricity, diffusion. And, and so that negative, it's going to change the the body of the oscillator, right? So the body also of the oscillator is going to be the shape of the oscillator of the magnetic field that the oscillator is producing.

07:57

I should change by some my son, Delta. And when you get a lot of neurons inside an oscillator firing, then the delta is going to be larger than if you had fewer obviously more significant and that delta is going to change how other oscillators perceive that oscillator when you have two oscillators connecting.

08:27

So there's these distinctions happening that are that groups that neurons are able to collectively track? What other groups are neurons are doing?
