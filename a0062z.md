This note is from my 2012 Business Plan
Below where it says "Neurofeedback Audio Visual System" is the back of a business card that I designed and orderd in 2011.
I made a couple of alterations to the note in 2022 for clarity. In terms of pricing.
In retrospect (from 2022) I doubt people would have opted to pay more than $35 for a 35 minute session.
$70 for 70 minutes is just a lot for a long time.

Relieving General Anxiety
Curing Depression
As A Treatment For Autism
and many more serious things that is not the purpose or intention of my shop.

The purpose is more general, it's for brain optimization, use this technology to optimize the minds, the reflexes, and the game!

So if you want to use it for any of the more serious conditions you will have to document your own progress. Keep a journal about your expectations and your results week in and week out. However that is completely up to you, as a self medicator. I don't even want to know about it if your doing that. You don't have to tell me anything at all about why your using this machine. You can think of my office and equipment as a something you can use for a fee, just like using the fax machine at a Fedex store! I will help you get set up, and I can monitor the equipment to make sure it's operating correctly, but my part is really simple.

Why do people generally use Neurofeedback? What are the general benefits?
Well in general Neurofeedback Optimizes the Mind in a Number of Areas
The equipment at my facility is available if you want to try out sessions related to

So my Neurofeedback Salon creates a comfortable spot for people to come and use this technology!

Neurofeedback is about identifying specific aspects of the brains functioning, isolating them and then using that information to help change behaviors in order to address shortcomings or enhance performance.
