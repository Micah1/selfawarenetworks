For the ultrasonography test the

00:14
Yeah, yeah, I'm yeah, at the moment. Yeah. And so, the follow-up question that is when our brains are thinking and, you know, the are there. What is what is moving across? The neurons electrically. Is it is it? Goal is.

00:43
Yeah, at the moment we think we think about it as the electrical and in but some some of my colleague at the EPFL they think may be something to do with the chemical but at the moment which is have to wait for further experiment to confirm. Thank you. Like a seal it's really great to see you like stretching trying to find questions just humbled to be in the room with the three of you very very dist.

01:18
No, actually helps you to learn. But anyway, here I think you I'm humbled to be here with all of you, definitely. I'm just curious because you have the image, is there a paper or an article where you got that image? Because if so I would like to read it.

01:40
Yeah. So I did a little deep dive after the spirit tech room that was done. And then one of them, photonics did a spirit tech room as well. They were device that sits on the it does transfer radial focused ultrasound The most muse. Yeah. And so this this image came from one of the research studies that I found to go.

02:10
I'm driving. I gotta find it. The link. Okay, if that press muse, maybe I can just search for a study on that. So, I mean, I, I personally would love to learn more about the prefrontal cortex and how in the goosatory bowl and and how the, the house smell is connected to the neocortex.

02:37
Did we lose the neuroscience? The neurosurgeon? Oh man. Oh, I was hoping you would answer that one coz, you know,

02:49
I'm sorry, I was so attached. Right. I was it says we still have four people, but he's he appears to be gone. So no, I was saying I, I definitely want to learn more about the prefrontal cortex and the, the olfactory bulb, and, and how. And and how your sense of smell is enters into the neocortex that I in in the how in the and the potential.

03:25
Like, I guess there's also a philanthropic pathway for further notes and so I just wanted to hear about the connections there but but I don't know if that would be wonderful to learn about but we've lost that we last the guy who would have had the expert he would on the expert on the topic, right?

03:50
Know me, is that is I go to, does that go to the and smell? Yeah, it does. So so that the sense of taste is is is going to go, I believe to this medicine cortex. It's going to go through. It's the sense of taste just is is just like thing.

04:15
I hope I'm not getting this wrong, but I think it's gonna go from from the tongue and then travel to the thalamus and then it's gonna to the thalam to thalamic nuclei. And then it's going to go to the smatter sensory cortex, just like your sense of touch as we're since a touch is going to be in this medicine cortex.

04:34
I think that's, that's right. But I have to look it up to be sure. And then and then also the same is true. Like for for you have an auditory cortex and then so the the signals from your ears are going to travel to the thalamus and then to the auditory cortex and then you're going to have, you know, obviously you're the the signals travel from your eyes to along the optic nerve to the thalamus and then to the visual cortex.

05:06
And then and then these these three quarters pieces of cortex, or regions of the cortex are all interconnected with one another. So, they're all, they're all linked together, but but it's did that. I forget. What your question was that answer it you absolutely did.

05:37
Yeah, you know, it's great. So so the prefrontal cortex is in front, right? And the, there's so, I, I think of the brain is having I was having like, really four main regions and, and there's different like it's like, it's like a pie that you can slice up in different ways.

05:53
So if you slice the pie up and four ways, you could slice at the pie and in a lot of different pieces, but if you just slice it up into four, we lost the guy. Who asked that question? Well I don't know if I should continue. Welcome, we've got BA Feldman on the stage.

06:09
Did you want to? You want to say something?

06:15
I know. Hey, yeah, no, I'm doing morning. Things around the house or seems like it interested in conversation. So a lot of just going tonight. Coming in. At the beginning. Yes, your beginner. This is, I mean, it's your baby, what don't, sorry. Let me reverse what I just said.

06:42
You're at the beginning of the room. That's what I meant to say.

06:49
They're just doing a random room with some kind of watercolor conversation. Yeah. I mean, as my, that's great nerves. It's me to die. All this stuff that I think that's right. Stingley, we're interesting for me because it's funny, I found that some of the ways that we described things makes sense differently, like, like most things makes them make sense in such a different way after they experience the prior to the experience.

07:28
So yeah, it's yeah, the way we describe the experience as from the experience are point of view and the non-experience here point of view still. And now that day and consciousness, that day, missing piece of the puzzle that puts it all together. So what what I was looking at your the the club for BA like I was looking at the it says on your clubhouse profile spatial reasoning.

08:06
What, how would you define spacial reasoning? And well, so okay let me just say what I've put on there. Those are. So as far as like the spatial reasoning patterns, we're prediction is single point data integration. That's like a little private joke. I have with myself because these are things that the human, right?

08:28
Just does. Like we all look for patterns and try to predict them, right? That's like a normal function. We all reason about, we all build these facial models and reason about where things are in relationships together, right? And we all take in environmental data and integrate it within our single point of existence.

08:50
So that it the bios kind of a little choke that no one gets where it's like my favorite things to do are basically just being you.

09:02
Right. That's awesome. Yeah. Now, you basically you've basically described a perspective on consciousness, which is very, which is very, very cool. Yeah, that's definitely one way to. So yeah. So I mean, I like that. It's um, it's a little joke, but but it's very, it's, it's food for thought, right?

09:26
You can think about that, chew on it. It's like what if it's like? What? I just thought it was more interesting than saying you know like hey I'm a human and I do all this things stuffing. All right. Yeah, I mean, I know so I like, you know, in the in the movie the the matrix they the matrix is there's a, there's a this the character Nia works at the meta cortex, right.

09:54
And that's like met a cortex. Why is the word cortex in there and they, like, cortexes I would like is the matrix to mind. I mean, this is the and he's actually like that. I I remember that that movie had so many, like, sort of teasing concepts embedded in it that you could look up and and find connections to philosophy, and it was just embedded with so many things, I think about.

10:26
And so I go ahead against your microphone. What? Oh mmm. I wonder if I was because of how I was holding it in my hand. Or is it gone? Oh yeah. Yeah, it's not. Okay, trust me. Maybe it. Just maybe. I was just it was a sliding a little bit in my hand.

10:52
I guess. No big deal. Oh yeah. So I know I was just when, when you described the joke on your profile space for reason, I just thought of the matrix as a representation of the mind. Like it's the idea that you're you're simulating the entire the entire universe from your perspective inside your brain.

11:18
And that's, it's that seems like a topic that I keep bringing up with lots of people. I mean, yes, no, I mean, yeah, that's the place super intriguing. We don't interact with the world directly means rep for their model of the world. But with trips me out is that the, the mind kind of doesn't interact directly with the body, either behind of insurance with our right.

11:50
Yeah, I'm on board. Let's say like, oh my liver hurts because like, oh, I drink too. You know, the mind is interacting with the model. Like, oh, something's not balanced somewhere here, but like, the liver is not staying like, danger, danger. You've done damage. So so yeah, like it's all but it's it's interesting that we don't we don't say that the the world is interacting with the body through our minds or and we don't say that our bodies are interacting with the world through our minds.

12:27
It's our minds are you know like I'm just like like the the agent is the mind in this scenario. As as it's being written instead of the world being the agent and the, and the mind being the, the means, well yeah, yeah likes so much. Our perception depends at the time those models that we've built right and our expectation, right?

12:55
When we do these little experiments very you know taste something knowing what it is. You taste or you feel a sensation knowing what it is, or not. Knows is right. Oh man, a monster just brushed by my foot. I freaked out. Now I have to jump out of the lake right or you see that dark is surrounds you yes.

13:16
So when you feel it, you think. Oh, that was just a little distressing by and then you looked out and realized it's a big monster, but you know what I mean? Like what we're looking for? Has a lot to do with the next questions with these empirical quantifiable. You know, exactly measured senses of hours.

13:41
They're supposed to and then let's say. And you also mentioned that the gravitron favorite fairground. Rides include. Oh, that's a fairground, right? I was like, I, I was like, what is the graviton? And I was, I, it made me. I started to think about the, the idea of a gravity particle.

14:14
Do you buy that? There's a gravity particle, or would you say that? There's, there's no gravity particle and it's just like, just the curvature of space somehow. What, what do you think? Yeah, I mean I have a lot of different that's on it. The one that I like the perspective that I'm taking for the last few days, because

14:41
It's all made of light some and so we're looking at like the solid time model rights like I'm getting and just because of it and the electron. So in this model, you would say that like we are very unique specify what it's all made of it with function. Something like this, that time is kind of a mother dimension and that gravity forces space you can form to the shape of time, which is emergent.

15:19
But I tried to this conversation last night about, you know, different kinds of emergence. Like, is it emerging to our perception by the things this structure already there? But it's not revealed to our perception to apart, sorry, emotion or to the parts going into motion actually produce something completely.

15:38
So there's like all of these so I look at time is emergent and then gravity beating, you know, kind of forcing space into the shape of time. So that the time would be continuous, the space would be discreet and the fabric would be. So I like what I look at it that when there are a lot of different models that are treated my when I look at it that way, it's just right now at least to make the most estimate of everything is being made of right.

16:07
Everything to me like your magnetism. And it's just this that we are not spending like we can't perceive them as such, you know. I don't want to go down the road. I don't want to go down the road. I'm saying like there's no difference between one thing and another.

16:25
Yeah. So, you know, light gravity and time have you ever positioned and supposed to different properties like that? But right now, I think I like, for like, the last 48 hours, I've been really digging now. So, at the, at the, when you think about like the universe that a fundamental, you know, particle level.

16:48
I mean, I'm just like I was thinking about the, the fine man lectures that I recently listened to that. I've heard about for years, but never had the chance to listen to because still shared them. Those that was good to get a chance to listen to them. Finally and, you know, listening to Richard, what's happening at the at the.

17:07
And, you know, with particles. It's I'm trying to remember, if you use the word like, like the the balls on a pool table, like just like, like or just almost like a lot of interacting like imagine just a lot of fears just interacting with each other. That's what it's how I guess he didn't say that but that's sort of like it's a lot of mechanical things bumping around and chaotic way and and do you what do you think about that?

17:40
Is that plausible? I mean, let me so light would be like, would you can you see? Light is like as like a billiard ball and on a pool table now and that model, light would be the fabric, the it would be literally, what space could be system. Great, because it would be the electron academic question.

18:11
It's kind of secure. I mean, it's been like two days literally, like 48 hours, trying to think about this way like, hardcore things about it this way, and yeah. So, what's it, what happens if we think about it that way, we're pages. Make that. That is all of the electoral that is the fabric of space.

18:32
Yeah, my CC studies about that, they're getting interrupting, 30 ciplinary now, and the concepts and physics and modeling of. This is related to what is now becomeing, popular. This is that is being used by this and also biologists so and doing AI. And so yeah, these are combinations of different disciplines that we have now.

19:04
And that reminds me as well of, you know, random walk and athletics and also KS theory. Yeah, and also you quoted is the portfolio spurn or something like that. Yeah, it's I think it's a polyester and there's there are images about that. So yeah, we could equate it to that if you know you talk about what the fine man was talking about.

19:31
In fact, I'm just thinking about doing happy art, find my room sometimes.

19:41
That I was just going to say that sounds lovely to sell. Just invite me to those. I love to have some physics conversations. I am. You know, what's weird is, I, I started writing a book and that I'm working on a that I didn't intend to write about physics in the book, but I, but I, but I'm like, that's where my, that's where this is the direction I'm going in right now.

20:06
So, I'm just, like, really fascinated with the topic and it's sort of going from neuroscience. Back towards physics is is kind of is interesting. What? How would you apply physics to neural networks, right? Like in terms of like, but also artificial neural networks. Yeah, the problem, you know, first, I would like to moment and what you're saying about the billiard balls, bumping.

20:39
And there was a study on this when we were looking at quantum noise and also quantum biology and I remembered, but the paper about photosynthesis and they were trying to like, and what's happening in both photosynthesis to what's happening in quantum computer and it is said that. Basically, if you do a random, walk in a classical computer would like to agree to what's happening.

21:20
Step that, you know, whenever you do an entanglement, you usually need someone to one correspondence. But when you do something, you don't know.

21:45
All that is how I like to go back to physics. Talk about famous concepts and there's regards. Neuron. There was a reason study about I think by because you know it doesn't get was my so much like the 10 years I has before I really loved him and I think it was seven years ago.

22:12
What's up videos? You cut out a little bit and you hear me now? Yes, yes. You just made a little bit here in there and usually because I see a red eyes and they're mentally coming.

22:33
Anyway, so in that second episode, you're a scientist. So he's a great one from Israel. And recently did the paper with the one, biological neuron with an artificial, neuron on a 1 to 1 correspondence because they wanted to understand the brain, even more is that are able to do some kind of option for just one.

23:03
Neuron. Artificial neuron, think about you it would have to do six times more than what the human that's so that this the premise of their study and they would like to go further in order and would like to make diagrams on how to understand or tried, artificial neurons to the human urine.

23:35
And I think because there is more technology now than there was seven years ago, they are going further into this settings. There is a very interesting study.

23:53
I just for a minute, I was looking through the list to see if I could invite like a neuroscientist. So I could ask some neuroscience questions. I don't know if VA. Do you know a lot about the about neuroscience? You know, not a lot. Okay, cool. I'm a neurological level.

24:17
I mean, the book and

24:24
Where I was like oh I thought there would be one pair. Oh but there are 20,000. Yeah. All right. So I have this idea. I want to make a room that's really about, like, exploring the prefrontal cortex and the olfactory bowl, but that, I guess we'll do that. I guess we can do that tomorrow or something.

24:45
Okay well, maybe no. I mean maybe. Yeah. Maybe we need to schedule like a week in advance of people can. Yeah, even just a day or two ahead, okay? So two days you think would be good? Yeah, I think a day or two and just just enough time for people to see it on the notification and like at it you know it's about if there's nothing on my calendar that I'm looking forward to that.

25:14
Yeah. I mean just got even come on the app for a while. And you know man I just got up this really good conversation. Interesting. So CCL. Do you wanted? I don't know. It may maybe I should ask you offline, but if you want to call, if you want to coordinate that with me, we could both.

25:35
We could both create that room. It depends on if you're interested in it. But yeah, we can discuss more and later on, I guess. So, get this.

25:51
Maybe if you also would like to message me backline or some focal points that you would like to discuss fairly and you talk about this, Also do retail to hazel who does a neurosurgeon.

26:21
And a lot great, so that it's on a lot of animals and profiles.

26:35
Okay, so I just proposed a name for the room. I don't know if it's, if it's too long. I guess we could just chop off the last word. If it's too long, I sent that to CEO. It's it's I can share it. I lied. If you guys want to hear say, yeah, I saw it.

26:54
Maybe we could chop it up a little bit but if sometimes, there are relations on this parts, maybe we can also discuss it. So, of course, when I do your science, my guy you don't be very man because in the past know that I really do art by the extreme success about this, because I know that you're in pain is not just hours.

27:24
That's right, perception. And thing that we can take the hat and roll it into a couple of different fields. Okay. Yeah, that sounds cool. Would you like to expand on that even more and just maybe describe like what what direction did you want to take that?

27:55
What question I guess I guess that is what questions are are driving you the most which that you want to find the answers to

28:06
Yeah, I'm not sure that. I'm yeah I'm not really questioning for answers. I just think for more knowledge and like ways of looking at things. So but yeah. I mean, I, I like I said, I'm literally like, losing my sensory nerves, right? So this gives a whole new perspective to this idea of finding what we're looking for and how our, how our prediction interact when our perceptions.

28:51
So yeah, like the the whole is that is the brain. The brain isn't really interacting directly with the body's ribbon interacting with a model of the body and we're not actually interacting with the world. We're interacting with our model of the and you know, it goes down to that same idea of when you're swimming.

29:13
Are you going to scream loudly and run away with something brushes, your foot? Or are you going to smile and think it's very sweet? You continue on. Well what do you what are you expecting that to be or I? Well yeah, already illustrated a lot like the child who sees the monster outside the window.

29:32
And there are very few data points upon which we build our models of this world. And so the child gets these data points and sees the monster and you're not going to miss the child that that is the tree until you can provide more data points. So, yeah, I'm just, you know, yeah, I'm interested in all of them.

29:52
So, I mean, I, I preferred the argument, I prefer to make the argument not just tonight, but like in general, like, I usually prefer the argument that the brain is actually in direct connection, with, with the world. And one sense that it's like, it's, it's part of the universe, right?

30:12
It's like physically connected with the world and, and yes, there's the brain is, is making models of reality that are not. It's not that these it's not that these models are not reality. They're just a first. They're just a one perspective on reality, right? And but but I'm saying like the this these models do represent reality and the brain isn't interacting with the world and a direct way, but it's just it's just a perspective and from a unique perspective so the brain has a unique perspective.

30:54
That's that's directly driven by it's experience with the world. Yeah. Yeah. I just if we start talking about the direct interaction then I mean I I roll right into field theory from there right? Yeah because then it all becomes quantized so it it's like just talk about the are you talking about?

31:21
Are you talking about field terry for psychology or quantum field theory? No like QFC right? But so to just talk about like neurological. Yeah, from our neurological framework. I'm kind of like staying away from, right? I'm kind of like a scolding myself to stay away from that idea of direct interaction, because that is a different like field, right?

31:50
I mean, feel to feel this study,

31:57
Oh, I guess I'm I guess I'm very multi disciplinary and I don't. I mix a mix different feels of study together and I love. Yeah, I'm actually writing a book that combines many different fields of study together. It's it's I I think that. Yeah, I hope you read it because I think you're really like this book.

32:16
Not it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if people are interested in is certain ideas and they're gonna like this book. So,

32:28
This thing with an open, Google box, waiting free to save any title. What does that mean? You're sitting in with an open? Google box waiting free to save any title. I'm sorry. You said that there was a book that you thought that we would have enjoyed and waiting for the title so I can put it into Google.

32:51
No I'm saying I'm writing a I'm writing a book and oh you're the one you're writing. Oh, absolutely absolutely yeah, yeah. No, I'm sorry. It's it's, it's not it's not done yet but but I but I think that people who are interested in how the mind works are gonna dig the, they're really gonna like my book because I go into a lot of the neurofits, the human mind and also the physics and the math and the and brain computer interfaces.

33:21
And also artificial intelligence is another topic and the in the book how we can make new kinds of neural networks that are conscious conscious like like human human beings are. So I I have good ideas that I'm working on, but that a lot of it is, is coming together nicely, and but there are certain areas where I still have work to do.

33:49
So it's like, what I've got, is, I mean, I don't know if you guys want to hear about this, right? I, I've got like, I've got an enormous amount of material written, and I've got an enormous amount of organization work that I've done in terms of, like, organizing the structure of the book and the contents of the book and deciding, what's going into the book, and it's not going in the book.

34:13
And I've got all these notes, and all these audio recordings that I'm going to turn into basically chapters that, you know, like, I've I like, I've in some cases recorded, a chapter with my microphone or type to chapter into a note. And now I'm like integrating them into like the body of the book and it's all like there's like a tons of.

34:34
Like I don't think there's gonna be there's any other book out there. That's like my book in terms of how in terms of like how many different. Because the reason I brought this up is because because is is the idea of like, you know, we accidentally started talking about a different area of research and like, always a second.

34:54
That's not my, not where I go, usually. And I was just, I was just making the point that I'm bringing together, like a lot of different industries and into this book. Like, there's there's, it's weird like, you know, I'm talking about, you know, virtue reality and augmented reality in a context of, of the brain.

35:15
And, and of course, you know, we already talked about the matrix. Well, the matrix is like a virtual reality and in one sense. So there's anyway, that's part that's that's a part of the discussion that I'm putting together. So that's why, that's why I think that's that's a good way to explain why.

35:32
If you like this discussion you'll like the book yeah. Yeah, I have two thoughts and one of them is are you sure we'll just be one book when you're finished collating? All of the all of its entities. That sounds like it maybe like a couple of. Yeah. No, I'm already.

35:58
Like I'm already like eyeballing 300 pages but also considering like well, I, you know, like you said, multiple volumes of stuff. Yeah, my second thought is this is something that recently. I've been really rallying next again, or railing on again, everyone's been a while, I just get super annoyed with how separated all the fields are becoming, or have our, and are getting even more in more separate.

36:30
And like I understand that it's necessary to sort things so that people can go very deeply into very specific areas. It's like the music thing, right? There's like a million and one genres like the genres are so specific and thinking like I wasn't aware that I liked spectacular type of music because it was just a genre that I had in order.

36:53
But I know I like this mother showing her, but I didn't know that this and I feel like that it's happening for it or with the science also, where I'm like, wait a minute, is that called bio business now? Or is this still like, you know, molecular biopic you know, like what is?

37:10
Yeah. Yeah. So I really, really that was my second to be really appreciating going across this. And there's because I do believe that. I hope you're in model, and

37:29
Screen. And I have to confess that my, my I'm about to fall asleep over here. So, I should say good night to everybody. And to feel, I don't know when you were gonna go, but I think you said you. Yeah.

38:02
Of that. They can organize them better interviews, and funding projections. So I saw it over, but I was thinking, you know, a little different, but that concept but I also have to go. See, and I would like to thank rejoining us today and my guide. Yeah, it was great to see you both again and really easy.

38:35
Yeah, I look forward to.

38:43
Okay, good night, everybody. All right, 9.
