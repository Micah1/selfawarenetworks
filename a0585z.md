a0585z ctp if you take one part of the brain and magnify it another the other then that is how one memory-prediction becomes the focus of the rest of the brain and body

imagine that a cell is an object in category theory, and its messages sent & rec are morphisms, that transform the identity
cell so it takes the inputs, pools them? to calculate its response
like the quantity of identical receptors ought to determine which genes will respond and how many will respond, its a spatial threshold mechanism for the cell to determine its response

the set of all elements inside a cell does not need to be know exactly because the composition table or the multiplatication table 

cellular communication is like a multiplication of signal types to unlock threshold limited reactions from genes, proteins and cell functions

and cells are "learning" by changing from the influx of signals, to attain a new state

so what missing from category theory is a statement management for identity

because identity refers to a single state of a transformation, the morphism points to another state but if you want to describe how two states are transforming each other, we need the set of transformations under identities

feelings and emotions could be the information of threshold changes in chemical signalling actually, the information encoded in the phase changes of chemical signals initiating genetic changes
