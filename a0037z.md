tonic, phasic, high phasic, and inhibited
4 main levels of signal detection & signal transmission at the synapse
0,1,2,3 Vesicles can be released
Receptors have 4 levels of conductivity

but it's interesting that powerband oscillations fall into named groups such as delta, theta, beta, alpha, gamma, high gamma

delta, theta, beta, alpha, being mostly tonic? Is this correct I'm not sure

but many of the incoming sensory paths are in the alpha powerband frequency range, so maybe alpha, beta, and gamma frequences can be considered phasic

delta, theta frequencies might be considered tonic

with gamma & high gamma being high phasic

I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia
