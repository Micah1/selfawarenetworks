Talking Neuralink Neuron Microphones Neocortex

00:00

Inside the New York College just be more country. I love to understand more. Sure. So you can the neocortex is like the top two-thirds of the human brain and the neocortex is is the human's have the largest neocortex but but this this this cortex which is the new rind exists in and I think almost all of the mammals including mice but it's different in other mammals.

00:34

Like so pretty much all mammals have like the same sort of six layers sort of but. If you look at yeah, well yeah okay, um, but the structures the structure the structures vary a lot. So for example at a mouse like it has the mouse brain is mostly layer one and the rest of the layers are really compressed whereas for a human being we have a lot of each of the layers like they're all the layers have lots of space.

01:01

For I think I I think I've seen some descriptions of of like the whale in dolphin brains being like one layer but it's probably mostly one layer with the rest of layers really compressed just like a just like a mouse. That's that's a I don't know exactly if that's true but I think that's probably the case.

01:25

Sugarloans should question. So to answer your most question so there was just there was a neuroscientist who was like studying cats and he was like if you like brush a cat like if you brush it's it's for or something he they had electrodes in the in the brain of the cat to see what would part of the brain would would fire and with this scientist discovered.

01:48

I think it was in the 40 in the 40s or something like that, maybe 30 to 40s, he he said, he can't put this idea that in neural column, which is like one. So I guess so neuro calm, so. The neocortex if you took it out of someone's out of out of out of the out of a brain if took it out of a skull and you flattened the brain you flattened the the top then just a neocortex.

02:12

It's like it's like after you unscrunch it it's like basically it's like a napkin in terms of like a dinner napkin like a big you know, I don't know it's a not like a small name. Yeah, I mean it's but it's like it's like this big flat. It's like a big flat napkins.

02:34

So but if you wanted to like if you just wanted to look like it two centimeters of that napkin. Then that would then what's in that is like a neural column. And so what so the idea is that when the cat when you're scratching the cat and in the whiskers are being activated there's just like one tiny corresponding part in and part of that brain that's it's active that represents those whiskers.

02:57

And so this scientist he was like, well the he thinks that they're neuro column is basically the organ and the organizing principle of information in the brain. And and so that idea there's a more modern version of that idea and there's a book called a thousand brains and it's ideas that use that you'd have like in your visual cortex in the back of your head you when you are holding a coffee cup or maybe you're holding your phone so if you look at your phone if you have your phone in your hand, there's there's there are columns in the visual cortex that are that are basically creating a model of that phone it's like maybe like a thousand different models in the phone and each of those models is a model slightly differently by.

03:41

Different columns in the in the neocortex so it's like a different you know centimeter of brain tissue is is rendering the phone over and another centimeter of brain issues rendering the same phone but slightly in a slightly different way and there's a hundred or a thousand of these different images and then you have parts of the visual cortex that are sort of like creating a representation of the sounds that that phone makes if you like if you bang the sound on the bang the phone on something then that sound is going to be rendered is going to be created like a thousand times in your audio cortex.

04:16

And as you touch the phone as you move your fingers along the phone along the back or the front you've got your somatosensory cortex represent your touch and so you've got maybe a thousand representations of where your hand is in your smatter sensory cortex and the interesting thing is is that all these different neuro columns are talking to each other so as as the the part of your brain in the visual cortex is coming up with the representations of the phone and predictions of how it's the phone is going to look if if you suddenly saw a crack in the phone, you'd be very surprised because your brain is modeling the phone and it's predicting.

04:51

What it's going to look like and it's prediction is a model like a 3d model of the phone and and then it and that has to be talking to your somatosensory cortex to all the representations that are tracking where your fingers aren't your phone so they can predict as you see your fingers moving along the phone you also are you also are going to predict what you're going to feel next so what you're seeing and what you're feeling those are two different parts of your brain that are talking to each other so you have all these different representations of what you're feeling talking to all these different representations of your of what you're seeing and that it's like you're.

05:26

The it's like the micro columns in your in your video cortex sending information to the back and forth with the micro with the columns the cortical columns the word sorry, the word is quarto comes on microphones the to the cortical columns in your somatosensory cortex and those are sending information back and forth with the cortical columns in your audio cortex, which is where you're hearing is taking place and all three of those sensory input areas are sending information back and forth sort of like constantly to to make predictions as you rotate the phone as you change it to.

06:01

To to predict also the orientation of the phone and not basically the orientation position sites and sounds have every single object in the room with you right now like everything is managed by different every object is managed by different. Cortical columns that are modeling you may have thousands of cortical columns that are modeling anything that you're looking at anything that you focusing on anything in the background and the room itself and whatever so whatever you're focused on is probably what's going to probably was taking up the most cortical columns at that particular time, but those cortical columns are you know, what you're focused on that they're doing the most communication with all the different sensory areas and then when it comes to basically higher levels of thinking when you're thinking about an abstract concept, like an object, you're gonna have like you're gonna have a part of.

06:55

Your basically you're gonna have maybe in the in the prefrontal what is called the yet prefrontal lobes the prefrontal cortex, you're gonna have maybe maybe some ideas that are basically managed by the cortical columns as well and those cortical columns so like if you have the idea of a fish.

07:19

And you're thinking about how the fish looks and how the fish tastes and well so when you're thinking about how the fish looks so you have the idea of a fish right but then if you're looking about if you think about how the fish looks then you're then you're you're you're prefrontal cortex is now talking to your visual cortex and if you're thinking about how how the fish feels it when you pick it up and and handle it or chop it or feed it all these different like like if you think about you know, you know the feeling the feeling of the fish that is your prefrontal cortex the idea talking to the field.

07:54

Ing part of your brain which is this amount of sensory cortex which is in its use visualizing at that at the same time if you're seeing the fish, then you're you're you're visual cortex is also talking to this matter since we cortex and your prefrontal cortex and so you have these you'd have micro columns lots of micro columns and each part of the of the brain and they're all talking to each other when you're when you're doing that mental activity and so if we could so with when it comes to their link in early is the ability to implant a lot of electrodes that can read single electron.

08:29

S firing and sorry single neurons firing right and so you can put elect you put 16 electrodes per each of these strands into the brain and that means you can triangulate with you you can you can try to triangulate and basically figure out where signals are coming from which is it's just the hard thing to do in general, but but the but the neuralink is like really just an incredible device with all of the, In its design in terms of like the cut because if you questions.

09:03

Yeah, I'll pause.

09:14

The front regions of the brain that you're talking about these when you get injected or when the the neural link, you know, it checks the valves and little strands is it only going to be looking at like a specific part of the brain so is it going to be limited to like say one part of your one of one part of where these representations are so if it's going to be able to do the vision cortex or some other part or is it actually spread out enough that it can reach all of these different part?

09:47

So that is up to the scientists but the the current design of the knurling well what they're doing what they're doing right now is they're they're implanting like three round three thousand electrodes at a time, but they have the capability with the current device to sustain 10,000 electrodes and with with future devices.

10:05

I mean, there's no limit there's no limit so they could stick the the the key the key thing though is that it's pretty much gonna be about decoding the the neocortex or the the probably I would say once if I figure out if they've already figured out what I'm talking about then then they're probably gonna be decoding the the cortical columns and so cortical columns are neocortex and the neocortex which is on the top of the brain and then that should be extra work out for for an early link but.

10:40

Like like a layer of an onion on top of the brain or is it like a spot on top of the brain well then so the neocortex is is actually the top two-thirds of the brain but it's sort of scrunched up so it's not the entire neocortex isn't completely accessible but but a lot of it is and that might be enough.

11:08

The cat part at the beginning. I don't remember the details but like people were able to scientists took out. I think the neocortex we most of it from cats and then these cats put back in their isolation. Almost looked normally just got super exploratory just because if you take that out what's left is sort of like the lizard brain as they call it sometimes and then that's just all survival instinct no regulation.

11:45

But I don't know that's just what I thought you're going at first but yeah, I mean I I'm willing to bet that that for most of neuroscience none of the animal survived and any of the brain surgeries from basically the for the first 10 years of a brain surgery and human beings and not a single person lived it wasn't took them 10 years to figure it out.

12:13

So I mean in modern days, of course, we can do like brain like the neural video with with the monkey the monkey lives the pegs live like they these are but in the old days yeah that all the animals. I'm sure are pretty to probably died. I'm sorry, that's probably grandpa.

12:32

's trying to think that of there's something else you said that but it's cool, that was a. That's a good speech to thanks for inviting us to your keynote hmm.

12:51

Yeah, I am very curious like just in what sense we get these or? First iterations come out like what? The abilities they could have based off of where this technology seems to be headed. And and it seems as if like well I so I don't know if there's like a like when when there's a place where you want to be if you want to look at language or is that kind of spread out throughout the whole brain or maybe we over value that.

13:31

It's very curious yeah what kind of signals like moving a cursor is one thing and then typing a sentence is another thing but thinking a sentence is another thing and then. If yeah and I another thought I had had it's sorry I'm rambling but this is one last thought here is I I wonder if what we'll do is.

13:54

You know take these neural links and then just tie them into our AI assistant and just kind of feed the raw signals to some other AI that then, you know kind of we interact with and so it it it like as we're thinking able to process right then and there what kind of quote unquote assistance it should provide and and yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:17

I think that's kind of maybe an in what if that's even like a feedback loop where you you have the signals come out and then go back into your brain after they go through some kind of processing computer stuff and then Injects maybe a new even if you're just showing images or words it is kind of a feedback loop that you you would be doing upon yourself.

14:40

yeah so I can answer all those questions if I can remember them all but so so the first first generations of neural link what what neural link is saying is that they're going to basically do they're basically doing what they showed you in the monkey video which is like base is it's the same sort of technology that they had in physical brain gate brain gate was you can look that up if you want but brain gate was the the first idea to use.

15:12

To implant electrodes above the somatosensory cortex or the motor cortex I've ever one of those two and in order to so that the patients could control a mouse on on a screen and and thus control variety of different devices basically for paralyzed people so they want to they want to basically create an improved version of that just to just you know, as a proof of concept because they can because if they mass produce this and then that means that that every paralyzed person in the world can have one and and and now everyone.

15:47

Paralyzed person in the world can have functionality that they didn't have. In addition in addition, so you know, I believe you know that this is going to lead to basically the restoration of. I've you know basically like, you know, like if someone has a severed spine. Well there was a time when you know, there's there was no hope for for restoring function to you know between the brain and the rest of the body because there's there's no conceptual understanding of of what signals needed to travel across the spine that had been severed and in how to know how to fix that but I I think that that, you know, maybe that problem will be will be solved based upon newer ideas that that.

16:44

People are in are having and also combined with this neuron neural link technology and. See what was the rest of that you want to say. Oh in terms of you said, oh go ahead go ahead go ahead. Um, Yeah. I'm just trying to remember.

17:11

I do have a maybe a interesting question it's a brief one too, you had mentioned if I can now remember the question but you had mentioned or I guess this isn't even a question this is a comment just I remember I saw Elon Musk tweeting that he had seen the or he had said that the, Neuro lace is going to make it so people can communicate better with their phones than you can with your thumbs and I see that to be like probably much easier to do than playing upon me even if you can just kind of have like where the person's looking that's kind of a click but sorry, I I could have swore.

17:55

I had a question and then once I got to it it turned into a comment, but maybe I did that there. Hey I wanted to say something real quick I why do you remember break the question I was in a group it's sort of a social experiment right because I wanted to know what these doctors actually knew anything and then you actually knew anything about um, you're wasting or the technology so it's in a medical group right it wasn't really a medical group which is a bunch of doctors like with extreme heaters hanging out and I'm like and like a few of them were like in genomics, so they said I don't like you understand that, you know, Elon Musk's you know link I I know it's I know he bought the technology.

18:35

I know that it was you know invented by somebody else but that's Besides the point okay? I was like do you understand that this technology could actually could could could very very well in the extreme near future help, you know, quadriplegics, you know, try to navigate IoT devices and there were like basically they told me that I was you know completely just in genius that they don't believe any of this shit is all bunker is not gonna happen for at least a hundred years, so I'm like, how do you know that and you can you give me any evidence to back up your claims?

19:11

They just got very upset. I was booted from the room eventually because I was asking these questions that they didn't like. So what are your thoughts on this mica? I just thought it was absurd. They had like no no facts at all. Right. I mean, you could you could just I mean, I think we covered it earlier you could point them to brain gate and point them to the video with the monkey controlling the mouse.

19:31

I mean, that's that covers it, right? Yeah.

19:35

And they were like, oh yeah, I saw that. They were like, oh it's all ER bullshit. I'm like, why do you know what it is? Can you can you give me any evidence that it is? They were like, oh yeah, it's all hype. I'm like interesting that you say that.

19:48

There's a number of these guys that go through rooms and conversations like this and then they they just like, You know, we could be having this conversation one of these guys can come in and then be like oh but you don't have the exact documented research evidence for this and so basically they're like describes and Pharisees they're like, it's cautering it and yeah, it's called gaslighting it.

20:18

Yeah, they're turning into like an ideology or you know, so some huge dogma but it's like, you know the whole point of an app like this is so you can have conversations and if you have to like go and like make sure every thought that you have is like completely verified by like three sources or whatever they try to do then it's just like nobody can really think but you know, we put together these thoughts how these conversations but yeah, there's always gonna be that those groups and that's just like, How some people choose to have a pathetic existence, but don't let it get to you.

21:00

Yeah, I mean. You're in the medical field and they're like quote unquote trying to develop disruptive technology to help people like how Elon Musk is going to help people but they didn't they didn't want to give him any kind of credit and I'm not a huge fan of you know, I must I'm talking about you know who they you know device that he's going to this at that actually very well they help quadriplegics.

21:26

I think it's very exciting and definitely noteworthy, don't you think they're just narcissists? Yeah actually remembered lessons questions. If you want me to go from there. So one of the some, Of the questions were like well what about you know language and and what about certain like, you know brain areas if I wanted to if I wanted to decode, you know, what someone was thinking or and I guess that could apply to any different kind of thought.

21:51

So there aren't there, right? So there are there's association areas in the brain that are like, you know is broke as area and we're next area and those are associated with with with speech and language and and there's a bunch of other association areas that the basically like this it's like a, Level operation seems to be happening there based upon when patients get injured that that patient loses the ability to like either speak or to understand language that those sorts of things.

22:24

And so if the neural link device can reach, you know brokers area and orders area then then I guess that those might be targets for trying to decode. And I think they I think they have been and I think I think that, You know it's not like it's not like neuralink is the first device that has been used to try to listen to on single neurons firing you can use you can use like the Utah array or you can use other other devices to try to listen to neurons firing but what I think I think the issue with language is that it's it's it was there there wasn't enough.

23:03

I think there's two things there's one is there wasn't enough electrodes to really like triangulate the sources of the signals to properly decode them and to like trying to decode like see the weight the weight neurons are. Really long like they go really long distances and they go in random directions and they end the part of the neuron with the despite comes out of can can kind of be random.

23:25

Like I mean, they they they have that there's an active potential which happens in the in the body and it's and then there's the dendritic spike but but the part in terms of like that you're sensor's gonna pick up, you know where that is where it's gonna detect a spike it could be a different place and so like if you're trying to figure out if a spike came if you're trying to figure out where a spike came from.

23:50

If your electric picks up a spike right it's just like it's like it's like okay so imagine like the imagine you just have a dark room and there's a microphone in the room and that microphone represents your your electrode, right? So your electrode doesn't know if if like I say this is spike is a large is a sound.

24:07

And so a spike happens and the microphone picks up a sound but it doesn't know where that that spike came from and then so if you put three electrodes white well, well what happens is the spike happens and all three microphones pick up the sound but in some of the microphones.

24:25

It's gonna be like a little louder and so maybe the spike is closer to the to the microphone as a little louder and so you might think okay, well the neuron could be closer to the mic that was a little louder but then the same neuron fires but a different but the spike happened is notice that a different point and so what happens is the same narrow fires, but if I but the spike comes out at a different point, it is closer to a different microphone, you might think that is a different neuron.

24:54

Because because this bike happened somewhere else and but actually it's the same neuron. And and so it's and it gets a complicated like so then you see another spike where the first one happened but it but because neurons are all squeezed together this this spike could actually be a different neuron even though it seems to be from the same neuron.

25:15

And so like you so I'm at so so this is like trying to triangulate not only where spikes are coming from with multiple microphones with multiple electrodes, but also which spike belongs to which neuron is really difficult. As you. Can imagine with a scenario so when you're link does is is there they're gonna say okay, we're gonna put 16 electrodes for each one of these, you know implants and then we're gonna put each one of these like hair like the implant is like the it's like implanting a hair and that hair has like 16 electrodes on it and they're doing that because they this like putting 16 microphones in a room but then they're doing like, okay 16, but then we're gonna put a hundred at once so it's like a hundred times 16 and just one area and So now there's like a now imagine you're in a dark room and you've got a hundred different things hanging out from the ceiling and each of these things has a different microphone and so now and so now when the neurons fire like what you're the image that you're reproducing and trying to decode like what's firing and where it's firing from is a lot richer it's a lot more detail you can really tell the difference now between whether that that sick that signal that was coming from that one spot is really that one.

26:35

Neuron or if it's if it's coming from a slightly different area you can tell because you have so many different microphones or electrodes and then and then you know, you can you can begin to maybe figure out you know, if a neuron is is making noise and two different places you can you you might be able to figure that out too but I don't know all the exactly how how they do that but but it's something like that.

27:05

This has been really great I they have a sense I didn't know that neurons. I always thought of neurons that's being like kind of all the same length and all just kind of like stacked together like a little puzzle pieces, but thinking of I I I did some like side googling and the neuron and our spinal cord is like can be you know a meter long and so just thinking of that's really fascinating and then addition just this sense that which like again when I when I was thinking of the neural link I was thinking of each of these little strands and I didn't know how many.

27:40

How many neuro or how many electrodes I was one of the questions that you answered before I could ask it because I with the the fact that there's 16 per strand but then the I was thinking like those strands which just like sit next to neurons and just they all that they would have access to is like whichever neurons they would connect to directly like touching that's what kind of would be the the signal a would be getting but this sense that that's not it it's more that it's like they're, you know, submerging themselves and in like the the the, Ta triangulate all of the different electrical signals that come from the different places one question.

28:23

I would I would have is just like how far like is there like when a neuron fires is it like what's the like radius of that that electron spike is sure far in which way like yeah, yeah, so thank you this has been really great so dependent so depending on the density of the brain at any given point it could be as many as a thousand neurons at one electrode is picking up and listening to.

28:50

Wow, okay, okay and it can like along the side with the other electrodes near it it can triangulate with those others to try and get like actually the the exact precise point that that electrons firing at so you can actually build that full three-dimensional model at least to some accuracy because you're not just.

29:13

Yeah with the with the ability to triangulate to some degree of accuracy that's right, but in fact when you have electrodes in the brain like this, you can track signals across the entire brain in fact you can track signals from from outside the brain with with EEG you can you can trace you can use what's called you get it's called eg source localization and and you can see like you can track accurately where you know where signals in the brain are coming from as deep as the thalamus with just the EG so with with with implant.

29:48

Electrodes with neural link the there are the ultimate capability is to just attract where signals are coming from everywhere in the brain but most accurately to action potentials that are really close to the electrode and to make predictions about what's firing within with really accurate predictions about what's firing within the the radius of about a thousand neurons, but ultimately be able to do brain imaging everywhere, but but in with the degrees of like the resolution as best we're where the electrode is close.

30:23

To us and it's second best when you're within like, you know that that I think it's a hundred and forty micrometers which is about a which can be about a thousand neurons. I think and then and then but then at a lower resolution you can track everything in the brain.

30:43

I have a textbook for you if you're interested well. I mean, it's not for me it's actually free you can get around the internet. I think it's put up a UCSD is called Niro science and it actually is an 800-page textbook that I'm currently reading and it will pretty much has all the answers that Mica well not all of them but pretty much how neurons work and you know, the actual all the structures of was that book again, it's called nearest science.

31:10

I think it's a third edition. Eating it now my condol.

31:19

Ences they believed that I'm sorry when when when there was a huge dispute between two types to two fields of a neuroscience. I want to say it's a little confusing because I haven't I actually had to put down the bug because it said that it's it basically gives you a very concise and very complicated and difficult to understand history of neuroscience and I'm going into like the glial cells all the structures.

31:53

Of our of other cells and you know all the way up to present, you know techniques I guess of yeah, I guess like pet and MRIs and stuff like that is the author Dale perms yeah or that guy okay, um, yeah there's a there's another book that if you like that book there's another book that you probably would would think is really cool it's called rhythms of the brain.

32:21

So yeah yeah, it's edited by Gale purse and George Augustine. And I'm like a quarter of the way through with that and then I'm gonna check out the book that you just recommended like I think yeah, I think you like it for for the basically the same reasons it covers a lot of the same material probably.

32:44

But with the slightly different angle perspective.

33:01

I I'd actually didn't hear what said because you were breaking up if you want to try again, that's fine. Now I'm just saying there's a fascinating field of study and um, I think that we're going to have for instance. I know I know that. That you know, various various mental illnesses are going to.

33:27

Pretty much be covered in the future we're pretty much abated in the future with technology like neural acing so that's the hypothesis. I mean, I'm sure that you know a lot more about that. I've heard of that from various people in in, you know in the mental health community and people in tech that they're actually working on this, you know, having to do the New York tax and then the PFC in different parts of the brain like deep brain structures, for instance, like OCD is going to be a something in the past.

34:01

So what do you think about that do you know anything about that about OCD? I'm OCD in particular I'm probably not I'm probably not familiar with the specific article that you might be referencing. I'm not representing any articles. I'm just representing I'm just talking about how a lot of mental various mental illnesses earned one of you think of the past with this type of technology, like neural link, oh, um, yeah.

34:29

I I'm not exactly sure what? What Elon Musk is talking about in that instance. I mean, so I mean what I can say is that with what what they have talked about is closed loop therapies where you you the closest therapy would be that you would you stimulate the brain and then look at what the simulation did to see if you're either improving the patient's outcome or or worsening the patients calm and then you stimulate again and then you look at what happened again and you do it you do it over and over again and you try a stimulation and different.

35:10

Different different electrodes different strengths and and you basically play with the person's brain until you're producing a better outcome. But what I've heard is that. Is that the medical professionals may not even begin to to do this kind of closely therapy on patients in the short term just because of for a couple things.

35:37

One is that you know, every time you breathe or the most subtle movement that electrode could be moving around and because all your all your nerve because you're you're, Neurons are are you know almost like spaghetti the in terms of like going in terms of like everything is going everywhere and everything is layered on top of everything else and so what happens is when that when that electron fires it's gonna send a pulse that could I mean, the post could affect a lot of different things simultaneously that you didn't intend to and because you might have a neuron that's going from you know, where the electrical pulses to the other side of your head, you could be stimulating something on the other side of your head that you never intended to stimulate and it ended and it's gonna be different.

36:25

For each person and so it's basically kind of like at this point it's kind of a it's kind of a it's kind of a mess to try to figure out how to do a closed loop therapy in a safe way. I think this is what I'm hearing but so there are some things that they're gonna have to figure out first especially because you know, like even if you even if you figure out what the patient needs in the electrode moves, well now with the patient needs is different than with the patient needed before because you don't necessarily like how you're gonna know exactly how the electrode moved right because you'd almost.

37:00

Have to like basically do the sort of high resolution mapping of the brain with all your microphones in the dark room again to figure out how they moved from the last time and it's really it's really just this is just it's just these are hard problems and. So I don't know what the with the with the solution is right now except that maybe they're gonna have to think about.

37:27

Stimulating the brain from from outside the brain like, you know, like like maybe stimulating your eyes and your ears or your your tongue or your back or your feet and instead of stimulating the brain directly but but stimulating nerves that extend outside the brain. So that might be a safer route or something.

37:49

Is it possible that I'm curious? Do you think it's possible to block your possible but is it probable that they'll be able to like, you know, you know trace certain signals from one area of the brain from let's say from the near cortex or maybe the front of the brain to deeper deeper structures in the brain with somebody who has been diagnosed with something like excessive or pure o is as they call what they call churros like pure obsessive thought.

38:23

Would they be able to? Record. At that and trace it and see what happens in an individual over let's say a few you know, a few days period of time to try to help that person. Arguably yes so arguably so the level of detail that we're talking about is basically the sync the level of the single neuron firing and I guess I guess one of the ideas with was OCD is it could be that part of your brain is is is too excited and firing too much and so if you're able to put the electrodes in that area of the brain and you know, maybe just just you know, when I when idea I guess as an sort of narrow feedback idea if you could put if you could put the electron.

39:10

S or the medical imaging device in the in the in the part of the brain that that is really noisy when a person is having an OCD experience and you're able to help them to become aware of their own brain. And what's happening there, then they might through that through the feedback feedback loop learn to quiet that area of their brain just by observing it and observing what's going on so that that's one when possible therapy that I think has been tried in the past with some effectiveness it neurofe neurofeedback under like kind of yeah.

39:47

I thought about this. In the sense of like if you just had like a screen in front of somebody and you read out like they were just looking at the words that popped into their head as they popped into their head and I was just thinking what kind of effect that might have one people and I could see that being kind of therapeutic if you were like showing them like maybe some of their underlying thoughts that they were fully conscious of and bringing that to the floor and and showing that to them, so they could then you know, maybe cause that feedback to.

40:21

I I feel like I subscribed to that idea a lot in terms of like well you know what is the history of meditation been about except asking people to just sit with awareness and be aware of their own thoughts and if you if you can just be aware of your thoughts, maybe you'll be able to maybe peace will descend upon on you, right so that's this idea is like so meditation is a self-awareness practice humming when you hum you're hearing a sound that your brain waves are making and then that is creating like a feedback loop if you see yourself in the mirror your eyes are seeing your body move and you're Brain is causing your body move and so your brain is is there's a feedback cycle between your eyes and your brain waves and your movements and so that is another form of like meditation so if you're humming or talking in front of the mirror and meditating like these are all like expanding your awareness and then if you add like a light and sound machine that it that you're you know, you're this the light and sounds are changing based upon your actual easy activity, which is something I didn't 2012 in when I I started the business in San Francisco, then.

41:26

People can listen can can begin to get a feedback loop between how their thoughts and feelings are you know causing their brain waves to change which is causing the lights and it's causing lightness and sound and the computer to change so that what they're seeing and hearing with the LED glasses and the headphones is reflecting their thoughts and feelings and this feedback loop you can induce like a very deep meditative state and and so like the it's like a lot of different ways people have done neurofeedback and I just described several different ways but I am as subscribed to this this this idea that yeah if you if we could put microphones or electrodes inside your brain.

42:01

And allow you to listen to your own to your own thoughts, but on our computer screen to see your own thoughts then potentially yeah that would have therapeutic effects in terms of really helping someone to relax and to expand their awareness around their own brain and it would be beneficial in a in a in a piece growing emotionally healing sort of way.

42:25

I think. I would wonder. Make those sis and whether or not it could you know, strengthen somebody's psychosis and so I think it would still want to be like you wanted one maybe that to be completely unfiltered and maybe have some safeguard. Yeah, I for sure maybe that would maybe would help.

42:56

He has became even more real. Being in front of their face. I feel like people with that kind of. Right all right yeah yeah yeah so yeah so a lot of the depression that some people have you know, when they describe ruminate ruminating is the word ruminating symptoms where they just keep thinking over the same depressive thoughts over and over again and it's like this it's like the default mode network of brain activity is just sort of like putting them into a mental holding pattern with all the all they can do is like they keep having the same depressed or basically thought unwanted thoughts over and over again, maybe they could be the thoughts of of self-harm.

43:40

Or harming others or you know just just you know sad thoughts that they don't want to have but they just can't stop having because their brain is like going through the cycle that they can't escape from and then if you if you then I guess if you say well if you just extended that you know, sort of like if you give them if you give a microphone to it and they're just like a reinforced it that would be terrible and I agree that's not that that that that would probably not work what has worked in those situations.

44:04

I think has been, you know, given even giving the the person's. That brain the person's brain an extraordinary amount of of of stimulation to sort of break them out of that rumination and in in that so that's simulation has come coming into in many different forms from electrical electrically stimulating the brain to psychoactive medication like hallucinogens to there's there's a whole bunch of different things that you know, you so like so it was interesting is that so serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

44:41

The the sort of like clogging the the serotonin receptors in the in the core of the brain, but then like the psychoactive medication is is is is a serotonin agonist but it targets the part of the brain that's in the neocortex it's not in the core of the brain so it's targeting serotonin receptors that are non-incore in the brain so but the serotonin the reuptake inhibitors are targeting this the serotonin receptors in in the core of the brain so like we're here we have two different.

45:16

Sort of medical approaches now that are under study and one of them is was tried to basically try 
to beat depression by targeting serotonin receptors in the core of the brain that's the old one and the new one is to try to defeat defeat depression by targeting the serotonin receptors in the in the neocortex which is not in the core of the brain and that is so that's that's that's just interesting that the new therapy that is being is researching that is being researched in terms of using psychedelic drugs to treat patients with this default mode syndrome-based.

45:51

In is still targeting serotonin and receptors it's very interesting but but ultimately the point of either one of these medications would be to basically cause a lot of stimulation and in a certain area of the brain and so in that sense they're analogous to basically using like something like either transcranial direct stimulate director current simulation to stimulate the brain or trans cranial magnetic stimulation to simulate the brain or or any number of other things that can connect to stimulate the brain there's there's a handful of other things.

46:25

I'm blanking a little bit right now, but But but I just see this.

46:39

People if they got out and they were able to start stimulating them. You know, new relationships and communities that that stimulation is kind of like what they need and a lot of cases but but I guess there's there's definitely a more medical since to it but just like this thought of stimulation being what gets people out of you know, the fronts it's it seems like.

47:08

It makes sense why that would be maybe a response to a lack of community and things like that well I mean I would just go so farther and say this simulating the brain I think would not work in all situations of depression, especially if the depression is based upon some sort of metabolic disorder where the basically the root of it is that the patient cells have been so damaged by overstimulation that they're no longer able to produce enough energy to meet the energy demands of that person's body and so certain kinds of depression if you tried to add stimulation.

47:37

I think would result in the patient just getting worse and long-term even if they saw temporary. I. Private because you really want to basically instead of treating them with more simulation you you may want to treat them with oh there's also another another thing is a light stimulation you may want to treat them with something that can help them to to either metabolize energy better or to create more ATP the light simulation is interesting so they have this red light simulation device that basically what it does is it actually it not only stimulates your brain but it's stimulates your your cells to create more ATP to so there's a couple of things you need to create more ATP, you probably need more reason.

48:18

S like like I don't know like dribbos can help your body to make more ATP for example but if you're if you just flood your body with you know deprivos what you know, the other thing is that you're self-happed to actually go through the action of using the derivos and so if this red light stimulation that some people are receiving a combined with the irrevose might help someone's body to make more energy which may help them to alleviate depression, but you might want to use that in combination with some sort of stimulation that could be a psychoactive stimulation so that the patient is getting both the ability to.

48:53

Create new energy and to escape the the the pattern of negativity that they're stuck in at the same time, but if you if you just try to like give the patient a lot of new stimulation, they may just get tired and in fact a lot of times what happens is after a patient has a stimulation sort of therapy, they are tired for many days afterwards and very very tired and so they can't think and so maybe they have like great results right after TMS, but then for the next week, they just they they are really just so there's like, A mental fog because they're just so tired never brain needs to recover so so I think there's you know, we the science scientists hold the medical.

49:38

The medical world as a whole still has a lot of things to figure out.

49:53

Was that good?

49:58

No thank you it's great it is great.

50:05

Ly Sean is that how you pronounce your name? I don't know anyway. I'll disable shop you say something about people will traveling and simulating themselves and I mean, I live in I don't know if you live in the United States. I live in the United States there was a series economic depression going on there a lot of people it's not it's even affect me, but I do I do realize that it's a lot of people especially among certain demographics, they don't have the ability to chat, you know to get health care.

50:40

They can't fund that let alone travel which is very sad so we need to fix those we need to fix the economic issues at this point first. I'll let me it's it's it's it's horrifying what's going on right now. I mean, especially my state anyway, California. Tenna I am American and and definitely it's like it's here and it's um, it's definitely.

51:07

I mean, it's a long-term problem. I don't know how many countries have kind of escaped this kind of where you have you know, that hasn't have knots, but America certainly hasn't been we we need to and I I feel like that's going to happen. Here soon because of technology and will be forced to recognize this labor is it's not going to be enough to keep everybody, you know fed and then once you don't need them to work to be fed then maybe you can let them be free and and we can build systems to that actually do.

51:52

Right but the people that are not going to have jobs, they're going to have to survive so how and the prevailing the prevailing thought out there the prevailing way to fix this preventing felt to fix it. I guess I'm being really an articulate right now really tired is a universal basic income but I don't know how that's gonna fix it either.

52:15

I think maybe the best way to do it is to go towards a resource based economy, but then that's going to cut out capitalism, so it's it's a little confusing. Yeah no, I think I'd say the universal basic income is it's definitely I think the way that a lot of people find that will do this but I do wonder like if like right now equity is so valuable that if you know, you get to a point where laborer and work is needed and like you don't that, you know prevent social mobility so you have people with these with UBI and they can you know, get the the base but they don't have any social progression.

52:56

I think that's maybe a risk of UBI and, Yeah, I don't know there could be other other issues there then yeah other kinds like resource-based economy there was this um, like it is like if we get to the point that we all have, you know break beauty interfaces and all can think you know as intelligently as we want or something like like if just the the base capability is the human being continues to rise and it reaches some kind of point that we can all kind of see past the, Systems in place and recognize that we don't have to let that all you know, dictate our existence, maybe we'll just you know, stop the machine and and just start a.

53:46

Existing. I don't but who knows what how technology will actually play out and if it'll just create new systems that are more controlling or less controlling or how things will play out.

54:07

All right well, I'm gonna head out. I'm a second night because I gotta you're gonna go with was really nice talking all. Yeah, it's been really great because I love listening. Tommy a lot, actually. Cool. Hey good night.

59:37

Yeah.
