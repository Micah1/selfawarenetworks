So the, so the lecture spectral graph, the electromagnetic spectral graph service as a temple. Spatial virtual a neat orderly map, the sensory field or perceptual field, okay? So the so the interesting thing is, the tectum it of a frog is a good analogy for the through the graph for the spectral graph.

Creating I'm back further. Coordination of muscle here, the coordination of muscle movement, and then I seen the same. The rest, the resolution consciousness is important because it basically serves as a as a map, the surface map for the coordination of muscle movements. So, consciousness serves as a map for muscle movements.

And Michael, Michael essays attention. Schema sort of like illustrates how neurons can selectively pay attention to certain areas of the map when they our firing physically. But also inhibiting. The surrounding neurons to be to be quiet for basically and inhibiting, their tonic firing. That draws attention to part of the map.

But the map is a map of the receptive field. It's actually a map of the

02:31

Of the potential receptive fields because the receptive field is like what's in front of your, of your eye, for example, or what's in front of your ear. But that's like place sell information, the receptive field that you're not paying attention to, you're still mapping and that is like grid cell information.

03:06

And that that's like the second map of where you're not. So the place else like a map of where you are and the grid cells like a map of where you're not so that you have a sense of having navigating sense of where you are and what you're not simultaneously.

If if I IT is a skeleton, it's a skeleton. And inside inside the if it is, is a is a sketch. It's the sketch of a skeleton and complex.

What the, what the with the, with the resolution and Brain activity. Could be her interval based upon the complexity of the connections with the ability to create the maximal number of patterns and the maximal number of, of, remember, of memory memoir of memorable, spectral patterns. So if it tastes like a like a vague sort of like illusion to just samples facial connectivity of many that leads to

05:15

What could be measurement and we could be a future tool in the measurement of the resolution of the map of a frame of consciousness at one particular scale at the it's a macro scale. Okay. And, but it could, it could allude to also a map of microscale for frames.

Please move on stuck inside.
