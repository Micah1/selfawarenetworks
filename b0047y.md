brain frequency neuroscience my history

00:00

What I had said was that because then I go ahead and he did all this work on split brain surgery. But there is still, there are still connections between two two hemispheres like the there's a connection between the thalami and in there. He and it appears that they're there you know activity and the left and right.

00:27

You know visual cortex is still seems to be synchronous without the the corpus callosum. I used to have oscillating. Temporal ~~spiritual~~ spatial phase patterns percolating through neural circuits that our matching and the left and right hemisphere even after the corpus callosum is cut. And so I said this in and in a group of folks and said, well, that is a great point.

00:55

These neuroscientists. And and then the main argument is that the single the and in the major, you know, the researchers who are doing the big work, they don't necessarily like you think I said he doesn't really do higher level math. He doesn't really, he doesn't have to, he's the famous guy, he's done amazing work, but he also sort of like, he's sort of, from a previous generation of of neuroscientists who a principal investigator and and he's got people in his lab who can who can do the math and he spends a lot of his time just thinking about the work.

01:36

And so it does seem like, you know, the fact that there's a the slant that the the thalamus does a lot with really tiny connections and and the brain does manage to stay in sync and you don't necessarily have to, you know, you can look at this plate, you can look at these split brain surgery.

02:00

You know, in terms of there's that initial trauma from from the surgery and which the inverts the corpus callosum was severed, but in the months that follows, you know, the the patients recover, the two hemispheres learned to cooperate and but they're but that, you know, part of that is that there is still actually a connection between the two hemispheres, at least, there's that landmark bridge and possibly, I mean, it's possible that the continue to be wireless connections of energy sent back and forth across the the two hemispheres or at least there are synchronization patterns.

02:39

I kind of wonder if, if I'm, you know, I'm curious to find that if we could ever find a way to, to take the, the idea of quantum entanglement and apply that to the brain somehow. And I'm very curious. I that would be like quantum entanglement at the classical scale, right?

03:00

But, you know, so that the classical scale everything is moving a lot slower and and in addition to being a lot larger and so the time it doesn't doesn't quite time up with what's happening at the part particle level. You know, so there's a bit of like how that would happen.

03:21

Exactly is definitely something that people that many more people will stop beyond beyond myself are interested to explore further to see how to link up things that are happening at the quantum level. I mean, certainly you can see that there are if you look at, you know, the example of photoelectric stimulation or, you know, in the at the chemical level, there's all those tons of talk about how, you know, you know, atoms can can, you know, lose, you know, you can shine light at the brain at certain light.

03:58

Sensitive proteins there are Mac there. Electromagnetic sensitive proteins. And some of the, some of the activity with flavors, you know, they say they say wool birds birds can see electromagnetic fields because they have these, these blue cone receptors called flavins that are sensitive to electromagnetic spectrum. Humans. Have these also.

04:22

So, it's argued that birds can see the electromagnetic field. But maybe some people can learn to see the electromagnetic field or have learned to see the electromagnetic field in in the sky. And, you know, and it's interesting that. So Michael Garza is a, he's the leading neuroscientist and he knows that and he is, he's a famous guy.

04:45

He's influence tons of people. He gets you know, he runs huge departments. He's but he but he, he and his his book, I mean, like he said, he's not great with math. He doesn't, you know, the high level math and he doesn't need to be, he doesn't need to spend his time that way.

05:04

But I think that as, you know, when he talks about Donald Hebb and he talks about, you know, basically how we learn that neurons, you know, through experience are neurons fire together and they and they are together or they fire one, they fire in sequences, and then, and then they learn those sequences because those sequences change, the change, the the brain, their store, they become learned by the brain, and in variant representation of those learnings are learned by the brain.

05:42

So so that parts of your brain could fail but but your brain would still recognize the pattern. You can have in your on the fails to fire and and another neuron can do can can represent the pattern can take its place because it because your brain learns and patterns and variantly.

06:00

It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.

06:42

There's lent. There's Len Och's he created the Lenox protocol which was photo stimulation. With a brainwave enchantment. He had a lot of success with the patients. He was treating and then he went on developed the transcreeno. Magnetic stimulation because he that says next level way to stimulate brain to produce results.

07:01

And so, in 2012, I got the Len Och's protocol and I I was giving it to people with lightning sounds and and that involves taking people through brainwave, entrainment with binaural beats from from delta to theta to to alpha to beta and gamma. And then back down again. And, and so, and I was also experimenting with simulating people's brains, but with the TACS transcranial alternating current, simulation and TDCS transcending direct current simulation.

# TACS
# "Modulating behavioral signatures of rhythmic auditory entrainment with tACS"
"Synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms is beneficial for processing auditory information. In principle, auditory perception could be improved by facilitating neural entrainment to sounds via brain stimulation. Here we aimed to modulate auditory perception by modulating neural entrainment to frequency modulated (FM) sounds using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)."

07:52

And and I've used lots of different devices. All right, EG with the emotive EEG with the neurosciency with the brain. We know that we we brought it to VR in 2018, I've brought EG into beyond 2018, virtual reality and that was a goal that I decided on to do back.

08:22

That's why I started studying virtual reality. I tried it at SFVR and in 2015, when I was working at a Adobe and I was just helping out with the events I was security there. And the I I met my friend, I'm at Sonic and and I eventually became part of the San Francisco virtual reality team and eventually became an organizer.

08:53

Like, I think a year or two later after that some maybe a year later and to organize the meetup. But the but when I was there in 2015 and made 2015 at the Adobe trying at the SFDR event, I tried tilt brush and it was so amazing. The same it's the same til breast.

09:15

You can try. You can try on the oculus quest too today, but I tried it back in 2015. One of the first people in the world to try to brush and I was painting with light and space and it was just mind-bogglingly amazing. And I knew that I was going to bring EG into VR and to so that you could stimulate someone's brainwares with, it's very specific patterns.

09:47

And so this, so then I started to talk about some of my ideas there of how, you know, we could combine eye tracking and just you know, paying attention to what someone was looking at in VR and looking at their brainwave activity, that became the the basically the purpose of the nearly as podcast was to explore next generation, brain computer interfaces that that involved virtual reality or augmented reality or I tracking.

10:11

And and also doing correlations with with the brain. And so that was my work in 2012. That was in my company is called NeoMinecycle printed out from the 2012 to about 2014. We just recently looking at the campus theater frequencies in particular are involved in memory formation and if you sabotage those theta frequencies then then you have a traumatic effect.

10:39

You can have a traumatic effect on memory. So the actual frequencies that you simulate with have very specific effects and if you look in the history of brainwave entrainment there's lots of like if you go actually what I really want to tell people about us. If you go on YouTube you can like type in brainwave and train it you can find some really awesome.

10:55

There's three kinds of binoral beats. There's a chronic beads. And then you can also just listen to like frequencies like the you can look up like this whole fagot frequency like three six nine. And but anyway, the point is that you can find like this. If you look at brain, if you look at binarial beads, you can find like gamma frequencies or delta frequencies.

11:14

You can find when they say, there's like alpha frequencies, they recommend for studying. If you want to go to sleep, they recommend like delta or data frequencies. If you want to like very alert, you know, like my cat like being caffeinated and and just very productive, you might want to go for beta frequencies or gamma frequencies the higher range frequencies and in the in these correlate.

11:34

Like, you know, people who have like depression, they have a lot of they've a lot more predominance of data, the slower frequencies and data and delta frequencies which which I think correlates with my idea that that for some people depression is a metabolic disorder. They're not producing enough energy, not enough ATP and so they're not able to maintain those higher frequency states that that the neurotypical has when they go back their daily life.

11:59

So their life is slower and it's like more impressed and it's like they can't do as much and they're having they're struggling and it is it's a depressing situation and when you're when you're and when you're have based metabolic disorder and it pulls you down into lower brain my frequencies and so that's what I was saying.

12:16

Yeah, you can give people stimuli and that give that they can give a depression some temporary relief. But if there's a about issue and that's the real cause of depression, that's not a long-term solution. And but I wanted to say that because if you if you want to, folks can if you, if you listen to binaural beats, you're gonna need headphones.

12:34

Because it they basically works by giving each of your ears a difference in like 10 hearts with the sound and if you listen to isochronic beats you don't need headphones. Because you can just it's no different between what they send to your left ear to what you're right here.

12:47

And it ends again, you don't need headphones for the like the just the tones, like the sulfur frequency 369, and so and so forth, like you can listen to the yeah, I think myself.

13:09

I I might be able to add something. So so supplemental messaging is so you know, I mentioned the top that that brain wave enchantment was early on dismissed by by some of the medical professionals of pseudoscience or just or or maybe that's not the right word, maybe it's just dismissed and is that it's too hard to explain and understand and preserve the conclusions that people have that it's sort of like it's that you know like we like you know there's a lot of claims that people have about what brain women treatment is doing that are just sort of have been difficult for people on the computational neuroscience side to sort of like understand how to connect to those ideas.

14:01

It's so like there's it's like that there's not been enough on understanding to sort of like really have support in the past but there's a there's hopefully I'm sorry. I totally forgot. It was going with that. Well, what was your question?

14:24

Yes.

14:36

Yeah. So, so a long time ago, I did a podcast called the neural lace podcast and I talked a lot about my ideas in terms of building an artificial cortex in that podcast. So that's available if you just search YouTube for the relays podcasts actually my. You go to my website, it's VRMA dot IO and that's the website.

15:02

Sure.

15:08

Are. Yeah, not. I have. Yep. Yep. And so, that's Isaac. And, and Oscar, and

15:35

Yep.

15:41

So I Well I am a programmer, so if you look at if you look at, if you want examples of my programming work, if you go to my Twitter page, which is Twitter.com/worksalt and you look at my pinned, post, that pin post contains a number of videos and links to my to my work, including GitHub links.

16:01

And you can see videos of my of my, I'd make AR and beer applications and also I incorporate I make brain computer interface software. So there's one of my applications brings EEG into VR. And so I've got applied experience with brain break of your interface tag and I so I'm actually writing a book right now in which I'm gonna talk about brain, computer interfaces, and that had been some design ideas I have for newborn computer interfaces and also, for artificial brains for how to build them.

16:35

Like, I have my own hypothesis that I'm gonna share. That's different from one other. People are saying, and then also, I'm going to write, I'm gonna write about it. Sounds pretty amazing to say to say that loud, but I'm also gonna write about how human brain works. How phenomenal consciousness works in the human brain.

16:53

Like think I have something new to say that people have never heard before and I'm also going to write about quantum gravity, I believe that I am going to propose a new equation to explain quantum gravity. I'm going to do all four of these things in my book. So brain computer interfaces, artificial intelligence and in between is is going to be artificial cortex and and then quantum physics in connecting to gravity and also how human brains work.

17:26

So, I'm actually writing that book right now and very excited about it. And by you can definitely check out my previous work and you've got the links now. So,

17:48

That's right. Yeah, I let that project. That was my project was mine. That was my idea. Other people helped me with it but I was the driver of the project.

18:06

Yeah.

18:11

And well, I mean it we're creating an experience for people. So what happens is we so you know, we're capturing a you know, representations of your brain activity as voltages measured on on your with sensors placed in your forehead and then in return of those voltages into numbers that were bringing into a web page with with with a VR application.

18:40

So your application runs and resident web page and so we're bringing those six signals to a website. And then I and then we make something happen for each of the the very variations in the signals that are coming. So the signals go up and down and within a certain range maybe maybe you know plus or minus 4 or maybe between plus or minus 4.

19:03

And so we, so what we did, what I did the project that I read was I I had it set. So that the so when I did was that we were just created time series so that so that we'd move a vector in a sheet up to and move it up along the y-axis.

19:27

So imagine you have a 3d space in the window of your application. And the y-axis is what goes up and down. So we moved part of a sheet of a plane up. And with one of the two, we moved one of the vectors upwards and then we moved it back.

19:42

We're shifted it backwards and move the next one up with the next number that came from the voltage from your forehead. And so the and then we change it to another. I change it to another sort of visualization. Where instead of that I had independent spheres going up and down along the y-axis and changing colors.

20:00

They went up and down and they up and down pattern represented your brain wave activity represented the numbers, we were receiving from the voltage from your forehead and so as that voltage, increase your decreased the height of the spheres. You saw in virtual reality, we go up and down.

20:16

So, we had like, originally like a thousand spheres, it was a little bit slow and choppy but people could get up and walk around inside this representation of the brain activity. And you can see you can see that. If you look through my work, you can see videos of that.

20:32

And you can download and you can download the software, we open source it. So it's open source software on my, you can see the code also. Absolutely. Yeah.

20:51

For areas for it, it's nice about this way. It's really five areas, so if we outline the five areas, so, one is nerf the neuroscience or neurophysics of how the brain actually works. And that includes, and then includes. And I work on me, I work on all the areas of the brain.

21:06

So the brain has many different specialists and many different sort of like subfields. So like, you know, some people will just study the hippocampus and some people will study the hippocampus and interact cortex. If you're neuroscientists, they specialize in certain areas, right? I said it all. And and so I like, you know, I talked to a lot of neuroscientists and it's great when I like they.

21:32

Like, I don't know about that because I only started this one area and I have, well, let me help you from the cafes there.

21:50

Yeah. I mean that I think that happens a lot because because because a lot of the a lot of the discovery has been done and so you have to like look, you have to get really you want you sort of like as near as if, you know you're gonna be a neuroscientist as your career.

22:11

You kind of a lot of people want to be very specialized because because the idea is you want to look for something as someone else hasn't seen yet. And in the last 200 years of, you know, most of the neuroscience has been done the last 200 years, even the last 20 years.

22:27

It is like, it's increasingly like harder to find something new and it's just like, you're you. And then you have to like, in any amount of stuff that's been created. There's a amount of research on that is it's so much information that it's like, you know, like it's like a left hand, doesn't know what the right hand is doing because the research is so big that, that is the reality of the situation, where there's like so many substrates, like there's neuroscience, there's neuropsychology, there's computational neuroscience.

22:56

There's there's computational biology. There's like, all these different, like, there's no, you know, like, neurology and neuroscience are two different things. Yeah, they sound the same, they sound the same, there's lots of overlap.

23:17

Let me, let me pull up my. I wrote some ever something to this effect, let me see. You've got them for physics. This will have near physics. Sure.

23:46

And,

23:56

Okay.

24:03

I just want to find this note because I actually put a lot of work into this, for my book, we're just coming out soon. I am hoping that. Okay, it'll come out this December. I'm working on it. Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.

24:23

Yeah. December December or at the latest of the latest January, but I think it's gonna come out in December. It's gonna count this month. I think.

24:35

Yeah, Kindle. Amazon Kindle.

24:41

But let me see if I can find it. So okay let me just and I'll just sort of do this remembering so. Okay, so so think of like to get this one. I have. Okay. So I see. So I see neuroscientists being primarily concerned with discovering, their own anatomy such as mapping, they connect them in the major brain regions and then I see computational biology or computational neurobiology is sort of concerned with mapping the functional connectivity.

25:10

How information might be distributed, how might flow? And that kind of gets into like also just like the area of of connect comics and networks with the brain, you know, lost borns and so forth. I see neurophysics as being sort of concerned with that, theoretical physics of neuron function and brain function at the both the classical and quantum scales.

25:35

And, you know, chemical and molecular scales in terms of like, you know, what are all the different, you know, what's going on like thermally, what's going on, like electrically, what's going on with the physics neurophysics? And, you know, I kind of see neurology is being concerned with the treatments and the causes of Neural dysfunction.

25:53

So, I also study neurology, but, but it's sort of, it's sort of, like, just accidentally. I guess I, you know, when I love to read about, you know, Alzheimer's and and Parkinson's, kind and Huntington's and, and the coronavirus and cancer, and, you know, immunology and I love to read all this, basically, this is the, this is the category of of neurology, right?

26:24

And studying medicine. But it's really because of the insights that I get into computational biology, that sort of like, because I can in it, I would have to say, the least interesting one is is, is neuro, what is called neuropsychiatry because or neurosychology because, you know, it's it's psychology it's much more at the at the love of trying to relate.

26:54

What's happening at the people level to what's happening with their, with their brains. And in a lot of, you know, and when you get into neuropsychology I mean it's just like so ISO psychology is any issues in this silly? It's interesting area. For me. It's just it's it's some but I hope I'm doing sort of like, you know, the neurophysicist is going to be much more, a mathematically warranted in versus the.

27:19

You might have some neurologists or neuroscientists who, like famous ones, who are not especially good at mathematics or computer modeling, like the like the nervous system, the computational biologists. So, so the fact that I'm a programmer, makes makes me more more interested in I think in computational biology research and also neurophysics.

27:42

Because those are the kinds of things where, you know, programming computers and doing math is it's so it's just this about the level of focus and I hope that's been a good sort of overview for you. There's a the fact I got it.

28:13

Yeah, now I feel that way too. I mean, I mean terms, like it's not that often that I get to talk to someone with that much knowledge.

28:38

Me. Oh no, I yeah, I, I haven't. I'm a normal sleeper routine. I tried it. I know I've read that. It's very important to get eight hours to sleep. So I, I tried to keep to sleep schedule of some sort or I try to, at least if I, if I'm late getting to sleep, I try to sleep in because I believe that that eight hours of sleep is important for memory function to bring function.

29:03

So I, you know, and yeah, sleep is super important. You don't don't ever skip on sleep. If you one thing that's interesting, people who people have trouble sleeping, you know, it the length that the length of the amount of time that you have to sleep, has to do with it with the temperature of your room.

29:24

And yeah. So if you like if you want to have like if you want to have a lot of control, it's about it's about what temperature it is at the time that you're trying to go to sleep. Like if you're if you're if you're very warm, you're gonna sleep longer and if you're but it depends on like if you if you get your it affects it's it connects to your circadian rhythm, you know?

29:45

Like light. Like if there's too much blue light at the end of a day or from your computer screen that can keep you up later and the same thing with with temperature like if you get if you get rid of the blue light so you can relax your eyes.

29:59

It's not good for your eyes anyway. It's right. The, if you get rid of the blue light, and if you are, is this sleep, something here, worried about getting enough. Sleep. Is that part of it? Or you just

30:37

No.

30:42

So I yeah, so so, so I I really am very, very organized person. I keep tons of notes. I all digital notes, audio and text notes in multiple multiple different online tools and was with many different backups. And so I'm a very like, very detailed oriented and very like, very organized very planned and, you know, I like brainwave and treatment like like that.

31:18

The that that's very useful. I like a new tropics. I think new topics can help with memory. I'm taking care of your brain getting enough exercise having a sort of, like, an emotionally healthy routine, you know, meditation. I like to do biking. Bicycling head, healthy eating. I like protein drinks that are like high in protein.

31:45

All essential amino acids, all, I get all essential vitamins, all essential fatty acids, omega-3s, I love any food has a mega-3s in it. Like, you know, there's lots of different options there, lots of fish and stuff and so forth. And the thing about essential nutrients is is people know that they're called essential nutrients and they don't get them and they like they, they then they're surprised when they have health problems.

32:10

And like, well, you don't care about your sense of nutrients, right? You think there are optional? No, there is essential. So, yeah. So people will definitely have health problems if they don't get their social nutrients. It doesn't like. They don't think about it. They're like, I well, okay, I'm gonna go to McDonald's.

32:28

Anyways, I'm like you're not getting any of the mega three from McDonald's, right? This matters. It matters. So yeah, see if it's great. Yeah.

32:49

Yeah, I'm so the book, I'm writing a book that I think is gonna change the world for real. Like a really is gonna like it's gonna like it's gonna I'm gonna hit, I'm hitting like five different, angel topics simultaneously, but innovations at all, five of them. And I I feel like I've been you know it lightning five times that.

33:10

That's how like, profoundness. And, but besides the book, then there's gonna be a wet. There's gonna be a web VR web expert website, which talks about the contents of the book in 3D and VR. And then there's, and then there's gonna be a brain. I'm gonna make brain computer interface, there's new ones.

33:32

And without others, I'm starting an institute, a scientific institute. We're gonna make new technology. We're gonna make make new machines, but we're gonna make

33:46

Okay.

33:54

The brain computer interface with the visual cortex. Okay. I mean that I mean I mean, yeah, what it, what is your what? You give a specific question that I have a lot of experience in that but I'm not sure what it's like the giant area.

35:10

That's really, that's really. I think you may have found an area that that I'm a little. Okay. So, you know, okay, so there is the machine where they have the, the person who's blind and they have, they have like, yes he wears like a tongue strip originally was a back strip, right?

35:30

This is back strip of electrodes and that's a tongue strip of lecture. The same concept just a lot smaller because the tongue is able the tongue is incredibly versatile. So the send the size of the sensor is a lot smaller. It's like easier but used to be a backstrip.

35:41

And either way the same concept is you have this you have this sort of plain of electrode to stick to the surface of the body, either the back of the tongue and that's connected to the pixels in the camera. And so, when the when, when the camera, the basically, the camera is video stream like you, if you consider that, you know, it's changing the pixels.

36:02

It's making each pixel lighter dark depending on each moment in the video stream. And what they do is say, is they look at the, they take the the strip of electrodes that is is connected to your tongue. That that plane of electrodes, it's like a matrix strain and they, and they stimulate those electrodes, they turn the charge up or down on each of those electrodes and dependently correlating to the pixels, getting brighter or darker on the camera and that's stimulation.

36:30

Your brain conversion to an image and so people, you can, the brain can learn to see through the tongue with that with the camera with that. Yeah.

36:47

Yeah. Right now, that the back of the back of the back, the back of above the butt, the back, the back back. Yeah.

37:06

Yeah, that's not originally they put it there and is really big but then they realize it was better to make a smaller one to put on the time.

37:16

And in addition to that, I mean there's there's a lot of like, you know, stem cell research in terms of, you know, in terms of replacing and repairing the

37:35

Right.

38:06

I well you got to read my book because I'm gonna tell I'm gonna like I think I know what the mechanism is. It's gonna be in my book. Yeah.

38:18

Right, the public knowledge is not up to date.

38:36

That's right.

38:49

I'm really interested in that and that as well, I mean, there's definitely a lot of this, there's everything about everything about that, you learn about wonder on. There's like a minute. There's like an there's like a million different variations here and

39:12

Yeah and then they really like the dendrites are like all different shapes. And it's just like every every rule that you think it's true gets broken.

39:55

I'm not I'm not 100% sure on what what what you're referring to. But there's like, you know, there's like there are neurons that are, that's that are different. They specialize with certain kinds of neurotransmitters, like there's dopamine neurons and then there's like, gout urgent neurons in there to burns and there's a acetylcholine neurons.

40:16

And, and then, and the inner is, like, yeah. So I mean, it's it's, it's they, they're there are the thing. It's like like so the gavin neurons for example, like they the there's they're like in certain brain areas like the like the thalamus and they ought they have in what comes out of them is our brain waves that are in the delta frequency range and that's very interesting.

40:53

It's like, okay, so we have a certain kind of neurotransmitter in a certain area and the outcome is a certain part of the brainwave frequency, from all the things are correlated. And if you look at like, you know, a lot of the incoming senses from when you go from the eyes, you know, to, to the into the, to the visual cortex in the visual cortex, right?

41:19

Where the sensors are coming in. You, could you go from the eyes along an optic nerve to the thalamus, to the, to the baptism of occipital lobes, right? And what you're getting. There's what there's a lot of alpha waves and and and that lower sort of like lower input areas of the cortex, the sensory input areas, there's a lot of alpha waves in the, you know, I sort of like, I feel like the the prefrontal cortex has been misunderstood that like in the literature says that, you know, we have the three primary sensory, cortices and was left over as a prefrontal cortex, right?

41:51

But I you know it's it's like it it's not it's not incorrect but it's also not I think it's not like the prefrontal cortex really isn't a lot different. It's not a lot different it's just a little bit different and it's it's basically like you know there's a lot of you know you're you've got your your information and your emotional information that sort of is right there at the input to the prefrontal cortex.

42:23

And I I so I still think of the prefrontal cortex. It's like the fourth. It's like the fourth sensory implant it but it's like goosatorian emotion. All right.

42:38

And my ad saying, gooseberry, but I'm sorry. I meant olfactory, go to Tori. Is this tutorial? Is this taste and olfactory is smell, so the prefrontal cortex is smell and emotion, so that would be olfactory emotion. I misspoke, but butitory and good. Anyways, so the good story goes, he does interact with the olfactory but like smell and taste or intertwined, but but it also gots.

43:07

But taste goes to the pride of cortex. It goes actually goes to some mountain sensory vortex first, where it it connects with tact with the attack, dostations that you can feel with your fingers and so you have taste and smell and they go up straight to the top of your head where they where the right in the middle, the top of the middle.

43:27

So if you put, so if you put it. So if you like, put your hand directly above your head, to this madison suit. What you, I guess, you notice you're ready, it's as mad as your cortex. It's where that? What's where the, the taste and feeling goes right in the middle of the top of your head?

43:40

And then and then it's starting a signals seem to travel backwards towards the visual cortex. They go backwards and forwards towards the prefrontal as it. As far as I know, they go both directions but but like right in between the so that you have the, the obstacle loads in the back, and then a button you have the somatosensory cortex, right above, right before the motor, and the motor cortex missed miss.

44:08

It's, it's missed named the missing name's motor cortex. It's not really an everlike. Every part of your brain is motor cortex, right? But, but the anatomical motor cortex is is on one side and then the somatosensory cortex. So, the medicine through cortex is as going to point. If you point from this medicine, for the middle of your head, to the back of your head where you're upset, the lobes are in between is the bridal lobes, and then the, there's the prial temporal junction, which is like.

44:39

So if you have, if you're seeing something tasting, something feeling something, hearing something all at the same time and you're really focused on something. You, you're temper, vital junction is going to be lighting up and

44:56
Yeah they converge right there and in people almost people don't think that like if you're like if you're if you're aware of something like really like consciously focus on it. Let's say that you're watching the video and there's a bunch of people playing basketball and there's a gorilla. There's a gorilla that passes slightly, it's walks to the screen, you've done that one, it's a famous one and so if if people are not paying attention, then they're they're TPJ and temporal parallel junction is not lighting up, it's only one.

45:24

If you, if you put an apple in front of someone and they're not paying attention to it, they're that part of their branch is not not active. And when they are thinking about the Apple and they're consciously aware of it, and they're considering it how it looks how it feels and it tastes how it sounds.

45:40

If you smash it or something like when they're really thinking about it, then you can see their temporal junction lighting up and that's so it's that is sort of something that that might famous talks about. He talks about with his attention, schema that that when you're paying attention to something, you part to do brain become active and, and so, it sort of like it.

46:05

That's that is that provides a window into your brain activity and in. That's so anyway, I'm also a neural imager. So that's I think a lot about that. It's part of my book.

46:30

Yeah, well it I think more specific. I mean like I don't know I have some there's different hypotheses about attention to disorder. I mean, I like I it was some medical imaging. It's known that. There's some like you can see the blood flow is not that great and the in the prefrontal cortex there's versus neurotypical.

46:52

And then there's also some speculation that the, that the there might be like cerebellum damage, which has to do with, how well you can balance. And you can you almost like if you see someone and they have like really weird movements, like they're not walking straight, they're just doing weird right things.

47:08

You can guess they might you can guess they. That is almost a symptom of attention disorder attention disorder. Yeah, well, it's not, it's not very widely known, but it's so it's like, it's like, there's multiple things happening that with the person's memory. And so, like attention deficit, or it would have shares some common with Alzheimer's as pretty interesting because it's like, they're both different diseases of memory dysfunction for different reasons but they're, but it's something that something happening in the in the tissue at the cell level that is dysfunctional.

47:39

And, you know, I I think I'm thinking it's probably a metabolic disorder from that. Stem is from, you know, not getting all your social nutrients. Yeah, yeah I mean that's a major cause there's two causes one is disease from like, you know, there's certain things. Your body shouldn't be there or there's some closer to injury happening either from like blood force impact or like cancer or something.

48:12

And then, there was some, a lot of a lot of diseases, just caused by many nutrition. So,

48:28

Yeah, I mean, so there's there's there's there's there's two big things that people pay attention to and when, when they hires what, you know, like with when you you think about how to bring on your team, is people look for, you know, people who are talented and people who have great, right?

48:43

And and the more important one really is great because it's like, well, is your team member gonna have the endurance to sort of stick through and continue the project? And I believe that endurance is about the, the energy metabolism on some level. It's like, it's like the, the behavior that results from having great is has a behavior that results from people who have good nutrition, who have energy and endurance.

49:09

And so they can stick with the project even when it's hard, even when they can't figure it out. And they get farther than people who might be extraordinary, talented intelligence, but can't just can't, you know, rise to the challenge. When when they, when the challenges is there, they just think they give up.

49:25

And so grit is anyway, I was good. Thank you, thank you so much. Well, how we talk for like 50 minutes. That's amazing. All right.

50:00
