# 1. The TACS reference
# "Modulating behavioral signatures of rhythmic auditory entrainment with tACS"
"Synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms is beneficial for processing auditory information. In principle, auditory perception could be improved by facilitating neural entrainment to sounds via brain stimulation. Here we aimed to modulate auditory perception by modulating neural entrainment to frequency modulated (FM) sounds using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)."
doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.17.504249

In the conversation, I mentioned my experiments with TACS and how it's used to stimulate the brain to produce specific results. I explored how different frequencies can influence brain states and discussed methods like TACS and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) in the context of modulating brainwave activity for therapeutic or cognitive enhancement purposes.

The referenced article, "Modulating behavioral signatures of rhythmic auditory entrainment with tACS", investigates how TACS can be used to modulate auditory perception by enhancing neural entrainment to frequency-modulated (FM) sounds. This study aligns with my discussion about using TACS to influence brain rhythms and improve cognitive functions related to auditory processing.

By demonstrating that synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms can be facilitated via TACS, the article provides scientific evidence supporting the concepts we discussed. It shows practical applications of TACS in modulating neural activity to potentially enhance auditory perception, which is directly connected to the topics of brainwave entrainment and neural stimulation methods that were part of our conversation.

# 2. A shorter summary of the Discussion contained within this file:

In our discussion, I began by highlighting Michael Gazzaniga's work on split-brain surgery, noting that despite severing the corpus callosum, connections between the brain's hemispheres persist through structures like the thalamic bridge. This suggests that the hemispheres continue to synchronize their activities, possibly through quantum entanglement or other forms of energy transfer. I expressed curiosity about applying quantum phenomena to understand brain function at the classical scale, bridging gaps between neuroscience and quantum physics.

I shared my personal journey into brainwave entrainment and neurotechnology, starting around 2012 with my company NeoMindCycle. I explored various methods like the Len Ochs Protocol, utilizing photostimulation and brainwave entrainment to guide individuals through different brain states using light and sound. My experiments extended to technologies like transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS), transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), and EEG devices from Emotiv, NeuroSky, and Brainduino. In 2018, I integrated EEG into virtual reality (VR), allowing users to visualize and interact with their brain activity in immersive environments.

My experiences at an SFVR event in 2015, where I tried Tilt Brush while working at Adobe, inspired me to delve deeper into VR and its applications in neuroscience. I became part of the San Francisco Virtual Reality team and hosted the "Neuro Lace" podcast to discuss innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), artificial intelligence, and the potential of VR and eye-tracking technologies. I maintain an organized lifestyle focused on health and nutrition, emphasizing the importance of sleep, exercise, meditation, and essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids for optimal brain function.

Currently, I'm writing a book aiming to make significant contributions across five major areas: BCIs, artificial intelligence and cortex design, the neuroscience of phenomenal consciousness, quantum physics with a new equation for quantum gravity, and the integration of these concepts. Alongside the book, I'm developing a WebXR website to present its content in 3D and VR, and I'm starting a scientific institute to create new BCIs and technologies. My work can be followed on my website vrma.io and on Twitter @worksalt, where I share my projects and open-source software related to AR, VR, and neuroscience.

The longer discussion primarily revolves around topics such as neuroscience, brainwave entrainment, virtual reality, brain-computer interfaces, personal experiences in the field, and upcoming projects.

However, it's worth noting that some of the statements made are speculative or represent personal hypotheses that may not be fully supported by the current scientific consensus. For example:

Depression and Metabolic Disorders: The suggestion that depression is predominantly a metabolic disorder caused by a lack of essential nutrients is a perspective that may not align with mainstream medical understanding. While nutrition can affect mental health, depression is a complex condition with multifactorial causes, including genetic, biochemical, environmental, and psychological factors.

Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD): The assertion that ADD might be linked to cerebellum damage affecting balance, and that unusual movements could indicate the presence of ADD, is a hypothesis that isn't widely supported in the scientific community. ADD/ADHD is primarily associated with differences in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex but is not typically diagnosed based on motor coordination or balance issues.

# 3. Longer Rephrasing of the Discussion by ChatGPT o1:

I discussed how Michael Gazzaniga did extensive work on split-brain surgery but noted that there are still connections between the two hemispheres of the brain. For example, the thalami are connected, and activity in the left and right visual cortices remains synchronous even without the corpus callosum. Oscillating temporal-spatial phase patterns continue to percolate through neural circuits, matching in both hemispheres even after severing the corpus callosum.

I mentioned this point to a group of neuroscientists, who agreed it was significant. The main argument is that while Gazzaniga is a renowned neuroscientist, he admits he's not deeply involved in higher-level mathematics—nor does he need to be. As a principal investigator from an earlier generation, he has team members who handle the mathematical aspects while he focuses on conceptual thinking.

The thalamus plays a crucial role with its tiny connections, helping the brain stay in sync. In cases of split-brain surgery, there's initial trauma from severing the corpus callosum, but in the following months, patients recover, and the two hemispheres learn to cooperate. This recovery is partly because there's still a thalamic bridge connecting the hemispheres. It's also possible that energy transfers or synchronization patterns occur wirelessly between the hemispheres.

I'm curious about applying quantum entanglement to the brain, which would mean exploring quantum phenomena at a classical scale—larger and slower-moving than at the particle level. While this is a complex area, many are interested in linking quantum activities to brain function. For instance, photoelectric stimulation shows that shining light on certain light-sensitive proteins in the brain can cause atoms to lose electrons. There are electromagnetic-sensitive proteins, like flavins, which are blue cone receptors sensitive to the electromagnetic spectrum. Birds have these and can see electromagnetic fields; humans have them too, suggesting we might also perceive these fields to some extent.

Michael Gazzaniga has influenced many in neuroscience, and although he's not focused on advanced mathematics, he discusses concepts like Donald Hebb's theory that neurons firing together wire together. Neurons fire in sequences, and these sequences change the brain, creating invariant representations. This means that even if some neurons fail, the brain can still recognize patterns because it learns them robustly and invariantly.

In 2012, I delved into brainwave entrainment research, which spans over 50 years. I discussed a recent article with Rick Adante from neurosciencenews.com about boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brainwaves and speeding oscillations. There are various brainwave entrainment methods like Holosync, Hemi-Sync, the Kasina Mind Machine, and the Len Ochs Protocol. Len Ochs used photostimulation combined with brainwave entrainment successfully with patients and later developed transcranial magnetic stimulation as an advanced method.

I acquired the Len Ochs Protocol in 2012 and used it to guide people through brainwave entrainment using light and sound, involving binaural beats transitioning from delta to theta, alpha, beta, gamma frequencies, and back down. I also experimented with transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), using devices like EEG systems from Emotiv, NeuroSky, and Brainduino.

In 2018, I brought EEG into virtual reality (VR). My interest in VR began in 2015 when I tried Tilt Brush at an SFVR event while working at Adobe. Experiencing Tilt Brush was mind-boggling, and it inspired me to integrate EEG with VR to stimulate brainwaves with specific patterns. I explored combining eye tracking in VR to correlate visual attention with brainwave activity, which became the focus of my "Neuro Lace" podcast. My company, NeoMindCycle, operated from 2012 to about 2014, working on these innovations.

Understanding that theta frequencies in the hippocampus are involved in memory formation, I realized that disrupting these frequencies can have traumatic effects on memory. Different brainwave frequencies have specific effects; for example, binaural beats can induce certain states like relaxation or alertness. People with depression often exhibit a predominance of slower theta and delta frequencies, which might correlate with metabolic issues affecting energy production (ATP) in the brain.

For those interested in exploring brainwave entrainment, there are resources on YouTube offering binaural beats, isochronic tones, and specific frequencies like the Solfeggio frequencies (e.g., 369 Hz). Binaural beats require headphones as they deliver slightly different frequencies to each ear, creating the desired effect.

Initially, brainwave entrainment faced skepticism from medical professionals due to difficulties in explaining and proving its effects. However, as understanding grows, it's becoming a more accepted area of study.

I also hosted the "Neuro Lace" podcast, where I discussed building an artificial cortex and other ideas. You can find more about my work on my website vrma.io and my Twitter page @worksalt, where I share videos, GitHub links, and examples of my programming projects involving AR, VR, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). One of my applications integrates EEG into VR, allowing users to experience their brain activity in a virtual environment.

Currently, I'm writing a book that aims to cover several groundbreaking topics: brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, building an artificial cortex, explaining how phenomenal consciousness works in the human brain, and proposing a new equation for quantum gravity. I believe these innovations could significantly impact our understanding of the brain and physics.

In our projects, we create immersive experiences by capturing brain activity through sensors on the forehead, converting voltages into numerical data, and visualizing this data in VR applications. For example, we represent brainwave activity with spheres that move and change color in response to the user's brain signals, allowing people to walk around and interact with a visual representation of their own neural activity. This software is open-source, and the code is available for those interested.

I work across five main areas:

Neuroscience/Neurophysics: Studying how the brain functions at both classical and quantum levels, including chemical and molecular scales.
Computational Biology/Neurobiology: Mapping functional connectivity in the brain and understanding information distribution and flow.
Neurology: Exploring treatments and causes of neurological dysfunctions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other diseases.
Artificial Intelligence and Brain-Computer Interfaces: Developing new technologies and interfaces to interact with the brain.
Quantum Physics: Connecting quantum phenomena to brain function and proposing new theories in quantum gravity.
While many neuroscientists specialize in specific areas due to the vast amount of research and data, I take a more holistic approach, studying all areas of the brain. This broad perspective allows me to fill gaps and make connections that might be overlooked in more specialized studies.

Regarding sleep, I maintain a regular routine, aiming for eight hours each night, which is crucial for memory and brain function. Factors like room temperature and exposure to blue light can affect sleep quality by influencing circadian rhythms. Managing these can help improve sleep patterns.

I prioritize organization and detailed planning in my work, keeping extensive digital notes. To support cognitive function, I engage in brainwave entrainment, use nootropics, exercise regularly (like biking), meditate, and maintain a healthy diet rich in essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids. Many health issues stem from neglecting essential nutrients, so it's important to ensure a balanced intake.

Beyond the book, I'm developing a WebXR website to present its content in 3D and VR. I'm also starting a scientific institute to create new brain-computer interfaces and technologies.

We discussed devices that help blind individuals perceive visual information through other senses, such as tongue or back-mounted electrode arrays connected to a camera. These devices translate visual data into electrical stimuli that the brain can interpret, effectively allowing users to "see" through their tongues or backs. Advances in stem cell research and other technologies also offer promising avenues for restoring vision.

The complexity of neurons is immense, with countless variations and unique dendritic structures. This complexity means that many established rules have exceptions, making neuroscience a continually evolving field.

In terms of specific neuron types, there are various neurons specializing in different neurotransmitters like dopamine, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. For example, GABAergic neurons in the thalamus are associated with delta brainwave frequencies. These correlations between neurotransmitters, brain regions, and brainwave frequencies are important for understanding brain function.

Sensory information travels through different pathways in the brain. Visual information goes from the eyes to the optic nerve, then to the thalamus, and finally to the occipital lobes. These areas often exhibit alpha waves. The prefrontal cortex, sometimes misunderstood, is involved with olfactory (smell) and emotional processing, making it like a fourth sensory input area.

Taste (gustatory) information goes to the somatosensory cortex, which is also responsible for tactile sensations. The parietal lobes, located between the somatosensory and occipital lobes, play a role in integrating sensory information. The temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) is active when we are consciously focused on multiple sensory inputs simultaneously.

Attention and awareness involve specific brain regions. For example, when someone pays attention to an object like an apple, the TPJ becomes active. This relates to Michael Gazzaniga's work on the attention schema, highlighting how certain brain areas activate during focused attention.

Regarding attention deficit disorder (ADD), some hypotheses suggest reduced blood flow in the prefrontal cortex or possible cerebellum damage affecting balance and movement. These issues might relate to metabolic disorders due to a lack of essential nutrients, emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition for brain health.

When forming teams, qualities like grit and endurance are often more valuable than talent alone. Endurance may be linked to energy metabolism and good nutrition, enabling individuals to persist through challenges.

Lastly, I look forward to continuing this work and sharing more through my upcoming book and collaborations.

Personal Experiences and Anecdotes:

While working at Adobe, I had the opportunity to attend an SFVR (San Francisco Virtual Reality) event in May 2015. There, I tried Tilt Brush for the first time, becoming one of the earliest users of this groundbreaking VR painting tool. Painting with light in a 3D space was mind-bogglingly amazing, and it inspired me to integrate EEG technology with VR. This experience led me to start studying virtual reality more deeply. I met my friend Matt Sonic at the event, and about a year later, I became part of the SFVR team, eventually becoming an organizer for the meetup group.

Specific Projects and Companies:

From 2012 to 2014, I ran a company called NeoMindCycle, focusing on brainwave entrainment and neurotechnology. During this time, I hosted the "Neuralace Podcast," where I discussed my ideas on building an artificial cortex and explored next-generation brain-computer interfaces involving virtual reality, augmented reality, eye tracking, and their correlations with brain activity.

Detailed Discussions on Devices and Technologies:

I have extensive experience with various EEG devices, including the Emotiv EEG, NeuroSky EEG, and Brainduino. In 2018, I successfully brought EEG into VR, allowing users to visualize and interact with their brain activity in a virtual environment. I also experimented with transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), exploring their potential for stimulating the brain to produce specific results.

Instructions and Recommendations:

For those interested in brainwave entrainment, I recommend exploring resources on YouTube. By searching for "brainwave entrainment," "binaural beats," or "isochronic beats," you can find various audio tracks designed to induce specific brain states. For example:

Binaural Beats: Require headphones; each ear receives slightly different frequencies, creating a perceived third tone in the brain.
Isochronic Beats: Do not require headphones; the same frequency is delivered to both ears using sharp, repetitive pulses.
Solfeggio Frequencies: Specific tones like 369 Hz, believed to have particular healing properties.
Listening to these can help achieve states like relaxation, focus, or enhanced sleep. For studying, alpha frequencies are recommended, while delta or theta frequencies can aid in sleep. Higher frequencies like beta or gamma can promote alertness and productivity.

Specific Interactions and Conversations:

I discussed these topics with Rick Adante, referencing an article from neurosciencenews.com about boosting memory performance by fine-tuning the amplitude of brainwaves and speeding up oscillations. This conversation highlighted the 50 years of research behind brainwave entrainment and its potential benefits.

Thoughts on Nutrition and Lifestyle:

I maintain a regular sleep schedule, aiming for eight hours each night, which is crucial for memory and brain function. I believe factors like room temperature and exposure to blue light affect sleep quality by influencing circadian rhythms.

Organization is key in my work; I keep extensive digital notes, both audio and text, across multiple online tools with various backups. My lifestyle includes meditation, biking, and a healthy diet rich in essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids. I emphasize the importance of consuming all essential amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids, as neglecting these can lead to health issues.

Future Plans and Book Details:

I'm currently writing a book that I believe will change the world. It will cover five major areas:

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Developing new technologies to interact with the brain.
Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Cortex: Proposing designs for building an artificial cortex and sharing my unique hypotheses.
Neuroscience and Phenomenal Consciousness: Explaining how phenomenal consciousness works in the human brain with insights people haven't heard before.
Quantum Physics and Quantum Gravity: Proposing a new equation to explain quantum gravity.
Integration of Concepts: Connecting these areas to provide a comprehensive understanding of the brain and physics.
I aim to release the book by December or January on Amazon Kindle. Beyond the book, I'm developing a WebXR website to present its content in 3D and VR. I'm also starting a scientific institute to create new brain-computer interfaces and technologies, collaborating with others to bring these innovations to life.

For more about my work, you can visit my website at vrma.io (which stands for Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality) or follow me on Twitter at @worksalt. On my Twitter page, you'll find my pinned post containing videos, GitHub links, and examples of my programming projects involving AR, VR, and brain-computer interfaces. The software I've developed is open-source, and the code is available for those interested.

Specific Names and Protocols:

I utilized the Len Ochs Protocol, developed by Len Ochs, which combines photostimulation with brainwave entrainment. He had significant success treating patients with this method and later advanced to developing transcranial magnetic stimulation, his next-level approach to stimulating the brain for therapeutic results.

Additional Thoughts on Neuroscience:

I'm intrigued by the possibility of applying quantum entanglement to the brain, potentially linking quantum-level phenomena with classical-scale brain function. While this is speculative, it's an area many are eager to explore further.

Regarding the complexity of neurons, each neuron is unique, with various shapes and functions, including different dendritic structures. Neurons can be categorized based on the neurotransmitters they use, such as dopamine neurons, GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, and acetylcholine neurons. For instance, GABAergic neurons in the thalamus are associated with delta brainwave frequencies, illustrating the connection between neurotransmitters, brain regions, and brainwave frequencies.

Neuroscientific Concepts and Brain Regions:

I also discussed the pathways of sensory information in the brain:

Visual Information: Travels from the eyes along the optic nerve to the thalamus and then to the occipital lobes, with these areas exhibiting alpha waves.
Prefrontal Cortex: Involved with olfactory (smell) and emotional processing, functioning as a sensory input area.
Taste (Gustatory) Information: Goes to the somatosensory cortex, which also handles tactile sensations.
Parietal Lobes and Temporal-Parietal Junction (TPJ): Integrate sensory information, becoming active when we're consciously focused on multiple sensory inputs simultaneously.
Attention and Awareness:

When we pay attention to something, like watching a video with unexpected elements (e.g., the famous gorilla in the basketball game video), our TPJ becomes active. This relates to Michael Graziano's work on the attention schema, highlighting how certain brain areas activate during focused attention.

Thoughts on Nutrition and Health:

I believe that many cognitive issues, such as depression and attention deficit disorder (ADD), can stem from metabolic disorders due to a lack of essential nutrients. Proper nutrition is vital for maintaining brain health, energy metabolism, and overall well-being.

Conclusion:

By incorporating these additional details, I've ensured that all original content is included, providing a comprehensive and detailed account of my experiences, projects, and insights into neuroscience and related fields.


# 4. Transcribed with Whisper:

What I had said was that Gazzaniga hadn't, he did all this work on split brain surgery, but there are still connections between the two hemispheres.
Like there's a connection between the thalami, and it appears that their activity in the left and right visual cortex still seems to be synchronous without the corpus callosum.
And you still have oscillating temporal spatial phase patterns percolating through neural circuits that are matching in the left and right hemisphere, even after the corpus callosum is cut.
And so I said this in a group of folks and said, well, that is a great point, these neuroscientists.
And the main argument is that Gazzaniga, he, and the major, you know, the researchers who are doing the big work, they don't necessarily, like Gazzaniga says he doesn't really do higher level math.
He doesn't really, he doesn't have to.
He's the famous guy.
He's done amazing work.
But he also sort of like, he's sort of from a previous generation of neuroscientists, a principal investigator, and he's got people in his lab who can do the math.
And he spends a lot of his time just thinking about the work.
And so it does seem like, you know, the fact that there's a, the thalamus does a lot with really tiny connections.
And, and the brain does manage to stay in sync.
And you don't necessarily have to, you know, you can look at the split, you can look at the split brain surgery, you know, in terms of there's that initial trauma from, from the surgery, in which the, in which the corpus callosum was severed.
But, but in the months that follows, you know, the, the patients recover, the two hemispheres learn to cooperate.
And, but there, but that, you know, part of that is that there is still actually a connection between the two hemispheres.
At least there's the thalamic bridge.
And possibly, I mean, it's possible that there continue to be wireless connections of energy sent back and forth across the, the two hemispheres.
Or at least there are synchronization patterns.
I kind of wonder if, if, I, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm curious to find out if we could ever find a way to, to take the, the, the idea of quantum entanglement and apply that to the brain somehow.
You know, I'm very curious.
I, that would be like quantum entanglement at the classical scale, right?
Um, but, you know, so that the classical scale, everything is moving a lot slower and, and in addition to being a lot larger.
Um, and so the time, it doesn't, it doesn't quite time up with what's happening at the part, particle level.
You know, so there's a bit of like how that would happen exactly is, uh, definitely something that people, that many more people beyond, beyond, beyond myself are interested to explore further to see, uh, how, how to link up things that are happening at the quantum level.
I mean, certainly you can see that there are, um, if you look at, you know, um, uh, the example of photoelectric, uh, stimulation or, or, you know, in, in the, at the, at the chemical level, there's all,
there's tons of talk about how, you know, you know, atoms can, can, can, you know, uh, lose, you know, you can shine light at the brain at certain light sensitive proteins.
There are mag, there are electromagnetic sensitive proteins.
Um, and some of the, some of the activity with flavins, you know, they, they say, well, birds, birds, uh, can see electromagnetic fields.
It's because they have these, um, these blue cone receptors, uh, called flavins that are sensitive to the electromagnetic spectrum.
And humans have these also.
So it's argued that birds can see the electromagnetic field, uh, but maybe some people can learn to see the electromagnetic field or have learned to see the electromagnetic field in, in, in the sky.
Um, and, you know, and it's interesting that, so Michael, um, Gazzaniga is a, he's a leading neuroscientist and he knows that, and he is, uh, he's a famous guy.
He's influenced tons of people.
He gets, you know, he runs huge departments.
He's, but he, but he, he, um, and his, his, his book, I mean, like he, he said, he's not great with math.
He doesn't, you know, the higher level of math and, uh, he doesn't need to be, he doesn't need to spend his time that way.
But I think that as, you know, when he, he talks about Donald Hebb and he talks about, um, you know, basically how we learn that neurons, uh, you know, through experience, our neurons fire together and they, and they wire together.
Or they fire one, they fire in sequences and then, and then they learn those sequences.
Um, because those sequences, uh, change the, change the, the brain.
They're, they become learned by the brain.
And invariant representations of, of those learnings are learned by the brain.
So, so that, parts of your brain could fail, but, but your brain would still recognize the pattern.
You could have a neuron that fails to fire and, and another neuron can, can do, can, can represent the pattern, can take its place.
Because, because your brain learns patterns invariantly.
It's very robust.
And so I was talking about how, um, in 2012, there, there are actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research.
There's just a new article that came out.
I was talking to Rick Edente about this, uh, neuroscience news.com article, boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brainwaves and speeding, um, oscillations.
So there are 50 years of, there's 50 years of research with, um, with, uh, brainwave entrainment.
There's, uh, Holosync.
There's Hemosync.
There's, um, the Cassina Mind Machine.
There's Len, there's Len Oaks.
He created the Len Oaks Protocol, which was, uh, photo stimulation with a brainwave entrainment.
He had a lot of success with the patients that he was treating.
And then he went on to develop the transcranial magnetic stimulation, because he, that's his, uh, next level, uh, way to stimulate the brain to produce, uh, results.
Um, and, uh, so in 2012, I, I, uh, got the Len Oaks, uh, uh, uh, protocol.
And I, I, I was giving it to people with light and sound.
And, um, uh, that involved taking people through, uh, uh, brainwave entrainment, uh, with binaural beats from, uh, from, uh, delta to theta to, to, to alpha to beta and gamma, and then back down again.
Um, and, um, and so, uh, and I was also, uh, experimenting with simulating people's brains with, um,
um, uh, uh, with TACS, uh, transcranial alternating current stimulation and TDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation.
And, um, and, um, and I've used lots of different devices, um, uh, EEG, uh, with the Emotive, EEG with, uh, the Neurosky, EEG with, um, the, uh, Brainduino.
That we, we brought into VR in, in 2018.
I brought EEG into VR in 2018, um, virtual reality.
And that was a goal that I decided on to do back, that's why I started studying virtual reality.
Um, uh, I tried it at, uh, SFVR in, in 2015 when I was working at, uh, at Adobe.
Um, and, uh, I was just helping out with the event.
I was security there.
And, uh, the, um, uh, I, I met my friend, uh, Matt Sonic, and, and I eventually became part of the San Francisco virtual reality team.
I eventually became an organizer, like, I think a year or two later after that, some, maybe a year later.
Um, and, um, to organize, uh, the meetup.
Um, but the, um, but when I was there in 2015, in May of 2015, at the, at Adobe, trying, at the SFVR event, I tried Tilt Brush.
And it was so amazing.
It's the same, it's the same Tilt Brush you can try, you can try on the Oculus, uh, Quest 2, uh, today.
Um, but I tried it back in 2015, one of the first people in the world to try Tilt Brush.
And, um, I was painting with light and space.
And it was just mind-bogglingly amazing.
And, and I, I knew, um, that, uh, I was gonna bring, uh, EEG into VR.
And, to, so that you could stimulate someone's brain waves with, um, uh, very specific patterns.
And so this, so then I, I sort of talked about some of my ideas there.
Uh, of how, you know, we could combine eye tracking and just, you know, paying attention to what someone was looking at in VR and looking at their brainwave activity.
That became the, the, the, basically the, the purpose of the Neural Ace podcast.
It was to explore next-generation brain-computer interfaces that, that involved virtual reality, uh, or augmented reality, or eye tracking, and, and also doing correlations with, uh, with the brain.
And, and, so that was my work in 2012.
That was, that my company was called NeoMindCycle.
I did that from 2012 to about 2014.
Let me just restate that.
So if you look at the hippocampus, theta, theta frequencies in particular are involved in memory formation.
And if you sabotage those theta frequencies, then, uh, then, uh, you have a traumatic effect.
You can have a traumatic effect on memory.
So the actual frequencies, uh, that you stimulate with have very specific effects.
And if you look in the, the history of brainwave entrainment, there's lots of, like, if you go, actually, what I really want to tell people about is if you go on YouTube, um, you can, like, type in brainwave entrainment.
You can find some really awesome, uh, there's three kinds.
There's binaural beats, um, there's isochronic beats, and then you can also just listen to, um, like, frequencies.
Like, the, you can look up, like, the solfago frequency, like, 369.
And, but anyway, the point is that you can find, like, just, if you look up brainwave, bina, if you look up binaural beats, you can find, like, gamma frequencies or delta frequencies.
You can find when they say, there's, like, alpha frequencies they recommend for studying.
If you want to go to sleep, they recommend, like, delta or theta frequencies.
If you want to be, like, very alert, you know, like, like, like, like, being caffeinated and, and just very productive, you might want to go for beta frequencies or gamma frequencies, um, the higher range frequencies.
And these correlate, like, you know, people who have, like, depression, they have a lot of, um, they have a lot more predominance of theta, the slower frequencies of theta and delta frequencies, which, which I think correlates with my idea that, that, that, that for some people, depression is a metabolic disorder.
They're, they're not producing enough energy, not enough ATP, and so they're not able to, um, uh, maintain those higher frequency, um, states that, that the neurotypical has when they go about their day-to-day life.
So their life is, is slower, and it's, like, more depressed, and it's, like, they can't do as much, and they're having, they're struggling.
And it is, it's, it's, it's a depressing situation, and when you're, when you're, when you're, have basic, have a metabolic disorder, and it pulls you down into lower brainwave frequencies.
Um, and so that's why I, I was saying, yeah, you can give people stimulation, and that can give, they can give a depressed person some temporary relief, but if there's a metabolic issue, and that's the real cause of depression, that's not a long-term solution.
And, um, but I wanted to say that because, uh, if you, if you want to, folks can, if you, if you listen to binaural beats, you're going to need headphones, because it, they basically, it works by giving each of your ears a difference in, like, 10 hertz, um, with the sound.
And if you listen to isochronic beats, you don't need headphones, because you can just, it's just no difference between what they send to your left ear and to what your right ear.
Um, and it, and again, you don't need headphones for the, um, like the, uh, just the, the, the tones, like the Sulfurigo frequency, 369, and so, and so forth.
Like, you can listen to, um, yeah, I think, I'll pause myself.
I, I, I might be able to add something.
So, so, so, subliminal messaging is, um, so, you know, I mentioned at the top that, that, um, that brainwave entrainment was early on dismissed by, by some of the, uh, medical professionals as pseudoscience, or just, or, or maybe that's not the right word.
Maybe it's just dismissed and is that it's too hard to explain and understand and sort of prove the conclusions that people have.
Um, that it, it's sort of like, it's sort of like, you know, like we, like, you know, there's a lot of claims that people have, um, about what brainwave entrainment is doing that are just, um, sort of have been difficult for, um, people on the computational neuroscience side to sort of, like, understand how to connect to those ideas.
It's, it's so, it's like, there's, it's like, there's, it's like, there's not been enough understanding to sort of, like, really have support, um, in the past.
Um, but, but there's a, there's a, there's a whole, well, I'm sorry, I totally forgot what was going with that.
Well, what was your question?
Yes.
Um, yeah, um, so, so a long time ago, I did a, I did a podcast, um, called the Neuralase Podcast.
Um, and I talk a lot about, um, my ideas in terms of, uh, building an artificial cortex in that podcast.
So that's available if you just search YouTube for the Neuralase Podcast.
Actually, my, you can go to my website, it's vrma.io.
Uh, and, um, that's the website.
Sure.
Mm-hmm.
R.
Yep.
Dot.
I-O.
Yep.
Yep.
And so that's Isaac and, and, uh, Oscar.
Hey.
Yep.
So I, well, I am a programmer.
So if you look at, if you look at, uh, if you want examples of my programming work, if you go to my Twitter page, which is twitter.com slash worksalt,
and you look at my pinned post, and you look at my pinned post, that pinned post contains a number of videos and links to my, to my work, including GitHub links.
And you can see videos of my, of my, of my, of my, I make AR and VR applications, uh, and also I incorporate, I make brain computer interface software.
So there's, um, there's, um, one of my applications brings EEG into VR.
And, um, so I've got a lot of experience with brain, brain computer interface tech.
And I, so, and I'm actually writing a book right now in which I'm going to talk about brain computer interfaces and that it, and some design ideas I have for new brain computer interfaces.
And also for, uh, artificial brains, for how to build them.
Like, I have my own hypothesis that I'm going to share that's different from what other people are saying.
And then also I'm going to write, I'm going to write about, it sounds pretty amazing, uh, to say, to say it out loud.
But I'm also going to write about how the human brain works, how, how, uh, phenomenal consciousness works in the human brain.
Like, I think I have something new to say that people have never heard before.
And I'm also going to write about, uh, quantum gravity.
I, I believe that I, I am going to propose a new equation to explain, uh, uh, quantum gravity.
I'm going to do all four of these things in my book.
So brain computer interfaces, uh, artificial intelligence, um, and, and in between is, is going to be, um, artificial cortex.
And, uh, and, uh, and then, uh, quantum physics and connecting that to gravity and also, um, how human brains work.
So I'm actually, uh, writing that book right now and very excited about it.
Uh, and, uh, but you can definitely check out my previous work.
Uh, you've, you've, you've got the links now, so.
Uh, that's right.
Yeah, I led that project.
That was my project.
That was my, that was my idea.
Other people helped me with it, but I was the driver of the project.
Yeah.
Um, well, I mean, we're, we're creating an experience for people.
So, um, what happens is, um, we, uh, so, you know, we're capturing, uh, uh, you know, representations of your brain activity as voltages measured on, on your, with sensors placed on your forehead.
And the, and, and, and we're turning those voltages into numbers that we're bringing into a webpage with, with, with, with, uh, the VR application.
So the VR application runs in, runs in a webpage.
And so, we're bringing those signals via WebSocket, and then I, and then, um, we make something happen, uh, for each of the, the, the variations in the signals that are coming.
So the signals go up and down within a certain range.
Maybe, maybe, you know, um, plus or minus four.
Or in between plus or minus four.
And so we, so what, what we did, uh, what I did, uh, the, the project that I led was I, um, uh, I, I had it set so that the, uh, so one idea was that we would just create a time series so that there, so that we'd move a vector, uh, in a sheet up to, um, move it up along the Y-axis.
So imagine that you have a 3D space in the, in the, in a VR application, and the Y-axis is what goes up and down.
So we moved, uh, part of a sheet of, um, of a plane up.
We moved one of its, we moved one of its vectors upwards, uh, and then we moved it back, we shifted it backwards and moved the next one up with the next number that came from the voltage from your forehead.
And so the, and, and then we changed it to another, I changed it to another, um, uh, sort of visualization where instead of that I had independent,
spheres going up and down along the Y-axis and changing color as they went up and down.
And they, the up and down pattern represented your brainwave activity, represented the numbers we were receiving from the voltage from your forehead.
And, um, so as, as that voltage increased or decreased, the height of the spheres that you saw in virtual reality would go up or down.
So we had, like, originally like a thousand spheres. It was a little bit slow and choppy, but people could get up and walk around inside this representation of their brain activity.
Um, and you can, you can see, you can see that if you look through my work, you can see videos of that.
And you can download, and you can download the software. We open sourced it, so it's open source software.
On my, you can see the code also, absolutely.
Yep.
Four areas.
Four areas.
Four areas.
So I said, well, it's really, it's really five areas.
So if we outline the five areas.
So one is, uh, neuro, the neuroscience or neurophysics of how the brain actually works.
And that includes, and that includes, and I work on, I work on all the areas of the brain.
So the brain has many different specialists and many different sort of, like, sub-fields.
So, like, you know, some people will, will just study the hippocampus, and some people will study the hippocampus and the, and, and the, and the inner cortex.
You know, neuroscientists, they specialize in certain areas, right?
I study it all.
And, and, um, so I, like, you know, I talk to a lot of neuroscientists.
And, uh, it's great when I, like, um, they're like, I don't know about that, because I only study this one area.
And I, oh, well, let me, let me help you fill in the gaps there.
Yeah.
I mean, I think that happens a lot, because, because, um, because a lot of the, um, a lot of the discovery has been done.
And so you have to, like, look, you have to get really, um, you want, you, you sort of, like, as a, if you know you're going to be a neuroscientist as your career, you, you kind of, um, a lot of people want to be very specialized.
Because, because the idea is you want to look for something that someone else hasn't seen yet.
And in the last 200 years of, you know, when most of the neuroscientists have been done, the last 200 years, even the last 20 years, it is, like, it's increasingly, like, harder to find something new.
And it's just, like, you're, you, and then you have to, like, and then the amount of stuff that's been created, there's a mountain of research on that is, it's so much information that it's, like, you know, like, it's like, you know, when the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
Because, uh, because the research is so big that that is the reality of the situation, where there's, like, so many sub, there's, like, there's neuroscience, there's neuropsychology, there's computational neuroscience, there's, there's, um, computational biology, there's, like, all these different, like, um, there's, you know, like, neurology and neuroscience are two different things.
They sound the same, they sound the same, there's lots of overlap.
Um, let me, let me pull up my, I wrote some, I wrote something to this effect.
Let me see if you've got them for, uh, neurophysics.
This will help, um, neurophysics, sure.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Um.
Okay, let's see.
Um.
Um.
Okay.
Let's see.
Let's see.
Okay, let's go back.
I just wanted to find this note, because I actually put a lot of work into this for my book, um, which is coming out soon.
I'm hoping it'll come out
this December.
I'm working on it.
I've got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, December
are at the latest January,
but I think it's going to come out
in December. It's going to come out this month, I think.
Yeah, Kindle.
Amazon Kindle.
But let me see if I can find it.
I'll just sort of do this from memory.
Okay, so
think of like
let me see if this one might have it.
Okay, so I see neuroscience as being
primarily concerned with discovering
neuroanatomy, such as mapping the connectome
in the major brain regions.
And then I see computational
biology or computational neurobiology
as sort of concerned
with mapping the functional connectivity.
how information might be distributed,
how it might flow.
That kind of gets into
like also just like
the area of
connectomics
and networks with the brain,
you know, Olaf spawns
and so forth.
I see neurophysics
as being sort of concerned
with the theoretical physics
of neuron function
and brain function
at both the classical
and quantum scales
and, you know,
chemical and molecular scales
in terms of like,
you know,
what are all the different,
you know,
what's going on like thermally,
what's going on like electrically,
what's going on with the physics,
neurophysics.
And, you know,
I kind of see neurology
as being concerned
with the treatments
and the causes
of neurodysfunction.
So I also study neurology,
but it's sort of like
just accidental, I guess.
You know,
when I love to read
about, you know,
Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's
and Huntington's
and the coronavirus
and cancer
and immunology.
And I love to read all this.
Basically, this is the category
of neurology, right,
and the study of medicine.
But it's really because
of the insights
that I get
into computational biology.
that's sort of like,
because I can,
and I would have to say
the least interesting one
is neuro,
what is it called?
Neuropsychiatry
or neuropsychology.
Because, you know,
psychology is much more
at the level of trying
to relate what's happening
at the people level
to what's happening
with their brains
and a lot of, you know,
and when you get
into neuropsychology,
I mean, it's just like,
so psychology is,
anyway,
it's the least interesting
area for me.
It's just,
it's, it's, it's,
but I hope I've given
sort of like,
you know,
the neurophysicist
is going to be much more
mathematically oriented
and versus the,
you might have some
neurologists
or neuroscientists
who, like,
famous ones
who are not especially
good at mathematics
or computer modeling,
like the,
like the neurophysicist
and the computational
biologist.
So, so the,
so the fact that I'm
a programmer
makes, makes me
more, more interested
in, I think,
in computational biology
research
and also in neurophysics
because those are
the kinds of things
where, you know,
programming computers
and doing math
is, it's,
so it's, it's,
it's about the level
of focus
and I hope that's been
a good, good sort of
overview for you.
Does it,
no, go ahead.
Right on.
No, I feel that way too.
I mean, I mean,
in terms of, like,
it's not that often
that I get to talk
to someone with,
with, with that much
knowledge.
Me?
Oh, no, I, I,
yeah, I, I,
I have a,
I have a normal
sleeping routine.
I, I try to,
you know,
I've, I've read that
it's very important
to get eight hours
of sleep.
So I, I,
I try to keep
to a sleep schedule
of some sort
or I try to,
at least,
if, if, if,
if I, if I'm late
getting to sleep,
I try to sleep in
because I, I,
I believe that that
eight hours of sleep
is important for memory
function, for brain
function.
So I, you know,
yeah,
sleep is super important.
You don't,
don't ever skip
on sleep if you,
I mean,
one thing that's
interesting,
people, people
who have trouble
sleeping,
you know,
it, it,
the length,
the length of the
amount of time
that you have
to sleep
has to do
with the temperature
of your room.
And, yeah,
so if you,
like, if you want
to have, like,
if you want to
have a lot of
control,
it's about,
it's about what
temperature it is
at the time
that you're trying
to go to sleep.
Like, if you're,
if you're,
if you're very warm,
you're going to
sleep longer.
And if you're,
but it depends on,
like, if you,
if you get your,
it affects,
it connects to
your circadian rhythm.
You know,
like,
like light,
like,
if there's too much
blue light
at the end
of a day
or from your
computer screen,
that can keep
you up later.
And the same thing
with temperature.
Like,
if you get,
if you get rid
of the blue light
so you can relax
your eyes,
it's not good for your
eyes anyways,
if you get rid
of the blue light
and if you are,
is sleep something
you're worried about
getting enough sleep?
Is that,
is that part of it
or are you just?
No.
So I,
yeah,
so,
so,
so,
um,
uh,
I,
I really,
um,
uh,
I'm a very,
I'm a very organized
person.
I keep,
um,
tons of notes,
uh,
all digital notes,
audio and text notes
in multiple,
um,
multiple different,
uh,
online tools,
uh,
and,
uh,
with,
with many different
backups and so I'm a very,
like,
I'm very detail oriented
and very,
like,
um,
very organized,
very planned.
Um,
and,
um,
you know,
I,
I like brainwave entrainment,
like,
like the,
the,
that,
that,
that's very useful.
I like neutropics.
I think neutropics can help
with memory.
Um,
taking care of your brain,
getting enough exercise,
having a sort of,
like,
an emotionally healthy routine,
um,
you know,
meditation,
um,
I like to do biking,
bicycling,
um,
healthy eating,
um,
I,
I like protein drinks
that are,
like,
high in protein,
all essential amino acids,
all,
I get all essential vitamins,
all essential,
um,
fatty acids,
omega-3s.
I love any food
that has omega-3s in it,
like,
you know,
there's lots of different options there,
lots of fish and stuff,
and so forth,
and,
um,
the thing about essential nutrients is,
is people know that they're called essential nutrients,
and they don't get them,
and they,
like,
they,
they,
then they're surprised when they have health problems,
and,
like,
well,
you don't care about your essential nutrients,
right?
Do you think they're optional?
No,
they're essential.
So,
yeah,
so people will definitely have health problems if they don't get their essential nutrients.
It doesn't,
like,
they don't think about it.
They're like,
I,
well,
okay,
I'm gonna go to McDonald's anyways.
I'm like,
you're not getting any omega-3 from McDonald's,
right?
This matters.
It matters.
So,
yeah,
seafood's great.
Yeah.
so the book,
I'm writing a book that I think is gonna change the world,
for real.
Like,
really,
it's gonna,
like,
it's gonna,
like,
it's gonna,
I'm gonna hit,
I'm hitting,
like,
five different major topics simultaneously,
with innovations in all five of them.
And,
um,
I,
I feel like I've been,
you know,
hit with lightning five times,
that that's how,
like,
profound that is.
Um,
and,
uh,
but,
uh,
besides the book,
then there's gonna be a,
there's gonna be a web VR,
a WebXR website,
which talks about the contents of the book in 3D and VR.
And then,
there's,
and then there's gonna be a,
uh,
brain,
I'm gonna make brain-computer interfaces,
new ones,
with the help of others.
I'm starting an institute,
a scientific institute,
we're gonna make new technology,
we're gonna make,
make new machines.
What?
We're gonna make,
we're gonna make,
okay.
The brain-computer interface with the visual cortex?
Okay.
I mean,
that,
I mean,
I mean,
yeah,
what do you,
what is your,
do you have a specific question?
That,
that,
I have a lot of experience in that,
but I'm not sure what,
that's like,
the Johnny Darrow.
I mean,
it's okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, um, you know, okay, so there is the, um, the machine where they have the, um, the person
who's blind and they have, um, uh, they have, like, he has, he, he wears, like, a tongue
strip, or originally it was a back strip, right?
It was this back strip of electrodes, and that's a tongue strip of electrodes, the same
concept, just a lot smaller, because the tongue is able, the tongue is incredibly versatile,
so the scent, the size of the sensor is a lot smaller and it's a lot easier, but it used
to be a back strip, and either way, the same concept is you have this, you have this, um,
sort of plane of electrodes that sticks to the surface of the body, either the back or the
tongue, and that's connected to the pixels in the camera, and so when the, when, uh, when
the camera, uh, basically the camera's video stream, like, if you consider that, you know,
it's changing the pixels, it's making each pixel light or dark, depending on, at each moment
in the video stream, and what they do is they, is they look at the, they take the, the strip
of electrodes that is, is connected to your tongue, that, that plane of electrodes, it's
like a matrix, right, and they, and they stimulate those electrodes, they turn the charge up or
down on each of those electrodes independently, correlating to the pixels getting brighter or
darker on the camera, and that stimulation, your brain converts into an image, and so people,
you can, the brain can learn to see through the tongue with that, with the camera, with
that, yeah, yeah, right, no, the, the back of the, the back of the back, the back of, above
the butt, the back, the back back, yeah, yeah, that's, that was, originally they put it there,
and it was really big, but then they realized it was better to make a smaller one and put
it on the tongue, and in addition to that, I mean, there's, there's a lot of, like, you
know, stem cell research, in terms of, you know, in terms of replacing and repairing the, right.
There's a lot.
I, well, you've got to read my book, because I'm going to, like, I think I know what the mechanism is, and it's going to be in my book.
Yeah.
Right. The public knowledge is not up to date.
That's right.
I'm, I'm really interested in that, in that as well. I mean, there's definitely a lot of, um, uh, there's, there's everything about, everything about that you learn about one neuron, there's like, there's like, there's like a million different variations.
There's like, and, uh, yeah. And, and they really, um, like the dendrites are like all different shapes, and it's just, like every, every rule that you think is true gets broken.
Okay.
I'm not
I'm not 100% sure on what
you're referring to but there is like
you know there's like
there are neurons that are different
they specialize with certain kinds of
neurotransmitters like there's
dopamine neurons and then there's like
GABAergic neurons and there's
glutamatergic neurons and there's
acetylcholine neurons
and
then there's like
yeah so I mean it's
the thing is like
so the GABA neurons for example
like they
they're like
in certain brain areas like the
like the
thalamus and
they have
and what comes out of them is
our brain waves
that are in the delta frequency
range and that's very interesting
it's like okay so we have
a certain kind of
neurotransmitter in a certain
area
and the outcome is a certain
part of the brain wave frequency
spectrum
all those things are correlated
and if you look at like
you know a lot of the
incoming senses
from
when you go from the eyes
you know
to the
to the
to the visual cortex
in the visual cortex
right where the senses are
coming in
so you go from the eyes
along the optic nerve
to the thalamus
to the
to the
to the occipital lobes
right
and
what you're getting
there's
what there
there's a lot of alpha waves
in
in that lower
sort of like lower
input areas
of the cortex
the sensory input areas
there's a lot of alpha waves
in them
you know I sort of like
I feel like the
the prefrontal cortex
has been misunderstood
that like
the literature says that
that you know we have
the prime
we have three primary
sensitive cortices
and what's left over
is the prefrontal cortex
right
but
I
you know it's
it's like
it's not
it's not
incorrect
but it's also not
I think it's not
like the prefrontal cortex
really isn't
a lot different
it's not a lot different
it's just a little bit different
and it's
it's basically like
you know
there's a lot of
you know
you're
you've got your
your gusatory information
and your emotional information
that sort of
is right there
at the input
to the prefrontal cortex
and
I
so I
still think of the
prefrontal cortex
as like the fourth
it's like the fourth
sensory input
but it's like
gusatory in emotion
right
I'm saying gusatory
but I'm sorry
I meant olfactory
gusatory is
gusatory is
is taste
and olfactory is smell
so the prefrontal cortex
is smell
and emotion
so that would be
olfactory and emotion
I misspoke
but um
but gusatory
and um
gus
anyway
so the gusatory goes
it does interact
with olfactory
but uh
like smell and taste
are intertwined
but um
but it also
but taste
goes to the
um
parietal cortex
it goes
it actually goes
to the somatosensory
cortex first
where it
it connects with
um
tact
with uh
the tactile sensations
that you can feel
with your fingers
and so you have
taste and smell
and they go up
straight to the top
of your head
where the
where the
uh
right in the middle
the top of the middle
so if you put
so if you put
so if you like
put your hand
directly above your head
to the somatosensory
I guess you know this already
uh
to the somatosensory cortex
that's where the
that's where the
the taste and feeling goes
right in the middle
of the top of your head
and then uh
and then it starts
and the signals
seem to travel backwards
towards the um
the visual cortex
they go backwards
and forwards
towards the prefrontal
as far as I know
they go both directions
but but
but like right in between
the um
uh
so that you have
the the upcipital loads
in the back
and then above
and you have the somatosensory
cortex right above
right before the
the motor
um
and
um
the motor cortex
miss
miss
it's it's
misnamed
the misnamed
motor cortex
it's not really
every like
every part of your brain
is motor cortex
right
but um
but uh
the
the anatomical
motor cortex
um
is
is on
one side
and then the somatosensory cortex
so the somatosensory cortex
is
is going to point
uh
if you point
from the somatosensory
from the middle of your head
to the back of your head
where your
occipital lobes are
in between is the parietal lobes
and then the
there's the parietal temporal junction
which is like
so if you have
if you're seeing something
tasting something
feeling something
hearing something
all at the same time
and you're really focused
on something
your temporal parietal junction
is going to be
lighting up
and
yeah
yeah
they converge
right there
and
and people
people almost think
that like
if you're
like
if you're
if you're aware
of something
like
really like
consciously focused on it
let's say that
you're watching a video
and there's a bunch of people
playing basketball
and there's a gorilla
there's a gorilla
that passes
like
it walks to the screen
you
you've done that one
it's a famous one
and um
and so
if
if uh
if people are not
paying attention
then their
their
their TPJ
their temporal parietal junction
is not lighting up
it's only when
if you
if you
if you put an apple
in front of someone
and they're not paying
attention to it
they're
that part of their brain
is just not
not active
and when
they are thinking
about the apple
and they're consciously
aware of it
and they're considering it
how it looks
how it feels
how it tastes
how it
how it
how it
sounds
if you smash it
or something
like
when they're
when they're really
thinking about it
then you can see
their temporal parietal junction
lighting up
and that's
so it's
that is
um
sort of something
that
that
my
the famous neuroscientist
michael
uh
gazaniga talks about
uh
he talks about
um
with his attention schema
that
that when you're
paying attention
to something
your parts of your brain
uh
become active
and so
it's sort of like
it
that's
that
that provides a window
into your brain activity
um
and
and that's
so
anyway
I'm also a neuroimager
so that's
I think a lot about that
and it's part of my book
yeah
well
um
it
I think more specific
I mean like
I don't know
I have some
there's different hypotheses
about attention to death disorder
I mean I like
I
with some medical imaging
it's known that
um
there's
um
some
like
you can see
the blood flow
is not that great
in the
um
uh
in the prefrontal cortex
um
there's
versus an erotypical
and then there's also
some speculation
that the
that the
there might be
like
cerebellum damage
which has to do
with how well you can balance
you can
you can almost like
if you see someone
and they have like
really weird movements
like they're not walking straight
they're just doing weird
things
you can guess
they might
you can guess
they
that is almost a symptom
of attention disorder
attention deficit disorder
yeah
well it's not
it's not very widely known
but so it's like
it's like there's multiple things
happening
with the person's memory
and so like
attention deficit disorder
what it shares in common
with Alzheimer's
is pretty interesting
because it's like
they're both
different diseases
of memory dysfunction
uh
for different reasons
but there
but it's
something
there's something
happening in the
in the tissue
at the cell level
uh
that is
dysfunctional
and
um
you know
I
I think
I mean
I'm thinking
it's probably
a metabolic disorder
from
that stems from
uh
uh
you know
not getting all
your essential nutrients
yeah
yeah
I mean
I think that's a major cause
there's two causes
one is disease
from like
um
you know
there's certain things
in your body
that shouldn't be there
or
um
there's some
sort of injury
happening
uh
either from
like
blunt force impact
or like
cancer
or something
and then
and then
a lot of
a lot of diseases
are just caused
by malnutrition
so
yeah
yeah
I mean
so there's
there's
there's
there's
two big things
that people
pay attention to
when uh
when they hire
when you think
about who to bring
on your team
is
people look for
you know
people who are
talented
and people who
have grit
right
and
and the more
important one
really is grit
because it's like
well
is your team member
gonna
gonna have the
endurance
to sort of
stick through
and continue
the project
and I believe
that endurance
is about
um
the
the energy
metabolism
on some level
it's like
it's like
the behavior
that results
from
having grit
is
has
is a behavior
that results
from people
who have
good nutrition
uh
who have
energy
and endurance
and so they can
stick with the
project even when
it's hard
even when they
can't figure it
out
and they get
farther than
people who
um
who might be
extraordinarily
talented
and intelligent
but can't
can't
can't
you know
rise to the
challenge
when
when the
challenge is
there
they just
they give up
and so
grit
um
is
uh
anyway
sounds good
thank you
thank you so
much
wow we talked
for like 50
minutes
that's amazing
all right
nice
well maybe you
can send me
the link to
that on
uh
on twitter
or something
or however
and uh
you've got
you've got
my contact
details
on VRMA
and
is it in
Russian
I
okay so
you're going to
join this
club
um
well
okay
well I
don't
thanks
I don't
know how
I can even
type this
all right
let's see
what
I don't
know
I think
I think
we got
disconnected
I think
we got
disconnected
but I think
I don't
think
Ike
and
I think
that's
weird
in
another
way
about
how
I feel
that's
I feel
Thank you.
Oh. Hello.
No worries. I think I actually, I think I clicked on the group, and that's why we got disconnected.

Oh, and if someone needs translation help, someone else will help?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just in case there's someone there that doesn't speak English.
Great.
Yeah, oh, absolutely.
Um, that, yeah.
