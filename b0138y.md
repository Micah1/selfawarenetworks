THE REAL FRAME RATE OF Prioception Neurons Movem

00:11

How to understand everything he's he says that, you know, the the speed of an athlete's movement, if you know, it's his is too fast for your brain to process. Your branding is the second to process, and so you have, you know, you have your motor movement, it's gonna be somewhat automatic, it's gonna have some sort of representation that allows you to react fast you're making choices faster than, but is, I think is assumptions are wrong, you should.

00:46

It's just that a neuron.

00:53

If you think you can take place, if you consider the fact that you have neurons are sort of like, and see what would happen is, you have a neuron that would be tracking the, the patterns of other neurons. By, by collecting in one instance, by collecting ionic charges from the ion or tropic receptor.

01:23

And so, is he coming up with sodium from each of his receptors? And this would be faster than the, you know, the super faster than the time scale of action, potentials. And we're talking in the, you know, receptors firing them in three milliseconds, range per sector and and then if you have a neural circuit, right?

01:56

So like even if you're at the neurone frequency of like the action potential, some adversity frequency of neurons. If you have and an entire neural circuit that is also listening with all of the ranching to local patterns and please don't look at me, like my mind, your own business place with the fucking you doing.

EDIT

02:26

So if you have, if you have, so if you have, if you have neurons firing simultaneously, then what that is. Like it's like You are multiplying, your frame rate, you're multiplying your response rate and so not only are they like you're not subjecting future movements so they're imagining feature movements before they happen and the frame rate of consciousness is not one neuron per second, it's 86 billion.

03:10

It's it's put it's it's not it's not the okay, so you're not as an all firing 17 minutes late but it's it's it's some large fraction of 86 billion neurons and so you have to multiply the frame rate time of your potential response speed by the number of neurons running in parallel.

03:38

So if you you have a billion neurons that are all firing in parallel in your and your real actual response frame rate is a billion times times the frame rate of a of an actual potential but realistically it's a billion. It's it's it's closer to like a billion times three frame rate of of each synapse.

04:04

Well I mean we're counting all this enhances the trillion times the frame rate of so your brain is plenty fast enough to coordinate your movement in real time. The idea that you remember has to be coordinated by your spine, or in a concert really matter located throughout here. Your your body

Is the wrong conclusion?
