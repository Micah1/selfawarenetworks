Brocoli Properties example: All the properties of Brocoli are features learned by the neural network of the human brain. So the color, texture, feel, crunch, taste, smell these are learned patterns, information patterns are detected as coincidence evens by receptors on dendrites, then by neurons, then by arrays of neurons, then by nuclei in the thalamus, then by cortical columns & the hippocampal entorhinal circuit, then by the thalamus again, essentially circuiting throughout your brain in a spatial temporal oscillating feedback loop.
