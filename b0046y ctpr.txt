Of the mind book. He line his name created, several different math equations. For how much electricity at each level current, or at each voltage, how much electricity would be required? You know, like like if you electricity is streaming through it, a certain rate, right? If it's a certain, I have, the current is like five or something, right?

If and then it's gonna then it's gonna take. Then if the cells like a but like has a threshold firing, right? Then it's going to take a certain amount of current for to be to pass from the electric battery, to the cell. And anyway, get those equations, get those numbers because then you can sort of like have that in the book.

Like what is the like what is the amount of electrical charge needed to fire off a neuron?

The book Model's of the Mind by Grace Lindsay provided a good answer to this question I am forgetting the specific reference at the time of this note.
