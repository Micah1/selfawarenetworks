(one of those notes I look back on am like WTF? It must have been super late at night, and I was super tired when I wrote this. An electron having a cone shape? What does that even mean? Still, it's interesting, so I will just keep it around.)

what if electrons have a cone shape

its why an up can sit next to a down

or why a positive and mesh with a negative, but not two positives

its like the electron is the tip of the wave at a delta hz, and the magnetic field is the expansion of that same wave from theta, alpha, beta, gamma etc

its like reality is made out of brainwaves

powerbands

curvature in space is what the strong nuclear force is, the curvature of space is why two particles are squeezed close together into an atom

perhaps an atom is like an event that is frozen in time, its happening so slowly relative to the surrounding environment that the particles seem bound together and so effectively they are relatively speaking bound together in time, waiting for everything else to move before its their turn to move.

This idea, whether correct or incorrect is interesting because then we can ask
