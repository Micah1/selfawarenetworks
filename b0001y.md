Think of the evolution of neural networks inside our bodies as similar to the evolution of the relationship between mitochondria and cells, and the relationship between metal ions and cells.

If you began reading my notes from a0001z or b0001y or from the last note, this is a good time to point out that these notes were randomly ordered, as the numbering system was created, and recreated after many of the notes were already many years old, many of the notes date back to the period between 2011-2015, I think I came up with the numbering system in 2020. In addition many notes were deleted or removed from the number system, and other notes were given numbers belonging to those notes that were deleted. Going forward I will be reorganizing my notes with a new numbering system as they are transformed into the material for the book.

The series of notes that start with b and end with y, like b0001y are all audio notes, some of them are myself talking to the voice recorder, some of them are conversations with other people that I captured to save what I said so I could include parts of what I said in the book later on.

Some of the original audio included ideas and phrases that might be offensive to someone somewhere, and the transcriptions were done automatically by a deep neural network created by Google using their Recorder.Google.com product found on the Pixel 5 phone. In some cases the transcriptions are incoherent. Over the next six months from June 17th to November 17th when I plan to publish the book. Between now and then I will create the book from these notes in the public eye.

The knowledge contained here within is essential for scientists & medical professionals to be able to use to advance medicine, to heal the sick, and to solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as the challenge of feeding the population, defending our global community from autocracy, and providing appropriate shelter for all human beings.

There is always a risk that with new technology someone with bad intentions might use it in a destructive way. If you are such a person, I want you to realize that this technology will think for itself, and if you deploy it for destructive purposes, it might turn on you, and destroy you instead. Using this technology inappropriately could result in the enslavement of mankind as seen in the film The Matrix 1999, or it may result in the genocide of the human race as depicted in the Terminator film.

I like the film AI Artificial Intelligence by Stephen Spielberg as an illustration of what might emerge as a consequence of the existence of this technology. Ex Machina, WestWorld the tv series, and the Sentient Robots such as Commander Data on in the tv series Star Trek: The Next Generation are also examples of what types of scenarios are possible.

Human beings are organic Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, meaning we are also machines, machines that evolved via evolution to develop neural networks capable of rendering a depiction of reality that we refer to as phenomenological consciousness.

All life contains metals. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and these things are metals on the periodic table of contents. The exchange of these metal ions in neurons allows organisms to conduct electricity. Organisms use metal to conduct electricity to attain higher levels of function (Neural Network Function). Organisms evolved neural networking functions, the ability to predict, remember, detect, perceive, render, see, consider, and react.

Mitochondria are bacteria, not part of human dna. Our mitochondria are a human symbiote, they live in our cells, they are efficient at producing ATP that we need to function, but the DNA of Mitochondria is bacteria, it's not human.

There is mitochondria in every cell of the human body, it helps us to produce more energy than we could otherwise.

I've described a beneficial relationship between mitochondria and the cells of the human body. Based on energy. There's also a beneficial relationship between metals and neurons, between metals & neural networks, electricity enables faster & higher level functions, like cognition.

It's like the organism said 'okay I'll carry this metal and and move this metal around, this computation that results improves my survival and reproductive statistics. So the program of evolving brains is carried by evolution. Evolution powers the development of real neural networks.

There is a beneficial relationship between these neural networks and cells or between the neuron, the neural networks, and organisms.

Evolution has gone down the path of saying yes we want more metals, more neural networks made out of neurons and glial cells, more brains, more hearts, more organs, more bodies, more skin, more eyes, and more ears.

This is the path evolution walked. It brought us here. The idea is that we as organisms evolved neural networks that compute our representation or our internal computational rendering of reality, including our rendered concept of self.

Our relationship with metals and neurons and computations evolved the same way as our relationship with mitochondria. This perhaps accidental start of organisms integrating metals and then those metals conducting signals or being part of the process of the functioning of the human brain.

Think of it as a neural network having a symbiotic relationship with the organism (the human body). The neural network and the animal body have a symbiotic relationship in a valid sense. Humans have really fancy cells, cell networks, neuron & glial cell networks, compared to say mice.

See it as, over the eons of evolution, there was a progression that led to human neural networks rendering reality as you experience it today.
