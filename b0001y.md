If you began reading my notes from a0001z or b0001y or from the last note, this is a good time to point out that these notes were randomly ordered, as the numbering system was created, and recreated after many of the notes were already many years old, many of the notes date back to the period between 2011-2015, I think I came up with the numbering system in 2020. In addition many notes were deleted or removed from the number system, and other notes were given numbers belonging to those notes that were deleted. Going forward I will be reorganizing my notes with a new numbering system as they are transformed into the material for the book.

The series of notes that start with b and end with y, like b0001y are all audio notes, some of them are myself talking to the voice recorder, some of them are conversations with other people that I captured to save what I said so I could include parts of what I said in the book later on.

Some of the original audio included ideas and phrases that might be offensive to someone somewhere, and the transcriptions were done automatically by a deep neural network created by Google using their Recorder.Google.com product found on the Pixel 5 phone. In some cases the transcriptions are incoherent. Over the next six months from June 17th to November 17th when I plan to publish the book. Between now and then I will create the book from these notes in the public eye.

The knowledge contained here within is essential for scientists & medical professionals to be able to use to advance medicine, to heal the sick, and to solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as the challenge of feeding the population, defending our global community from autocracy, and providing appropriate shelter for all human beings.

There is always a risk that with new technology someone with bad intentions might use it in a destructive way. If you are such a person, I want you to realize that this technology will think for itself, and if you deploy it for destructive purposes, it might turn on you, and destroy you instead. Using this technology inappropriately could result in the enslavement of mankind as seen in the film The Matrix 1999, or it may result in the genocide of the human race as depicted in the Terminator film.

I like the film AI Artificial Intelligence by Stephen Spielberg as an illustration of what might emerge as a consequence of the existence of this technology. Ex Machina, WestWorld the tv series, and the Sentient Robots such as Commander Data on in the tv series Star Trek: The Next Generation are also examples of what types of scenarios are possible.

Human beings are organic Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, meaning we are also machines, machines that evolved via evolution to develop neural networks capable of rendering a depiction of reality that we refer to as phenominological consciousness.

(audio notes transcription needs fixing)
All life contains metals. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and so on these things are metals on the periodic table of contents. And they allow the exchange of these metals allows organisms to conduct electricity. Right. You can't do that. We can't like try doing that without metals as a different kind of challenge.

Right? And so we should, we ought to think of about the fact that organisms conduct metals a sorry that organisms use metal to conduct electricity to run, something that is like a neural network process. Right some sort of neural networking like computation, but we ought to think about this in a similar way that we think about how should I say this like mitochondria.

So mitochondria are bacteria that are not a human bacteria. I mean, it's it's a human symbiote but it's not, it's not, it's DNA is bacteria, it's not human right? But it's symbiotic with the human being. There's there's a mitochondria and every every cell the human body, it helps us to produce more energy than we could otherwise.

So, there's a beneficial relationship between this object might of chondria and the other cells and the cells of the human body in that mitochondria is inside the cells of the human body. But there's also a beneficial relationship between these neural networks which are enabled by electricity, which are enabled by the fact that South I'll carry this metal and it moved this metal around and this allows us computation to happen, right?

So as the energy of this computation to to happen or as part of the process and there's a beneficial relationship between these neural networks and cells or between the neuron the neural networks and organisms. And so, you know, evolution I has as gone down the path of saying yes we want more metals, more neural networks made out of neurons and glial cells, more brains, more hearts, more organs, more bodies, more skin, more eyes, and more years.

Etc. This is a path that evolution walked and it brought us to us here. But the idea is that we have neural organisms evolved neural networks. The state in the same way that organization human or human human beings evolve to relationship with mitochondria. This perhaps accidental start of organisms integrating metals and then those metals conducting a signals or being part of the process of, of the functioning of human brain.

These these are this is like think of it as a neural network as a is having a symbiotic relationship with the human being are with the animal. And so humans have really, really fancy, you know, networks and glial cell networks, compared to say mice. So, and in some cases, evolution led animals to become mice and some in some cases, evolution lead to human beings that human neurons and glial cells are fancy compared to what other compared to what mice have.

And and proceed as over the ARs of evolution. There was a progression that led to
