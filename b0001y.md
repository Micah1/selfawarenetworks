This note is a comment on the evolution of human biology and it's co-evolution relationship with metals, mitochrondria, and neural network computation

b0001y argues that organisms evolved neural networks just as they evolved a symbotic relationship with mitochondria, and the use of metals. It links my two articles that discuss how humans are metal robots in a valid sense. 

organisms like us are akin to metal robots that evolved neural networks that have distributed inner displays, nonlinear environment modelling, self modelling, action modelling, and adaption modelling computations.

Think of the evolution of neural networks inside our bodies as similar to the evolution of the relationship between mitochondria and cells, and the relationship between metal ions and cells.

All life contains metals, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and so on.

These things are metals on the periodic table of contents.

The exchange of these metals allows organisms to conduct electricity.

You can't do that. You can't try doing that without metals. That's a different kind of challenge.

We ought to think about the fact that organisms use metal to conduct electricity to run something that is like a neural network process, some sort of neural networking like computation.

But we ought to think about this in a similar way that we think about mitochondria.

Mitochondria are bacteria that are not, it's not a human bacteria. It's a human symbiotic with the human being.

There's mitochondria in every cell of the human body that helps us to produce more energy than we could otherwise.

So there's a beneficial relationship between this object mitochondria and the other cells in the cells of the human body.

In that mitochondria is inside the cells of the human body.

But there's also a beneficial relationship between these neural networks which are enabled by electricity, which are enabled by the fact that cells carry this metal and it moved this metal around.

This allows this computation to happen. It allows the energy of this computation to happen or is part of the process.

And there's a beneficial relationship between these neural networks and cells or between the neural networks and organisms.

And so evolution has gone down the path of saying, yes, we want more metals, more neural networks made out of neurons and glial cells, more brains, more hearts, more organs, more bodies, more skin, more eyes, more ears, etc.

This is the path that evolution walked and it brought us to us here.

But the idea is that organisms evolved neural networks in the same way that human beings evolved a relationship with mitochondria.

This perhaps accidental start of organisms integrating metals and then those metals conducting signals or being part of the process of the functioning of the human brain.

This is like, think of it as a neural network is having a symbiotic relationship with the human being or with the animal.

And so humans have really fancy neural networks and glial cell networks compared to say mice.

So in some cases evolution led animals to become mice and in some cases evolution led to human beings.

But human neurons and glial cells are fancy compared to what mice have.

And if I see it as over the eons of evolution, there was a progression that led to...
