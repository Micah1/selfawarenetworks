00linkreviewlist

It's like the todolist but specifically for external links to research papers including links to pdf's that I want to review

a0213z revisit this note to sort out the content

There are a pdfs & downloaded webpages on the chromebook

a bunch of webpages open on the iphone in chrome browser

there are papers linked in the facebook groups & pages & the discord group

there are pdfs saved to your hardrive & the cloud

the chrome browser extension toby also has a ton of old links to review

search for old onetab links on each notebook, and in your notes in apple notes, simple notes, ever note, all the other note tools

anything that hasn't been reviewed add it here.

MIT solved a century-old differential equation to break 'liquid' AI's computational bottleneck
The discovery could usher in a new generation of weather forecasting and autonomous vehicle driving virtual agents.

New Medical Imaging Tech
title: "Faster brain imaging technique seems to overcome limitations of current MRI scans"
"The DIANA method can be implemented with typical MRI machinery, but researchers used a new way of measuring the data that is fast enough to detect the tiny DIANA signal. Normal MRI scans acquire the entire image in one scan, but that’s too slow and would start recording after this signal had already dissipated, which is why it hasn’t been detected before. The new method splits up the process, acquiring a single trace of the data at a time." https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/13/faster-brain-imaging-seems-to-overcome-limitations-of-mri-scans/

# "Phase of firing does not reflect temporal order in sequence memory of humans and recurrent neural networks" 
"model neurons exhibit theta phase-dependent firing related to item position, where phase of firing again did not match item order. Instead, we observed a mechanistic link between phase order, stimulus timing and oscillation frequency - a relationship we subsequently confirmed in our neural recordings. Taken together, in both biological and artificial neural networks we provide validating evidence for the role of phase-of-firing in memory processing while at the same time challenging a long-held theory about the functional role of spiking and oscillations in sequence memory."
