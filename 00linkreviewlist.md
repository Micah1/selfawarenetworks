00linkreviewlist

It's like the todolist but specifically for external links to research papers including links to pdf's that I want to review

Note: The link review list is meant to be empty, it's a back log of links I want to review, it's not even all the links I want to review, countless links are stored in my toby account, and on my social media accounts, twitters, facebook pages, facebook groups, on linkedin, and other places, all over the place. There is so much stuff to review and that fact is why I am starting an institute focused on this research topic: Self Aware Networks: Neurophysics, Artifical Neurology, and Brain Machine Interfaces.

As I review the links I will either move them to related notes, create new notes around them, or remove them for being too far off topic. Most of the time I've previewed a link and at least skimmed the abstract before it makes it to this list, but occassional I will grab something just because of it's title to review later without knowing whether or not it's applicable to this project.

New Medical Imaging Tech
title: "Faster brain imaging technique seems to overcome limitations of current MRI scans"
"The DIANA method can be implemented with typical MRI machinery, but researchers used a new way of measuring the data that is fast enough to detect the tiny DIANA signal. Normal MRI scans acquire the entire image in one scan, but that’s too slow and would start recording after this signal had already dissipated, which is why it hasn’t been detected before. The new method splits up the process, acquiring a single trace of the data at a time." https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/13/faster-brain-imaging-seems-to-overcome-limitations-of-mri-scans/

# "Phase of firing does not reflect temporal order in sequence memory of humans and recurrent neural networks" 
"model neurons exhibit theta phase-dependent firing related to item position, where phase of firing again did not match item order. Instead, we observed a mechanistic link between phase order, stimulus timing and oscillation frequency - a relationship we subsequently confirmed in our neural recordings. Taken together, in both biological and artificial neural networks we provide validating evidence for the role of phase-of-firing in memory processing while at the same time challenging a long-held theory about the functional role of spiking and oscillations in sequence memory."

# 1 of 2 "Study urges caution when comparing neural networks to the brain. Computing systems that appear to generate brain-like activity may be the result of researchers guiding them to a specific outcome."
"Grid cells, on the other hand, work very differently. As an animal moves through a space such as a room, grid cells fire only when the animal is at one of the vertices of a triangular lattice. Different groups of grid cells create lattices of slightly different dimensions, which overlap each other. This allows grid cells to encode a large number of unique positions using a relatively small number of cells."
"To train neural networks to perform this task, researchers feed into it a starting point and a velocity that varies over time. The model essentially mimics the activity of an animal roaming through a space, and calculates updated positions as it moves. As the model performs the task, the activity patterns of different units within the network can be measured. Each unit’s activity can be represented as a firing pattern, similar to the firing patterns of neurons in the brain."
"“Earlier studies have presented this story that if you train networks to path integrate, you're going to get grid cells. What we found is that instead, you have to make this long sequence of choices of parameters, which we know are inconsistent with the biology, and then in a small sliver of those parameters, you will get the desired result,” Schaeffer says."
"One of the constraints found in earlier studies is that the researchers required the model to convert velocity into a unique position, reported by one network unit that corresponds to a place cell. For this to happen, the researchers also required that each place cell correspond to only one location, which is not how biological place cells work: Studies have shown that place cells in the hippocampus can respond to up to 20 different locations, not just one. When the MIT team adjusted the models so that place cells were more like biological place cells, the models were still able to perform the path integration task, but they no longer produced grid-cell-like activity. Grid-cell-like activity also disappeared when the researchers instructed the models to generate different types of location output, such as location on a grid with X and Y axes, or location as a distance and angle relative to a home point."
