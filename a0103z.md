Looking back on this note I remember thinking it sounded ridiculous when I had this idea and wrote it down. I'm saving it because it's novel & interesting. I'm sure some physicists will want to yell at me for how stupid they think this idea is. lol.

Quantum Gravity age of the universe
if the size of space is relative to mass

the cosmos is 93 billion years apart, and the cosmos is 13.7 billion years old, but if it is relative to mass then as mass increases so does space, and that means half the expansion of space is negative space, backwards in time and half is positive space forwards in time

negative velocity and positive velocity
negative mass positive pass
negative 

but space could only expand faster than mass temporarily, like a virtual particle, a temporary violation of conservation, which means space expanded at the same velocity as mass, because they are expand together, but instead of getting more mass in the samespace we get more intervals of mass which we experience as time

so the expansion of space is relative to the increasing intervals of spacetime caused by paired particles

since one happens at the same time as the other, and one is locked to the speed limit of light, then the other is locked to the speed of light

the size of the visible universe, expanded at the speed of virtual light,

and real light actually does have an undetectable amount of mass

-if a virtual particle is a temporary particle, and all particles except protons have been observed to decay,

proton

if a proton never decays, then in a harmonic oscillator that would make it a bad point,
