(oscillat) Phases not spikes.
Mark Humphries the author of The Spike insists that most spikes do nothing. In my hypothesis every spike does something, because a neural oscillator ensemble is observing phase changes at multiple scales in individual neurons which is the compiled result of all phasic spikes relative to the oscillators tonic firing pattern.

The spike is going to electromagnetically stimulate mitochondrial production of ATP see the note on Flavin, that leads to reinforcement learning and memory development via receptor growth & new protein synthesis.

The tonic spiking is creating the canvas of consciousness, the phasic spiking is creating the ink of perception. (Phasic spiking is rare, in Information Theory something contains more information if its rare, so in contrast to the common tonic spiking that seems to do nothing they are providing a canvas for rare signals to have context)
