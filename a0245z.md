(oscillat) Phases not spikes.
Mark Humphries the author of The Spike insists that most spikes do nothing. In my hypothesis every spike does something, because a neural oscillator ensemble is observing phase changes at multiple scales in individual neurons which is the compiled result of all phasic spikes relative to the oscillators tonic firing pattern.

The spike is going to electromagnetically stimulate mitochondrial production of ATP see the note on Flavin, that leads to reinforcement learning and memory development via receptor growth & new protein synthesis.

The argument is that the magnetic field, created by the action potential spike along the axonal body, will stimulate the mitochondria to produce more ATP, aiding synaptic growth demonstrating what researchers identify as improved neurocognitive effects like memory formation.

"In addition, behavioral studies of healthy mice exposed to a 3.5-23.0 T magnetic field for two hours also found improved neurocognitive effects, which may be associated with increased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II expression in the mouse hippocampus. "

The tonic spiking is creating the canvas of consciousness, the phasic spiking is creating the ink of perception. (Phasic spiking is rare, in Information Theory something contains more information if its rare, so in contrast to the common tonic spiking that seems to do nothing they are providing a canvas for rare signals to have context)
