website: neo mind cycle: increasing the depth of your "recursive embedding"

To understand what Neo Mind Cycle is, you need to understand your brain
I want you to understand your brain, so my twelve week course, includes 24 Neo Mind Cycle sessions
lessons in ai, neurology, and cognitive science

Meat is an interesting good conductor of electrical signals,
brain is a better conductor, actually it's almost a battery

memory is like a charge

the storage format is movement

so all data is converted into movement

the more important a concept is, the more associations it makes with other concepts

this means that you will think about it more often

1,000,000,000 
one concept may have 1 billion connections

if you have 84 billion cells

then your going to think about this concept 1 times every 84 minutes

that's a huge concept

the reason you think about it, is that everything in your brain is connected

so if you have any electrical pathway, traveling in any direction, eventually it's going to connect with one of the cells that are connected to the 1,000,000,000 cells that represent the once concept

but this concept is so big, that all 1,000,000,000 cells are going to fire several times together all at once to form the concept

So Neo Mind Cycle becomes the a flash bulb, making big concepts, but this has to happen several times for the big concept to take hold.

once the big concept is formed, by repeating coincidental firings

it becomes an array that can represent many concepts

and it can be represented by a smaller number of cells, even by a single cell eventually

that single cell is enough to remind the other cells of what to do, what coordinated pattern to follow.

so instead of a giant firing pattern, the firing pattern smoothes out, 

spatial data is being converted into movement, the sequences of movement are recorded, from what was initially learned

the initial memory was spatial/temporal relationships, then sparse distributed representations, then individualized grandmother neurons complexified to 

replace the large distributed representation, with a single neuron that simply connects to the defining edges of what use to be the large distributed representation

it's as if the 1,000,000,000 billion cells is a specific shape, like a sphere, or more simply a circle, a curve, with volume, dimension

so grandmother neuron's connections represent the same 1,000,000,000 billion cells, by reacting to the cells that represent the outline of that circle, the corner of that curve, the expansion motion of that volume, and the contraction motion of dimension, and it connects to those to represent the sphere, essentually factoring 1,000,000,000 billion cells into connections assigned to one neuron,

which involves a new protein, that physically redefines the connections this neuron seeks to grow, so even if connections are destroyed, they can be regrown, the connections do not store any long term memory, they create active memory

the stored long term memory is the whole protein structure of each neuron, including tiny changes to the exterior of microtubules because of what the camkii2 does everytime a synapse fires.

"recursive embedding is consciousness itself" no its memory, capacitive memory, mans brain reaches to the moon, has a monkey been to the moon?

there is no self inside any memory, no part of the brain contains me, the meat is a capacity, relay, concept generating battery, your not inside you, your not inside your brain, it's just a capacitor/battery/memory/concept making/ relay

you don't exist at all, your brain exists, the concept of you exists, the memory of you exists, but none of that is you.

It's okay to argue that since there is no you apart from that, that this stuff is you, the memory, the concept, the brain,

but for the same reason you can argue that the whole ecosystem in which you are connected is also you, the whole environment, earth, solar system, galaxy, cosmos

yes your brain has memories, and concepts, and it effects your life in a deep way

so does your heart

so do other brains and other hearts

so does the whole environment

efficiency

even if you have a neural network with 100 billion neurons, you still need a way for a single neuron, to represent the unique result of a 100 billion neurons, in a unique way

so you simply capture the top 10 percent which is going to be the peak of the impact in all the regions of brain, and then that single neuron connects only to those peaks, not the 90 percent of neurons involved in the initial firing pattern

its as if the bulk of the brain is used for stage 1 environment sensing, and long term memories are novel, important, and persistent peaks of brain activity converted into single cell memories by connections that represent the factoring of large concepts

so its like if everything I am seeing is a number, a branching sequence of numbers, I'm only remembering the peaks of those numbers

actually this means my eeg numbers should represent my emotional present stage one sensory state

which I will be able to coordinate more efficiently depending on which long term memory-predictions are fired

the short term state is emo

so if I have long term memories about navigating emo, I increase my coordination locally

thats why eeg is good for autistics, it literally creates long term memory around how to navigate emo

emo meaning short term sensory awareness

its increasing the depth of your "recursive embedding"

increasing the resolution of your hd infinity looping screen

so seeing yourself between two mirrors is recursive embedding

so is the russian doll

humans have toys to teach each other concepts

so with eeg I'm peak long term learning these state awareness concepts, plus I'm stimulating the conceptual development by triggering larger sequences of memory associations to fire, so that the memories that are eventually formed in single cells after many sessions are extremely big picture high resolution concepts of self

so self coordination rapidly increases,

self understanding rapidly increases, 

understanding of others rapidly increases

I'm conceptualizing the processes of my inner state of mind, my long term memory, every function of my brain, and the cosmos, because

some of my neurons have changed their connections to represent gigantic concepts of how my present in the moment state works, in terms of inner coordination.
