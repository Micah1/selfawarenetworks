Consciousness is a temporally active loop of human computed stories & graphical renderings & audio sensory mechanical synthesis of patterns.

That's it, that's the solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

perhaps the morphology of the spine and dendrite encodes a memory in the topography or shape of the neuron, setting its shape as its voltage or waveform, the amplitude of its wave form or volume of its learned pattern, that changes long term with long term memory changes, its shape changes, because of new protein synthesis for growth in certain areas that are stimulated

That there is a plausible scenario in which the human brain has learned to render and imagine volumetric images from any angle like GP3
