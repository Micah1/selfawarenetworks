b0172y Brain note taking Dipoles Movements

# Concise Summary (b0172y):

Graph spectral theory applied to MEG data treats the brain as a network, mapping magnetic dipole activity onto a 3D coordinate system to form a dynamic, non-distorted spectral graph. This graph captures frozen moments—like detailed drawings—that serve as spatial maps for coordinating complex, highly refined movements and constructing a note-taking memory system where each frame of consciousness is recorded.

Graph spectrum, graph spectrum, graph spectral theory. So graph spectral theory is interesting because this was a, this was a way of, this was a discussion for analyzing MEG data as a spectral analysis of MEG data and consideration of the brain as a graph, as a network graph. It's applying, like, work in graph theory to MEG data, to correlate the brain as a network and the data that it uses. It's hoping to create a spectral graph that you would measure with MEG, which is the magnetic and electric. It's the electromagnetic field generated by, it's the magnetic side of the dipole. Magnetic dipoles. You're going to find this better.

But you have, you have a dipole that's going to create electric; there's electric dipoles and there's magnetic dipoles. The output of MEG, for some reason, is capturing the magnetic dipoles—not the electric dipoles. See, the electric dipoles are what you get with EEG, and that's distorted by the shape because it's electricity based. The skull and the tissue underneath the skull are going to distort the electricity-based dipoles measured with EEG, but the magnetic dipoles measured with magnetoencephalography are not distorted at all by the skull or the brain tissue around the brain, underneath the skull.

And the mercy of that—the amazing features of that, I guess—are that you get a really nice, high-level, non, I guess, I don't know, like, would it diffuse? Like, if you can't capture the detail at the neuronal level with magnetoencephalography, would that be similar to applying a diffusion, like a diffuser filter over an image captured? Like, putting a diffuser on an image—is there a similarity there? But the point is that we're considering the full spectrum of the magnetoencephalography readouts as a graph based upon the brain being a network that creates each component of the magnetic spectrum in a different area.

It's like, imagine—so a graph is like what? You have, imagine you have a graph that you begin to draw. It's a 3D graph and you're going to need a coordinate system. So you go with the typical x, y, and z coordinate system. And so y is, y plots—you plot the points that go on the y axis, usually up or down—and x can be left or right coordinates. Everything on the left, to the left, is like negative x, so everything to the right is positive x of an imaginary line. In this case we'll plot x, y, z through the center of the brain, and we're going to say that if we think of the brain as a spatial structure—a volume that fits on top of this x, y, z graph, which is at the center—and then we also plot the data received from MEG on top of this same structure.

So, yeah, so, okay, so as far as I know so far, spectrography represents the magnetoacetylogram, as plotted by the activity of the brain over the volume of the brain, over the distribution of the brain's volume. That means that if you have brain activity, it's not that brain activity is increasing; it's that it's changing—the rate might be increasing. But that's what it is: you have a rate of activity increasing in certain regional areas, and those are correlated with your movements as well as changes in thoughts. And what comes out of that, though, is just this awesome phrase: graph, spectrograph theory, right?

So what I'm positing is that essentially what this rendering is—what we're calling experience—is, if you slow it down way, way down (if you could really, really slow time down), all you see is one moment that's just frozen in time and nothing really changes. You're slowing time down so much that all you're considering is one moment frozen in time. Okay, is this working? And so what you want to think about now, having a frozen moment in time, is that whatever you're seeing is like a drawing. And it's like a drawing—it's like a map, right? Let's say that, let's say that.

So right now, I'll tell you what I'm seeing. I'm at the mall while I'm recording this—I'm at the Embarcadero Mall in San Francisco. It's been mostly empty for the past year because of the pandemic, but I'm sitting on a metal bench on the second level of a three-level mall. The mall is, for the most part, an outdoor mall. It's a mall that's exposed to the elements. There's no central air conditioning because they use the natural air of San Francisco. It doesn't get super hot in San Francisco; it does not often go above 80 degrees, and I think 70 degrees is pretty warm here for us. And while we're used to it, okay? But let me click this back—put my backpack down. Um, okay, but...

Okay, so we're going to say that we've got this—what we're considering one moment of time. What's in front of me is that I'm sitting on a bench, and there's a bush—a plant, a large plant that is... the plant is the size of a cow. Okay, it's a big bush. Now, if I wanted to, I could get up and walk into it, or I could walk next to it so that my path would be clear. But in one moment of time, in one frame of time, the organism—that is me—knows that it could walk forward and have a clear path in front, or it could walk to the right and be in a bush. It could walk into the bush. And, um... so that information would be valuable for an organism that needs to walk to find food, for example—the information of where my path is clear.

And so I'm saying this because we can see that a plant doesn't have a brain. The idea is that animals have brains for highly coordinated movements. They go far beyond just having some movements like a plant; a plant might lean toward the sun very slowly, for example, to get the best sunlight. But it's not writing a check from a checkbook and pulling a check out and handing it to me. That's the difference between highly coordinated movement and simple movements. Plants have extremely simple movements. For human beings, we have to do these really complex, highly coordinated movements. Animals also do highly coordinated movements. For example, a dog is an animal that has to consider a lot of variables every day in order to find food or be friends with a human who can give it food. So a dog is making very highly coordinated movements. All animals are. And the bigger the brain, the more capable it is. That's an old thought. Obviously, there are some brains that have been bigger than human brains—animal brains. Well, you know, part of the animal came down. But I'm just saying, you know, there are elephants and dolphins and a whole bunch of animals with very large brains. Not that many, to be honest—not that many, but there's a few. And we've seen some intelligent things from animals that have very small brains, comparatively. Crows—very small brains doing very interesting things with tools that they made themselves to get things, complex tools. So, in that context, the brains are for highly coordinated movements—whether you're a human or part of one of the other species in the animal kingdom.

The thing is that it would make sense, in the context of having a brain for movement—highly coordinated movements—for you to have a sort of note-taking ability that tells you, once you figure out where something is, where it still is. It's called a memory system—a note-taking memory system—where every frame of your consciousness is a note, and collectively, the frames of your consciousness constitute a memory system. This is for an organism that has to do complex things to maintain its life, long enough either to reproduce or to support other members of its species when they reproduce.
