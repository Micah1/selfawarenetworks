Photocopier Neurons Oscillator

00:00
After I had this idea about the the atom being a about Adams, combining to form like a ball, or a planet. And then that planet having like a beam forming isolation. Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.

00:42
How many horizontal patterns are available and that sort of beam forming property. The of something has oscillations form being beams because they are attractive. Like the they attract.

01:06
They the power bands, converge, right? Like you have a bunch of. If you have oscillatory activity emerging from the same place, they're going to converge together and so you have space squeezing squeezing together. When when you have oscillations increasing around around vertices around atoms and molecules. So the state so space time is squeezing only because squeezing together?

01:38
Because the in terms of like the the number of different ways, that a part of open travel, there is an increase in vertical traveling, but like, but waves also oscillate so, like, like it the particle travels, it's a plank distance and then that knocks another part of phone and that travel, then that particle travels and so and so on.

02:10
But in any way that that's like what I called like a lane is that in in the boast Einstein condensate, that is a beam as a beam. So that's that. So that that so I just like hypothesized there could be a lane from from the the concentration of vertical firing also is for a vertical firing Actually doesn't matter.

02:40
If it's Oscillatory. Like the decades should be like concentration of vertical firing and just disfit flows down on horizontal firing. And so because it takes longer for because it's less because is less likely that a known is going to come out than that. But something is going to travel horizontally than it is in trouble vertically, right?

03:03
Because it's like, it's like there's more, it's going vertical. The closer you are to that at more stuff is like, by chance gonna go vertical and horizontal and so the so basically, like actually. So, I'm not sure if that works, because that means the closer you are to the atom.

03:25
The more more likely it is that you're going to get sucked into a vertical lane or attracted to the attic and environment. If you can't go in closer. All right, so second, the gravitational force could like a, like, an attract could be like the tractor forces, like the odds of of moving towards the atom or towards the oscillator are going to increase the closure.

03:52
You are to it see when I be volunteering the other class. But if that, so in that case, there are actually fewer, horizontal lanes for the travel. So some stuff that's traveling horizontally. My travel a lot faster, that's what they're speaking. And if you get stretched out from that oscillator, then then the beams are going to be spread out.

04:26
They're going to disperse like some like Sundays, they're going to disperse and so that means that there's a lot more potential but relatively speaker there's a lot more potential for horizontal cobbles. So, horizontal travel is going to have to not actually have or horizontal. Travel is found out because severely speak English.

04:56
Yeah, but the horizontal is would be expanding between the beans that are shot out by the, but it's between the vertical games. And so the the distance that that a particle would have to travel. Horizontally is increase relative to distance part of the travel, horizontally. It's closer to an oscillator like Earth.

05:29
So if a particle has to travel a greater distance because the beam it relatively relatively speaking. I greater distance, then it's the warping of space. That makes travel nice particles. Travel.

05:49
Sure distance to orbit. So if there's a shorter distance for a particle to orbit then time, then the amount of time or the interval of time is shorter. And if a particle has to travel how long your distance, which is a higher orbit, then the interval of time is longer, right?

06:15
Because it has to travel more horizontally. There's less vertical. There's less chance that something than travel vertically. The farther away. It is from the center of an oscillation. So that sort of like explains our relatively speaking, there's more space so it doesn't explain why space is created actually. So after you think that I guess?

06:40
No, no. So I guess I'm not arguing that spaces created by the, by the offset because that actually doesn't make sense. I'm arguing that the curvature of space is defined by the last letter which gives so that would give you the relative distinction of space. Since space should be relatively slower away from the oscillator, the center of the oscillator.

07:17
And it's, it's a result of the solar. And so space would be appeared to be expanding, and a sense, because the amount of time, the amount of time between intervals is relatively greater than the amount of than than the amount of time at the horizontal movement between offers is in a relatively greater.

07:50
Can be horizontal movement. Close to the oscillator far from outsider. It's like time to solve sound, you know, the interval, the time, intervals, between points of space, right? So particle would happen with one point of space to another and maybe the maybe the particle represents sort of like an interval and time, all right?

08:21
And it's like it's defined by where it lands, even if it's even if where it's going to I've covered here, Oh yeah, so but like for space away from Adams, it is going to expand and the square corner to expand in a sense because I know maybe in a census like a sort of like inverse pressure from from the vertical waves, that sort of like

09:01
I'm trying to remind me how after we visit a computer can detect. Signals. I I didn't auditory a good story and visual signals. Samata sensory, signals case, signals, with sensor arrays. Just just it with higher fidelity, than him being can. And it can have possibly can simulate physics to process.

09:36
Those signals in exactly the very human being would 39 in exactly where, but to produce the exact same signal results, it's it's a functional isomorphism. So like, if you imagine, we're like imagine, like with categories theory, let's draw a straw map. Okay so we're going to have my drive map and it's going to it's going to image the note flow and I'm gonna draw like so there's gonna draw like a which is the signal capture is the signal capture from an array.

10:23
So it's like the array could be your you're retina your hand your tongue here, the signal capture. So we have a and then let's make this smaller. Here we go. So, they may also have like, or

10:58
Or microphone.

11:03
Camera.

11:07
Other sensor device other sensor. Sensory arrays other artificial cancer arrays, right then. So we have a okay, and there's a goes to just draw an arrow. I'm drawing arrow to be A to B and then we're going to point an arrow from a down to see. Okay. And we're going to draw.

11:47
That's right. Down to see them. Highlighters. Okay, delete see this time. So okay. So you have to let our a and it has two arrows and one points to the a is right, and that points to be, and the other goes from a and it goes down points down to C.

12:06
Now, C is going to point to the right today and B is going to point down to D. So you see, so the point that I'm trying to make is so a is the sensor is the sensor array or artificial array. And this is going to so be, it's going to

12:37
So the morphism between A and B, let's call this a simulated physics.

12:55
And then we'll call and then we'll call the the morphism from A to C as real physics.

13:10
And then, we will call.

13:19
See, a four-dimensional see is it's kind of funny actually, the four dimensional makes it. It's funny because you're I'm putting the letters C4D together and it references, a 3D program, but it's not intentional. So see C40 signal processing.

13:50
And B is is also 40 signal processing.

14:09
Okay, so then we

14:18
So then we to say the transformation between B and D is

14:37
Patterns pattern, save other parents, gaining.

14:49
And,

14:57
With with render.

15:04
Rendered inner mappings.

15:14
And then we have motor outputs.

15:35
Motor or signal outputs motorcycle outposts.

15:47
And then over here we have and scaling where render in our mappings.

16:10
So, these are functionally.

16:19
And so perfect.

16:27
So frankly asking market

16:36
Functionally. So, morphic processes

16:51
Right? So that's positive. So when an oscillator kicked other oscillators, some of them become synchronized and some of them become decent eyes and it so into like you're intuitive sense of what's going to happen is just not going to lead you to the right answer. You're just seeing like, yeah it's like it's it's hard to imagine what's going to happen because some stuff is slowing down and some stuff is speeding up and I guess it's kind of like the what's happening to atmosphere right.

17:22
Now some some parts of the earth are getting colder and some at times and some are getting hotter and it's confusing to people and they don't like we have all these increasingly chaotic climate events and it looks like the climate is the synchronized DC synchronizing further. So we have more extreme heat and more extreme cold.

17:45
And it kind of looks like there's a DC synchronization process happening in a climate terms of extreme weather events but it is, it might be it it. If the thing is like, there could be something counterintuitive happening in that these different systems are oscillating systems in the weather. And eventually, the the wild divergences and weather events will slow down.

18:24
And they all be in, in the weather will become oscillating together. That's that's like that is provided that the sources of new energy to the atmosphere stops and otherwise the perturbation, the tribulations might continue indefinitely, you'd have to actually stop introducing new energy to the atmosphere to to support to eventually settle towards an equilibrium.

19:02
But simply adding in new energy to the oscillators in hearse assignment is going to cause Lots of cascading energy, transformations on all the different weather systems that really that are there. I think they're driven by the influx of new energy. So we can say, I mean, I guess the argument is that it is about methane and carbon dioxide but more generally speaking those are like these are weird.

19:41
Maybe could consider those as the carriers of new energy into the climate ecosystem. So it's, it's a pick them as spikes in oscillating system, which is, which is kind of, it's kind of interesting because it's kind of, like, well, by removing energy from the atmosphere and regardless, of whether the car it's carbon or methane, or I mean, it might be, it might be that those are the only two options.

20:18
But, I mean there, maybe there's a third option for something that could be removed from the atmosphere. That would cause the sort of the atmosphere to calm down. So we wouldn't have high experience and temperatures dreams. And but I mean it's so like, okay so imagine another way for imagine like what the weather just weighs more and therefore it bounces harder between the screens and I'm imagining like that is too much just too much out there but like yeah.

20:59
But like if we, if we could, if we could change the oscillations in the atmosphere, I mean if it's seems like maybe that maybe we can argue that the osmosis are being set. But set by the molecules and chemicals and gases of the gases of the methane fast and the cotton, and the carbon gas that is creating sort of heaviness in the air or an also.

21:26
The Tory power is like, it's like you really eat really seeing many, cyclones with every camp with every gas that gets released, because it consists of, you know, first of all, atoms, right, atoms that are spinning in way that causes, you know, increased collisions. I'm just trying to imagine like, you know, aside from capturing carbon and aside from capturing method.

22:00
You know, like so like let's say that all the human being started and that and the planets atmosphere moved towards equilibrium, even if that's like ultimate equilibrium isn't plausible. Let's say this, it moves forward equilibrium. And then so the total sum of all the temperatures might be warm that.

22:22
I'm going to say. Yeah. It's like yeah. All the fish in the sea. You're gonna get wiped out from the heat and plants and the land over burn to the plants. Can't can't even grow.

22:39
So what I'm trying to understand is, as I'm going back to the book scene and I'm trying to understand. Did he say that that asked later was like a photocopier or like a met like a magnifier? Because that's what I think. That's what I thought he said and then and it's like the principal to how even like a photocopier works or how image scaling works.

23:03
And I'm now I'm like well wait a second I I'm not sure that that's what he said and I'm like, wait a second, how could scaling then? You know, like what? Exactly. Like, it might like if the basis of my idea isn't here in this book, then why does it work?

23:27
And what is the basis of my idea? Then if it's not that, how could it be a misunderstanding and still work? So I'm like rereading chapter 2 in chapter 3 to see if I can figure out what would real story was like the patterns in the game of life that grow over time, oscillators like they absorb other oscillators as the many oscillators observe other oscillators into in when they like it's it's a it's a characteristic description or viewpoint on what happens when two oscillators become synchronized.

24:12
It's sort of like looks like they become one. It looks like they emerge their they've merged together and so like you can imagine like you know when patterns come together in the game of life or appear to start appear to club together that is sort of like a growing configuration.

24:31
That eventually stuff becomes really in the game of life events, that becomes really clumpy together. Well, I mean, I should say that that there's a lot of different possible outcomes in the game of life, but but seeing clumps emerge, all over the place is up is pretty typical, I guess.

24:52
So so in the book saying, how order emerges from chaos, what he says is if you if you have the aces that basically a different. So a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point the whole system doesn't reach oscillation. Right. But he's saying that that points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle that bad point moves to a most from one oscillator to another.

25:17
And and now no absorption happens in that one, in that one point. And so, in effect, basically that point has to be ignored from the actual process of, okay. It's it's like it's like the actual set of what of points that are absorbable. Can't include that. So the actual set like excludes.

25:51
So let's say that you had three neurons, right? So see. It's made of this ticket. Let's take a look. It's to say it's it's it's three plus, one bad point, right? So the bad point moves around. So that's there's four neurons and or there's four oscillators, okay? Four oscillators.

26:15
And they're each kicking the other oscillators in turn. And that point is like a is like a box that moves that never gets absorbed. Whereas the other three neurons in one interval of time are have good points and when they, when they kick the other neurons, that don't have bad points.

26:39
The, the the point is being absorb. And so, so the argument then is like, well, basically you have a smaller area now for the oscillator, so the oscillator. So that, so the bad point removes that the is removed from, from the area. So, the fourth neuron is, which is not, which is, which is, you know, sometimes it contains a good point and sometimes it contains a bad point, but it's like, there are three good points.

27:16
And so, the area of the oscillatory, pattern is three good points, and the fourth point, the bad point, that's just ignored. So so, so that that I mean, I guess that implies that because three good points will reach will reach equilibrium with the with the fat point. If there's just one of them I guess.

27:44
I don't know. But like, I am a little bit confused by that. But like yeah. So like, you know, it's weird because in the example of of a, like a is always fixed zeros. So that is kind of like a bad starting point sort of at several titch, but the others, but, but it doesn't affect the rest of the oscillator from eventually coming into equilibrium.

28:10
But it's, it's weird to say, okay now. Well, wait a second. What if you have two bad points? So that that are, you know, permanently like in that bad are in polar oscillations that don't get absorbed, right? It's it's, it's weird because you're kind of, there is kind of an argument that if it if an oscillator cannot, if ester has a bad point in the energy, cannot be absorbed.

28:48
You know, by that, by that oscillator for that interval. Then it's, you know, in each interval, it transfers on it and it maintains the same amount of energy as if as if as if it wasn't there. So what is there in terms of what is there are? The is like you have an area of that is only represented by the good points or for the phase changes, paste, changing areas.

29:24
And so the phase changing area is a subset of the larger possible set, if there, if the whole, if the whole set of possible of potential areas for points was, was filled with good points. Then you'd have an area of you know, four points. And if there's a bad point in there that you have an area of three points and in the bad point, to can't take up any of the area of the secret synchronized, oscillators for those for those three points and I guess in and theory the other three points could could eventually match the oscillation of the theoretical back point.

30:12
I guess that's that's the best part of living excuse about. But what surprised me is now that the, you know, he's okay. So what I want to understand is how the, how having a smaller set, a smaller area is actually like the and large function of the photocopier. That's better, when I understand.

30:36
So he's saying that the transfer that the operation from before to after works like a larger function of the photocopier The idea is that don't understand why he's saying that all sets, get expanded in area, but it's, but it's like, it's like, Here. Okay? So the argument is that if you have a terrible point that leads to an oscillation not reaching equilibrium, then what happens is the somehow the oscillation by itself is like the enlarged function, wherever a point in oscillator becomes larger.

31:26
So I have to understand this. But but that would mean that the the bad point becomes larger and that it's area becomes larger and that is it seems like a paradox. But the so, so the argument is that the inhibit and inhibit inhibited sat is like, photocopier because it is enlarging.

31:53
The effect of a single neuron to several neurons simultaneously. That would be like taking a positive pixel positive, light pixel and capturing its negative light as a difference. So while the neuron is faster, the oscillating set becomes slower and but therefore it becomes distinct becomes stinked from the rest of the oscillator.

32:23
So becomes a distinct pattern that the rest of the oscillator encounters but it's a magnified pattern. So you start off with a small pattern and that one pattern which is this is just a single neuron firing and it becomes a larger pattern because a single neuron causes a set of neurons to become inhibited or for one signal to be sort of like, passing the charge to a lot of others.

32:51
And then, for some of the others that it passes to, to fire randomly, the ones that fired together. I'm sorry. The ones that were inhibited together are there. Well, they're these synchronized from the ones that didn't that didn't inhibit together. I guess they're their time has been their but here's the other interesting thing is now like maybe the neurons and that set that we're inhibited together are going to basically find out that the next time they fire their in sync with their intemporal sync with with new neurons, right?

33:39
So there so their temporal scene has been shifted from being connected to some neurons now being connected to other neurons. But in any case, I'm like I'm suggesting if there's a magnifying effect this similar to an empty to the, or the similar, to the enlarging effect of a photocopier, I mean, I think that the other the other foot to drop is that we do see fractal patterns at small scales becoming factor patterns at large scales.

34:11
And so, I think that there has to be a process for which small small scale patterns can become large scale patterns, but also, how large scale patterns, can can also become small scale, patterns, again. So, it has to be reverse process. Also, I think or or



53:00
It's it's really it's not just the, the head position and the orientation, but it's also the incoming vets from the head position orientation. So your expectation of what you would see, when you turn to the right here. Here here your micro expectations and your visual cortex, but that's gonna help should help in the rendering process for for combining your vision.

53:30
With your head movement, with your head orientation and your head's position. So that you are so that you all all three of these things are helping your brain to complete the picture to your right or to your left. When you look over to your left of what you're seeing and, you know, I so I asked John Carmack, why isn't this again being used to write for each frame of a VR perspective, given the head position orientation stallion render the next frame.

54:00
So the John Carmack responded on Twitter. He said there is an emerging field of of neural rendering but it is very resource intensive. It's not close to being commercially deployed and and and that's a great. It's great response. I think about the fact that the AI, like there's a huge jump on in terms of how much AI processing can be done on engine devices.

54:27
A lot of the AI processing that you see with the style, again, demo, these are done on massive multi, GPU systems in some instances or and in some of them on, you know, at least like a GPU, that's like, you know, like an RTX, 2080 or 390, at least one really powerful to GPU.

54:49
That's a lot more than what you're within, what's in your phone essentially, but you can see like, there's a huge, there's a huge leap. And if you look at the, the pixel 5 versus the pixel 6, there is a huge leap in the in the TPU processing core being added to on that phone.

55:07
It's going to have much better voice, recognition. Much more accurate voice recognition it. The AAI can can be used for there. Is this in 2020, Nvidia released an article about how they had. They released the technology basically, the deep learning with Jenner with with guns or generative adversarial networks.

55:32
They the story with they can reduce demand with required for sending video that and then include sending video to VR headset. This would be sending a frame to your headset and in that the bandwidth required is, is reduced by 90% because you can send a lower resolution video and then essentially upscale it with a neural network when it's received.

55:54
And so, you know, the trend in phones is yet Google's like, okay, let me put. Let's put a TPU inside the phone and that's gonna help with his voice recognition. And when we, when we all have these like tensor core processing. Here's in our headset their beer classes, we're gonna have next generation air performance but that and so that.

56:17
So yes that improves voice recognition but also imp hand tracking it. Introduce it improves position, tracking It improves 3D, semantics segmentation so that the device can recognize. Oh, this is the table. This is the chair and then it can transform the chair in into so that it has a different pattern now.

56:37
And but at the same dimension so you can like you can skin your chair while you're looking at it and it is a different chair but it does the same dimensions. So you can still interact with it. The same way, it just looks just textures. Look different textures and materials and you know, and this is also gonna bump up the video resolution of what's on the device I guess similar to how it was called, you know, like like soup, like super scaling, or do you know, anything, or real-time ray tracing is it got those products are all similar and in the sense that They the new network is basically trained on high resolution images so that when you feed it low resolution images.

57:34
It can it can remove the noise or improve the image fidelity. It can again upscale a low noise, you resolution to a higher, resin noise image and you not you may not get your. It's it's not that you're gonna get more details. I think is that you might get some clarity, you might get some.

58:05
It's, it's like, I mean, I guess it's similar to a, the enlarged function on a photocopier, right? But it's sort of like cleans up the noise around the, you know, around the it sort of like the AI can infer some details. That can improve, you know, between like interpolate.

58:33
It's like, yeah, if you like if you made everything made every pixel bigger in the array, but then you interpolated what what is what or you made every pixel bigger but then you made every pixel smaller and you interpreted the likely connections between different pixels. Like if you good classify the image and interpolate, what must be there.

58:55
If you could feel that and just a little bit then perhaps perhaps you could produce an image of higher quality. But that it's sort of, it's sort of doing that by inferring, things that are that we're not there in the original image. And so that's a bit tricky, but that's like that.

59:19
It's like, it's like, if you have, if you saw a tail and you saw a cat, but there was a pole in front of the tail in the cat. Well, you might infer that the tail belongs to that cat. And and the machine AI we might went, we'll be able to teach it to.

59:38
It's also infer that the tail belongs to attack. But there is, at the very least, the remote chance that, that tail belongs to another cat and there's some sort of optical illusion happening. So sometimes inferences can be wrong. And so like like and if an image is designed in such a way that that it could mislead a human being about the, the truth of events in that space.

01:00:07
It could also mislead a computer about the truth of events in that space. So you know, the computer might fall to optical illusions. Basically. However, you know, it's it's like that is sort of like the point of or the it's like the value of moving around the object and seeing it from different angles because in essence, by having more angles on what's on the object of.

01:00:40
It's being observed, there's sort of a sort of like, you know, like tomographic construction of of a model that is robust enough to resist, you know, the model being the the model, you know. Like over like overfitting when you trying to take a neural network that doesn't have these sort of capacity to understand the complexity of the model that it's perceiving.

01:01:15
And it is. So it forms starting back in conclusions about what's what's there, right. And anyway, so there's there's overfitting and but the idea that ideally like, you know, there's so then, you know, there's this gradient descent, which, you know, maybe you can help sort of fixed overfitting problem.

01:01:40
If we did somehow, you know, correct if it but but I think that, you know, when you're, when you're dealing with 3D and when you have a neural network that has sort of like sufficiently high fidelity in terms of each node and being able to have and have the ability to correct itself.

01:02:02
And so what I'm actually guessing in the brain is that and you know when a neuron fires to its to its adjacent to its two is extremely the external set that it inhibits a set of of its external effects. So it in some cases, inhibiting it. In some cases, it's exciting other than neurons.

01:02:30
And in some cases it's adding charge and in some cases it's adding, it's it's it's opening more potassium receptors which don't inhibit the following cell but have been. And but have the effect of changing the action potential shape of another cell so that the the gate of the action potential opens more slow.

01:02:55
So basically like the firing of one cell is changing the face, the phase states of a large group of cells. Simultaneous, in terms of, you know, exciting there's there's a set of cells that get excited to go past stressful that may fire and there's a set of cells that they just get a bump towards reaching their threshold.

01:03:21
There's a set of cells that basically they lose a bump because I'm sorry, not, it's not that they lose a bump. It's that they they're so there. Like if you open the calcium channels, if you open the sodium channels, much faster than the potassium channel. So like there's more soap, more calcium channels open and and very few.

01:03:50
Potassium channels are open times at the same time, then that means the rate of potassium filling the sack. Because it's it's the potassium that that repolarizes the the the body of the neuron after the sodium depolarizes. The body of the nerve by causing a separation of charges. So if fewer potassium channels are opened, then that means that the action potential event is going to take longer to close.

01:04:21
So duration of it is going to be longer or and and that will affect how many vessels get really. So a longer duration or longer duration I so I'm still trying to figure out if the longer duration of the action potential means of phasic. First, I think it does like a longer duration of the action potential, represents a high frequency, phasing first.

01:04:55
I think. I mean at least it implies that the calcium channels opened up a lot faster than the potassium channels because more were opened more more sodium channels. Got opened in fewer, potassium channels. So there's that. Yeah, it's hard to. So, yeah. Harder. I'm my mind around them out there but so but but you know, I guess we're gonna see the tensor processing unit which which is different from the graphics processing unit because it just sort of like the tensor processing unit focuses on matrix multiplications, which is, which is if you try, if you're trying like, if each nodes, if each nodes output is a vector and a deep learning, it's a vector and intensive space.

When you doing deep learning then, then it would help to have a tensor processing unit. That's just focused on processing vectors or processing and vectors is you know processing vectors is processing matrices, right? So if you just focus, you know, the entire GPU, TPU thing to focus to specialize and doing matrix mat and multiplying agencies.

01:06:24
Then you are at the point where you can do deep learning really faster. So I think that the logical trajectory is that our all of our home devices from our phones, to our AR glasses are a beer headsets to our tablets in our computers. They're going to have much more powerful TPUs in them in the future because of the advantages for improving.

01:06:52
All of these, you know, technology experiences like I am using Google's. I'm gonna get a pixel 6 right away because I I make a lot of use out of Google recorder, which is not was only on the Pixel 5 and unfortunately, the actors these and isn't that great? I mean, the compared to what?

01:07:21
What I believe it could be. I mean, there's there are times when I'm like, looking at the real-time transcript of of myself, you know, speaking out loud and I'm like, I, you know, it struggles with, you know, when I'm talking about neurophysics neuroscience, I'm talking about, you know, really, you know, biological concepts dendrites synapses, you know, right now it seems to be doing really well.

01:07:56
I like watching it. See. Cow modular. It's an accident. It's about cow. Module and like cow modular.

01:08:11
See calcium. They have potassium sodium. Okay, so but in any case it's it's gonna be doing well today, I feel like it's been getting better over time and maybe it has been learning my voice. But and but it will be nice, it will be nice to experience like, you know, and even more perfected version.

01:08:41
And I wonder if like like even if I like playback some of the earlier conversations in which like oh yeah, that's like this is obviously messing up the voice tracking voice tracking is obviously messing up and it's guessing that I'm saying things that are different from what I'm actually saying and to like see it get it right?

01:09:05
The second time around by playing back, the old recordings would would just be really interesting. I I would love to see that. So I I really am excited about the pixel 6 for that reason. Is just having a much more powerful on device, AI just is going to really open up with the devices cable with phones were capable of, but it, but so like, yes.

01:09:30
So like the idea that, you know, you're oculus quest is basically gonna have like a really powerful TPU. Maybe you're oculus quests. Three your octopus quest, four? I don't know. But it's gonna be like at some point you're gonna you know, there's there's already in the the chipset that's in it right now.

01:09:50
It's already designed to be really good at doing AI, you know. Basically, it hasn't specialized given it already for that, but we'd love to sleep in this and obviously next generation checks I can do a lot more. Here's a lot more precision across multiple AI driven features you know the hand tracking
