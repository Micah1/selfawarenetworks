(dendrite, cortex) You are a fractal of functional isomorphic systems

Imagine a picture of tree branch with branching limbs
then a human arm with branching fingers
then a neuron with a branching dendrite
finally the optic nerve and the retina where the hand might be
one more that is the layer 6 pyramidal cells and the interneurons connecting the top of the neocortex on the inside of your skull.
