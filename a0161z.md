I mentioned that Valve will have EEG and Eyetracking in a future VR headset

AR and VR headsets from Microsoft,
Facebook, Apple, Google, Vive and more will be pointing cameras at the eyes, mouth, hands for motion capture, to reconstruct digital avatars

And so we could potentially use the camera with eeg to predict intention and emotion

Some companies are combing eye tracking from a sensor mounted on a laptop to try to predict intention and emotion

this combination of sensors might help us identify eye blinks that are intentional,

My 2012 eeg project attempted to use eeg signals to drive changes to light and sound patterns presented to the user to attempt to change their eeg patterns further and created a sort of feedback loop between the person, their brainwaves, the computer, and the lights and sounds

This was an attempt to create a self reflective meditative therapeutic experience for our participants
