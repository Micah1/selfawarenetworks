# 1. Summary:

The speaker reflects on childhood memories of being impressed by relatives who demonstrated fascinating experiments with magnetism and electricity, such as the behavior of circuits and safety lessons involving electric shocks. They recount lessons about physical properties, like why objects don’t pass through each other despite being mostly empty space, sparking a curiosity about the physical world.

The narrative transitions to musings on physics and computer graphics. The speaker draws parallels between "marching cubes" (a technique in 3D modeling) and the limitations of physical particles, exploring the relationship between phase, amplitude, and particle interactions. They hypothesize that particles like electrons and photons exhibit behaviors tied to oscillatory dynamics, phase velocities, and spatial configurations, which govern interactions and phenomena like the double-slit experiment.

Further, they delve into spacetime concepts, theorizing that the expansion of time and space enables particle movement, with mass influencing spacetime intervals. This analogy extends to the gravitational effects of oscillating particles, likening gravity to an elevator's upward force. They speculate that oscillatory forces underpin fundamental phenomena, from gravitational fields to light’s interaction with matter.

Finally, they link observation in experiments to oscillatory behavior in the human body, such as how retinal cells react to light. They propose that both physical and observational processes warp spacetime in subtle ways, illustrating a cosmic interconnectedness where everything operates as oscillators influencing one another.

I think when you're a kid, you go through so many different, I think it's that relatives
want to impress you, right?
Especially the male relatives want to impress the kids.
The female ones do too, but I don't know.
I think that in my experience, I was really impressed with magnetism, when I think it
was the grandfather on my father's side was really into magnets and electricity and he
would show us some of the really weird things with the movement of magnets and the movement
of electricity.
I remember kids have to be taught that if they grab onto something that is electric
with both hands, there's going to be a circuit that forms that causes them to continue to
grip to close their grip around whatever they're grasping.
In theory, it's difficult to let go if you're caught in a circuit.
They're like, okay, well, you can try the circuit out, but try it with the back of your
hand.
So your hand doesn't try to grip it, and then I remember trying it, and of course the shock
is like, yeah, your hand moves away really fast, like it moves away from fire really
fast.
When you're taught that the stove is really hot, you get kind of close to it, but then
you jerk your hand away, right?
So I don't remember very well what would happen when we experimented with the shock.
I mean, that's weird, it was such a long time ago, but yeah, I just remember that we weren't
supposed to put our hands around something electric, and you weren't supposed to stick
your tongue on a frozen pole because it would get stuck, and so there was this long list
of, you know, I remember talking to my dad at his work, and he was interested in the
problem.
If most of your hand is empty space, why is it that it doesn't go through another object?
It's like if your hand, on a particle level, your hand is kind of like a cloud, kind of,
if most of it is empty space, most of the time, why doesn't that cloud go through it?
And I do kind of like, I like the, I like to think about a marching cube, which is like,
a marching cube is something used in computer graphics, and it has, it's really good for
creating instance voxels, which is something that's done in WebExR, you have voxels, and
you can instance voxels, and so that means you can have a ton of marching cubes, and
this can help simplify 3D graphics, right, so you can have a lot of detail in your 3D
graphics.
The thing is that with a marching cube, you're in a situation where there is a fundamental
limit to the, like it's not, it's not going to give you exact curves, right, that you
might want in a real geometric representation, but it's interesting to think about a marching
cube, because it's like any of the planes that make up a marching cube can be activated,
which means that it, there's a, there's a, there's, there are several different ways
that it can appear to, to the human eye, based upon which parts of it are activated, and it
creates a sort of like, a very generic sort of like, low cost shape for computer graphics,
but I think it's interesting to think of the marching cube in terms of physics, because
there are some strange limitations, like, you know, about particles they can't take
up the same space, right, but they do merge, you know, in a sense, like I think that if
you have two electrons that are, have the same phase, that they can merge, but they
merge in a way that they, they begin to oscillate each other in time, because of the same phase,
and if you, and so my, the same idea is like, okay, so if you have a neutron and a positron
and an electron together, they can't merge because they have different phases, it's kind
of like, these are, they have different phases, different phase patterns, different phase
speeds, it's really the, the different phase velocities, right, that's the difference
between, I would say this, that's why a neutron and a positron and an electron do not merge,
it's because they have different, they have different frequency patterns, and, and they
have different amplitudes, so I would say that because light has a larger volume than
an electron, that it, it's, I mean, I'm just saying, I'm just speculating that, that light
could be, could have a higher amplitude, and the, and higher amplitude would be associated
with a greater area, um, yeah, that's weird, um, so the idea is that the electron has a
smaller area, and it's potentially as fast as light, um, it's, it's weird because it
should be faster than light, in a sense, like the phase of, like, if we have, if really,
if there's, like, um, what I'm imagining is that there's, um, is that there's a relationship
between phase and amplitude, such that if a particle's phase increases, um, its frequency
increases, then it's going to be, uh, smaller and faster, well, it's going to be smaller
and faster, and, um, it's, it's potentially going to be smaller and faster, right, so
I would think that, I, yeah, I don't know, it's, it's, that, it's not completely decided
for me, but, um, the reason why light might be faster, in some instances, would be as
if, um, you had, um, it, it's, it's, okay, so maybe, so maybe what I'm thinking is that,
um, the speed of light is, like, the speed of light is, is, is, like, um, hmm, I don't
know, hmm, the constant, right, because it is a constant, right, the speed of light
is a constant speed, the ideal speed of light is a constant speed, right, because light
can be bent and, like, can be slowed down, so the ideal speed of light, and, is, is,
and so, what I'm, what I'm, so what I've argued previously is that space, um, space,
uh, marches forward in time because the, because particles, particles are moving in the direction
of expanding time, particles are moving in the direction of expanding time, and because
expanding time is creating more adjacent opportunities for movement and particles, the particle movement
is fundamentally chaotic, so if particle movement is fundamentally chaotic, then there's an
equal chance it's going to go in every possible direction, but in the direction of space that's
excited because it's moving faster and moving through time, and because it's, like, layered
with multiple particles, like, if both sides can condense it, there are basically more
chances for the particle to move in the direction of, uh, hot space, or oscillating space, or
faster space, or, um, expanding time, and so the expansion of time is caused by, um,
by particle masses, right, and that, that, um, expansion time, you should think of it
as time is, like, uh, it's, it's, like, it's fourth dimensional, but in this, right, but
it's, but it could be fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth dimensional, I mean, the idea is that
it's just, um, advancing forward in time, and, I mean, like, um, it's, when I'm saying
it's, like, expanding in time is, like, expanding in space, and then now there's additional
ways for particles to tumble, causes, it's gonna cause particle movement, right, and
you could say that expanding time is a movement, right, and, um, but you could also see it
as a configuration, right, so it's a movement from the, you say, expanding time is a movement
from the perspective of, um, expanding time is a movement, um, of, of, of, of, of, of,
of, of, of, of.
It's like, okay, it's like, imagine it has space as three dimensions, right, and, but
the three dimensions are only accomplished because the three dimensions space time, oh
shit okay so imagine that the the atoms are polygons and the and the galaxies
are polygons but then there's lines between them so like imagine that each
oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time it's creating 3d space time
but but but but in actuality it's creating intervals of 3d space time so
the interval of 3d space time increases with mass or decreases with
frequency or I should say increases with increasing mass or decreases with
increasing frequency
so it's kind of like so I guess in a manner of speaking it's kind of like
a knot in space or a traffic jam in space where a whole bunch of particles
collided to create traffic jams that resulted in atoms right so it's like
random particle collisions cause atoms and atoms become molecules and basically
these particle collisions are oscillations merging with oscillations and
these are oscillations in space time and as the oscillations merge they
effectively combine or they act as one which which means that anything that
encounters that that body of oscillators ripples through the entire body of
oscillators so they act as a combined sensor an information configuration
sensor but but also a transmitter and the transmission between one oscillator
and another causes space to bend between them but also causes lines to form
between them these lines are particle lines but they can they can they can the
particle lines in the in in the direction of each of the points in the
points are made out of oscillators and but then all the points that are not in
between two of the oscillators two of the great oscillators are going to be doing
the opposite thing where there's an increase in in traffic that is not moving towards the
oscillators and this is like in the devil's foot experiment how there are
lots of bands of really brightly lit
were partners like lots of bands were particles landed because the configuration
space was such that they had a probability of landing closer to to
certain points that reflect I think those point I think those points like they
kind of represent like like vertical lines between oscillators right and and so
you're gonna have like strobe you have strobe lines basically that that emerge
from each oscillator like emerge from a planet so the planet so a planet like
earth it's gonna have strobe lines that are vertical lines where it's pulling
together vertical particle traffic but counterbalance but that is going to
create a counterbalance of of push with horizontal particle traffic that's in
between these vertical lines and so in between these vertical lines all the
energy is going to be going to the lines and away from these dark spots and so
you're gonna you're gonna see basically in a situation where there's a where
there's a sufficiently stronger tractor such as an oscillating planet you're
going to see basically like particle lanes that are oriented towards the the
large spherical large dense spherical attractor particle lanes and but that
can but conversely that's like but that's the equivalent of like if you have
light and light is sending energy forward it's like okay so think of the
elevator example so like having gravity on earth having like having gravity on
earth it's like being an elevator shooting straight up at a certain
velocity and so the elevator is like this force it's shooting up beneath you
like some particles are being pushed underneath underneath your feet they're
being pushed upwards right and I'm in it and so I'm basically saying that that
the force of the oscillations is creating the gravitational force that feels
like an elevator where your particles being pulled down as if they're being
pushed force so in the double set experiment you're actually firing photons
you're firing photons so there's force where you're coming from the photon
emitter and that force it's coming from the photon emitter that's fine firing
the the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an
oscillating an oscillating mass the same way that an elevator is going to be
equivalent to to gravity on earth and so that is going that the double set
experiment itself is interfering with the experiment because as it fires like
photons it is basically is basically creating a gravitational field that is
warping space time in such a way that it's creating like the same sort of
vertical lines that an oscillator would create but creating them from a beam
right and so they're fanned out and so you see like this that's basically this
wave pattern is in the double set experiment and
so it is really interesting how basically how every oscillator every
oscillator's configuration is based on its interactions with everything else
and everything in the universe is an oscillator so let's say that we're we
have to put the observer in the in the room of the double set experiment if an
observation is going to happen right and that then that means that a certain
amount of activity in the ratna is going to receive the signal it's going to
receive the signal and then it's going to
it's going it's gonna some of the oscillators are gonna fire and they're
gonna cause lots of inhibitions in the ratna so only a small only small parts
of the right now are gonna react I mean the whole redness can react but it's
gonna react like where you have small parts are gonna fire in each moment and
they're gonna inhibit the rest of it so you're gonna have like basically like
the sparsum distributed pattern happening in the retina as light it's I'm
guessing but it's basically like as so light is going to interact with the with
light-sensitive proteins and that activity is going to generate the first
action potentials in the first race basically it's that's that's the the
rays the first array the sensor the sensors the light-sensitive proteins and
then we have the you know the but but the basic principle is that they have a
receptive field and the receptive field is also an oscillator and so you have
okay so let's say that you have the force of light is creating gravitational
force in your eye as you human body the human body and in the point of your
observation when you observe something that also has an oscillatory force
because it's like it's like your whole body and brain are like are like combining
configuration space and so there is a sort of space-time warping happening
between an observation which is which is a pattern that's being encoded
somewhere and and the the powerful beam of light that's being beams through
