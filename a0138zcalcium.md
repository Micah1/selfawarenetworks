# "Dendritic spine morphology regulates calcium-dependent synaptic weight change"
"Dendritic spines act as biochemical computational units and must adapt their responses according to their activation history. Calcium influx acts as the first signaling step during postsynaptic activation and is a determinant of synaptic weight change. Dendritic spines also come in a variety of sizes and shapes. To probe the relationship between calcium dynamics and spine morphology, we used a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of calcium dynamics in idealized and realistic geometries. We show that despite the stochastic nature of the various calcium channels, receptors, and pumps, spine size and shape can modulate calcium dynamics and subsequently synaptic weight updates in a deterministic manner. Through a series of exhaustive simulations and analyses, we found that the calcium dynamics and synaptic weight change depend on the volume-to-surface area of the spine. The relationships between calcium dynamics and spine morphology identified in idealized geometries also hold in realistic geometries, suggesting that there are geometrically determined deterministic relationships that may modulate synaptic weight change."

# "Plasticity and Learning Algorthms in Models of the Single Neuron" August 25th, 2022 at Numenta.
You should probably watch this at least twice. It's an hour long but I spent most a day watching & rewatching it, looking up papers from it. Really good work. Link to Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmk3xnojKU This section of my notes is what I wrote down during & after the video today.

"The gradient clusteron: A model neuron that learns to solve classification tasks via dendritic nonlinearities, structural plasticity, and gradient descent

"The Clusteron" (1991) is a thought experiment and a computer simulation designed to explore how non-linear biologically plausible learning might happen.

The activation is that synapses active input times the sum of the weighted inputs of all the other synapses within a certain region (Di) a synaptic cluster that fires together. The idea is to find correlations between multiple synapses, that are each detecting coincident firing.

The NMDA Spike slide:

The super linearity voltage dependence of the NMDA receptor creates a huge spike when two synapses close together on the same branch are activated at the same time. The voltage is not the sum of the voltage generated by each synapse, instead the voltage is like the multiplication of both synaptic voltages, its much larger. 
Its a distance dependent effect, if you put both synapses on separate branches and activate them simultaneously you again get the linear sum.

The multiplicative nonlinearity means that the clusteron learns correlations. I think it points to the idea that cells have a mechanism for learning surface side, or branch specific correllations, a way of detecting spatially where information is coming from. 

However it causes one to think how can this spatial (nonlinear correlation information be passed along between cells. Of course the activations will be from sodium channels, and the inactivations from potassium channels, and that is how the waveform of the AP is shaped.

This allows a neuron to make topographic or spatial detections, because spatial detections from synapses close to each other on the same branch have a multiplicative effect, meaning they are more likely to fire.

It seems like this process could lend itself to the idea of topographic pattern tomography, the learning of surfaces, textures, and making mental maps for concepts, especially related to art, visual design.

Another idea from the clusteron is that before learning there may be no deliberate structure to the synaptic arrangement, after learning there are regions of synapses that are associated with positive patterns are much more strongly activated (the clustering effect multiplies signals and perhaps in biology causes receptor/synapse growth in that area so neurons will grow synaptic clusters in certain sections that increase the odds the neuron will fire in response to certain patterns, in this way a growing synaptic cluster.)

I think this work shows the value of the fast rearrangement of synapses like AMPA receptors that we see in the brain. 

Note from the video: Logistic regression and non-linear clustering are both similar in performance when they have the same number of parameters.

The G-Clusteron can solve the exclusive XOR problem. If I remember correctly the Perceptron could not, and that led to one of the AI Winters.

Slide: A Fixed Point - Learning Rate Framework for Modelling: Calcium-Based Plasticity Predicts weight-dependent Synaptic Changes.

Molecular Mechanism of Plasticity Slide

Synaptic Potentiation (LTP) Calcium enters the cell through the NMDA receptor (through voltage gated calcium channels) it interacts with CaMKII and AMPA receptors are shuttled to the synaptic spine? You have increased conductance & increased synaptic strength
doi: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301559

With Synaptic depression Calcium comes into the cell, it interacts with Calcineurin PP1, and AMPA receptors are removed from the spine.

Both responses start with calcium entry into the cell, so the question is how the does the cell know what to do with the calcium.

Next slide

"The calcium control hypothesis: one rule to rule them all"

everything depends on the concentration of calcium in the post synaptic spine. If you have not very much calcium nothing happens, if you have a medium amount of calcium you have depression, and if you have a lot of calcium you have potentiation.

Hebbian learning rule with calcium, if you have two thresholds, one for LTD, and one for LTP, then "fire apart wire apart, or fire out of sync loose your link" is accomplished when the the lower LTD threshold is crossed but not the higher LTP, but if you have coincidence firing from multiple receptors then you can stack the calcium to reach the higher LTP threshold, and that gives you

"my neighbor hetero deconstructing the mechanism underlying heterosynaptic plasticity

it means if you have 1 synapse that is in an LTD state, and two on each side that have an LTP state that is Homosynaptic LTD, Heterosynaptic LTP

If there is an LTP state in the middle with two LTD neighbors that is homosynaptic LTP heterosynaptic LTD the opposite of the previous state

if the two neighboring cells have the same state then you have both homosynaptic in the middle has matching heterosynaptic neighbors

the second image implies that a depolarization of one synapse might spill over to the next synapse to create a chain reaction depolarization.

In Heterosynaptic Plasticity the VGCC receptor plays a big role:

VGCC means voltage gated calcium channels, when one post synaptic membrane depolarizes the current will depolarize other synapses, but the NMDA & AMPA receptors of those neighboring synapses won't open, because they only open in response to neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft above, but the VGCC will open, so the synapse that wasn't triggered can still depolarize,

Can partial Heterosynaptic Plasticity cause synapses that didn't depolarize with Heterosynaptic Plasticity to undergo LTD threshold depolarization, enough to trigger endocytosis or exocytosis? Sort of like boosting it's proximal fellow players, and burning it's distal benchwarmers?

How much fractal correlation and how much causation exists between the slow frequency at the synaptic scale and the slow potentials at the soma scale?


Going back to the idea of glutamate synapses having four levels of conductance, and the idea that 0,1,2, or 3 vesicles can be released, and the idea that there are four types of spiking, inhibited, tonic, phasic, high phasic (which could actually be bursting, if you think of how a big voltage can double the frequency of a wave). I would guess that biological computation is base 4. 

So we are talking about two thresholds, one for LTD and a higher one for LTP,
and I have imagined that the low frequency LTD might correlate with the antispike, or the slow wave potential or the DC potential, and that LTP might correlate with a phasic spike.

but then high phasic spikes (which could manifest as bursting I'm not sure but it makes sense) 

It seems perhaps that each of the 4 thresholds. 

So what I might look for is evidence of differentiated synaptic behavior at 4 different levels. I think by default there are 3 because LTD & LTP are differentiated from the baseline which might be no calcium entering the synapse. And if my hypothesized high phasic is actually bursting then maybe there is a study on how synapses respond to burst firing

The idea I am thinking about is that burst firing is the event that will cause Heterosynaptic Plasticity: a single synapse to fill up adjacent synapses & dendritic branches will fill up

looking at the slide Asymmetric Voltage Attenuation in Dendrites

With a high phasic NMDA spike the voltage spill over might  induce heterosynaptic plasticity in all of the locations that are distal to the input but not at the locations proximal to the input?, 

Maybe burst firing is what triggers coincident NMDA spikes which triggers heterosynaptic plasticity

I decided to look up the terms Heterosynaptic plasticity & Homosynaptic plasticity on wikipedia.

"Maintaining Long-Term Changes
In order to stabilize LTP and make it last longer periods of time, new proteins supporting this change are synthesized in response to stimulation at a potentiating synapse. The challenge that arises is how to get specific, newly synthesized proteins to the correct input-specific synapses they are need at. Two solutions to this problem include synaptic tagging and local protein synthesis.

"Synaptic Tagging

"In a neuron, synaptic tagging occurs in a series of steps in order to provide information on synaptic plasticity.
"Synaptic tags mark where synaptic plasticity has occurred and can thus provide information on synaptic strength and potential for long-term plastic changes.[5] The tag is temporary and involves a large number of proteins, activated by the influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell.[5] In addition, depending on the type and magnitude of synaptic change, different proteins are used for tagging. For example, when plastic changes lead to long-term depression, calcineurin is used. Conversely, when plasticity leads to long-term potentiation, CaMKII is used.[5] In order for synaptic plasticity to be input-specific, these synaptic tags are essential on post-synaptic targets, to ensure synaptic potentiation is localized.[5] These tags will later initiate protein synthesis that will in turn cause synaptic plasticity changes at these activated neurons.[1]

"Local Protein Synthesis
"Protein synthesis at dendrites is necessary for homosynaptic plasticity. The depolarization and resulting activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic cell causes endocytosis of these receptors. Local protein synthesis is required to maintain the number of surface receptors at the synapse. These new proteins help stabilize the structural changes induced by homosynaptic plasticity.[6] There is evidence of ribosomes in dendrites, which can manufacture these proteins. Furthermore, there is also evidence of granules of RNA in dendrites, which indicates the presence of newly made proteins. LTP can be induced from dendrites severed from the soma of the post-synaptic target neuron. Contrarily, LTP can be blocked in these dendrites by protein synthesis blockers, such as Endomyacin, which further indicates a site for local protein synthesis. This evidence shows local protein synthesis is necessary for L-LTP to be stabilized and maintained.[1]"

# Receptor Endocytosi
# "NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation and Long-Term Depression (LTP/LTD)"
"Weak activity of the presynaptic neuron leads to modest depolarization and calcium influx through NMDA receptors. This preferentially activates phosphatases that dephosphorylate AMPA receptors, thus promoting receptor endocytosis."
"In fact, AMPARs can be quite mobile and recycle between the cytoplasm and the cell membrane even under baseline conditions within tens of minutes. This can be shown, for example, by interfering with endocytosis, which leads to a run-up of synaptic responses. It is presumably this mobile pool of AMPARs that allows for rapid but sustained changes in synaptic efficacy. The insertion and removal of AMPARs during LTP and LTD, respectively, is believed to involve classical mechanisms of SNARE protein–mediated exocytosis and dynamin-dependent endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles (Lüscher et al. 1999; Carroll et al. 2001; Kennedy and Ehlers 2011). Current evidence favors the idea that the endocytosis and exocytosis of AMPARs during LTD and LTP happens not directly at the synapse but at slightly perisynaptic locations, from where the receptors reach the postsynaptic density by lateral diffusion."
