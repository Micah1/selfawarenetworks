(oscillat, array) cosmos neural network
while the universe has many of the properties of a neural network, depending on how we define the word conscious, a word first elucited by *Decart, meaning to know, we can argue that the cosmos is not intrinsicially conscious because "to know" is to render a certain kind of pattern that is in essence a recoding of decoded signals in the brain.

Basically the principles of neural coincidence detection (to dive deep into this topic I recommend "The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation by Peter Tse"), which is another way to think about Hebbian learning (similar to the idea that neurons that fire together wire together, and similar to the physics of oscillation where oscillators attract other oscillators and form clumps, and eventually an entire array of fireflies is oscillating in sync reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.) can apply to any material in theory, so a planet could be a coincidence detector, or a pattern detector that learns through its physical configuration to be more responsive to some patterns and less responsive to other patterns, this means that yes the entire cosmos could be a neural network, on a scale that is vast spatially & temporarily, but planets oscillate, earth oscillates, spacetime is imagined to be a harmonic oscillating field, and signals (light) travel between planets, stars, which is about what you need for the cosmos to be a giant neural network, albiet on difficult to imagine scales of time & space.

The Real Matrix: Physicist Says Our Universe Is Likely a Neural Network

to understand this we have to compare and contrast the heart and the brain

the heart also consists of oscillating nerve cells, with cyclic firing patterns like the brain, but the heart is limited or rigid in its signal pattern complexity, because its network of cells consists of mostly excitatory feed forward looping activity that has a low pattern divergence

where as the brain, see Rhythms of the Brain Figure 11.5 has a high number of possible signal patterns that emergy because inhibitory neurons act like train switches, "choice bifurcation" is the word, diverting the paths of incoming signal transmission resulting a vast array of possible pattern learning that is many times greater than the level of detail that could be rendered by a human heart.

It makes sense why we can replace a heart with a pace maker, but not a brain with a pace maker, what ever the human heart is potentially rendering its information complexity is miniscule enough to be replaced with an artificial pump

Bifurcations of paths in the interneurons multiple the complexity of phase variations that you might see in excitatory networks, which might be good at predicting curves or shapes over time as signals are modulated with subsequent distances (in the excitatory sensory input pathways) but the bifurcating interneuron pathways would be useful for higher level abstraction, non-linear concept formation.
