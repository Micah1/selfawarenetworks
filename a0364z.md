(oscillat, array) cosmos neural network
while the universe has many of the properties of a neural network, depending on how we define the word conscious, a word first elucited by *Decart, meaning to know, we can argue that the cosmos is not intrinsicially conscious because "to know" is to render a certain kind of pattern that is in essence a recoding of decoded signals in the brain

to understand this we have to compare and contrast the heart and the brain

the heart also consists of oscillating nerve cells, with cyclic firing patterns like the brain, but the heart is limited or rigid in its signal pattern complexity, because its network of cells consists of mostly excitatory feed forward looping activity that has a low pattern divergence

where as the brain, see Rhythms of the Brain Figure 11.5 has a high number of possible signal patterns that emergy because inhibitory neurons act like train switches, "choice bifurcation" is the word, diverting the paths of incoming signal transmission resulting a vast array of possible pattern learning that is many times greater than the level of detail that could be rendered by a human heart.

It makes sense why we can replace a heart with a pace maker, but not a brain with a pace maker, what ever the human heart is potentially rendering its information complexity is miniscule enough to be replaced with an artificial pump
