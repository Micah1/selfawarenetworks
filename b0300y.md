Brain Holism

representation transformation
category theory: the representation is a relative change in temporal & spatial phase patterns that trigger renderings that consist of previously learned temporal & spatial phase patterns, but the previously learned patterns oscillate harmonically in the unconscious brainwave to be ready for activation during a neural spike. So the brain wave represents an unconscious readiness pattern, and the spiking represents the conscious or temporarily active pattern. Your mental experience is happening at the convergence of both patterns, a conscious pattern is the dominant temporally active pattern that is colliding with incoming sensory patterns, and the prioceptive muscle patterns. Consciousness is the convergence of three types of patterns, learned oscillating brainwaves combined with new sensory input and muscle firing sequences. That is at a high level. At a lower level the types of patterns generated from everything cells communicate with one another.

quantity of dopamine in a release varies
so the ATP uptake changes
when the neuron moves faster

Stable Hippocampal Code in Bats, points to the framework outlined in Jeff Hawkins 2nd book "A theory of a thousand brains" which I would rename as a theory of higher level representations that anchor lower level representations.

Entitativity
ENTITATIVITY: "Entitativity deals with how groups of people are perceived as a group or as a mere aggregation of individuals."
Personhood is Cellular Entitativity: How groups of cells are perceived as a singular person, or a person appears from a mere aggregation of cellular communication.

The Stable Hippocampal brain activity in bats, across multiple environments is compositionally isomorphic to the relationship between place cells & grid cells, and between the sensory inputs of cortical columns and the higher level learned representations at the top of cortical columns 

Micah Blumberg here. So I, by the way, thank you everybody for participating in this group, it's a really cool group.

I'm so glad I stumbled on it so think about the top-down versus bottom up so I do think that the world is both top down on but and bottom up that we have, you know, people who do things that a grassroots level and we have people in at high levels that were respond and and we have low we have you know, high level systems and companies there's society as hierarchies right but um, and and I think that in the brain human brain also.

03:01

Top down and bottom up we have neurons detect information that criteria of the neuros attack criteria is coincidence patterns and that they consider information and in cortical columns and but at the top from the there's also a top-down process where the where the brain has to self-regulate brain activity and maintain equilibrium and regulate every the information that's coming in so that top down and bottom up happens in the brain.

I want to make a counter argument that our brains are still logical. Machine like but not like current machines but machine-like in a in a sense of machines will happen in the future not like current computers not like current logic and computers but logical in a sense that you know, the brain is collecting information and summarizing it it's it's collecting abstract sensory based multimodal information, but there's still logic in a sense that we're making multimodal predictions in the world of representations that we're thinking about and these sum up into a decision which is our action to take a step in one direction or another and so our brains are.

04:12

Our still processing information and discrete steps it's not computer-like but it's still computational in future machines will be able to do it also so I also want to make a point to what Garrett said I think that the argument that you know, the holism versus basically reductionism isn't a hundred percent correct because there's no way there's like the holism is not really holistic which you have just a more inclusive model anytime you like hold as it has to be everything right but there's but anytime you're thinking about something you're.

04:47

Subtracting from the whole already so you just you can never get the holism and it's that's a silly argument but I just wanted to point that out and so organize my my conclusions organs are actually robot life just not the way we understand robots and that's it thanks can I respond to Tom actually really think about holism so sorry.
