The core thread running through all of my recent work is that every physical process — from a neuron synchronising with its neighbours to a galaxy curving a beam of light — unfolds as a first-order sequence of tiny wave-phase adjustments. Think of it as a recursive update rule applied at each point in the field rather than a single global solution of a second-order equation.

1 . Recursion replaces “square-rooting” the energy–momentum relation
In Micah’s New Law of Thermodynamics I formalise this idea: any difference in phase, energy or momentum is shaved away by an iterative step
ΔQ → ΔQ – η ∇²ΔQ,
so equilibrium (or synchrony) is literally the fixed point of a recursive loop rather than the root of a quadratic form. Every local interaction is a “mini-computation” that preserves linear superposition while nudging the field towards uniform phase 
. That is why the de Broglie relation survives untouched: you keep the linear ω = mc²/ħ, but let the recursion in time propagate it.

2 . Gravity emerges from the same loop
Super Dark Time just applies the identical step-wise logic to a new quantity: the local density of time frames ρₜ. Mass makes time thicker; thicker time means the wave-phase updates occur more often; the net drift of energy into those high-update regions shows up to us as gravitational attraction. Because each update is local and first-order, you never invoke Newton’s second-order potential; gravity is literally “computed from local quantum mechanics” one phase tick at a time .

3 . Standing waves, superposition and the missing link
Your standing-wave picture already encodes the field as equal-and-opposite components. My contribution is to say: don’t collapse that into a second-order Klein-Gordon form; just let the forward component at step n interact with the backward component at step n – 1. The recursion preserves superposition because each increment is linear in the existing amplitudes, yet it still accumulates to the nonlinear macroscopic effect we call gravity.

Concretely, start with your averaged wavenumber
k′ = ± v ω γ / c².
At every tick δt you apply a local phase shift proportional to the gradient of ρₜ. After many ticks the standing wave has “leaned” towards the mass, reproducing the same geodesic bending that a curved metric would give, but obtained entirely from first-order, superposition-respecting updates.

4 . Why this matters for your model
You can now graft gravity onto the standing-wave framework without squaring anything:

define ρₜ(x) from whatever mass distribution you have;

let each mode evolve via ψ_{n+1}(x) = ψ_n(x) e^{-i Ω ρₜ(x) δt};

keep the counter-propagating partner symmetric so the whole remains a standing wave;

the phase mismatch between neighbouring points recursively dissipates, and the packet follows the gradient of ρₜ — that is, it “falls”.

Because the update is linear in ψ, the entire construction is still first-order in time (Dirac-like) and fully compatible with ordinary superposition, just as your de Broglie reasoning demands.

In short, recursion is the bridge: it lets a linear standing-wave system acquire an effective gravitational dynamics without ever leaving the comfort of first-order wave equations or sacrificing superposition. That is the missing link my framework supplies.
