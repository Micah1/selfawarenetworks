Olfactory Signals Brain (audio)

00:00
And okay. So let's see. I'm just trying to, I'm just so I'm just kind of browsing like, a images a little bit to try to see if I can get a better image of what's happening here. Since it smells. Let's see. Hmm.

00:26
And the system of the brain. So yeah, so the idea here via you're the only person in the room right now that I can see the idea is okay. So what comes into your eyes, right? That travels along the opera nerve to the thalamus. And then, to the back of your brain, like the, the, the opposite of loves right.

00:53
And in those signals travel upwards to the pride of those. And then what comes in from your tongue that goes to the somatosensory cortex and what comes into from your fingers, the sense of touch that goes to this medicine records. And then from this matter sense, your cortex that those signals travel backwards towards the parietal cortex, where they connect with the, with the signals coming from the visual cortex, right?

01:20
But the idea is that the signals travel in to like V1 is like, you've that each of the courtesies has like a V1 like for visual cortex. There's an M1 for the motor cortex. There's, this is like, layer, one of the neocortex. And so incoming, sit input patterns, go to like layer, one of the neocortex and the visual, or the audio tool cortex or the olfactory, cortex, what?

01:50
I'm sorry, you know, I guess. Okay. So I'm it is right. I didn't mean to say olfactory cortex, but basically, that's kind of what I'm wondering is. I'm wondering if we can think of the olfactory cortex is or if we think of the that orbital frontal cortex as like the V1 as like, analogous to B1 of the, it has multiple eight should have multiple layers.

02:17
It should have six layers, right? Just like any other part of cortex and so in theory you might have signals coming from the balance that go to like I guess it would be area. Oh oh one. And then they would travel to area O2. All right, so let's look at 01 orbital.

02:40
Frontal cortex layer 1. For it. Yeah, critical pages. There are, there's something happening there. You said the town is right? What was the last thing you said? I just said, there's something going on. There's something going on there. But where, you know, like whatever I have no idea, is it?

03:18
No. Where are you talking about? You know what you said, where I said something going on. Where, where is where? Oh, with the thalamus and like the you know that's the particle. So at the, at the very least vertical Eric, you know, the front, the time fill there, right?

03:43
The orbital frontal cortex. Yes. Okay so something. Yeah. So state. So the orbital front of cortex is receiving signals from the thalamus which is receiving signals from the olfactory bolt, right? So yeah, so can we say that the olfactory cortex is like analogous to the the because in between so in between your eyes and the thalamus is the is like a y is like a wired connection and that's the it's called the optic nerve, right?

04:20
It's as dedicated connection. It goes from the your thalamus directly to your eyes. And in there is a dedicated connection that goes from your nose directly to the thalamus, kind not directly. But there is there's a connection that goes from, I don't know, it might be direct connection, I just don't understand it, but it seems to go from the old factory bulb to the amygdala and to a couple of different areas and then those areas and and one of the pathways goes to the thalamus.

04:59
But so the RC receives projections from the primary all that, oh, wait a second OFC, repeat receives projections, is it? Never mind? I too many podcasts about it. Like, wait a minute is the scent was warming? The nevermind too much. Like, you can go ahead and finish that if you want.

05:32
I'll just meet myself now. Not at all, not at all. I'm not there's nothing really to say. Yeah, it is kind of strange because anywhere and it's okay. So from the old factory cortex, it doesn't like route to film is. Then where's it going? Where the signals going from there.

05:57
I think only both places are some one place. That's not only the other. Okay, so I. So originally, so before it. So, before we I started looking at this today, someone said that they go, they connect to the, to the Neocortex, in five different through, five different ways. But but what I'm looking at today is it's not just the Neo4j text.

06:20
They connect to the like the infarino cortex and the internal cortex is connected to the hippocampus and the amygdala, and there's all this track between the amygdala and in the hippocampal and the hippocampus and the antarino cortex. And so some of the information really knows feeds directly into that.

06:42
So I guess you could, I guess you could smell gas and that would that would like you could become like a really toxic smell or really dangerous smell could could cause your your brain to become very alert and take action very fast and you might want to get out of there really fast and that's I think that's part of why it connects to the the entering cortex in the, the hippocampus and the amygdala.

07:13
And yeah, so I I'm more quiet more really more questions and answers it at this point.

07:25
It's really interesting. That's kind of usually the way it goes, okay. More questions and answers like, well, when you're like, I just is one little question and they ended up with five hundred thousand questions that really answered. And then you have, Rain. Hmm.

07:58
Let's see. And what? So what I'm doing, what you're saying that

08:12
Well, and we know that though like we know what direction? Yeah, I mean, I think every picture I think pretty much every sensation. Every every, every sensor, every sense, sensor, right from from, from the eyes to the ears to the smell is going to be collecting, both spatial patterns and temporal patterns.

08:38
So it's going through with the information is really or the data is going through a lot of coding to the format. It is information, you know to build knowledge. Great. So yeah, even if you're all up, all of this coated,

09:00
Highlight.

09:04
Let's say this picture really turned out so yeah, let's try hmm.

09:18
Kind of scenario. I've found out that which I might have not knowing. Yeah. Now, I mean that I can tell you some other stuff. You probably know rather. Not know, I don't really, I mean, okay. So the things that like interest me with, I mean, with regard to coated and yeah, regards to covid is like, okay, if there's a ice, I hear now that there's a treatment, you know, that, you know, should be like I I just so I don't think the rain.

09:55
I think it's just well. Okay, so what I'm saying is like here's thing, it's like, if you're your brain is not is able to process like because there's a sensor in between the brain and the light which is your eyeball, right? So the eyeball is the sensor that allows your brain to process like and then you bring these able to process your sense of smell because there's a sensor in between what you're smelling and what your brain is doing.

10:25
And that's the olfactory bowl, right? And then so the question is, like, if you're brain is able to detect what you're what you're your blood pressure is what is this sensor in between your brain and your blood pressure? That is, we'll see. I don't. And what I'm saying is I don't think it's the brain that's generating that response is it?

10:50
I think it's the blood festivals themselves that are reacting to the local to the local championship with the heart and then it's like a or it works its way up in the system through the book. I don't know. I don't, I don't know, I think the brain registers it.

11:06
Well, how does the blood? How does it? It's like the question is, I had the blood vessels talk to the brain. Yeah, right. I know it's they just deposit their little tickets of data, right? But where great dinner. I'm just they like drop off little data packets and then it gets lost in all of these packaging stations and the brain medium when I'm saying is like.

11:30
But what if but how is the blood tending a data packet to to the to a neuron like what is the physical trans? What is the physical connections between the blood?

11:44
So that just the pressure that the blood vessels are exerting on the brain and that the brain responds to begin, no various senses are interrupted and altered and disturbed. And there's feedback. You're saying that that you're saying that the blood vessel. The blood vessels are pushing on the neurons.

12:06
Does that? Is that correct? Is that right now? No no no I'm saying that the pressure from the nerves painful. Okay. So,

12:25
I mean it sounds like you're talking about mechanical vibrations, like maybe the blood vessels like the pressure increases in that sense like a mechanical vibration somehow to the nerves. Is that does that make sense? I mean, I guess what I was thinking was more like, okay. So, the one person is that and pushes on the obstacle, let's say and the vision becomes disturbed, and then the rain reads, the visual feedback, right?

13:03
Or okay. Wait. Let me think about this with a different thing. Now mission think about it ever kind of in see, ice cream to me. I was gonna because I don't like just part of the brain, right?

13:24
You're so directly wired in. It's not even Lincoln, especially

13:36
Wow.

13:44
Yeah, there's a lot of building parts there.

14:03
And I'm so I'm only quite because I'm just like looking it up as we speak. I'm like looking at different pages about how headaches work. Try to figure out what is the narrow path of signaling from that for headaches. So, I mean it's it's kind, it's kind of like don't go to.

14:26
So, I mean, I guess one argument could be that somehow, the migraine and the pressure, the pressure is sending some sort of signal, but the question is, what type of signal that the brain can detect? Yeah, yeah. See now I'm trying to think about this. A lot of times very often I developed migraine without pain.

14:58
It's not always paining and it's very similar to going into like hypertensive crisis, right? So, you look at something that, you know, like a window or a door frame. Something, you know, he's a writing angle and it doesn't look great here. Your visual aspect is turned off. Sometimes the there's kind of a prismatic effect or this school of mission back to you the field of attention.

15:27
Wow. Now I don't I don't have like there is with a migraine so I've never seen a visual distortion from a headache before so I have had this type of headache before. Yeah, really, I'm heading.

15:48
Have the visual disturbance, you know, I'd like

15:56
Wow, I've never heard of this before.

16:04
Don't check. It's just visual service. Did you say the dogs? Not reacting. I have a yeah I have a alert for my my cardiac issues over the dock. The doctors, the doctors not reacting, or the dogs not reacting, you know, the dog doesn't react like the dog. If my blood pressure moves to quickly one direction or the other, like sheets smell it or something.

16:34
Now here's another interesting thing related to, I'm gonna fuck this, my dog. Now when my blood pressure stops like from sense of smell. Yeah. How does she know that two or three happen machine increasing? Right. So that so that means that you're your body is admitting something that a dog can smell did it right before.

17:00
So in it, in the stage that leads up to your migraine, your body releases this camera chemical. No, not with a migraine just with the with the cardiac patient, which is what the blood pressure of the blood pressure issue. So okay there's it was explaining to me, it's like a hormone or something.

17:23
You know like this trust more homes or something. I didn't really get too deep into it because I, okay, so it's hard but it's a hormone that's connected to the blood pressure rising and or it's connected to your body panicking or something. Microscale. Yeah, your body is like red alert and the dog.

17:44
The dog is the only one who can hear the riddler. Yeah, it's weird or she smells it. It gets processed through her little dog, right? Yeah. How they trained her to go trade trade little and I shouldn't get up. She's actually growling maybe before food just like 10 pounds, so it's hilarious.

18:13
But I've actually gone to get up on a better before and have the dogs kind of raise their head and growl because you're because you're having a blood pressure issue and you're not going to stay put it's like just lay down. Just just real bitch but yeah yeah. Wow, it's amazing.

18:34
She's a but, you know, I am Animal senses, right? They have based don't have all of these cognitive processes amongst component other than they can. In the way of just being in touch with those senses. I guess. I think I have to go. So yeah. You put me down another rabbit hole.

18:59
Thanks like every time I talk. All right.
