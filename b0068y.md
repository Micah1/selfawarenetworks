Okay, so let's see, I'm just trying to, I'm just, so I'm just kind of browsing like
all the images a little bit to try to see if I can get a better image of what's
happening here. Since it's a smell, let's see. Hmm. The system of the brain. So yeah, so the, so the idea here,
Bea, you're the only person in the room right now that I can see. The idea is, okay, so what
comes into your eyes, right, that travels along the optic nerve to the thalamus and then to the back
of your brain, like the, the, the, the occipital lobes, right, and then those signals travel upwards
to the parietal lobes. And then what comes in from your tongue, that goes to the somatosensory
cortex. And what comes in from your fingers, the sense of touch, that goes to the somatosensory
cortex. And then from the somatosensory cortex that those signals travel backwards,
towards the parietal cortex where they connect with the, with the signals coming from the
visual cortex, right. But the idea is that the signals travel into like V1. It's like you,
that each of the cortices has like a V1, like for visual cortex, there's an M1 for the motor
cortex. There's, this is like layer one of the neoportex. And so incoming input patterns go to
like layer one of the neocortex in the visual or the audio to cortex or the olfactory cortex.
Well, I'm sorry, you know, you know, I guess, okay, so I meant, sorry, I didn't mean to say
olfactory cortex, but basically that's kind of what I'm wondering is I'm wondering if we can
think of the olfactory cortex as, or if we think of the, the orbital frontal cortex as like the V1
is like analogous to V1 of the, it has multiple, it should have multiple layers. It should have
six layers, right, just like any other part of cortex. And so in theory, you might have signals
coming from the thalamus that go to like, I guess it would be area 01. And then they would travel
to area 02. Alright, so let's look at 01, orbital, frontal, cortex, layer one.
Yeah, so the thalamus and the cortical ranges, there are, there's something happening there.
You said the thalamus and the what? What was the last thing you said?
I just said there's something going on there. There's something going on there.
Where?
Like the subcortical, yeah, like whatever, I have no idea.
No, where are you talking about? But you said where, I said something going on where, where is where?
Oh, with the thalamus and like the, you know, the cortical.
So at the very least, the frontal cortical area, you know, the frontal there, right?
The orbital frontal cortex. Yes.
Okay, so something, yeah, so, so the orbital frontal cortex is receiving signals from the
thalamus, which is receiving signals from the olfactory bulb, right?
Right. So, yeah.
So can we say that the olfactory cortex is like analogous to the, the, because in between,
so in between your eyes and the thalamus is the, is like a wide, it's like a wired connection.
And that's the, it's called the optic nerve, right?
It's this dedicated connection that goes from your thalamus directly to your eyes.
And, and there is a dedicated connection that goes from your nose directly to the thalamus,
not directly, but there is, there is a connection that goes from, I don't know, it might be
a direct connection. I just, I guess I don't understand it, but it seems to go from the
olfactory bulb to the amygdala and to a couple of different areas.
And then those areas, and, and one of the pathways goes to the thalamus, but so the
OFC receives projections from the primary olfactory, oh, wait a second, OFC receives
projections. Well, you can go ahead and finish that if you want. I'll just meet myself.
No, not at all. Not at all. I'm not, there's nothing really to say. Yeah, it is kind of
strange to look, to look, and where, if it's, okay, so from the olfactory cortex, if it
doesn't like route to thalamus, then where's it going? Where the signal's going from there?
Are they going both places? Or some go in one place and some go in the other?
Okay, so I, so originally, so before, so before I started looking at this today, someone said
that they go, they connect to the, to the neocortex in five different, through five different
ways. But, but what I'm looking at today is it's not just the neocortex, they connect
to the, like the enterinocortex and the enterinocortex is connected to the hippocampus and the amygdala.
And there's all this traffic between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the hippocampus and
the enterinocortex. And so some of the information from the nose feeds directly into that. So
I guess you could, I guess you could smell gas and that would, that would like, you could become like
a really toxic smell or really dangerous smell could, could cause your, your brain to become
very alert and take action very fast. And you might want to get out of there really fast. And
that's, I think that's part of why it connects to the, the enterinocortex and the, the hippocampus
and the amygdala. And yeah, so I'm, I'm more, I have more, really more questions and answers
at this point. It's really interesting. I think that's kind of usually the way it goes for me.
More questions and answers. Well, when you're like, I just have this one little question
and then you end up with 500,000 questions that you really answer and then you have to
then you're on your way to do like something. Right.
Okay.
Let's see.
And what, so what I'm doing. You're seeing that?
Well, and we know that though, like we know what you're answering.
Yeah. I mean, I think every, I think pretty much every sensation, every, every, every
sensor, every sense sensor, right, from, from, from the eyes to the ears to the smell is going to be
collecting both spatial patterns and temporal patterns. So it's going through with the
information is really for the data is going through a lot of coding to format it is information.
You know, to build knowledge. So yeah, it's going to go through all of, all of this coding.
Okay.
Let's see. This picture is really time-consuming.
I'm kind of sorry I found out they could be missing, which I think I might have been
happy or not. Not knowing? Yeah. No, I mean, I can tell you some other stuff you probably
not know. Rather not know. I don't really, I mean, okay, so the things that like interest me with
code, I mean, with regard to COVID. Yeah, regards to COVID is like, okay, if there's a, I hear now
that there's the treatment that, you know, should be like I just so I don't think the brain, I think
it's just, it just processes. Well, okay, so what I'm saying is like senses. Here's the thing. It's
like, if your brain is not is able to process light because there's a sensor in between the brain
and the light, which is your eyeball. Right. So the eyeball is the sensor that allows your brain
to process light. And then your brain is able to process your sense of smell because there's a
sensor in between what you're smelling and what your brain is doing. And that's the olfactory bolt.
Right. And then, so the question is like, if your brain is able to detect what your, what your,
your blood pressure is, what is the sensor in between your brain and your blood pressure?
I see, I don't, and what I'm saying is I don't think it's the brain that's generating that
response. Is it? I think it's the blood vessels themselves that are reacting to the local,
to the local change with the heart. And then it's like a, it works its way up in the system
through the blood. I don't know. I don't, I don't know. I think the brain registers it.
Well, how do the blood, how do the, it's like the question is how do the blood vessels talk to the
brain? Yeah, right. I know. It's, they just deposit their little two bits of data. Right.
But where? The neurons just, they like drop off little data packets. And then it gets lost in
all of these packaging stations in the brain. But what I'm saying is like, but what is, but how
is the blood sending a data packet to, to the, to a neuron? Like what is the physical trans,
what is the physical connection between the blood?
Isn't that just the pressure? Isn't that just the pressure that the blood vessels are exerting
on the brain and then the brain responds? You know, various senses are interrupted and altered
and disturbed. And then there's feedback. You're saying that you're saying that the blood vessels,
the blood vessels are pushing on the neurons. Is that, is that correct? Is that right?
No. No, no, no. I'm saying that the pressure from the nerves. Okay. So
I mean, it sounds like you're talking about mechanical vibrations, like maybe the blood vessels,
like the pressure increases, and that sends like a mechanical vibration somehow
to the nerves. Is that, does that make sense?
Well, I mean, I guess what I was thinking was more like, okay, so the blood vessel expands
and pushes on the optical, let's say, and the vision becomes disturbed and then the brain
reads the visual feedback, right? Or, okay, wait, let me, let me think about this with
a different thing now. Vision. Let's think about a different kind of interaction.
See, eyes freak me out, too, because I don't, I don't like, just part of the brain, right?
You're so directly wired in, it's not even like an accessory.
Wow.
Wow. Yeah, there's a lot of, you know, big parts in there.
I'm, I'm, I'm, so I'm only quiet because I'm just like looking it up as we speak. I'm like
looking at different pages about how headaches work, try to figure out what is the neural path
of signaling from that, for headaches. So, I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of like,
so, I mean, I guess one argument could be that somehow the, the migraine and
the pressure, the pressure is sending some sort of signal.
Um, but the question is what type of signal that the brain can detect?
Yeah. Yeah. See, now I'm trying to think about this a lot of times, very often,
I develop migraine without being, it's not always payment. It's very similar to going
into like a hypertensive crisis, right? So, you look at something that you know, like a window
or a door frame, something that you know is a right angle and it doesn't look like writing,
right? Your, your visual aspect is turned off. Um, sometimes the, um, there's kind of a
charismatic effect or the school of fish effect to be the field of vision. Um, like there's with a
migraine. No, I don't, I don't have, like there is with a migraine. So, I've never seen a visual
distortion from a headache before. So, I haven't, I haven't had this type of headache before.
Yeah. Well, it's a migraine is not really a headache. Like a lot of, like I said, a lot of
times I get a migraine, but there's no actual headache. I just get the visual disturbance,
the nausea, you know, I get like all of the other symptoms, but maybe I don't get the pain.
Wow. I've never heard of this before.
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of times I get just purely visual migraines where only my field of vision
will be interrupted and I'll check my blood pressure is fine. The dog's not reacting.
It's just, I'll feel a little nauseous and have a visual disturbance.
Did you say the dog's not reacting?
I have, uh, yeah, I have, um, an alert, an alert for my, my cardiac issues.
Oh, the doctor, the doctor's, the doctor's not reacting or the dog's not reacting?
No, the dog doesn't react. Like the dog, if my blood pressure moves too quickly,
one direction or the other, like she can smell it or something. Now, here's another interesting
thing related to the smell. How the fuck does my dog know when my blood pressure is about to
spike from? From the sense of smell. How does she know, like, yeah, how does she smell that?
Two or three minutes, it feels like before it's going to happen. How does she know, how do they
smell that? So crazy. Right. So that, so that means that your, your body is emitting something that
a dog can smell. Right before, right before, um, so in the, in the stage that leads up to your
migraine, your body releases this chemical. Not with a migraine, no, not with a migraine,
just with the, with the cardiac issue, but just with the blood pressure. Oh, the blood pressure
issue. So, okay. So it was explained to me as like a hormone or something, you know, like
the stress hormones or something. I didn't really get too deep into it because I, you know. Okay,
so it's a, it's a hormone, but it's a hormone that's connected to blood pressure rising and, uh,
or it's connected to your body panicking or something on a micro scale. Yeah. Yeah. Your
body is like red alert and the dog, the dog is the only one who can hear the red alert. Yeah,
it's weird. She smells it. It gets processed through her little dog brain. Yeah. And, uh,
somehow they trained her to, uh, she, she's changed. She's trained, she trained herself
with the signaling. It's changed a little bit. If I'm lying down and I should get up,
she's actually growled at me before. Hey. She's like 10 pounds, so it's hilarious.
But I've actually gone to get up on a bed before and have the dog just kind of raise
her head and growl at me. Because you're, because you're having a blood pressure issue
and we don't want you to stay put. She's like, just lay down, just lay down. Just lay down,
touch, but yeah. Wow. Yeah. Wow. It's amazing. She's, uh, but you know, I am,
animal senses, right? They have, they seemingly don't have all of these cognitive processes,
amongst one another, and then kick them away of just, uh, being in touch with those senses,
my gosh. All right. I think I have to go. Yeah, you put me down another rabbit hole. Thanks,
Mike. Every time I talk, you put me down a rabbit hole. All right.
