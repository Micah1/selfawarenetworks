time dilation oscillates, because spacetime oscillates, time is a wave, just like spacetime.

My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio

as the particle/wave increases in magnitude / mass it decreases in frequency / speed. As it increases in speed / frequency it decreases in mass / magnitude

1/f describes the ratio of amplitude to frequency as being inverse in macroscope EEG measured brainwaves.

If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?

"The current proof-of-concept study reveals that one group of experimentally engineered cells performs optimally in terms of survival, growth, neural connectivity, and dopamine production, when implanted in the brains of rats. The study demonstrates that the result of such neural grafts is to effectively reverse motor symptoms due to Parkinson's disease."

since space is a wave, and since space and time are unified, time dilation is a wave

time dilation at the quantum scale is also a wave

which means gravity oscillates like a wave
and that means
# antigravity or anti-gravity propulsion might be a splay state oscillation to the oscillation frequency of gravity
