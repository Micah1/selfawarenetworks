Essentially dead things can be conscious.

And earlier today, I remember I was thinking come back to the sensor array idea. Essentially dead things can be conscious.

Because because it's conscious perception is basically like the telescopic perception of a projection of patterns stored in synaptic connections, to oscillating groups of neurons in cortical columns (including the hippocampal as a special cortical column in a special activity loop with the entorhinal cortex & the thalamus, to the whole brain via pyramidal connections, the rich club network & the default mode network

complex reality patterns by a sensor/transmitter system (or consideration/action system) of consisting specifically of oscillators in it. And certain information configuration pattern encoded in both the membrane of the dendrite and in the synaptic connections.

With phase transformations that lend themselves to the perception of reality at the rates of the frequencies of reality,

see the quote on alpha frequencies from Tesla in my notes

“Alpha waves in the human brain are between 6 and 8 hertz. The wave frequency of the human cavity resonates between 6 and 8 hertz. All biological systems operate in the same frequency range. The human brain’s alpha waves function in this range and the electrical resonance of the earth is between 6 and 8 hertz. Thus, our entire biological system - the brain and the earth itself work on the same frequencies. If we can control that resonate system electronically, we can directly control the entire mental system of humankind.”
