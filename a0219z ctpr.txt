It’s a simulation because without the external process of matrix multiplication the structure of the network wouldn’t do anything, in a real neural network, in a biological brain, the components of the network operate according to the physicals of biology where each component is a facilitating a fractal information feedback loop in order to maintain electrical, thermal, and structural equilibrium.

So what is a unit of computation in the brain. Is it a neuron? Is it a neural circuit? What’s a neural circuit? Is it a column of neurons? Is is a region of brain activity encompassing many columns, does it take many regions of simultaneous activity to create an information pattern in the brain that has temporal and spatial characteristics
