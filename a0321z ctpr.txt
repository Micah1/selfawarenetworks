"Hippocampal neurons code individual episodic memories in humans" pdf notes:
(These are notes written in conjuction with a certain pdf. There is a pdf saved to the 12.9 ipad called: Hippocampal neurons code individual episodic memories in humans)
I am interested to learn about how grid cells and place cells work from the Hippocampus Research as applied to Cortical Column research.

To what extend is the function of grid cells & place cells representing a core dynamic in the brain called Reference Frames.

Is it true that grid cells & places cells work together to form a reference frame?

Do they work together or do they work apart to each form reference frames on their own.

Can a single cell form a reference frame in the sense do doing the combined work of grid cells and place cells

but the Hippocampus role in both episodic memory, how neural circuits maintain short term memory, but how that short term memory is also 

How do we hack the government? How was the government hacked?
