(neuron, potential)

What if the neuron was fiber optic and the action potential was a beam of light instead of an electron? Could you still have intelligence?

Peter Rothman
Yes, it seems possible to build a mind out of things that aren't biological neurons but which at some level exhibit similar properties to neurons. 
Beams of light? Well I don't know what you mean there exactly. A laser? Yes there are photonic computers that use lasers and there are some recent interesting results.

Can it self-modify?

Łukasz Stafiniak
No because synapses would stop working.

Micah Blumberg
do you think the synapses can be remodeled to be triggered by a proton instead of an electron?
