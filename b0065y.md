So in listening to Richard Feynman, I have this idea that there's a difference in the scale of how many neurons are inhibited by the one neuron that fires.
Right, so the neuron fires, and the neuron fire is going to be a 0, 1, 2, or 3.
But the thing is that when the neuron fires at a 3 at its peak,
that is going to send the greatest amount of neurotransmitters, because more vesicles will be released.
And that will cause the potassium channels to open sooner on the inhibited neurons.
Those are going to be inhibitory synapses on the same layer.
And so that one neuron inhibits the rest of its own layer in terms of what it's regionally connected to.
But the scale at which it's going to affect those neurons is either going to be...
So it's like it's a regular amount of noise, which is the tonic noise.
And then a louder noise at scale means more neurons were inhibited.
So there's either more neurons were inhibited, that's a louder noise, and the even louder...
And then there's a loud noise, and then there's even louder noise, that's high gamma.
And so the idea is that it's almost like a confidence of a certain pattern appearing.
So a certain pattern appears if there's high confidence, then a lot more is inhibited from that one neuron.
If there's some confidence, then a smaller number of neurons are inhibited, right?
Because less neurotransmitters, less vesicles are released.
And so that the neurons are less inhibited at that point.
And so this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency.
And so in one sense, if there's more than one neuron set fire off in a layer, then potentially there are more of that layer is blacked out.
Like a much bigger area is blacked out, then it could be just one.
That is combining two...
That would be the effect of combining two smaller patterns into a larger scale pattern.
That's when you get to what I was calling about the television rendering effect, when you're combining different pixels together to create an image.
And so what you have with the sparse distributed representation, we can look at the pictures of the sparse distributed representation with the MENTA.
But in a self-war network, it's not on or off.
There's always a tonic firing.
And so whenever there's an off, that is actually like a distinction between on and bright and brightest.
There's four different levels of distinction in a self-war network because there's a tonic off.
There's like a tonic pattern of when the network is active.
There's like a tonic pattern that's constantly forming a collective array.
And that is also...
So the array is embedded inside the timing, the timed firing of neurons as the tonic pattern.
That is the array which is conscious of changes to the array.
Because like fireflies, the entire array is sharing data.
It's rippling, it's dissipating the differences as they occur.
So differences come in and it dissipates the differences across the entire array because of the principles of oscillation.
The same sort of principles that cause bugs to oscillate together, light bugs to oscillate together.
And the same principles that cause two pendulums in the same room to become in sync.
And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving novel patterns from the small oscillators.
And because of the principles, the off oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate.
They're causing the novel oscillations, the novel firing, the bright and brighter, and they inhibit it to return to a tonic firing rate.
And they do this the way that oscillators work.
The large oscillator absorbs the smaller one.
And gradually, so that means that the novel firing is a phasic, phasic firing is a resonator or a decaying oscillator.
And the oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator in that it has more regularity.
And you know, it stays like the alpha frequency, but that is that that regularity is about like if you see in the alpha frequency,
there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field being changed by inhibition patterns and firing patterns.
They're defining the depth of the phase field that defines your reality.
And that's where your reality is. It's in the changes of the phase field of the alpha pattern.
And of course, you know, that's in the sensory input areas, but then later on your reality is in the delta pattern and the theta, and somewhere else is in the theta pattern.
And it's really in the contrast between the phase acquiring patterns and the resonating contrast.
Because patterns resonate in the alpha frequency and the beta frequency and the gamma frequency.
But the amount of possible resonation is a different scale, which allows different levels of focus.
Like this slower delta can have a bigger scale focus in one sense.
But it's also, it's really a lot slower than sensory input data.
But it's bigger picture. It's higher amplitude. So it's more networked.
It's when the network comes together at the highest levels in the delta frequency.
But yeah, so think of your reality. Like when you look around, like when you walk outside your city, you're inside the alpha frequency in a sense.
Your perspective on reality is being rendered inside the alpha frequency in the lower reasons of your cortex.
The visual stuff and the visual cortex. The auditory stuff and there's an audio cortex, or auditory cortex.
And then you have your taste and smell are going to your somatosensory cortex.
And then you have your grusatory cortex is going into an interesting circuit that goes first to your temporal lobes.
And then it splits in two different directions. Part of it goes to your thalamus and then the olfactory cortex, which is the secondary olfactory cortex.
And then part of it goes from the temporal lobes to the olfactory lobes.
And again, in this time it's going, it's sweeping the thalamus, it's going directly from the temporal lobes to the olfactory lobes.
So it goes in two paths. So there's a circuit that goes, and then actually it also goes through a third path.
It also goes to the amygdala and the enterinocortex and then the hippocampus.
But it's interesting there's this sort of like circuit that goes through the thalamus and also directly to the olfactory cortex.
And then meets back up with it. And then olfactory cortex, of course, connects to the thalamus to a part of the thalamus.
And all the senses do have pathways through the thalamus, all of them.
And it's interesting like, you know, people say that the prefrontal cortex is not a sensory input.
But the axons that are connected to the, there was a recent paper in 2020 that was saying that the axons that are associated with the signals that come from the nose,
that they go throughout the prefrontal cortex.
And the prefrontal cortex is the primary sensory input area for the nose, right?
So it's like all this time they were saying that it wasn't, but it actually kind of is.
So it's like everything goes to the thalamus first except for olfactory which goes to the neocortex before going to the thalamus,
before going back to the neocortex, right?
So there's something slightly different happening with the sense of smell.
But it allows basically for the whole brain to basically be a primary sensory cortex.
Yeah.
