Prefrontal Neurons Pattern Oscillator Cortex (audio)

00:00

So and let's listening to Richard Fireman, I have this idea that that the, there's a difference in the scale of how many neurons are inhibited by the one there on the fires, right? So the neuron fires and the neuron fire is going to be a zero, one, two or three.

00:21

But the thing is that when the neuron fires out of three and it's peak that is going to send the most amount of of this is going to send the greatest amount of neurotransmitters because more vesicles will be released. And that will cause the potassium channels to open sooner on the inhibited neurons.

00:49

Like those like those like those. Those are, those are going to be inhibitory. Synapses right on the same layer and so that one neuron. It was the rest of its own layer in a certain in terms of what it's like regionally connected to. But this scale which it is going to affect the, those neurons is either going to be like, they're either going to be

01:20

So, like it's like, okay, it's like it's a regular man to noise, which is a tonic noise, and then a louder noise at scale. Means more neurons weren't inhibited. So there's like either more neurons inhibited. That's a ladder noise and the even louder. So and that's a sorry, there's a like a lot.

01:37

So there's like regular noise and then there's loud noise and then there's like even louder noise. That's like high camera and so the idea is that it's like almost like a confidence of a certain pattern appearing. So a certain pattern appears if there's high confidence, then it's then a lot more is inhibited from that one.

01:57

Neuron. And if there's like there's like you know, some confidence that and a smaller number of neurons are inhibited, right, because less neurotransmitters are less, vesicles are released. And so that the neurons are less inhibited at that point.

02:26

And and so this allows to have this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency, right? And, and so sense.

02:44

So this so and one sense like additional like if there's more than one neurons that fire off and a layer then potentially there are like more of that layers like blacked out like a much bigger areas like I think could be just with one. And it that's like it's like that is combining to that would be the effect of like combining two smaller patterns into a larger scale pattern that's when you get to what I was calling about.

03:17

Like the television rendering effect when you combining different pixels together, right? To create an image, right? And so what you have with this question distributed representation in the stuff like and we can look at the pictures of a smart distributor representation with dementia. But in a self-award network the, there's it's not on or off.

03:43

It's it's a it's a there's always a tonic firing and so whenever there's an off that is actually like a distinction between on which ends bright and brightest, like there's four different levels of distinction and a software network because there's a ton of cost. There's like a tonic pattern when, when the, when a network was active.

04:12

There's like a tonic pattern, that's constantly.

04:18

Forming a collective array and that is also. So the array is embedded inside the timing. The timed firing of neurons as the tonic pattern that is the array, which is conscious of changes to the array because like fireflies, the entire array is sharing data, it's rippling, it's dissipating. The differences as they occur.

04:50

So differences come in and it disappears the differences across the entire array because of the, the principles of oscillations. The same way the same sort of principles that that caused bugs to oscillate together. Lightbox Austin together in the same principles that cause to pendulums in the same room to become in sync.

05:13

And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.

05:46

So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

06:37

And that's where your reality is. It's in the it's in the the changes that the face feel of the alpha pattern,

06:49

And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?

07:22

Resonation is is a different scale, which allows different levels of focus. Like this slower, delta can have a bigger scale focus and one sets but it's also

07:41

It's really a lot slower than sensory and potato but it's but it's, it's bigger picture. It's it's a higher amplitude. So it's it's more network. It's when the network comes together, the highest levels and the Delta frequency.

08:06

But yeah, so but think of your reality. Like when you look around, like, when you walk outside Mercedes, you're inside the opera frequency. Innocence you're being your video perspective. On reality has been rendered inside the alpha pregnancy and the lower reasons of your cortex, the visual stuff in the visual reports, the auditory stuff, and there's an audio cortex or auditory cortex.

08:33

And then you have entertains and smell. I'm going to your there's a medicines for cortex. And then you have regulatory cortex is going into an interesting circuit that that goes first to your ear Temple loves, and then it's listening to different directions part of it goes to your thalamus and then the both factory cortex, which is the second primary, which is this.

09:05

I'm sorry that which is the secondary olfactory cortex and then part of it goes from the the temporal lobes to the olfactory lobes.

09:16
And again, this and this time is it's going if sleeping without a swing directly from the the temporal lobes to the olfactory. Love so goes into paths. So this is a circuit that goes and then actually it also goes through third class. This is also goes to the amygdala and the internal cortex and in the hippocampus.

09:37

At the very interesting, there's this sort of like circuit that goes through the thalamus and also directly to the olfactory cortex, and then meets back up with the and then, and that'll factor cortex, of course, connected to the thousands to tooth Atlantic. We've got two part of the talents, right?

09:55

It all the senses have do have pathways through the topics following them. And it's interesting. Like, you know, people say that the prefrontal cortex is not a sense and is not a sensory input but the axons of the the axons that are connected to the there's a recent paper in 2020 that was saying that the axons of the that that associated with, with signals that come from the nose that they go through out the prefrontal cortex.

10:33

And the prefrontal cortex is the primary sensory input area for further nose, right? So it's like, all this time. They were saying that it's wasn't but actually, kind of yes. So it's like the click, the everything goes to

10:56

The balance first except for the olfactory, which goes to the neocortex before, going to the thalamus, before going back to the day of cortex, right? So there's there's there's something slightly different happen with what the sense of smell. But it, but it allows basically for the whole brain to basically be a primary sensor.
