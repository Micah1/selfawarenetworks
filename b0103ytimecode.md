Title: Oscillating Volumes

b0103y, In this recording I explain how oscillating cells in sync behave like a single sensor transmitter system, as I listened I thought of the comparison to materials, metals, or plastics or any material that is basically the same atomic/molecular/chemical configuration repeated and bound by a common oscillation pattern, a satellite dish is coated with a common material so that the whole dish can have one common function that unites the entire surface area or the entire volume. In this call I am wrapping my mind around the concept that the signals passed between cells are both quantities of energy and information at the same time. It's long but its a good listen. You've moved a small oscillating group out of phase with the global oscillator, the physics of oscillators requires both oscillators to create a drag on each other until either they sync or they don't sync but they still affect each other

[00:00.000 --> 00:14.800]  Einstein condensation is an oscillation, when a bunch of atoms, an oscillator, sink and sink.[00:14.800 --> 00:25.800]  So the idea that the probability cloud, the probability cloud of an atom is like an oscillator,

[00:25.800 --> 00:42.800]  is a little bit like an oscillator, in the sense that like, the Bose-Einstein condensate is like if you have many, many atoms and they're all oscillating as one.

[00:42.800 --> 00:53.800]  I'm just like, so what I just started to imagine was like, well what if, what if, what if a particle was like many micro particles, right?

[00:53.800 --> 01:05.800]  Like, what if it was like in a sense like a matrix of particles all sort of like oscillating together, but oscillating together in a way that would cause the,

[01:05.800 --> 01:15.800]  like one part of that oscillator to light up at a time and you say well that's like the, that's where the particle is,

[01:15.800 --> 01:28.800]  but it really seems like it's, the particle's location is all over the place because that is just like one possible phase state for that space.

[01:28.800 --> 01:38.800]  So represent, so like that one, the location where it's at in one moment is kind of like, that's like, that's like the neuron that fired.

[01:38.800 --> 01:47.800]  And the, the rest of the space is like the part that listened or the part that was inhibited in a sense.

[01:47.800 --> 02:06.800]  And so it seems to be moving around. It seems like the particle's moving around, but maybe it's not really moving so much as there is basically this,

[02:06.800 --> 02:15.800]  like what if it like represents this compression of space that is actually made out of,

[02:15.800 --> 02:25.800]  yeah, what if it's like a fractal space, like what if, like what if the particle of a phase field has its own phase field, right?

[02:25.800 --> 02:42.800]  And so the reason its behavior is so mysterious is because its micro phase field inside the phase field is basically repeating the same patterns as a larger phase field on a smaller scale.

[02:42.800 --> 02:51.800]  So, yeah, like, is that going to make sense?

[02:51.800 --> 03:17.800]  So I'm imagining an oscillator as like, as like, imagine that you are, you are rolling around, like, it's like, it's like when energy is spiking, right,

[03:17.800 --> 03:29.800]  then everything is in this array. And then if you roll around like this array, like let's say you have like a ball, like a sphere, and you roll it around and move it around real fast, right?

[03:29.800 --> 03:35.800]  So it's like the liquid inside is spinning around. You have a sphere and you've got liquid inside it spinning around.

[03:35.800 --> 03:48.800]  And if you, when you slow down the shaking, the liquid inside is going to gradually slow down from like moving around really crazy.

[03:48.800 --> 03:57.800]  It's going to start, it's going to be, you know, waving back and forth for a while, but eventually it will become very still as long as you don't move.

[03:57.800 --> 04:06.800]  And so that's what I think of in terms of like what is kind of like why, you know, oscillatory states like a move.

[04:06.800 --> 04:28.800]  I'm sorry, why, why neurons eventually move towards being an oscillatory state where there is, it's because as a reaction to the action potential, it's like the action potential is a drop in the ocean and the rest of the neurons are

[04:28.800 --> 04:37.800]  absorbing and redistributing that wave everywhere until it runs out of energy, sort of.

[04:37.800 --> 04:43.800]  So they're like, they're bouncing that wave all around until it runs out of energy, basically.

[04:43.800 --> 05:03.800]  And that's like, it's not that it runs out of energy, it's that the network reaches a new equilibrium, right, which is like, it represents the, maybe it represents the acquisition of that energy, I guess.

[05:03.800 --> 05:18.800]  It's like now we went up like one point of voltage or something. And so it's just a tiny modification to the, to the oscillation phase frequency.

[05:18.800 --> 05:33.800]  And then that, so that oscillation's collective phase frequency is, you know, that is like, that's a, that's a brain wave, right.

[05:33.800 --> 05:57.800]  The frequency emerging from net, from cortical columns and oscillators, groups of neurons, those are, those are brain waves, right, and they don't end, and they're reflective of the collection, action of, the collective action of neurons that are oscillating together.

[05:57.800 --> 06:21.800]  So I'm arguing that those brain waves are containing, basically, it's the, the oscillation phase changes are containing the, sort of like, those are the screens, those are the 4K screens that are being presented to your thalamus.

[06:21.800 --> 06:50.800]  And collectively, they're, and they're being presented to the, to the default network, right, which just connects the default, you know, the major connections, the major connective areas between the different parts of the neocortex are acting like a fractal screen for your, for your thalamus.

[06:50.800 --> 07:12.800]  Right, and for your, but in any case, it's just, though, it's, it's, your whole brain is this screen, right, your whole, the whole brain is, but what I'm saying is like, the center of your focus, like, like imagine your focus has three different levels.

[07:12.800 --> 07:30.800]  Right, so then, so the center of your focus would be, you know, like, where the brain's major connections are. So I was thinking like the thalamic, the thalamic bridges are major connections between brain areas.

[07:30.800 --> 07:46.800]  So that would make sense if, you know, that is like a convergence point where that, that's where you would get your, basically, that would be the center of your focus, theoretically, where information is seen from the larger scale.

[07:46.800 --> 08:14.800]  At the top of the hierarchy, in a sense, you know, there's like, you know, the signals come in from your senses to the nuclei on the thalamus, and then they go from the thalamus to the, to the neocortex, and there's these narrow paths that go throughout the neocortex where the information goes to the

[08:14.800 --> 08:30.800]  the occipital lobes from your, from information from your eyes goes to the, along the optic nerve to the lateral genital nucleus, and that is a collection of nuclei.

[08:30.800 --> 08:48.800]  And they, then that's routed to your occipital lobes, and that goes, connects to, that splits off into the parietal lobes above, and signals are, you know, have a path that go towards the temporal lobes below.

[08:48.800 --> 09:11.800]  And, and in general, like, everything connects to everything in the brain in a, you know, in a sort of like random graph away so that there's mathematical proof that the distance between any two points in the brain isn't that great, isn't that far away.

[09:11.800 --> 09:21.800]  There's no two hops between any two distances in the brain.

[09:21.800 --> 09:33.800]  Yeah, so, but the idea is that, I'm just like imagining like, if you had

[09:33.800 --> 09:46.800]  like sand, right, like, I'm just saying like, I'm just like imagining like sand, it's like, or I mean if you imagine like water, right, yeah, actually water is probably the best analogy.

[09:46.800 --> 09:53.800]  It's going to sort of like settle, it's going to look for an equilibrium, the signal is going to spread out, right, that's what happens to water.

[09:53.800 --> 10:10.800]  But we're thinking more like okay so we've got three different oscillators, and they have three random initial voltages, and they each, you know, collect a little bit of voltage each round, and they get moved up.

[10:10.800 --> 10:21.800]  And then so they each reach a threshold and they fire and when they fire they kick the other two, which means, in addition to the voltage they're getting each round, they get an additional amount of voltage.

[10:21.800 --> 10:35.800]  And the idea is that this keeps happening over and over again where, where, you know, one neuron will fire it will kick the other two, and eventually they'll get to the point where all three of them

[10:35.800 --> 10:37.800]  fire at the same time.

[10:37.800 --> 10:59.800]  So eventually, all the oscillators end up firing in sync, because eventually they're, what they're distributing is like reaches equilibrium, it's like they each, they're each, it's like the richest one is, is going to give to the other two.

[10:59.800 --> 11:11.800]  And then when the next person becomes the richest one they're going to give to the other two, when the next person becomes the richest one they're going to give to the other two. And eventually, you know, if they're just constantly giving to each other.

[11:11.800 --> 11:15.800]  Then eventually they all have the same amount.

[11:15.800 --> 11:20.800]  If they're giving like, if they're each giving like one each turn to the other two.

[11:20.800 --> 11:22.800]  Every time they fire.

[11:22.800 --> 11:27.800]  Eventually they all have the same amount, if this just happens a long enough for a long enough time.

[11:27.800 --> 11:42.800]  And in that sense, like, you can send signals to an oscillator, but anything you send it like what happens eventually. If you stop sending signals to an oscillator is that they all eventually oscillate together.

[11:42.800 --> 11:43.800]  Right.

[11:43.800 --> 11:47.800]  And it just becomes like an array.

[11:47.800 --> 12:09.800]  A sensor array, like the, the entire oscillate oscillating group of nouns becomes like a sensor array that can remember its own activations, because that

[12:09.800 --> 12:18.800]  kind of like creates, it creates cascading reactions.

[12:18.800 --> 12:27.800]  And, and the cascading reactions that happen are the memories of that, of that.

[12:27.800 --> 12:56.800]  That's the activation of memory. So the cascading reactions are the activation of, sorry, that's the activation of memories. The formation of, that's the rendering. So that pattern is the point of rendering that is what, what I'm actually seeing in my head when I look at something outside of me like a wall.

[12:56.800 --> 13:02.800]  But, but at the same time that entire oscillation, right.

[13:02.800 --> 13:11.800]  That is something that is observed at an even higher level.

[13:11.800 --> 13:28.800]  It's pattern, what I'm saying is that there, there are other oscillators who can interpret the output of that, of that one oscillator.

[13:28.800 --> 13:37.800]  Like that's that's so that's when we're going from like, you know, to the pyramid cell that collects the interneuron that connects to another cortical column.

[13:37.800 --> 13:49.800]  Right, so the idea is that the, the output of one oscillator. So the oscillator magnifies the, the pattern that.

[13:49.800 --> 14:10.800]  And if you look at this book called Sync, in chapter two, it's really great. Let me share something. Each oscillator is distributing its extra energy each time. It's like dissipating, each one is dissipating the energy and the collective work of all the dissipating energy is going to even out the, the amount of energy that each has.

[14:10.800 --> 14:16.800]  The entire system is going to even out the energy. So that's why oscillation happens.

[14:16.800 --> 14:24.800]  Equilibrium happens. Okay, so what I just imagined was the.

[14:24.800 --> 14:44.800]  That basically, the, the neuron, the neuron is. So, so oscillator synchronized because they're basically dissipating energy they're taking a lot of energy that one of them receives.

[14:44.800 --> 14:50.800]  And each one is like saying okay well I need to dissipate this energy because a charge has built up.

[14:50.800 --> 15:05.800]  So, and the amount of energy that's being dissipated is the signal pattern. So, the signal pattern is, at the very least it's with neurotransmitters like at the root of it.

[15:05.800 --> 15:20.800]  Neurotransmitters can do, can do like, they can, there's four possible signals and I call those signal zero which is an inhibited neuron, it sends nothing.

[15:20.800 --> 15:35.800]  It is a tonically firing neuron. Signal two is, and that would be, that would be transmitted with release of one vesicle sac. That might have, it might have 2000 neurotransmitters in it.

[15:35.800 --> 15:57.800]  And the signal two is when the, that's a, that's a phasic burst so it's not a tonic, so neurons fire tonically all the time. But when they fire because they've received, they've recognized a pattern, a pattern, which means that the pattern is stored in the, in the walls of their

[15:57.800 --> 16:12.800]  branches like there's synaptic, there's synaptic, synaptic connections. The synaptic connections that a neuron has is constantly, are constantly changing, and that's the pattern that that neuron is ready to receive.

[16:12.800 --> 16:28.800]  It won't reject patterns that, that it's not looking for because, that it's because, because it just won't see patterns that it's not looking for because those won't go to its, its, its active synaptic connections.

[16:28.800 --> 16:41.800]  Like, it's only going to receive patterns from its synaptic, from its active synaptic connections. So inhibited connections, it's not going to receive a pattern to an inhibited synapse.

[16:41.800 --> 17:02.800]  So what happens is, if it gets three times the, if it gets three micro vesicle stacks, it's like 6000 neurotransmitters, that's going to activate a lot more of its potassium channels simultaneously, and that will inhibit the cell.

[17:02.800 --> 17:20.800]  Because that will inhibit the cell, and so one action potential will inhibit its neighbors, its neighboring cells. And so those cells like, you know, if they,

[17:20.800 --> 17:41.800]  it's, it's, but it's, but it's not necessarily the same, it's going to inhibit a selection of its neighbors. And, but it matters a lot in terms of like, not necessarily all of them, because some of them might be,

[17:41.800 --> 17:57.800]  some of them actually might not. Like, it might, so the thing is like, it might, that is one possibility, but it's also, it's also possible that the way that they're connected to another cell could instead excite another cell.

[17:57.800 --> 18:15.800]  So instead of like, maybe they have only one synaptic connection to another cell, and there's no potassium, it's just, there's just a lot of sodium receptors in that synapse. So in that sense, if it's a sodium receptor synapse,

[18:15.800 --> 18:32.800]  then if you sent a, you know, a huge, you know, a number three, three multibesical, three vesicles release, then that cell is going to get excited faster.

[18:32.800 --> 18:52.800]  But it also matters, it also matters a lot whether that pattern is something that speaks to that cell or not, because if that cell is not looking for a pattern that involves, what I'm saying is like, what pattern speaks to that cell, is that cell is only going to fire

[18:52.800 --> 19:06.800]  if it gets enough, if it gets enough charge, and the charge has to come from all of its synapses, all of its synaptic connections, right?

[19:06.800 --> 19:23.800]  I'm sorry, it doesn't have to come from all of them, but it has to come from enough of them. So if enough of them are receiving, if enough of the sodium receptors are active, and the sodium is filling up faster than the potassium is leaving.

[19:23.800 --> 19:43.800]  So like if there's a one, or if the receptors that are receiving are just like sodium receptors, right, in that synapse, and so it could be like a three vesicle release.

[19:43.800 --> 20:01.800]  And in that sense, yeah, so sodium receptors might open up faster. And that just like, I don't know, it's not so relevant.

[20:01.800 --> 20:25.800]  Yeah, it actually would be relevant, yeah, because the rush of sodium opening would cause the action potential to start faster, and the rush of potassium opening would either inhibit the cell, or it would cause the cell to shorten the action potential.

[20:25.800 --> 20:43.800]  And if you have, if the frequency of the action potential is shorter, then the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger.

[20:43.800 --> 20:57.800]  Because there's an inverse relationship, so if the frequency is smaller, the amplitude is larger. If the amplitude is smaller, the frequency is longer, or larger.

[20:57.800 --> 21:14.800]  Yeah, so that would be like a longer frequency, or a larger frequency. I'm not sure how to, it's a higher frequency, I think. Yeah, higher frequency, yeah, so we're talking like hertz.

[21:14.800 --> 21:33.800]  So if we're sending out, so the gamma ray bursts, you know, the frequencies of gamma ray, sorry, the gamma frequency of brain waves, because the brain can oscillate between like 0.02 hertz and 600 hertz.

[21:33.800 --> 22:01.800]  And the high gamma bursts, the phasic bursts, those are high frequency bursts. So tonic oscillations are low frequency bursts. And the idea is that to understand the oscillation, the oscillations tend to like get divided into power bands that are, they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17.

[22:01.800 --> 22:20.800]  And it can differ a little bit between different animal species, how exactly what, you know, what defines each power band, in terms of which frequencies belong, you know, it typically stays between.

[22:20.800 --> 22:34.800]  And like theta for rabbits is different than theta for humans, right. But they're still like these power bands, these power bands are like the horizontal.

[22:34.800 --> 22:59.800]  I mean, these are like the, these power bands are like, you know, I think that they're probably like the result of your cortical columns, like the alpha in, you know, synchronizing patterns, maybe across layers.

[22:59.800 --> 23:18.800]  So the lowest layers, I think would be, I think they might be the lowest, the lower layers might be like alpha band, or just like alpha band beta, higher frequency.

[23:18.800 --> 23:40.800]  Maybe even like, you know, higher frequency would be gamma. That's what I imagine that you're going to have a little bit more of that. I have to check. And then the, the, towards the, you know, the top, at the pyramidal cell level.

[23:40.800 --> 23:53.800]  Actually, when you get into, you know, I would expect to have more delta up there, because,

[23:53.800 --> 24:13.800]  because, well, when you get into, because when you get to the thalamic bridges, you know, the thalamus is like this, this delta firing circuit. It is, it's sort of like,

[24:13.800 --> 24:36.800]  you want to be in the same frequency range for data, data, data comparability, I think, like, and I think you need, I think if one oscillator is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator,

[24:36.800 --> 24:45.800]  I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it, just for it, so that there's an apples, there's a way to compare apples to apples.

[24:45.800 --> 25:11.800]  Right, so if you look at, like, basically the, the book, I mean, sorry, if you get NeuroPipe, you know, the idea is, well, how can we relate different sets of unstructured data, like heart data and EEG data, and you kind of need to, you know, figure out how to create, like, create a relatable time series.

[25:11.800 --> 25:27.800]  Right, how to relate the time series of heart activity and the signals you're getting at each interval exactly to brainwave activity by a time interval.

[25:27.800 --> 25:50.800]  And so if you have a way to compare, like, you know, I got this, this heart, this, basically this heartbeat at the one minute mark, and the brainwave at the one minute mark, and then I got another, like, you know, super big heartbeat phenomena happening at the, at the, at the one minute 52nd mark, and at that exact time, there was another, like, really strange, curious brainwave.

[25:50.800 --> 26:03.800]  And I'm, I'm, like, wondering if there's a correlation between this brainwave and this, this, like, surprising. What was happening at the time, you know, was there, there was a surprise. Somebody, it was there, it was like a happy birthday surprise.

[26:03.800 --> 26:16.800]  A bunch of people came out and said, surprise! And there was, and there was a birthday party. And then that's why, and right when they said surprise, that was the one minute mark.

[26:16.800 --> 26:31.800]  And then, and then someone in particular came out at the one minute and 52nd mark, that just was, it was shocking to see them, because that person had been dead for three years and now they were back.

[26:31.800 --> 26:49.800]  Okay, I'm just joking. Just trying to create a funny surprise. But, no, I've had dreams where I'm, like, I realize I'm talking to someone that had passed on, and, but I don't realize it right away.

[26:49.800 --> 27:04.800]  It's like, it's like my mind is trying to allow me to enjoy their presence without the horror of their presence. Right? It's like, my mind is like, okay, forget the part where they died.

[27:04.800 --> 27:19.800]  It's like you're just talking to someone and all of a sudden you realize you're talking to someone who died like three years ago in a dream. It's like, that is, that's, I, I, I appreciate those dreams because it reminds me of people that I've lost.

[27:19.800 --> 27:34.800]  But they're, they are something, you know, I, I'm like, I'm like, I hope that, like, that would be amazing if like, you know, someday I get to get to have a really great DMT experience and I meet people who, who passed on.

[27:34.800 --> 27:53.800]  Right? That would be a wonderful, that could, that could be a wonderful and perhaps even like frightening, a little bit frightening DMT, our ayahuasca experience. I would, that'd be amazing. Yeah. To meet people who passed on and sort of a trip, psychedelic trip.

[27:53.800 --> 28:21.800]  So basically, you know, Fireflies are, as oscillators, they are sending each other a bolt, like a bolt of energy, basically. They're, they're, like, you don't think of it actually as sending energy, but if you, like, if you like blink a light at a light receptor, you're sending something that is, is, is, you're dissipating,

[28:21.800 --> 28:29.800]  you're, it's almost like you're dissipating information, if that makes sense. You're dissipating information.

[28:29.800 --> 28:53.800]  And so if one Firefly's pattern stops working, like, either like that Firefly becomes inhibited, then maybe like that it has been eaten by like a frog or something and the whole oscillate, oscillation is disturbed and it's like, it's, I mean, maybe that means it flies away really fast.

[28:53.800 --> 29:06.800]  So there's a swarm and they're just hanging out and all of a sudden, like one of them disappears, they're all going to notice it because they were all expecting to receive a signal at exactly the same time and they, and they didn't.

[29:06.800 --> 29:09.800]  So it's like, well, something is different.

[29:09.800 --> 29:14.800]  The entire oscillation notices the pattern. And then

[29:14.800 --> 29:30.800]  that, that, that creates a disturbance in the forest, basically. And then at the same time, we have this situation where maybe one of them finds food, but now they all know it because that one, that one, it burst faster.

[29:30.800 --> 29:47.800]  And that, that it burst out of sync. And that caught, that's going to cause this, it now has to dissipate that extra energy into the oscillator. So it has extra energy. So now it didn't give away some of those energy by beaming, beaming it out.

[29:47.800 --> 29:51.800]  And that triggers the other,

[29:51.800 --> 30:05.800]  the other bugs to receive that signal. And that causes them to release their energy. And this, and this point, this is the functional expression of energy. It's like, each one is releasing its energy as light.

[30:05.800 --> 30:10.800]  And what's in the signal that's being received.

[30:10.800 --> 30:24.800]  It's weird to say that that's energy, but I guess it kind of is. It's like receiving a really little amount of energy that's increasing its, its voltage or something, or exciting it a little bit more.

[30:24.800 --> 30:45.800]  But even if it's like, it's a really subtle amount of energy, maybe what it's triggering is just, just enough to trigger neural activity, right? It's tracking a change, basically. So it turns energy into receiving, receiving the energy of the photon.

[30:45.800 --> 30:56.800]  In a sense, is like, it's being, it's being converted into information,

[30:56.800 --> 31:03.800]  which is like, it's like

[31:03.800 --> 31:12.800]  the information is encoding the pattern of energy release, right?

[31:12.800 --> 31:29.800]  So it's not necessary. Like it's, I'm like, I'm trying to say, well, maybe this isn't like an energy transfer, but

[31:29.800 --> 31:43.800]  but the, but there is like energy that is being spent both for the transmission and for receiving for like in receiving a signal.

[31:43.800 --> 31:51.800]  Some, some, some energy is being like spent

[31:51.800 --> 32:00.800]  because the signal is, there's a collision, and then that is causing something to move,

[32:00.800 --> 32:11.800]  which generates a signal that starts traveling through, starts traveling through the network.[32:11.800 --> 32:23.800]  It sets off a cascading signal, right? And if there's some, if there's a neuron that is specifically like receptive synaptically to that incoming signal pattern,

[32:23.800 --> 32:31.800]  then that's going to fire. And so now you have pattern recognition in terms of synaptic connections.

[32:31.800 --> 32:44.800]  Right. And so the,

[32:44.800 --> 32:56.800]  but the synaptic connections will also lead to a situation where the action potential is going to depolarize other neurons,

[32:56.800 --> 33:08.800]  causing them to fall silent. It's going to have like an effective range.

[33:08.800 --> 33:17.800]  It's like, it's like a, it's receptive. It's going to have a receptive range. So an effective range is like the inverse of a receptive range.

[33:17.800 --> 33:36.800]  Right. So the neurons dendrite is its receptive field, what it's paying attention to. And the neurons exit terminal is its effective range in terms of who it's speaking to.

[33:36.800 --> 33:55.800]  And of course, you know, of course signals can travel in reverse across, across the gap. And I'm not exactly sure yet what happens when that happens.

[33:55.800 --> 34:06.800]  Neurons set fire together, oscillate together. So each, each oscillator is going to add a geometric effect. This is from chapter two of SYNC.

[34:06.800 --> 34:15.800]  So a large bundle of neurons oscillating is going to have like a, like a geometric pattern of enormous complexity.

[34:15.800 --> 34:32.800]  That's going to represent its, its collective observation power, perhaps, or resolution. The larger the oscillator, the more complex its, its geometric patterns could be potentially.

[34:32.800 --> 34:47.800]  I mean, I think of that as like, like a four, like a 4K screen versus an 8K screen. Like if you have a larger oscillation than happening, then that is going to have a lot more complexity to it.

[34:47.800 --> 35:04.800]  And so like when I think of the global oscillation of the brain, you know, like basically like thanks to the interneurons and the thalamic bridges and the corpus callosum and the other major connective areas, the temporal parietal function and so on,

[35:04.800 --> 35:24.800]  there are, you know, Warnock's area and Broca's area, there are basically the default mode network, the rich clubs. Because of the global, because of the way the brain is connected globally, you know, at the pyramidal cells in the sixth layer,

[35:24.800 --> 35:47.800]  like then, you know, I think of it as the global. So in the book, he's saying like basically like the transformation of, you know, sending a spike from one neuron to other neurons.

[35:47.800 --> 35:56.800]  That it's, it's, or sending, you know, basically having one oscillator knock the other two oscillators and the example of three oscillators.

[35:56.800 --> 36:06.800]  Like, you know, each oscillator like fills up with electricity and then fires and it distributes its energy to the other, to the other.

[36:06.800 --> 36:20.800]  And then eventually, like they all, they all, like, it's like imagine that, he's like imagine that there's a point of energy that's moving from one oscillator to another.

[36:20.800 --> 36:36.800]  And, you know, eventually they all end up firing at exactly the same time. But what happens is when two of them fire at the same time, they become in sync with each other.

[36:36.800 --> 36:53.800]  And so, you know, at some point, but they all, but they all become in sync at the same time. Like you have like all three of them will, like, so A is always firing at zero, but in the, so B and C are always firing at like, you know, between zero and one.

[36:53.800 --> 37:07.800]  Right? But eventually, you know, B and C will both fire at zero at the same time as A. And from then onwards they will always, all three of them will always fire at zero.

[37:07.800 --> 37:20.800]  Right? Because they've sort of like, they've reached a sort of like equilibrium. Right? Where the dot is now sort of like evenly distributed to all three of them.

[37:20.800 --> 37:38.800]  And he was saying that like, sort of, like the way I interpret like the reason there's no bad points is like if you have a point that's never absorbed, it's, even if that point moves around, as long as it's never absorbed anywhere because it's a bad point, it's as if that point doesn't exist.

[37:38.800 --> 37:42.800]  It's as if it's part of the architecture that the other points are moving around.

[37:42.800 --> 37:51.800]  And that's why the system will still reach oscillation. It's why bad points don't actually have any area because they'll just, they don't interfere.

[37:51.800 --> 37:58.800]  And that is sort of like, that's interesting because it's sort of like that idea could apply to building a robust network.

[37:58.800 --> 38:25.800]  Like if you have, if one of the network stations is inhibited, there's like this automatic switch over to another network because it's, it's like there is, there's multiple different nodes and it's going to automatically like skip over the bad point in the situation.

[38:25.800 --> 38:34.800]  Like the network is set up so that if one of them goes down, the signal is automatically routed to the one that's up.

[38:34.800 --> 38:38.800]  So it's like checking for whether the network is up before passing the signal.

[38:38.800 --> 38:55.800]  At each point when the point moves, it's a little bit more, a little bit of it is absorbed. So like the point eventually gets to zero because it's been completely absorbed by the whole oscillator.

[38:55.800 --> 39:02.800]  So it eventually reaches its low number when it's basically, its energy has been divided evenly among all the oscillators.

[39:02.800 --> 39:10.800]  And that's sort of the point in which they've all sort of like eaten. They've all received energy.

[39:10.800 --> 39:18.800]  And now they're just like waiting for the next source.

[39:18.800 --> 39:23.800]  But yeah, they're basically sharing energy.

[39:23.800 --> 39:32.800]  Like whatever, whenever I have extra energy, I'm going to like fire and I'm going to send it, I'm going to spike and then that's going to send energy onward.

[39:32.800 --> 39:37.800]  And so those neurons will be inhibited because they've been sort of like fed.

[39:37.800 --> 39:50.800]  I mean, imagine if your neurons are like a swarm of fish, sort of like they're all like opening their mouths, their dendritic mouths for ATP.

[39:50.800 --> 40:01.800]  But then they start to fill up with charge, which is some sort of like, oh, it's maybe it's symbolic of I've been on full and I've got that ATP.

[40:01.800 --> 40:06.800]  And now I need to release some energy. So it dissipates some energy to this surrounding environment.

[40:06.800 --> 40:11.800]  And what it's doing then is passing on energy to another group of neurons.

[40:11.800 --> 40:17.800]  But that, but its information is being magnified by that oscillation.

[40:17.800 --> 40:31.800]  It's encoding a pattern in the whole oscillator because all the receiving neurons are receiving, you know, it's causing what it's causing cascades of energy releases in neurons.

[40:31.800 --> 40:45.800]  And so there's a physical tracking, there's a physical reaction that is cascading throughout the oscillator that eventually reaches equilibrium.

[40:45.800 --> 40:52.800]  But the equilibrium is sort of tilted just a tiny amount.

[40:52.800 --> 40:57.800]  And that happens enough times and eventually with the equilibrium phase changes.

[40:57.800 --> 41:05.800]  And those phase changes then are going to be tracked by the default mode network.

[41:05.800 --> 41:10.800]  So it's like taking, it's like now you take something big and make it small again.

[41:10.800 --> 41:18.800]  So you basically have the same process, you know, like you have, you're going to have basically dendrites and synapses again.

[41:18.800 --> 41:24.800]  But now they're, they're creating connections between large scale patterns, right?

[41:24.800 --> 41:32.800]  So that the large scale patterns can basically, you know, repeat in slides.

[41:32.800 --> 41:43.800]  Like imagine like you're playing a movie, it has multiple frames and each frame of the movie is one of the cortical, is a pattern in a cortical column.

[41:43.800 --> 41:53.800]  And you have all these cortical columns so you're capable of playing a lot of different frames of the movie.

[41:53.800 --> 42:03.800]  And so, and so the movie is, it's just like, it's like four dimensional matrix or tensor, right?

[42:03.800 --> 42:23.800]  It's time space, space time, and it's like a field array of sensor modalities intersecting in the different field arrays of your sensor modalities being related to one another.

[42:23.800 --> 42:33.800]  Right, let's say that your internal modality interpretations of hearing are very like amplified for you.

[42:33.800 --> 42:40.800]  Maybe you're very like, you're very into like your acoustic way or vocal way of processing information.

[42:40.800 --> 42:45.800]  Like audio books are much easier for you than text books.

[42:45.800 --> 42:53.800]  And it's like your mind is very efficient in processing audio information.

[42:53.800 --> 43:02.800]  And so we have this sort of synchronization pattern.

[43:02.800 --> 43:26.800]  So with LTD, I'm like, you know, I'm thinking that the inhibitory, like the inhibitory process is taking the single, the oscillation of a reaction potential and it's dissipating it across the network.

[43:26.800 --> 43:49.800]  So the action potential inhibits many neurons simultaneously and the, this might trigger, it should trigger an eventual oscillation, but it triggers the oscillation of the network in stages.

[43:49.800 --> 43:58.800]  Because what happens is it's only going to affect like the downstream field effect of the neuron action potential.

[43:58.800 --> 44:03.800]  It's only going to affect a select group of downstream neurons.

[44:03.800 --> 44:08.800]  So only a select group within the oscillator will be inhibited.

[44:08.800 --> 44:35.800]  But that, that it magnifies that one neurons pattern because that group is now sort of like out of oscillation for around with the rest of the neural circuit in terms of like they are desynchronized in one sense from the rest of the oscillation.

[44:35.800 --> 44:54.800]  So they are magnifying the, they are in a way magnifying the action potential, but magnifying it with a signature that's in the negative.

[44:54.800 --> 44:56.800]  So that is, it just places them out of step.

[44:56.800 --> 45:12.800]  It changes the phase, but it changes the phase of a group, the group that were, so it creates like the chance for a negative wave.

[45:12.800 --> 45:22.800]  A negative wave that decreases the chances that like that pushes like the potential pattern of what is activated in another layer.

[45:22.800 --> 45:45.800]  It narrows down, it narrows down what gets activated because, because if you look at the, in the book Sync, they said there's basically there's no, there's no like, there could be like terrible spots or terrible points in the network.

[45:45.800 --> 45:55.800]  And what's going to happen is that their location has no area because if they were a terrible point in one, in one point, then the system just moves around them.

[45:55.800 --> 46:01.800]  And if they move to another point, they're, they're not absorbing energy when they're inhibited basically.

[46:01.800 --> 46:26.800]  So if it's completely inhibited, that's, I think that's the argument is that, is that if, if the neuron is completely inhibited to the point that it's a terrible point, that it's not absorbing anything, then the signal is just going to, I think the best situation would be like if the actual synapse was inhibited, so it just doesn't open.

[46:26.800 --> 46:31.800]  So I'm curious how that would work, but I mean like if it's inhibited, it's not going to fire.

[46:31.800 --> 46:41.800]  And my question before when I was trying to figure out what does that mean that some other neuron would get more,

[46:41.800 --> 47:02.800]  more signal via pressure, like more sodium or something, and I realized that didn't, it doesn't make sense. So not a pressure based redistribution of patterns, but the,

[47:02.800 --> 47:16.800]  the key that increases the likelihood of where, let's say that the signals, say that signals are coming in, okay, signals are coming in, and they have to go somewhere.

[47:16.800 --> 47:41.800]  So you're increasing the likelihood that a, another neuron gets triggered. So like if the, if there's a chance that any neuron in the group could receive a signal that results in it getting fired,

[47:41.800 --> 47:53.800]  the question is can, if you have a whole bunch of neurons, if they become basically depressed, that means they can't fire.

[47:53.800 --> 48:02.800]  But does that also mean that another neuron next to them that wasn't inhibited has a greater chance of firing?

[48:02.800 --> 48:23.800]  So the question is, is the energy distributed sort of like everywhere evenly or is, if one neuron is depressed, does that mean other neurons around the depressed area are more likely to fire?

[48:23.800 --> 48:37.800]  So the depression, the question is like, yeah, is the depression increasing the chance that the other neurons will fire or is it part of creating like a sparse pattern?

[48:37.800 --> 48:51.800]  So that, let's say that the neuron that does, say that there's a neuron that does fire and there's just a couple, there's a few of them, like it's a sparse distributed representation, and most of the neurons don't fire.

[48:51.800 --> 49:13.800]  So, well, okay, actually there is an interesting way that could be worked out. So, and the neurons that don't fire, so let's say that, yeah, so the neurons that don't fire constitute a pattern in a sense in terms of like they're not going to be sending a signal onward.

[49:13.800 --> 49:36.800]  So let's say that their effective field is not sending anything longer. Let's say that the combined effective field in the receptive field of more post synaptic neurons, that you can define a pattern, not just by what fires, but also by what doesn't fire.

[49:36.800 --> 50:00.800]  And so going back to sparse distributed representations, if you are inhibiting a lot of stuff from firing, then maybe, oh yeah, so okay, so I thought, so maybe that's going to make it more likely that the neurons that are firing are going to, in the next, in that moment when those neurons are inhibited from firing,

[50:00.800 --> 50:28.800]  the neurons that are firing might be more likely to form a bond, an oscillatory bond. So, in a sense, the inhibited neurons help define which, the likeliness of oscillatory bonds for the neurons that do fire, perhaps,

[50:28.800 --> 50:45.800]  because there's less to, because by being inhibited, they're removing themselves from potentially being linked, from potentially being part of a pattern, and by removing themselves from being part of a pattern, they're helping to define a pattern.

[50:45.800 --> 51:04.800]  And so in that sense, the neurons, so if a bunch of neurons inhibit that one, are inhibited by one neuron, then that is a group that is going to help define a pattern.

[51:04.800 --> 51:18.800]  Not in the, not in the second layer, but in the layer beyond the second layer. So they're helping to, well, actually no, they're helping to define a pattern. The inhibited neurons aren't, let's assume that the inhibited neurons aren't.

[51:18.800 --> 51:36.800]  Let's say that, for the sake of an example, let's say there's a neuron fires in layer one, and that causes a whole bunch of neurons in layer two to not fire, right, but so only a few neurons in layer two end up firing, most of them are not firing,

[51:36.800 --> 51:49.800]  but the total sparse distributed representation to the layer that's even above the second layer, and I don't know in the visual cortex if that's V4.

[51:49.800 --> 52:16.800]  I don't get why they skipped V3 seemingly, but V1 to V2 to V4, and so in the third area is V4, and if V4 is capturing a pattern, let's say that it's like a TV screen, and it's about which areas of the screen are black, and which areas of the screen are lit up, right?

[52:16.800 --> 52:23.800]  It's a black and white TV screen. Which areas have light, and which areas have bright light?

[52:23.800 --> 52:46.800]  And so it's the neurons that fire physically in high gamma that have bright light, and the neurons that fire physically in low gamma have perhaps just regular light, and the neurons that fire tonically have just really like, you know, just really boring light.

[52:46.800 --> 53:00.800]  Really like, uninteresting, uninformative, right? But then we have these phasic bursts, and these are lighting up, but they're also defining which areas of the screen are dark in the next layer.

[53:00.800 --> 53:17.800]  And so the combined information pattern that defines the next layer, the information pattern that defines the next layer, let's say that the pattern is defined by both the spots that light up and the spots that don't light up.

[53:17.800 --> 53:41.800]  Because that ultimately somehow impacts the final calculation of what is going to cause neurons in the next layer to fire in terms of like, for that, for each neuron synapse in the third layer, it's going to be activated by the coincidences that are below it, and so it can detect.

[53:41.800 --> 53:57.800]  So it becomes like a sparse pattern detector, right? It's looking for really just like connections between two points that it's paying attention to within a certain frequency range, right?

[53:57.800 --> 54:19.800]  And it's going to have some clarity about whether the pattern is specifically those two points if there's a whole bunch of other points that are inhibited so that it's like, if you reduce representation to as few points as many, there's a reduced chance that you're going to confuse one kind of pattern with another.

[54:19.800 --> 54:39.800]  Because if you have too many points firing at once, yeah, and so you'd need to, and so yeah, so the idea is to reduce the number of points that are firing simultaneously, but still have the neuron ready to, basically on the tipping point, ready to fire.

[54:39.800 --> 54:59.800]  Because it's like, it's constantly moving towards a tonic position of firing, right? And so you just, you would just need just the right amount, just the right amount of signal to a sparse, just a sparse signal, you know, with most of the signal, most of the potential signal coming into the neuron inhibited.

[54:59.800 --> 55:19.800]  And so just, so just a sparse signal is enough to push the neuron over the tipping point. A sparse signal that is very, very, very specifically one specific pattern that the neuron is able to perceive that is defined by what fires and what doesn't fire.

[55:19.800 --> 55:43.800]  And so if you have, yeah, like I said, there's a problem. If you have too many things firing, the neuron may fire for a different pattern. It's not related to one specific pattern. There could be multiple patterns that could trigger that neuron to fire if too many, if too many downstream neurons are activated.

[55:43.800 --> 55:58.800]  So I think it's really essential for your clarity, for your sense of clarity, for your, in terms of you being, having a very robust pattern detection to be able to, to be able to have, you know, lots of your neurons inhibited.

[55:58.800 --> 56:24.800]  So that basically defines like a, like a short-term memory expression, which is, which is, it helps, it helps define a short-term memory expression, I think, is by having basically LTD. So one neuron inhibits a bunch of others. It helps define which sort of patterns make it to the synapses of V3.

[56:24.800 --> 56:48.800]  So the brain can be very selective in detecting and reacting the patterns. In fact, that's the whole point of the reconfiguration of synapses in terms of like what signals they're open to listening to. It depends on what connections they have and which of their synapses are active.

[56:48.800 --> 57:17.800]  But, but the same thing is, is that that's true, I think, for the oscillator being able to learn invariant patterns. I think that the membrane of the synapse also has to be able to learn invariant patterns, because if you have a synapse that is sort of inactivated when you get a pattern that's similar to a previously learned pattern,

[57:17.800 --> 57:42.800]  it is plausible that a different synapse could fire instead, it's possible a different synapse could fire instead, and that you could have a pattern that's similar enough to cause, to create maybe an analogy to the original pattern.

[57:42.800 --> 58:08.800]  So maybe you maybe you have an analogy will trigger things that are sort of, they create synaptic patterns that resemble other synaptic patterns. It's like, that would be like an analogy could be like, you have a certain pattern sequence of firing and inhibitions that appear to some, to several

[58:08.800 --> 58:29.800]  downstream neurons in different ways. And that gives basically like all the X terminal neurons are, you can argue, well, if they're sending the same pattern, wouldn't they all develop the same picture? It's the thing is like the differences between each neuron. It's like, it's like, on the one hand, they are all trying to render the same picture.

[58:29.800 --> 58:48.800]  But because their connections are all unique, they're all going to be rendering a different perspective on the same picture. And so that's really useful if you are physically moving around an object that's in space in front of you to see it from different sides.

[58:48.800 --> 59:02.800]  If you're, if your brain is already like in the habit of rendering like multiple unique perspectives of an object, because each each

[59:02.800 --> 59:21.800]  area is sort of like receiving a different, a different slightly differentiate differentiated data stream. It's like the data streams disperse, right, you have the signals come in and they trigger inhibitions and the inhibitions help define

[59:21.800 --> 59:43.800]  help to clarify, you know, they help to amplify it's, it's, it's sort of like the attention schema, right, the attention schema, what was this thing where the brain is able to focus more clearly on the information that's coming in, because

[59:43.800 --> 01:00:02.800]  you know, some, some areas of the brain also become inhibited. Now I have to look at, you know, whether the neuron is inhibiting neurons in the same, I think it's, I think it's that the neurons, the neuron that fires is supposed to inhibit the neurons in its same

[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:19.800]  receptive field, right, like it's like they're all competing for the one who sees the signal first and the one who sees the signal first is going to fire inhibit all the others. And so there can be focus in that sense, like it's, the neuron that fires is going to inhibit the receptive field of the rest of the neurons or something like that.

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:36.800]  So that would imply that that one neuron is defining that one entire string. I don't know if that's the case, but that sounds like that one neuron's exit terminal feeds back into the same layer.

[01:00:36.800 --> 01:01:01.800]  Right, that's, that is a little bit mysterious, but maybe there's like, maybe it's a situation where the exit terminals synapses, so maybe there's synaptic terminals, so maybe one neuron has synaptic outputs to its own layer and the next layer, and the synaptic outputs to its own layer

[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:10.800]  might be inhibitory, and like basically mostly with potassium receptors.

[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  And the synapses to layer two might be more excitatory, where it's, it's, it's, it's opening more sodium channels.

[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:47.800]  And so that means it could, it could send basically either, well basically it sends, it's going to be able to send either excitation or inhibition, but that the idea here is that the excitation or inhibition would be layer based, because it wants to inhibit stuff in its own layer, but it wants to excite stuff in the next layer.

[01:01:47.800 --> 01:02:09.800]  So, I have to look it up. I want to say real quickly, the reason I think of LTD as something that's related to inhibition is that it's the opposite of, it's the opposite in a sense, like, because LTP is related to excitation, in a sense.

[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:19.800]  It's the idea that neurons that fire together become wired together to fire together again.

[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:38.800]  And it is about links between neurons that fire, and that's the opposite process would be like links don't fire together and maybe they be, and maybe that leads to

[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.800]  So links have, I mean, yeah, so this is like

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  So this is like

[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800]  So this is like

[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800]  So this is like

[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  So this is like

[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  Okay, so, I mean, man, this is recording nothing for a minute. So, I mean, like, the thing is like, yeah, so

[01:04:44.800 --> 01:05:13.800]  If neurons are inhibited from firing together, then the neurons that were inhibited, potentially their synchronization with neurons they were firing with is potentially erased. So the inhibition process has a process of taking all those inhibited neurons and desynchronizing them from the rest of the group simultaneously.

[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:30.800]  So any, like, synchronizations they had before are now sort of like, at least temporarily desynchronized. And that, of course, is going to

[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:47.800]  That's also going to affect the tonic oscillator because the tonic, because, because in the tonic oscillation, because now you've changed, now you've changed a small oscillation, you moved a small oscillation out of sync with the global oscillation pattern.

[01:05:47.800 --> 01:06:04.800]  And so the principles of oscillators interact, the principles of the interactions of oscillators seem to say, now, wait a second, now these two oscillators have to resolve each other and to come back and sync with each other. And that process is going to eventually

[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:27.800]  If that process happens enough, the global phase state of the global oscillator, once the two different oscillators are re-merged, is going to be altered. And in that sense, that is basically like, it's like, imagine an oscillator is a point passing between

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:44.800]  Different nodes, and each time it passes to a different node, it gets absorbed by a little bit until, until eventually there's no more energy to pass around because all the neurons are, and that's the, and that literally finds like all the, all the neurons firing at the same time.

[01:06:44.800 --> 01:07:08.800]  Like, if one is firing ahead of the others and it has, it has more energy, and so it throws, it throws some energy around, it knocks some other neurons, and it's losing energy every time it does that. And those neurons have extra energy for a little bit, but they throw it around, and so eventually the energy is just evenly distributed everywhere and they're all firing at the same time.

[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:22.800]  But the, but the fact, but the, so the action of inhibiting a group of neurons now makes that, now makes those, those neurons slower in terms of their phase relative to the global oscillator.

[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:40.800]  So the global oscillator now has to combine with the group of neurons are moving slower. That is going to cause the, the total oscillation to decrease

[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:54.800]  in an amount that is sort of adjusting, sort of like balancing out the increase of one, of one.

[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:19.800]  So let's say that, you know, the action potential fires. The overall, the overall thing is that the action potential is adding in new energy to the system. And what's happening is the inhibition is part of the process of the whole system dissipating that energy in a cascade of activity.

[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:42.800]  And the cascade of activity continues until all the neurons in that group are oscillating at the same, at the same rate. And so if neurons, if the whole group is oscillating slower, then what happens is all the rest of the neurons and then oscillation have more energy to give.

[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:56.800]  Relatively speaking, their charge has increased in that, relative to that, that their phase charge is increased relative to the phase charge of that inhibited group.

[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:12.800]  So that inhibited group is not passing anything on to the next group. And so that is like a bunch of neurons whose clocks have been slowed. So their oscillations have been slowed because they didn't receive something.

[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:35.800]  And so what you have, if you have a bunch of stuff that becomes inhibited all of a sudden, is you have a bunch of clocks that get slowed. And they get slowed in reaction to something that was moving faster. So it's like aphasic is a faster rate that causes a bunch of neurons to become slowed by a tiny amount.

[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:59.800]  And it's sort of shifting the spike into, the spike in one area has become, is a really fast increase of one, in one neuron. But it's creating, it's creating a high amplitude, but low frequency depression.

[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:16.800]  A low frequency, let's see, LTD is long term potentiation and LTD is long term depression. It's creating a low frequency depression.

[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  But the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression, depression, so the global oscillation would still like increase

[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:54.800]  in its time, in the timing of its firing, unless a lot of, unless, yeah, yeah, I think it would be because the oscillation is just dissipating the energy from the activation.

[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:17.800]  But there's still like more energy, but still, like with every, when the neuron fires, like that is pulling in energy. But those downstream neurons are like, take a break.

[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:34.800]  And so the rest of the system, the rest of the system is gaining energy at a faster rate. And so the rest of the system now becomes more likely to fire next.

[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  So there is an impact. So when, yeah, so on balance, the, well, okay, I'm trying to, I was trying to say the rest of the system has more energy,

[01:11:50.800 --> 01:12:05.800]  but it's more like the rest of the system has more of the charge during that interval.

[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:23.800]  Or, no, it's that the rest of the system's charge grows relatively, not because something is being passed to them, but because their charge is growing relatively

[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:36.800]  because it's like they're getting an extra interval of charge versus the depressed neurons are not getting that, they're not getting charged for that interval.

[01:12:36.800 --> 01:13:01.800]  Or they're not passing, they're not passing charge along for that interval. Right, so the depressed neurons. So that, that is, that means that relatively speaking, it is as if the rest of the network is getting more charge.

[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:15.800]  And so, because relatively the rest of the network is getting more charge, because it can, even if it continues to accept charge at the same rate,

[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:36.800]  it's as if it got charged. It's as if that inhibition pattern actually distributed a charge to the rest of the network. A charge to the rest of, I'm sorry, not to the rest of the network, to the rest of the oscillator.

[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:58.800]  So that might, so the rest of the oscillator could, relative to the brain, the rest of the oscillator could be in a situation where its total charge is exactly the same or increasing.

[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  Yeah, so I'm, okay, so this is what I need to get clear about. I'm wondering, okay, so maybe the LTD doesn't, because yeah, the question is, does the LTD process, is it causing the total charge to increase?

[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:39.800]  Or maybe it's a situation where the total charge is not increasing, but the charge concentration is changing.

[01:14:39.800 --> 01:15:01.800]  So, the charge in certain other patterns, relative to the patterns that have been inhibited, those other patterns are increasing without increasing the total charge of the oscillators.

[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:15.800]  The total charge of the oscillator can stay at the same, the total charge of the oscillator may not change at all. It seems possible.

[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:42.800]  So if one neuron fires, it inhibits a larger set of neurons, and they cause a charge displacement, so that the rest of those neurons need to, will, so maybe this increases the chances of a temporal cascade of firing.

[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:54.800]  Right, so you,

[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:12.800]  so, but what is interesting is that, you know, in experiments with, you know, like low frequency trains, so they used high frequency to,

[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:33.800]  high frequency stimulation to evoke long term potentiation, right, to evoke action potentials, which have, that's when you're going to have more spikes, more high frequency spikes, and it's going to create inhibitions, I guess, as a reaction to those spikes.

[01:16:33.800 --> 01:17:01.800]  But when you feed the brain a lot of low frequency trains, like of electrical stimulation, like one hertz, that might inhibit, basically inhibit short term memories in the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude low frequency

[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  oscillations, because low frequency is like, it affects a wider area, what low frequency signals are going to affect a wider area because they have a higher amplitude, they're going to, and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up to a single oscillator with low frequencies.

[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:41.800]  And, but going from basically, but yeah, so the inhibition process,

[01:17:41.800 --> 01:18:07.800]  so going back to the inhibition process that comes as a result of the action potential is going to magnify, sort of like, it's going to, in a sense, magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential,

[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:28.800]  which is, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low, oscillation is going to be a low frequency activity, and the in between step is that a set of neurons are inhibited, a set of neurons that were,

[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:40.800]  that were connected to the firing neuron that were inhibited.

[01:18:40.800 --> 01:19:05.800]  But yeah, I mean researches like really have done, have studied LTP and LDP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude low frequency LTD signals basically stimulating the brain with like a one hertz frequency,

[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:17.800]  that is going to desynchronize groups of neurons, that is going to, not desynchronize, it's going to synchronize them.

[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:28.800]  But there's, okay, so, but the in between stage, so the action potential passes like an LTD signal to a group of neurons, right, an inhibitory signal.

[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:41.800]  So they become desynchronized in a sense, but their desynchronization as a group is a magnification of the action potential moment.

[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:48.800]  That is, that's basically the attention schema mechanism.

[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:58.800]  So that is, it's clarifying which of the action potentials fired, because it's obscuring the ones that didn't fire first.

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:08.800]  But then eventually, so that's like, at that point, that group of inhibited neurons is not at like, they're just slowed down relative to the rest of the oscillation,

[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:18.800]  but eventually that group is going to cause the rest of the oscillator to pass their phases around.

[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:34.800]  So, and until, you know, so basically like the slowed down neurons are going to, it's like, it's like when you, so when an oscillator passes a phase around,

[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:45.800]  the idea is phases like a box that gets absorbed a little bit, it gets passed by neurons, it gets passed by oscillators that have more to neurons that have less.

[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:55.800]  And each time, each of the neurons that receives something from what's being passed to it is going to absorb a little bit of that.

[01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:04.800]  It's been passed something. And then, and then if that neuron fires, it starts passing what it learned around.

[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:20.800]  And eventually, they all are passed around the sort of like they're all like the same amount is distributed to all of them, so that they're all like lined up temporarily, temporally.

[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:34.800]  The point at which all neurons are lined up so that they fire at the same time is the point in which they have distributed that shrinking point,

[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.800]  that point that keeps getting absorbed until that point which is like the excess energy keeps getting distributed.

[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:50.800]  Like they fire because they're depolarizing to get rid of that like sort of like energy tension, like the energy tension is like a split between positive and negative.

[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:59.800]  And so they're firing to get rid of their tension that's above, the tension that is like, yeah, their threshold has peaked and they're firing to get rid of it and they pass it on.

[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:19.800]  But they don't, they only pass on a little bit. And so each neuron like reaches its limit and passes on a little bit and they keep doing this until the amount that's being passed on is just going to,

[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:35.800]  is going to basically cause them to begin to fire in groups. Like because they're just like, because they're all like receiving like the same amount of energy at the same time eventually.

[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:48.800]  Like their balances, like their voltages all become in alignment eventually because they keep distributing the energy to dissipate it until it gets like evenly absorbed by the whole oscillator

[01:22:48.800 --> 01:23:14.800]  and their timing is all aligned. And they are, as an oscillator, they are a sensor array that's waiting for more energy to come into the oscillator from the neuron that is going to spike next.

[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.800]  So after I had this idea about the
