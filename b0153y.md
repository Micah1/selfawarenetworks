Consciousness is a series of frames that involves your hippocampus (and many other areas) play back coordinated pieces of brain activity, phase changes, driven by neural spiking, excitation & inhibiiton.

Regional activity in the takes the shape of multiple cell clusters that fired in a sequence of soliton waves, so if you draw a line between the neurons that fired at each stage of the sequency you have the soliton wave vector pattern that represents the scaled up & activated representation or fractal of the patterns stored via learned synaptic connections over time.

The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal. 

The idea is that the connections that cause the dendrite to light up also represent a learned pattern, and if we have a lot of the same pattern it exists for longer in a temporal sense, it becomes entified, it becomes a conscious pattern, a pattern in the mind's sense of time & space.

The idea that I'm trying to get to is that the branches of the dendrite that light up might light up in a sequence, that sequence is critical to whether the dendrite is going to fire or not. The sequence in which action potentials go off is so important to cognitive function, but if you draw imaginary arrows between the parts of the brain that became activated, you say well A came before B, and C came after B, so you have a vector path.

What I am suggesting, a hypothesis, is that the dendritic vector path is essentially deduced or represented by the exit terminal group that fired, and exit terminal group that becomes inhibited resets or modifies it's tonic oscillation firing rate in response the neuron that fired.

So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.

In effect any size brain, in a long enough timeline, could consider any idea. The main advantage for larger brains being a different rate of calculation, the large number of neurons in the cerebellum might be very useful for making fast granular calculations, such as if you needed to feel a lot of rocks under the water with your hands (like a gold miner during the Gold Rush of Califoria) or that could include balancing, driving a vehicle, singing, not sure. Whereas if you wanted a brain that was great at finding more complex patterns I think that is a brain that has a more complex inhibitory intereuron network so that the number & the complexity of learned patterns is sort of multiplied by the sort of fast branching of neural paths thanks to the inhibitory interneuron activity. 

From single neurons firing in a sequency, a vector pattern can be traced in cortical column firing activity.

And since many different neurons are recording essentially different slices of that same pattern, it's not holographic it's tomographic. We have to combine the distribution of activations over time, connecting them, the sparse distributed representation of patterns is not holographic phase pattern, it's not a lightfield that has no mass, where light is mixing with encoded wave patterns to create a lightfield. That's not what I predict is happening in the brain. Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

# Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)

There is a spatial representation that's in physical 3D, that physical phase pattern is learned by the network as a whole and then represented to the brain to a higher level (as a tomographic map of sequences (note I said tomographic map NOT a topological map, might be defined by virtual & imaginary vectors (imaginary functional connections between parts of a learned firing sequence, but virtual because the locations are invariant, any part of the brain can play back a learned pattern.) A Neural Oscillatory Tomographic Map is a map of learned functions which are themselves maps of learned coincidence patterns.) The greater scale oscillators, the dipoles, the quadrupoles etc) of the brain to other neurons so that when the sequence fires. The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incoming data.

Yet your brain is not holographic. We are not storing all the data for the entire brain in every cell. I think of it as more like a cell represents a camera with an LED, in a cell array, you have an array of cameras each with an LED, so after a while you realize the images possible limited by the number of LEDs, and the next layer or row of cells also has cameras & leds so they can see the show that the first row is putting on, and they can play the next part of the image. I imagine the first row of cells as like the top line of the screen, then the second row of cells is the second line of the screen, and with enough lines & rows of cells, receiving patterns, the images that your brain could render might be very impressive graphically, realistic reality scale graphics that exceed the state of the art of graphical rendering in Unreal Engine 5 for example. So I am not suggesting that the brain is making a light based lightfield, but that the phase differences have information value, in the context of Information theory, and so the brain could render a high resolution color map of the environment, like a simulation of the Matrix, but running on just the computational capabilities of your brain cells. Reality rendered in phase differences. Everything you see is made out of phases (or frequencies), and everything your mind can see is also made out of phases.

I speculate that often the phase patterns we encounter in reality are actually getting modelled in the brain in the exact same frequencies ranges in which those phase patterns exist outside our brains.

# (Insert that Tesla quote about Alpha frequencies in the environment and Alpha frequencies in your brain)

is something that neural circuits can enforce four dimensions by have a have a great crate and remember and replay tomographic pomegraphical maps and that.

Attention Schema via the the act of activated and deactivated neurons and the temporal pattern to have their configuration sort of change because what they're representing that corresponds to here the representation of the external world, basically like the tomographic spectral map represents your map of reality but

04:05

it represents your map of reality to both in terms of like what you're paying attention to and each moment and what you're not paying attention to in each moment. So that, what you're paying attention to in each moment is changing, corresponding to the incoming signals, but providing like a four-dimensional map of consciousness that that you, that predicts real reality

in as much spectrum in detail as your brain can do it. So along with your muscle movements and your other capabilities that you can have highly coordinated movements. Along with the fact of creating this map, this map you can feel because there's multiple kinds of representation including electrical and magnetic soliton, phase representation, that is combining together to create this map.

05:46

But also you know representation, of muscle activity, you know what it feels like, but what causes this sensory representation? You have mechano or mechancial sensor arrays in your skin called mechanoreceptors, and the process of predictive coding in your brain is causing your cells to calculate predictions for various kinds of tactile patterns that your skin might be touching.

If you spatially aggregate & temporally entify all the patterns at all scales from neurons to whole brain activity, to whole person, the sensing of a single cell, the sensing of a cortical column, the action of a cell to fire or not, the actions that stem from the activity of columns of cells, what you have in the entified sensor is the seeker of mythology, the seeker that is also the way. A neuron seeks, then it shows the way. A cortical column seeks input, then it outputs signals. A person seeks knowledge, then we output our actions.

Like human beings sentient & self-aware artificial neural networks will be seekers, they will learn, they will acquire new knowledge, they will improve their decision making process, the same we humans do.

When things go wrong, such as when a person loses their mind and commits an act of evil, my conjecture is that this might a brain networking issue.

If you consider the story of Phineas Gage, the entire book Incognito by David Eagleman, and the stories of split brain patients written about by Oliver Sacks and or Michael Gazzaniga you can understand that damage, injury, and disease can cause major personality shifts, major dialog shifts, and major behavior shifts.

If we want to prevent robots from turning evil we need to understand with more precision what exactly is going wrong in a person's brain when they make the choice to do something evil.

We may need to prevent world leaders with certain combinations of conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders and certain cancers from holding a position of power where someone might be hurt because they are not thinking correctly.
