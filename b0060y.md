Vectors Representation Particles

Below is a comprehensive summary of the key arguments and ideas presented in the recording:

1. A Web Standard for the Metaverse
Unified Interface Concept:
The speaker advocates for establishing a universal web standard for the metaverse. Rather than relying on a single, monolithic application to control everything—as some influential voices (like John Carmack) have suggested—the proposal envisions the metaverse as an extension of the web. This standard would work like a virtual web browser, serving as the central interface where users can interact with various virtual environments.

Personal Information Management and Privacy:
Within this framework, users would have a virtual “profile” or digital persona that encapsulates their personal information. Importantly, this profile could be shared selectively with websites or services as needed. To enhance privacy, the system would also support AI-generated identities. These dynamic, on-the-fly pseudonymous profiles would allow users to interact with online services without necessarily revealing their true personal details.

2. Securing Applications with Homomorphic Encryption
Encrypted Application Models:
A notable technical proposal is to embed a homomorphically encrypted model of the original application. This method would allow computations to be carried out on the application’s data without decrypting the underlying code. In essence, only the necessary functions would be exposed, while the core logic remains concealed and secure. This approach not only protects intellectual property but also enhances privacy and security for users interacting with the metaverse.
3. Enhancing Computational Efficiency Through Sparse Coding
From Binary to High-Dimensional Representations:
The speaker argues for a shift away from traditional binary (ones and zeros) storage toward using high-dimensional, high-fidelity vector representations. This “fractional encoding”—where values aren’t just on or off but can exist in nuanced, intermediate states—could make code more efficient and expressive.

Sparse Representation of Functions:
At the heart of this idea is sparse coding: the process of finding the minimal transformation necessary to go from one state (or sequence) to another. By “refactoring” code into its most compact form—retaining only the essential computational steps—applications could run leaner and faster. This approach mirrors the concept of finding the shortest path or smallest difference needed to transition between two patterns.

Analogies with Natural Processes:
The speaker draws parallels between sparse coding in computers and how human cognition processes sequences. Whether it’s following a conversation, appreciating changes in a musical piece, or tracking the movement of objects, our brains tend to identify and predict the most efficient transformations between states. This natural inclination toward minimizing complexity can inspire new ways to optimize digital computations.

4. Understanding Embodiment Through Dissipative Systems
Bodies as Causally Linked Entities:
Extending beyond digital applications, the speaker discusses how physical bodies—be they humans, animals, or inanimate objects like chairs—are composed of particles that move and act together. In such “embodied” systems, a change in one part affects the whole, reinforcing the idea of joint causation.

The Concept of Dissipative Systems:
The argument is broadened by considering all physical bodies as dissipative systems. These systems (examples include hurricanes, tornadoes, whirlpools, galaxies, and even human brains) operate by continuously taking in energy and then dissipating it to maintain equilibrium. This perspective ties into the earlier discussion of efficiency: just as efficient coding seeks minimal transformations, dissipative systems naturally optimize energy flow to sustain their structure.

Implications for Life and Computation:
By equating humans and other life forms to “embodied atoms” within dissipative systems, the speaker suggests that both natural and computational systems share common principles. Efficient transformation—whether in processing information or managing energy—is fundamental to both realms. The analogy even extends to mundane biological processes (like cellular waste disposal), highlighting the universality of these optimization principles.

5. Overall Integration of Ideas
Bridging Digital and Physical Worlds:
The recording weaves together several advanced concepts—from a secure, privacy-focused metaverse and efficient computing techniques using sparse coding to fundamental principles of natural systems and embodiment. The underlying thesis is that by adopting these principles (minimal representations, secure computation, and efficient energy or information flow), we can create more robust, adaptable, and user-centric systems both in virtual environments and in our understanding of the physical world.

Future Implications:
If implemented, the proposed metaverse standard and the accompanying technological innovations could lead to:

More secure and private digital interactions.
More efficient and flexible software architectures.
A deeper understanding of how natural systems operate and how those principles can inform technology.
This summary captures the multifaceted argument of the recording, emphasizing the interconnectedness of virtual interfaces, advanced encryption techniques, efficient computational methods, and the natural principles of embodiment and energy dissipation.

So, I'm saying that we should have the metaverse, the metaverse should be basically a red standard, right?
Because, you know, John Carmack talks about how, you know, like, it seems like the idea of a metaverse is to have like one app that sort of like...
It's sort of the interface, sort of like controlling everything, like one app that you don't want to have, like this, within like...
But anyway, so just to get to the point, it's like the idea is that you want to have yourself, and so what we need is...
So my proposal for is to create a web standard for the metaverse, which is basically like a representation of your web browser inside virtual reality that stores your...
Stores like an interface for you to have a representation of your personal information that you can share an unfair at will with any website.
And you can definitely, like, and it comes with like AI generated personal information that you could share instead of your own personal information.
Like, it generates like random AI identities on the fly, and so the program is sort of like...
You get some of its input from a simple web post that it checks with.
But even if it's cut off, like, it has a model of... I guess it has like this encrypted model of the...
So it has like a homomorphically encrypted model of the original application so that it can run computations on the original application without decoding the original application.
So the code is effectively disguised. The original code is effectively disguised. And all that remains basically are the functions that...
So that's an interesting way to do it, but like using the principle of sparsity to learn to encode functions could result in basically computer code becoming more efficient.
Because basically instead of storing things in ones and zeros, which is like a two bit interface, what we would do is store high dimensional vectors.
And high dimensional vectors. High fidelity vector representations.
So I mean, I wonder if what I'm thinking is like a computer that's like baseball, somehow baseball, because that's not exactly what I was thinking. I was thinking that like between on and off, that there is like this ability to have like a fractional encoding.
Do you know what I mean? That's what I'm thinking. Like we could have the...
We could be like... See the thing is like the idea of the sparse representation is to find the smallest possible...
Difference that accomplishes the transformation between two sequences.
That would mean like if you have... That would mean like if you have... If your eyes are rolling across the surface and then there's like a piece of cloth on top of it.
It's like what is the shortest possible path between transitioning between these two patterns? So what's happening is with a computer, you're getting two patterns.
It's like, okay, here's a sequence. But the computer is not like learning the shortest possible paths between the two sequences.
That's a higher dimensional level of representation.
When you could encode... Basically when you can encode functions in the most sparse way.
Like when you refactor your code so that basically your functions are expressed in the simplest way possible.
Here's computational steps necessary, which means your code runs leaner and faster.
So that actually is... That would be like sparse coding. Sparse coding is like, okay, how can I refactor my code until the code is so short that it accomplishes a function.
It's like not even clear how anymore because it's like... I mean, I guess it's clear how, but it's like the representation...
It's clear how, but it's clear how in a way that you haven't necessarily understood yet.
But once it becomes clear how, there's like a shorter, easier way to represent that function.
Then you get to a point where even your understanding of the transformation that actually happened between two different steps.
In one example could be between two different steps in a conversation, two different steps in a song,
or two different steps in a physics... Two different steps like a person is literally taking two different steps.
If you understand the sequence of how one step became another, that is you're learning sort of like a function,
or you're predicting the function of certain... the functions between different steps in a moving pattern.
So different steps in any moving pattern of anything in your line of sight, anything that you see.
That is basically going to cause you to...
Basically, your brain is going to learn the sequence patterns between the causal bodies,
or where is the causal body, and a body is a bunch of particles that are moving together,
like a human body, or an animal body, or a chair.
It's an object that has joint causation, because if you push on a chair, you move the whole...
From any part of the chair, you move the whole chair.
So it's a body that is causally linked, spatially and temporally,
like if affecting any part of it affects the whole thing, so therefore it's embodied particles.
So we are all embodied quantum particles. We've become embodied.
Maybe it's a little bit less confusing to say we're all embodied atoms.
Quantum particles, it's true that we're embodied quantum particles,
but it's a little bit more grounding to say we're embodied atoms, or we're embodied molecules,
or we are embodied.
But we're specifically embodied with the configuration of a dissipated system, which is a vortex.
A dissipated system is like a hurricane, it's like a tornado, it's like a whirlpool,
it's like a galaxy, it's like an atom, and even human brain is a dissipated system,
even a neuron is a dissipated system, because the neuron has to take in energy,
and human being has to take in energy, so neurons have to eat, and human being has to eat,
so we're fractals of neurons in one sense.
I need to take in energy, and I also need to dissipate energy to the surrounding environment
in order to maintain my equilibrium, which means, you know, in the sense of life forms,
cells need to get rid of their waste, and human beings need to get rid of their waste,
so cells need to prove, human beings need to prove that poop.
Human being is basically like a bunch of cells that are, that are, that are acting as a,
as a body of positive, a combined body of positive, and this means that,
um, okay, this body.
