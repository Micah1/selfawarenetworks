00:00
All right. Let's go ahead and start the clubhouse chat. I start to run.

00:28
All right, welcome. I I'm gonna invite people up in a second. I am just inviting some people to the room right now. Welcome everybody. I'm going to invite people up to the to up here in a second. I'm just inviting people to the room real quick. I'm just hang on a second.

00:50
We're just we're getting started soon. I'm just making a bunch of invitations. Before we get started. I think yeah, I'm excited invitation, so let me just um, I'll be happy to invite everybody up who's here. And I'll just do that real quick invite. I'll raise your hand. Welcome. Make sure my volume up hey, welcome.

01:18
Okay, so I'm gonna make sure I'm sending invite out to everybody. Okay.

01:28
And.

01:32
All right. Let me just so um. Let's see. I already sent one out to letter let me see and make sure someone out to Ann and then anyone else is just going to raise your hand, alright, so welcome everybody. I'm gonna go ahead and. And just come in at this this is a recorded talk by the way so that because some people don't have clubhouse and like on reddit and so like I manage the the the ready group called neuros and they said hey can you can record it so we can listen to it afterwards and I said okay, I'd have to tell everybody tell everyone that I'm gonna record it and and then Clubhouse says, it's okay, so if yeah, so just let me know if you have any any issue with that and won't make sure to.

02:21
Stop positive recording when you're talking if you prefer but okay, so welcome everybody so I thought this would be a really great topic because there's a lot of crossover between when our link is doing and what you meant is doing and it's also you know a lot to say about, you know physics and nerve gear so I think of mental as closer to the discussion of neurophysics and neural link is closer to discussion of nerve care and so let me go ahead and pause and just walk my everyone and give everyone a chance to say hello and and and and speak.

02:57
Let me know yes a very interesting topic though had a room in the digital humanist club about what is it now? 12 hours ago, something like that on the ethics of newer links, so just looking at human brain interface more broadly and. All of the areas of crossover and that turned us clubhouse rooms tent through into a discussion of you know, every type of related topic but very interesting space and I think with newer link being I guess more evasive and having grander ambitions than a lot of the other select journal devices and ultimately looking at producing feedback and also augmentation for healthy humans not just their shorter term ambition to to treat illness and disability it's.

03:53
A very interesting space and it seems to be a real crossover between biotech. AI computer other computational tech as well as surgical work and even animal research so really touching lots of parts of advanced sites at the moment and the good illustration in my mind of of convergence so on very interested in what other people have to say on a topic one of things.

04:18
I'm David I'm done speaking wonderful. Katarina, do you want to go next? Hi thanks for having me yeah. I'm a newer scientist so I do um, so my main expertise is actually like to physiology and written vivo and in vitro recordings sliced recordings and imaging. And yeah, that's why I'm very interested in them and the topic for human application, so thanks for having me in the room.

04:55
I'm done speaking thanks. Wonderful, thank you and our next speakers. Joseine do you want to go and then Dave and then Kenneth? Sure yeah, so I'm a machine learning engineer at the company on we are working on a clean energy a smart grid and so on however most of my background have been in healthcare.

05:17
I work I booked in genomics and also on clinical trial and so on so yeah and I haven't worked directly on. However many techniques that I use in machine learning actually applied in Windows.

05:41
And Dave. Good morning formulation. I'm Dave my background is on fashion design also computer science, so I have the really diverse interest and I'm here to observe the advancement of the technology and also I'm in the journey to searching of the balance between technology and human touch for the society thanks I'm done speaking dear.

06:11
I get it. Hi, my name is Ken Granville, I prefer to be called Ken my company for the past decade we've been focused on creating a system that bridges the gap between how humans think and how we express ideas how we communicate and how that translates into machine behaviors and some of the things we focused on aside from patents relating to signal processing that allows us to more precisely inefficiently.

06:48
Processed large amounts of data and and map that data to semantics such that we can produce code generate code that's also highly efficient. We've also focused on creating what some would agree is equivalent to the 
periodic chart or the periodic table with elements that allow you to essentially understand what things are made of and composed of.

07:18
And so our equivalent to that is a semantic periodic chart for. Computing where we have two hundred and fifty six elements that map meaning units to what humans express whether it's words or or gestures or typing text or any any signal data basically such that we can then in real time competitively generate highly parallelized code the benefit being the the ability to see the machine produced results and and have that correlating to what you actually met.

07:58
With you can validate. So we call that part natural language dialogue. So it's it's quite a complex and long project that's culminating in some some products coming to market this year. So can regular I'm done talking. Thank you can't Frank do right you want to say something. Yeah sure, you know, thanks Mike.

08:21
So yours, I mean always interesting your rooms. It's like a drinking from a fire hose. So for me I'm in my interest in this topic is essentially connected to my fascination with a brain how it functions and my take on my angles approaches the have a background in I have a crop background a breath better than depths of high consider myself a material engineer.

08:50
So macroscopic and going towards. A microscopic hopefully and see how that you know interface with the brain peered. I chose her to deliver very or you know, the there's no wearables and for me it's especially flexible substrate electronics and yeah things like that also new materials also III also take a philosophical approach as I consider myself also had a, Training in you know, mathematics and know that doing modeling and is like I can contribute, you know, bring all you know, different field of concepts and contribute yeah, yeah.

09:43
Thanks again. Thank you very much. Terita. I am just written currently a PhD scholar and I am working on using applying rather machine learning mostly solid sticks to solving problems related to cramps a prognosis and prediction and to make like detection cheaper with liquid biopsy. I have more discover, you know, better biomarkers and gene panels for liquid biopsy with machine learning.

10:17
I am very. Interested in the working of the brain as well and I think that understanding how the brain works can can be maybe okay to developing a better AI better architectures is just a interesting. I'm not like really well versed in love but really interested. Thank you so much.

10:43
Wonderful. Thank you everybody for introducing yourselves. I'm glad you're all here. So I'll go ahead and start by an introducing what I think is the major link between. Manta and NeuroLink, but I I want to also sort of like give a brief description about what we each of them is just a very general description.

11:04
I know some people have heard a lot and some people have heard a little. So I the big focus the big guy research focus that memento what you know, I guess recently we've been hearing a lot about cortical columns. So there is a researcher called Vernon Mount Castle who proposed that the neocortex was made up of.

11:27
Of basic basically identical cortical columns everywhere and that these cortical columns were helping to organize the the information in the brain. And so when the mental is is saying is like, okay, well we have this idea it's the idea's reference frames and the idea is is reference frame is similar to the relationship described between grid cells and place cells in the entering of cortex.

11:55
And it the idea is that when you have an object in the room with you that object might. Be tracked by at least one let's say let's say it's your front the eating analogies are found because usually if you're using clubhouse you have a phone, right? So you've got them I you probably have at least one maybe a thousands of cortical columns that are each rendering a visual representation of your phone.

12:23
That's that's that's one of the ideas here. But you would also have and I and I asked Jeff Hawkins this time when he came to clubhouse I said, but you would also have like probably a thousand representations of the phone and your audio cortex, which would be. Based on audio representations of what you're sounds your phone might make if you if you bang it on a table or if you if you scratch it with your finger and then you might have a thousand representations of of the of how your phone feels based on where you put your finger and and and that would be in your somatosensory cortex.

13:00
And and then you you'd have the representations in each of your primary sensory core disease would be voting basically, you know, like I guess it's if the patent if the cup is is predicted if the if sorry the cup if the phone is predicted many times in your somatosensory cortex and your video cortex and your audio cortex you the many different the thousands of different cortical columns are each representative of your phone will eventually vote on some version of your phone that is accurate enough and then you don't need a thousand.

13:36
Temptations in each of part of your cement sensory cortex And so in that case they would just you know, I guess they would just compress down to one. But use but they're not but the key thing is so a lot of people don't know that the the columns themselves are not multimodal but you're the audio representation of your phone is going to be linked to your to the visual representation of your phone and this Vatican is for your representation of your phone so that you could trigger, you know, the visual representation the visual activity that correlates with the audio activity from the Visual cortex or vice versa from the outer cortex.

14:13
And so if you so that's interesting because what we're talking about is that the the the representations of what you can see here and feel are basically in the cortical columns and this is this is what can be reached the cortical columns can be reached of course with. You know like the Utah array I guess but there's different, you know, you can stick electrodes and in the brain and stuff like that but but the specifically neuralink is coming along with with really some advanced hardware that you know, when you have when you when they're doing things that are light years ahead of the Utah array in terms of like by putting 16 different electrodes on each of the hairs.

15:09
I say hairs is not really hairy. Each of the sensors strands, that means that you so imagine. I guess I like to. Describe this as like imagine that you you have a completely dark room and each electrode represents a microphone and so if you drop in three different microphones, then you could potentially begin to triangulate where it worse where sound is coming from where it were spike is coming from potentially.

15:35
But but but even then like it like you might think that because a neuron can spike from different places you might think that the same neuron has actually more than one neurons or you might think that that two neurons are actually one. Neuron because you don't have enough information with just three electrodes to really triangulate where where that spike is coming from and and and to make sure that it's just coming from your so it's a lot harder to do imaging medical imaging when you just have three electros.

16:10
So now we have 16 electrodes for each of those strands, and then we have you know, I guess hundreds of strands. You know, so it adds it to like right now, it's like it's like 3000 electrodes and in one area or something like that and I guess I I am but But what what's cool about that is that your ability to develop and accurate space resolution of what neuron is firing and where it's firing and sort of distinguish between two neurons that are close to each other and also figure out when it's the same neuron that's firing in different places that is going to really improve a lot and so I asked what I asked.

16:52
I got to ask Subutai who works with Jeff Hawkings yesterday. I asked I said, so do you think neural link devices would be able to decode cortical columns? And with that lead to decoding, Basically my on my mind I'm thinking this that basically is to decoding images from the brain sounds from the brain and in human thoughts from the brain because it's you know, if if you know basically what we're talking about with with cortical columns is that not only doing sensory the stuff in the Samadison Street cortex, but when you put the talk about the cortical columns in the prefrontal cortex, you know, we're talking about ideas we're talking about you know, you put it in the language areas we're talking about language we're talking about words and so the brains representations of words ideas, you know, how Level concepts the idea so um what super taught said I'm paraphrasing what was that yeah if you put um, if you put um, the electrodes in the right places like all over the place.

17:51
Then you could do things like like figuring out when a imager might my question probably the other part of my questions wouldn't neuroim be able to tell that voting has happened right would end and would would would a neuralink be able to decode cortical columns and voting by listening to individual columns and decoding in them and suputize answer is basically yes, yeah if you stick enough electrodes around in the right places and you forgot what's firing and when then yeah, we could eventually decode these these microcortical columns and figure out.

18:26
Exactly what they mean because figure out they their network protocols between them and we could figure out what the representing in terms of you know, visual what what images and what or what sounds and so on and interestingly I sort of like asked them the question well could I like I this is this was I guess can I say that I said if we have this network protocols could I like you know do an HTTP request to the audio cortex to to query some information from the visual cortex and he said well, you know the aside from the HTTP part, which is you know, Which is it's it's you know, you don't actually use ATP on the brain but but aside from that basically yes because there are already examples in neuroscience history where I mean, like, you know, basically you hear like think about if you hear something that might that might trigger a thought a visual memory of what the visual prediction of what you're hearing, like if you hear it the sound of a a a big cat for lack of like a like a like a puma then you might you might visualize it, you might visualize a bobcat.

19:36
For you know, if for for lack of recognition of what it what exactly it is, right but but but it's a it's a big deal when you hear that sound right so but so anyway, I'll go ahead and pause and and let people reflect on that.

20:01
Well this is can and that is definitely fascinating to me from the standpoint of. Being able to map what is an accurate reflection of a signal that you can verify discreetly not simply as you know, some some textual or other representation but a signal that you can map to meaning and represent in a number of ways we render it as as what it would represent in terms of something that is an image like a black an image of a big cat as you you suggest it.

20:44
I find that very fascinating and it it is very consistent by the way with our work to to sort of allow the emphasis to shift away from what we use in in language, for example, which is text or in in the case of machine code also text to something that's more distinct than distinctively meaningful so that you could verify it and and represent it more efficiently.

21:16
And again can hear us stop talking now.

21:22
We already are doing that. I mean, it's it's simpler but how we do it is we visualize with like and when so my slime's be visualized which types of cells are active in which type of context or during a specific memory that the mice learned and then if we stimulate exactly those cells we get like, The same behavior or.

21:56
Whatever that memory that programmed memory was before we can elicit that and actually we can transfer that from one animal to another that context learning and combined with a fear for example, which is so yeah, I believe that you know, we can't have transgenic people to visualize so we have no other choice than make, you know, grits with a lot of lot of electrodes.

22:30
In humans so yeah if we have enough data, I think we can recreate memories and you know help people that have Alzheimer's and other disorders to compensate basically for some sort of damage or stroke or whatever we just need to record enough data over a long period of time.

22:57
I don't believe that in every human every. Every pattern will be the same so I think to to be able to help people when they have a stroke or when they have some sort of disorder that made lesions in the brain and so on. The ideal situation would be that people would have already those type of recording devices in their brains beforehand when they were healthy so that once the damage occurs then that this type of devices can just you know, take over and replicate what the brain was doing before ideally.

23:47
And doesn't it matter then that there's a semantic representation that can be mapped to the individuals way of thinking. Yeah exactly so not every representation will be exactly the same and every brain. Based on different experiences based on different context data, and so on so. Yes that what what really makes that a big part of our focus of my team is that we've observed what what happens in computing with programming languages and how so much is not represented there's there's an a semantic representation sufficiently to to determine what what does this mean and and context of the the code writer or the person who had the the idea or what they were trying to achieve, you know, so being able to.

24:49
On a very granular level capture that meaning and represented semantically is in our view the way to to personalize it and make it very very much more precise and efficient and and and and we needed to build a a different approach to how the data is managed as well, so we focused on translatable data structures that use sort of a blockchain kind of approach with with hashing ideas or tokenizing all of the very discrete data elements in the math.

25:24
That supports the the machine behaviors. The only question I have for everyone because I'm thinking about this let's say we can map every like all kinds of memories out and we can replicate them and make you know people that get Alzheimer's or so remember and perform a regular life will it?

25:51
I'm not sure if you'll feel the same way because you won't have maybe you don't have this neurotransmitter release in the same way and in the same abundance. Because you have an electronic device taking care of retrieval and so on so um, it will be a memory retrieval but it won't maybe have.

26:22
That much often emotional. Link to it but that's a very good point if I may real quickly in other words the person feel fear, when when they heard the big cat or did they feel a sensation of delight because they actually know the big cat or own the big cat or have trained the big cat or you know, a myriad of possible emotions are those also retrievable.

26:58
So you're referring to Qualia. That is that right, that's what. So I mean, I yeah we're talking about a qualia being represented in your basically your internal representations of what you're seeing and hearing being represented in the my in the cortical columns of your visual cortex and your audio cortex and what you're feeling represented in the in the in the cortical columns of your somatosensory cortex and that being decodable pattern that neural link will be able to detect because that is it's going there it is going to be decoding that.

27:41
And then so Katarina was just saying that she's already doing about version of this with with the animals as she works with with the mice and it's it's probably a more basic version like you like the I imagine I have never seen kinder in his work, but I imagine that that that there's a very controlled environment there's like probably one item at a time and in in the room with the mouse so that makes that might make identifying whatever the mouse is interfacing with a lot easier than then, you know with a real human being if you're not into controlled setting if there's like tons of things.

28:16
How is the neuroimagers supposed to figure out what is what right you have this? I think you'd have to simplify the environment a lot but also human beings might have might have a much more complex pattern and figuring out which part of that pattern is is the correlate to the the thing that you want to detect is probably to be difficult because it's multi it's a it's a temporal pattern that has many different well.

28:42
I don't maybe Katerina can speak to this but but, My question actually to Katarina is not only that but but also about stimulation so so so someone said someone said that a neuroscientist in another group said that neuralink is probably going to move around I read in the book rhythm of the brain that these brain computer interfaces can't move around every time you breathe including like the the the kind of electrodes they call what is it like it's something like try electrodes I forget but um, But they they can move around a lot and that means if you're trying to stimulate the brain.

29:25
I that that electorate might stimulate a lot of things that you're not intending to stimulate and that's very messy problem and so the neuroscientist that I've talked is Scott F Scott he was saying that what could probably happen is that you might you could end up stimulating a whole bunch of things you didn't intend to stimulate because you might have a neuron that is is running through the area that you're that you're stimulating and but it actually is also like going to the other side of your brain or to the other side of your body, maybe it's one of your foot or something or In any so you could be doing a lot of accidental stimulation and for that reason he was saying that he that doing simulation human being might be a waves off but I'd love to hear sort of like what Katarina thinks is is the deal some ideas about how we might have like a really high resolution stimulation of of the human brain and I guess we'd have to adjust it constantly if these sensors move around.

30:28
Yeah some new technology development that we have in the institute also for monkeys. That so the implants I use like previously the implants that I used you had to like drill big holes in the skull and fix them with dental cement because we of course want to be sure but I did so how I stimulate this different is with oxygenetics.

30:57
I'm not sure so there's a push from some groups to get it into humans so the the good thing about opportunitics is that you use you use a genetic code and a user specific promoter so you can you introduce those and into the brain and by using those specific promoters you can choose which type of neurons and bridge and in which brain regions.

31:32
By injection location and I should express. That light receptors they are from algae and by using that tool you then introduce a light source into the brain and that's how we do it an animal studies to be very very precise with the cell types and which cells and where you want to stimulate and limiting toxicity like excitatory toxicity with electric stimulation, if you use light, it's it's, Less and you have a more temporal precise way of stimulating and milliseconds.

32:21
I can stimulate for only one millisecond and only elicit one action potential or even if I use less light. I don't even unlisted the action potential that I just elicit the EPSC so um, which is under the threshold that's the neuron gives this information to the next neuron just I just make this neuron a little bit more excitable on a specific.

32:48
Regional to then red but not the whole neuron gets excited. So it stays in that neuron. So that's the level of specificity like location-wise and temporal-wise and. And the amount of stimulus we want to listen. That's what we have in animals. So to fix that problem. I think the the solution would be to use that in humans there.

33:22
I think only a very few clinical trials for people that are blind that are starting to use opportunitics and humans. We don't see too much neural damage. We don't see brain tumors with that technology, so. And it's been done now for over 10 years when I first started making transgenic mouse water, it was in 2007 or so.

33:54
So. I think that would be the way to solve this and the the other thing is you can also at the same time introduce proteins that give a fluorescence signal at the same time so you could also record what's going on in the brain and you can trace those specific neurons that express those over time while they let's say learn a fear in a specific context and we change the context and, See what those cells are doing and then we extinguish it and then we see how the excitability changes.

34:42
So this would be the technology to solve that problem. So what does dozens do though is fix neurons when you get outside? So that that wouldn't address that issue. Um, so can what you said it made me imagine that there could be a future version of an early that has light electrodes and that that the masses will be basically they're they're DNA will be altered so that they're they can respond to genetics.

35:18
Is do you think that's realistic that that that often and genetics could become like a mass market solution for human beings down the road or is that just unrealistic? Oh, Some push and extreme situations right where people are totally blind and they really want this because they don't want to stay like or let's say severe parkings on like that you are on uncontrollably, you know, you can't you can't basically live your everyday life anymore like your life quality is so low that the the cost of the risk is you know, how to you know, it just outweighs the, Laid on I think.

36:07
At some point it will I'm not sure how soon once we have more we could also we don't have to have it permanent right we could also just introduce like we are doing right now with the like we could introduce our names instead and and have like a temporal like that, it doesn't actually change the genetic code itself we could think about those type of solutions but, I think at some point we will be more comfortable with changing, you know, the the genetic sequence and it won't pass to the next generation right so how we do it in mice's we we introduce a virus we inject it in the specific brain region needed.

36:58
And it will as I said only be expressed in those neurons and those cell types, so the risk is relatively low and if you don't inject to it but as I said what this won't fix would be? The person that has a stroke in that brain region you can't you can't regenerate cells with this technology and with electric stimulation you basically I if I understand it right you want to basically compensate for a loss of brain tissue basically you would then need to introduce stem cells that have these receptors which all is also being studied right now, there's like spine.

37:47
You know mice that have neurons using opportunities and then they can walk again basically yeah before I say anything else I want to give the three new speakers on the stage a sock. I might be mispronouncing your name. Carrie and Sam all of you can take a turn.

38:13
Hi I'm such. A Mexico. I generally. And I'm extremely interested in the brain. I think it's like literally the most amazing machine in the universe like yeah, it's really amazing and I would really love to channel my career towards neuroscience, so I these is a really interesting topic for me and I was actually going to mention also early on the, Discussion up to genomics button capturing now also mention it so well, it's not set necessary now but thanks.

39:04
Carry if you want to say anything. Yeah, hi guys. I'm Carrie here thanks for having me. I also wanted to second what Katarina was talking about in. Opportunitics and that's why I put my hand up but she's pretty covered a lot. I think one of the other things is just that ability with optogenetics to actually identify neuronal circuits so just as a means of gathering that sort of base data that we're going to need to be able to start actually manipulating these networks.

39:40
I think you know is is incredibly important and that might be something that takes a long time, but I think with AI and, Other technologies and you know, it could be you know, more expertness exponential than we expect yes, so that's what I want to add, thank you. And we Sam.

40:07
Yeah, I I've been kind of we had a good conversation the other night on on the app and a different room talking about. Hawkins theory and how it relates to the stimulation and that and I've been kind of pondering it over trying to from the position of what you know, let's say the theory is correct and well how does that really end up connecting with neuroscience and you know what needs to happen next and in BCI's but uh, I won't dive down that rabbit hole I do have some you know kind of deeper concerns with the problem a hand, but I was just kind of building off of the, Conversation about opportunities.

40:57
You know, it's a there's there's some serious limitations with that and humans in my opinion, you know, none of the transgenic techniques or anything like that that are real robust and animals are something to even think about in humans, so we're we're down to thinking about, you know, viral using viruses to express these options and in neurons and you know, it's interesting with it how targeted that kind of thing could be but you know, right now we're very bad at these things when it comes to.

41:32
Getting them across the blood brain barrier, so we're talking about a very invasive local injection that would need to happen which is you know, I mean as an alternative to a full-on neurosurgery that sounds like a good alternative but it's you know, something that would need to happen and you know to kind of point at the deeper problems here, you know, these the the lot of these virally expressed options they only last for a certain amount of time, so the question is the real question is even if you did.

42:08
Good at doing that and we could do it safely in humans what is it that you're going to do with it because you're gonna you're you're gonna have a small time window it's not like you're gonna be able to monitor and stimulate these these neurons for for life, right so we need to understand what it's gonna take to open up plus the city mechanisms and it's gonna need to be paired with therapies, we need to understand how movement is related to what cortical calms our processing and incorporate that into our therapies.

42:43
You know, combined with stimulation and maybe stimuli but there's just a you know, there's there's a lot of big deeper problems in between that being useful and and even you know getting it to work and practice.

43:08
Anyone can yeah me I also question I'm deaf here if I understand you correctly kept arena that you already can achieve the food to blacks that mean you can read the signal and yet you can stimulate the signal to the mice so in this case the devil trigger you that a certain action or certain things that can be ready stimulate from the universe to the object, so are we reading the signal from the object or the the, The subject itself or is it a signal that is broadcast from the universe that is the first question the second question will be a human is a more complicated creatures that we can really learn and read associate the whole experience of all things when when this action is triggered the association of the brain signal and metrics might be change and and relocate to other location the did you already have.

44:18
Studying into that direction and then speaking this here.

44:26
I mean, so if I understand so the signals so when it's. Okay, so there are different ways of studying the signals of brain and vivo when we use like calcium imaging or these. Engram transgenic mice that those are fluorescence signals and we of course always check how the basil or fluorescent signal is of the brain and tissue that doesn't express so that's how we basically make sure that we are recording the right signal when we record from cell cultures or from sliced tissue.

45:16
There's a bigger risk and electric like recording of electric current or. There we. We have Faraday cages around we we the the signal is actually really really small so we need amplifiers and so we have to make sure that the noise is low that the signal is high compared to the noise and yeah, as I said, we have fired a kid just around we can't have like nowadays the amplifiers are pretty good.

45:57
At blending that. Including noise so yeah and then we stimulate the cells with either oxygenetic we like. Actually just up to genetically nowadays or with and then see how drugs do and things like that so and then those signals change based on what we do to the cells and then we do control experiments, of course always we for example just inject or have like a virus that has like the promoter but then not the the option encoded in there but something else like let's say just GFP or something and, Then we do the same procedure and then if we don't see a signal then the the signal that we recorded in the actual experimental mice should be real so we always do a control experiments.

47:04
We also just inject the vehicle, for example and so on and so forth, so we make sure that we actually recording what we. Attempt to record so I would say we use control experience to make sure of that and then the options it depends so transgenic mice have the the the channel robs, you know, NPR whatever you express their whole life in there and the levels don't change so we like to use those for for experiments.

47:43
Where we let's say come compare. I'm different groups of animals of treatments or we want to compare different brain regions because if you inject the virus you always have to make it's it's more complicated because you always have to make sure that you have the exact same amount of virus and you always inject it in the it fits a deep brain area and very small brain area that you hit the target and you always are very consistent with your injections so um, that's why.

48:18
You need. To make it easier especially for lab technicians and and students we prefer using transgenic mice that express it in the brain regions we wanted to express with the virus is different we have to wait for a few weeks depending on the neuron type and if we want if there are long projections we have to wait longer.

48:43
But the waiting time is actually more the issue not the issue in my eyes and read that we have that they become the active overtime they say they stay in there for let's say months of experiments, of course the life span of a human is different and we would need to check but my brother for example is a neurosurgeon he uses the brain stimulation for Parkinson's and and other type of disorders and those are really major brains.

49:18
Surgeries so just injecting a virus and injecting electrode like a cell light sources nowadays, we have very very small LEDs that are flexible and so on I I think would be a less major surgery than what we have right now, so this would be an improvement and since we inject directly into the brain we don't have the blood brain barrier issue.

49:54
I'm done speaking thank you. I just had an idea that if anyone wants to let the current speaker know that they have something to say they could flash their microphone and then if you're speaking currently you can if you see someone flashing your microphone, you could you could hand it to them directly so go ahead and hostane.

50:10
Thank you very much you're very interesting panel and so. Did my question. Or scientist and here he also walked up to genetics and my question is that can be like a stimulate a neuron which two separate basic resources one for example with simulated with the photon that you know that creates, you know beyond you know for up the octagonetics and another one, you know from another for example source so so the idea is that in a way like more or less this is regarding the question that we sound brought that.

50:53
What happens when basically no longer that virus has any effect on on the neuron and so on maybe once you know, two separate the stimulation come to a neuron then after a while you can turn on turn off one and the other one actually continues stimulating it. You know what I'm mean, like more like you conditional stimulation or something like that.

51:24
And if one of our geneticists in the room wants to take and wants to respond.

51:33
You can also yeah you can express different type of options but you mean then also then using let's say electric stimulation separately yeah that so I started talking about the. Wrote up like option version was because currently the issue. I think is that those electrodes, um, When people move around a lot they change their position and then you could be ending up stimulating completely wrong brown brain regions and and and neurons and yeah and I was just introducing what we to an animal to solve these because we had those issues and so.

52:31
That's what we use and animals so um because we had those issues and we want we need to be very precise because if we want to know which pathway or which cells subtypes or how many let's say we want to know how many neurons we need to make an eye blink movement, so these types of questions we could answer with this technology to be very very precise and yeah, but you can also use options that are inhibitory you can use on.

53:06
Options that have a diet that are active with different types of wavelengths so you can distinguish between a brain regions that you want to excite because now so many options and then there's absence with cold lights, so you have bioluminescence absence. So you could you could combine different types of absence to distinguish brain regions cell types and so on and then distinguish it that way yeah so good that doesn't go through one example, so I probably like clarified my question so listen, for example.

53:45
I already have learning you know in my brain and it's optogenic, you know enables one and so anytime for example. I hear a specific sound. You know that there is also a signal goes into my brain that make me hungry, you know, so so basically that of the original genetic signal is for making hungry and then after a while I associate these two together, so even if you don't basically trigger that that signal, you know, link anytime I hear that sound, you know, I get hungry so in a way now my brain, you know, the plasticity of my brain cause that I triggers on something which is not.

54:32
Typically, you know trinkets this one. Yes, yeah, sorry. I didn't understand your question before yes, we can definitely do that and people have been doing that in animals, for example day, we reassociated traumatic I could bet memory with a reward system and then the bad memory that wasn't a bad memory anymore it was a it turned into a rewarding memory with a combined with a signal so yeah, we can definitely do that but as I said this won't this one solves the problem of.

55:12
Damage tissue like once outside my kicks in or worse a lot of seizures over time make lesions in the brain severe depression make lesions in the brain and the loss of that tissue we can't with this system create new cells what we can do is facilitate the implementation of stem cells so that they will be integrated and also active in the system we can facilitate.

55:47
That with with absence but no one of the things that I think we send said was that it so with opportunitics you basically described a proof of concept for when you are able to decode the cortical column by by with opportunitics and then you're able to to visualize what the sequences of neurofirings mean and then transfer that to another animal so you could or you could just, Basically you could implant memory and that could be I guess a visual memory of something bad, but then you could reshape it by recombining that memory to make it into a visual memory of something good and so this is it basically perfect concept that basically establishes that the neural columns that that the courts are the cortical columns are are when we decode these in human beings at a higher resolution, we're going to be able to do just that we're going to be able to grab high resolution images from.

56:57
The human neocortex in the cortical columns and transfer high resolution images to other human beings to pull images that have one person's brain and stimulate another person's brain when that would be basically the the the future generation like a next generation of this sort of proof of concept that you have now and a more primitive way with mice so basically this proof of concept that you're doing with opportunitics establishes the the basic idea it and so I wonder if a couple things one is.

57:32
A new. To share some resources with all of us. Katarina that's like maybe like a paper or two that's really great for talking about just this exact thing of transferring the memory from from a decoding the cortical column and transferring memory reshaping the memory and just a couple of resources if you want to share you could you could put a prime on your Twitter or something if you want to.

57:58
Yeah, I can I can do that. I can do that later after the conversation. I'll put on up on my Twitter some you know, some papers I have to have to. Find them and but I can put them up. I'm not sure if they are all open source but.

58:18
If you direct message me or something. I can send the PDFs as an email then or something. Okay so I also want to ask you another question so there's another hypothesis so it's not just a narrow link that is there's a lot of different new brain computer interfaces that are being developed so it's not just an early link it's not just oxygen and it's there's also something called microwave imaging.

58:42
I wonder if anyone in the room has heard of that and could tell us more about it there's there's there's new there's a new thing called well there's there's an old there's it's not it's not new but it's sort of like what's happening is there's electrical is EIT or electrical impedance tomography what's new about it is people are using a deep learning with electrical.

59:02
Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.

59:37
EEG or the firing speed of you know base basically the same the same rate that the neurons are firing just like what what? Neural link is doing but it's going to be able to you're going to be able to basically have this high resolution holographic image which can by a command's laser with functional air for spectroscopy or laser with doppler and you're you're doing holography you're reversing the refraction of light so you can you you're combining this with ultrasound to get greater depth so you can get all the way to the thalamus although to the core of the brain through completely through the neocortex and and then the idea is then that's that's just for the imaging part so we have well very precise imaging.

01:00:21
Of down to the neuronal level at this at the speed of EEG but the idea here is the stimulation might happen with ultrasound so I kind of wanted to ask them the neuroscientists in the room, what do you think about the possibility of using ultrasound, you know in combination with neural link or or any of these other technologies to to be the, The the tool that's gonna allow us to target and stimulate individual neurons and individual parts of of cortical columns and I'll pause there.

01:01:08
I am I'll jump in there like. I it's not a lot. I haven't read a lot on the topic. I know that they were using ultrasound to disrupt the blood brown barrier. Target cancer cells and even plaques in Alzheimer's disease and I I'm not up to date on that so I'm not quite sure where the current research is.

01:01:37
Thank. You anyone else?

01:01:47
Michael may I ask a question yeah the example the example that you give that. Can you still hear me because I getting a very bad signal here yeah okay, um, so if we be able to project. A set of action or memory to another subject and in terms of reading device as a researchers you are reading the brain signal while if there is a projection is going on do you have a device that detected the current signal that I'm reading is originate from the subject itself or that is some other broadcast is going on, so my question will be a do we have the device to detect that at this moment and then also the spectrum of.

01:02:41
Energy if we talking about the full spectrum of the frequency from sonic vibration and then to static EEG and then from static EEG and then they go higher to light and then our is our reading devices are targeting into the correct spectrum of the original signal to the brain to trigger some action and or metrics of memory to trigger a movement or something so is the researchers aware that the full respect.

01:03:16
Of the frequency that we are researching now they are limited to the EEG limited to a light lightweight but do we look into the area of the spool spectrum and the change reaction of the energy change form so that we can drew into the most foundation of the original signal was created and done speaking this year.

01:03:48
Okay anybody want to go? I don't know the answer does anyone else want to answer it? I am. Of what you are saying sorry Dave, but um, are you talking about the actual frequency is in like what hurts um, like how many hurts like for example? I use low intensity repentive transcranial magnetic stimuli stimulation, which is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and we use that to modulate those neural pathways and you can use for example one hurts.

01:04:29
To inhibit a particular pathway or ten hertz to excite that pathway is that what you're talking about, sorry. Yeah, if you if you look at the energy transform change itself something from Sony we have the object vibrate and then from the vibration in my create the magnetic hurts that you are currently working on on your reading device and then from the magnetic and then installing more intensified it transform into an another type of energy form, so in terms of technology as a researchers, we only limited to the technology we having right now that for example, maybe you are reading from the magnetic.

01:05:14
Field point of view you are reading from the frequency point of view but the full spectrum of energy transformation that if you are doing how to say do master the whole change of the transformation, then we might only research on the certain area in a gap that we don't know that after this EEG from one hertz a vibrate intensively a transform into another and other type of energy that can be measured also so so I'll be reading at.

01:05:49
The root source of the origin grain signal creating the creation itself, so if you can tap into the root source then we how to say we can have more accurate data, for example if we can be detect is this brain signal is created by the subject itself that means the original subject itself or that is some other stimulation or broadcast that from external effect that is affecting the brain itself, do we have a device to read that at this moment.

01:06:24
That that was my second question yes, we we have like we can record the signals of the cells with electrodes and so we can do it two ways we can record the electric signal and what we can do also is if the animals have either voltage sensitive dyes. In the brain or in the brain cells or like a genetic encoded.

01:07:02
Signal of for example calcium signal or chloride signal then we can also visualize that activity. So we can and then the frequency actually did some work recently where a changed basically a memory from. Like. I I listened to the long-term memory with high frequencies simulation and then I turned down this memory like I did compulsive behavior.

01:07:35
I I generate a compulsive behavior specific one to a specific movement and turned it into a compulsive behavior with high frequencies stimulation and then I did low frequencies stimulation that is known to introduce LTD like long-term depression and then I, Got that that compulsive behavior back to our normal level with it, so frequency matters for simulation.

01:08:09
Thank you. That is amazing. Please share your research paper when that's out. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, thanks I wrote it in the way that Roverio's rejected like a I started the discussion with going back to when Freud first Fright was actually the first one to do this imprinting because for those for this stimulation what I did I.

01:08:40
I I do those simulations in the stride and the dozer them with this known to be responsible for habits learning. And I did it in the slides by injecting and sensory motor cortex the opportunity tools and then the make dollar to represent basically sensor motor signal from some sort of movement and then represent an emotional Q labeling will then make the line and what I did this with a bunch of brain regions and the highest upstate.

01:09:17
I could generate was like I used a thalamic input because the striatum is the basal ganglia is where like, A lot of inputs that generate then the movement or stopping a movement gets into like all that information gets integrated and then sends out what we basically in the end, do do we do a movement or we don't.

01:09:39
And, So the, So the that's why it's a very cool model to test those information integration type of things and turning it and and see an outreach and behave here. So, So I did that and then I did it in vivo like when the mice were digging, for example.

01:10:05
I stimulated and I only really needed a dove like 10 minutes a day and after 5 days if I did this every day for 10 minutes. They would like compulsively dig or they would compulsively groom more, you know different behaviors but it wouldn't affect other behaviors. So I decided thing with you know fried that said this already that this would be important for a long to have a memory and as to have some sort of emotional cue attached to it, you know, 
the reviews didn't like my whole and then heavy and so on they didn't like it.

01:10:49
After change my discussion everything. That was I was wonderful. Yeah, thank you so much Katrina that I want to explain to everyone here in the group why Katarina's answer also really answers to Dave's question. So so Dave's question the way I would rephrase it the way I think about it which is it's not it's not a better way of rephrasing it but it just helps me to understand it to think of it of days question is like, what is what what is the how what is the granularity of?

01:11:24
The measurement of the neuron of the energy of the neuron. What is the are we doing like core screened measurements or you know, basically getting like very precise changes in energy and infrequency and an amplitude and and and so on I I want to say that there we can add more to what what's being detected in terms of like amplitude and we can go even in it in more detail back to Kettering in a second, but the reason what Katerina said was very was a great.

01:11:59
Answer was because basically by explaining that, you know earlier saying that basically if you if you can if you can listen to the neuron to to to the degree that you can figure out if it's about to fire like if if that if the dendritic spike has happened but not the action potential or if if NDMS bikes have happened, but not the dendritic spike and and so if you can listen that that's a very fine grain level with detail.

01:12:31
What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.

01:13:02
You know basically but then the other thing that that Caterina said was that the the grant in terms of you know, the granularity of the encoding when you're talking about, you know, like first of all eliciting elicit illicitating a long-term memory with with high frequency stimulation and then generating compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation, so basically making this like stimulating this neuron so they can basically or micro, you know, micro circuit or micro column or cluster of neuro cluster of.

01:13:37
Cells it represents the neurosur circuit whatever catering stimulated in and you welcome to give us more detail on that in a second that caused the animal to have a high frequency response that what what generated compulsive behavior and then Caterina reversed it by using LTD long-term depression to issue a look frequency stimulation.

01:14:06
I mean to use low frequency stimulation to basically calm down the animals behave. Or to slow down the the high frequency firing of that neuron or that micro cluster of neurons and and it this is this extremely profound because it speaks exactly what David is saying about the the the granularity of the of measuring and stimulating or the course coarse grained measurement and coarse grained stimulation of of energy at the neuronal level and the micro micro circuit micro neural circuit level so I want to go ahead and hand it back to can arena if you want but I just wanted to.

01:14:47
Share it the meaning of that with the group and.

01:14:56
Yeah you explained that's really what? Thank you so much. And sometimes explaining it. Because I'm doing the work so it's sometimes you're stuck in the subject so it's harder for you to explain it but yeah that's um that exactly what we are seeing that the the frequency of the stimulation that type of which which type of input is stimulating these brain cells and in the slice at least which which doesn't always mean it's one hundred percent also and, Vivosystem the same way but at least in the slice we can see also that the location of where we stimulate in the dendritic arbor makes also a difference, so we need to weigh less, um, Way less um synapses to be stimulated on the distal areas of a dendrite in the striatum then in if you get closer to the solar then you need more more sign up to the activated and that's because the the dendrite the dendritic arbor the shaft like, Not this fine the the eyelid selves the chef they ask thinner, so I bet the spine size is still the same so the impact of those mines being activated is bigger, so um strong inputs of chorus.

01:16:43
Are ripped are represented by being on more distal areas of of the land right so. I think we have to. Call to know um like to that type of resolution and it's known that these type of subcategories of mapping of the neuron itself, it's supposed to be even more important and human.

01:17:13
Neurons the camera paved the cat, there was one paper after find that where they somehow were able to have more shorts amount of time. To keep a few actual cortical human brain cells alive and record from them and do some electrophysiology on them. Yeah, so so the the importance of like the dendritic argument allocationization and the integration of information is way more complicated and more precise even than in neurons from from breath and mice that we usually record from I'm not sure how much we need of that to to let's say to evoke a memory again in a person.

01:18:09
I don't think we need to be that precise for just recall our memory. But I'm not sure I can say but that's my thought we sound did you want to talk about that paper yes so I I'm kind of in limbo with that lab. I've rotated with the lab that did that work hard at lab MIT not a you know, we're still working out potentially he and he may be my co-advisor but anyway, nonetheless.

01:18:46
I know the paper very well, they're so that the basic idea with that. Actually by the way, did you want to say the title of it for the group yeah, let me get the exact title here.

01:19:03
I got a term in computer. Um, Yeah, just give me a second that way you guys can have a look at the paper if you want it has a great eye graphical abstract that maybe will help if anyone's trying to follow along. So I'm maybe I'll maybe wow we sometimes do not just reset the group real quick so we're talking about the basically we're talking about neurophysics and nerve care but specifically how numenta and neuralink sort of overlap how basically the that that the big idea from the new book of from the mentor talks about how cortical columns may be used to represent what you're seeing and hearing and and, And what you're what you're touching and how all of them are, you know different areas of cortex and but they're all sort of linked together and so they'll vote and and and and and then that will be how your brain can represent objects to you but the thing is quote-to-coms are in reach of of neuralink and and other brain computer interface technologies, which is why we're talking about, you know, the deep the potential for for decoding our thoughts and and our our, What we can see in here, so I'll go ahead and pass it back to we some.

01:20:31
Yeah, so the title of paper is enhanced and ready compartmentalization and human cortical neurons. And I'll say I the the reason the lab was going after these kinds of things with what they're thinking about here is neurons being much more complicated than the models that are being used in an AI currently with some exception, you know, people some people are already working on incorporating dendrites but that they're much more powerful that we could look at think about neurons much more like computers and the brain much more like the internet than the traditional model which is like thinking.

01:21:15
About the brain as a CPU and neurons as transistors and this is a very compatible with what Jeff Hawkins says has has put forth not just because the attention to dendritic computation but that this notion that you know, there's a bunch of computers that are connected in the brain instead of the brain being a computer so the the basic idea with this paper is this there they wanted to compare across rats and humans.

01:21:49
And just so we don't like lose anybody that but you know, so we get a little bit of context here what we're talking about is these neurons embedded in the neocortex and they they then neocortex has many layers so you can think of you know, it kind of sheets of different types of neurons that are kind of stacked up in six layers and that cells are looking at our parabola neurons are output neurons, so they have very large soma somatic soma somata that are in the deeper layers and layer five and then they have a big.

01:22:24
Trunk that comes off of the soma and it reaches up through the layers and it branches it looks like a big tree so the dendrites just branched in the the the neurons that were they were looking at in this study are called tough dendrites, so they have they have a really big arborization and layer one near the top of the cortex.

01:22:46
So the first thing there they wanted to do is compare these exact types of neurons in routes in humans. And they do this really heroic patch clamp technique went in the rat and when I say heroic, I mean, there's if there's a dozen labs on that that can do this these these kinds of measurements.

01:23:10
I would be surprised and they had they take a very very tiny electrode and they put it in the top and the dendritic tree way up right where the the trunk starts to really start to branch out in layer one and they put one in the soma and so they're measuring somatic.

01:23:30
Voltage and dendritic voltage at the same time and what they then do is they can inject currents in the dendrite and measure how strong that influence is the soma and and and so so forth, you know the other direction and what they find is that the the rats have you know, some attenuation so they they compare layer two three cells which are so smaller cells those start in the third seg in mice layer of two three are merged together a compared to a human.

01:24:05
So they they know these cells that are you know, somewhere in layer two three in the mouse how are much are are more um, you you get the any injection that you do in the dendrite you see at the soma and then if you go to a layer five cell which is longer and bigger attenuates, so the your you you can blast the dendrite but you you won't see activity at the soma.

01:24:32
Okay, so then you know that's kind of like the main thing that they're looking at here there's other stuff going on in the paper but and then with humans what they did is they have a relationship with MGH nearby here. I actually work at the hospital there and there's some neurosurgeon.

01:24:51
Kind of Sydney cash who will has a relationship with Mark when they have a surgery planned sometimes they'll have to remove some human cortical tissue and the way to doing something else in a patient and when they do remove that tissue they immediately put it in to a cooler and they rush over they grab it and they they kind of proceed from there how you normally would with a patch clap a slice electrophysiology experiment and an animal with that tissue and so they were able to do the same exact experiments in the human neurons.

01:25:26
And the rap neurons and it turns out that the human neurons are much more compartmentalized than the rat neurons and then so the the question is why you know, why is that you know what what is the underlying mechanism and so what they did is they built some biophysical models that then tried to things so, you know, the first thing that you notice when you compare the rat neuron to the human neuron is the human neuron is much bigger.

01:25:56
So do we have a bigger neuron with the same exact spatial channel densities that you see in a mouse neuron or do we have the same amount of channels and it's stretched and so they built two models that way and it turns out that the stretched version matches the data much better so the idea is we have larger neurons with a kind of stretch distribution of channels that creates more compartmentalization and if you're trying to go, you know, bring this back around to what we were talking about the motivations for the study the idea then is that, you know beyond having.

01:26:31
More neurons than the human brain that potentially the real underlying power of the human brain compared to a rodent is that each neuron is so much more compartmentalized and so much more powerful computationally than individual neurons in the rats that's like the main thing the the papers getting and there's there's lots of other cool things stuff about the paper but that was the point.

01:26:54
I think Katrina was trying to make. I am a little bit curious how a stretched out larger neuron is it translates to me it being more compartmentalized.

01:27:09
So we've been kind of alluding to all these different dendritic spikes, there's you know three different types of dendritic spikes that people talk about plateau potentials from from calcium channels dendritic sodium spikes, which come through voltage gated sodium channels and they're they look a little more like what you see at the soma but a little broader not that not as a way way more narrow than the calcium spikes and then there's these NMDA receptor spikes that happen really distally and they're more compartmentalized but the read, S in these things happen is there's a spatial relationship between where these channels are embedded in the membrane and the morphology of the the dendrite and where the currents are coming where these synapses are located relative to these channels, these are this is like the physics underlying how these spikes are generated given inputs and so you know, you could just just kind of imagine a tree with a bunch of buds all over it, you know, there's your your synapses and then you can just imagine ion channels kind of embedded all over and then Just imagine what would happen if you stretch something like that and there was more space more passive filtering in between each channel as you stretch it and you can start to maybe imagine how there would be more localized activity in the dendrite that's isolated from the soma in other words there's computations happening out in the tree that are independent of what the the the neurons output is.

01:28:47
Yeah and so maybe it would take a lot maybe because it's larger the tree would require more water and the with the analogy work that the neuron would require more. I like electricity to to fire or I don't know. Yeah, so you you would want if you wanted a huge human neuron to be exactly functionally identical to the mouse neuron which it's not you would have to add more channels in you would have to maintain the channel density that the mouse has but the that's you know, indirectly through these biophysical simulations they're arguing that it's more likely that the channel densities are.

01:29:33
Lower in in human neurons. Okay, I'll just let anyone else who wants to go next go ahead. Alright, thank you thanks for letting me on up is okay for me to talk to start asking questions. I'll find what you've been talking about absolutely fascinating and it's great to hear.

01:29:55
I'll go ahead please. Okay. I'm. So you guys will probably do all the tools in the box, you know, and this one is if you've looked into what was I'm saying to send our brains aren't like I'm an amateur by the way, but our brains not like our mouse brain is that it's not as it got lots of unexplained things, you know going on like perception maybe and lots of things what kind of perceptions what is it run on?

01:30:26
I mean, surely you could play it music and it do certain things, you know, but you know romantic music like, I don't like taking you generate this other ways of evoke invoking behaviour and animals and people but I what about the part of the brain that wasn't and that hasn't been done it, so part of the brain that's always we've always had but we don't use which is quite a lot.

01:30:52
I mean, you probably know one line but what would that have been used for in the past maybe going back into our ancestors in it like, Sort of a long time ago prehistory and things like that Well what resonant frequencies would we have been picking up and have you seen any of that regenerated or have you found a way to regenerate that but I suppose you don't know whether what you're looking for that then you wouldn't have been always there but anyway that just that's a question is okay and thanks for let me talk, you know, I'm obviously an amateur, but I'm fascinated by what you've been talking about and it does resonate.

01:31:28
Thank you. So real quickly. I don't think there's any part of the brain that's not not being used. If a what if there was, Part of the brain that's not being used it would be taken over very quickly by some other part of the brain, you know, for example, if you if you lose your eyesight the visual cortex as quickly taken over by by the the the other sensory input areas in in others of the brain and any any part that you lose is going to be taken over because it's like a it's like a competition.

01:31:56
Your brain is like each areas like in competition for resources with the other areas and vision kind of seems to dominate but But but yeah, so I don't think it's plausible any part of your brain is not not in use. Yeah, but. Sorry well that was okay, so Scott knowledge.

01:32:18
I mean, you have to learn something so you might pick it up you have to get everything heritage or you've seen it it's easy to replicate it and hence vision but what about things that you the brain can pick up on other than vision or a sense, you know, but direct sensory ones in it and I'm talking about particularly like perceptions and things like that or I don't know ancestral links, you know, how did they I mean, okay, then let's look ahead telepathy.

01:32:49
Things like that if we're if we've got everything's running on RF, there's so many frequencies and being blessed around us in everyday life, including the the phone and we is a part of the brain that's been stimulated more by RF and by a high static literacy and for you I'll show you I've got some triggers as well for you guys with regards to frequencies that we're running on it quite a distance as well and you can pick it up using it using you can think you just basically.

01:33:24
Lots of cable really but I was I I got a pan on something and it was a byproduct of it. I'd like to I just like to talk some about it and show you what I've got and it is to do with radio waves and I was picking up we don't know we're picking them up but we are.

01:33:44
That's why. Today, that's you're all listening to me, so thank you.

01:33:57
Some really interesting research currently being done around healing after brain damage so um yeah it's being brain can heal a lot but when it's in a natural environment rather than in an over stimulating environment, which you know, I think from a at the point of view of you're talking about ancestry or you know, I know how long term past there's a possibility that we're not you know, evolved yet enough.

01:34:32
To sort of be able to integrate all the stimulation that we currently integrate and if we put ourselves back into it like it a more natural homeostasis of what our body in our brain is used to then then we function a lot better. I don't know if that sort of touches on what you're saying yeah, we're going there just thank you for that.

01:34:52
I'm sorry. I don't know jump on these tables really well, but it's just got some questions so I am with everything with respect as well, okay? I want to try to rephrase because I again I'm getting an idea of what you're talking about but I want to kind of try to sort of rephrase it to reconnect it to the root to the rest of the the story so far and I mean so, you know, it's some I've been hearing from Clubhouse that that you human beings broadcast an electromagnetic field and there's a guy who has a new device he's talking about that that can it can detect if you can it.

01:35:36
Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.

01:36:11
Detect the sequence of RNA with his array then he can identify viruses like like coded 19 and and so that's what his patent is about and that's what he's gonna do but he basically he came to one of the past meetups that I did and he said that that electromagnetic waves can can affect DNA RNA viruses and bacteria just the same way that they can affect antennas which is really it's just it's pretty interesting but um, I think that the new the the was also mentioned it was emotion so and this is kind of what I want to ask it's sort of ties back to our our group here tonight and so so Katarina mentioned that so Katerina it does optogenetics, so she's a genetic sorry we were just a second method that was some bits of the picked up on our fluorescence, they the thing with manipulating those nuclei with magnetic fields.

01:37:16
I, Paid with can you see the picture so oh we had to pull down the refresh to see your picture okay, so your picture is what would you say it was those mobs but those points is the way they'd be they reacted to AMF and magnetic forces are put in I've got some other pictures.

01:37:36
I'll show you the experiments of it helps anyone the thing is those all those organisms don't have a skull they won't. Whatever bacteria you're viruses, they don't have a skull and also those papers that came up that 5g is make something called arranged that on and those those don't it was shown that those high frequency they don't go through the skull at all, it's really really hard actually to get signals deep into the brain so I.

01:38:12
I'm quite doubtful of that being if if that would be the case it would be actually very happy we wouldn't need to do all those brain surgeries you could just blast things and people would improve like practice there there's TMS with very very high magnetic fields, you can simulate brain regions and there's a bunch of studies like that then at MIT and others where you change plus the city depending also on the frequency, but you need really really powerful.

01:38:47
Magnets and being really really on your scalp directly and then you can change plasticity in the brain with those yeah, that's what I'm not and just put that into context that's sort of we can stimulate maybe two centimeters with really quite high magnetic fields, so it's it's you know, like, Miles above what you would be exposed to.

01:39:18
But I think with mica is mentioned in the gentleman who was speech in this I think he was I was in the same room I think and he was saying that he can sense like those viruses Michael he was not necessarily talking like right on the skin he was talking in the t-shirt right in the blood perhaps right or something like that, so like so so so what's separating them is maybe the tissue right not necessarily the bone right so in a in a particular instance.

01:39:43
I I believe he was he was he was saying that you you you basically put saliva on your finger and then put your finger on the device and and you'd have to have time oh, I see. Yeah. He did speculate about some some wireless version of it that he could do in the future with with increased amplitudes.

01:40:02
I that's a yeah, I don't know. Yet. At low intensity RT mass as well, so not just really high intensity magnetic fields and we have shown in animal model that low intensity magnate fields can still induce a plasticity response, however, this is not sort of activated through your usual LPD LPD pathways because it's sub-threshold but you know that this is a research that we're looking at so but it's still high relative to the usual magnetic fields that you would be exposed to.

01:40:47
So I have a really big question and I really want to ask Katarina this it's um, it's about emotion in the brain so um Katarina's work is relevant she talked about how she was able to you know, take to create a take a negative memory and transfer it to another animal but then to change that negative memory to a positive memory that wasn't me.

01:41:13
I was sad thing of paper. I mean, oh, You know, like the the taking of him we so when Joseph we erased memory, but the the trends and we and used up to genetically also memory without actually having some sort of food chuck or anything but the transfer I just shared it on Twitter, it was done by it by another.

01:41:41
The transfer of memory like relabeling it was done by another. Study. I I did the compulsive which is also like labeling a regular behavior with an anxiety queue basically and turning into a compulsion but. Yes, the real labeling was done by a little different. But, All right. Katerina is it that the paper in that if a campus?

01:42:12
Um, yeah. The only thing I would say is we're like the hippocampus on plasticity than we are in the cortex. Oh, yeah is the tool is being used in the process because I I know that can if it's doing the AI self programming. So it's a two of detection and also the many relation before the projection also in the great with the AI.

01:42:42
Connect this providing at this moment for for your research and and testing job and all this. No, we're not working collaboratively on it that our work is is independent. It's been a 10 year project and this this year we so we've had a number of patents that have been approved of that underpinned this technology essentially that the the first patent was was on a mathematical approach to essentially making the output signal better quality than the input signal as it might sound like magic.

01:43:28
But it is a is a an approach that that is beyond interpolation it it literally is based on ability to do a very accurate guided directional progression through the data. So so using quaternion math for dimensional math that we can scale logarithmically and using what's called opcode to determine that the direction that we're progressing through the data allows us to work with very precisely.

01:44:03
Which we're we're expressing in our third pattern that's that's pending and level of detail control that is quite significant and it's it's value with regard to for example the ability to very accurately analyze petabytes of data by only touching or progressing through megabytes or a gigabytes of that data.

01:44:27
So so a very efficient way. To process data but perhaps more importantly it maps to to language both human and machine it can be mapped to signs symbols and and what we call meaning units in I mentioned earlier for those who weren't in the call or in the room initially we've we've mapped this approach to what we call a semantic periodic chart for computing that allows us to use 256 elements that are.

01:45:06
Antique representations of meaning that can map in both directions both to to natural language or or programming language or to signs and symbols but also to code and and thus so you think of it as being able to pick your methodology, whether you you are more in your effort benefit by expressing it a natural language or a programming language or.

01:45:41
A symbolic representation of what you mean they all map to the same definitive meaning to the machine and the benefit of that is is that you can support different ways of thinking different ways of expressing different languages different cultures and and within that those elements it it has certain specific representations that are not present and programming languages such as emotions fear anger.

01:46:16
You know that this the things that we use to define our world are represented as elements that can be combined to the equivalent of compounds and and very complex constructs including for AI algorithm production to the Kuwait and application to processing the data, they're all treated the same way so a uniform way of treating all of these ways of expressing what human.

01:46:51
Being and what machines can can understand and process efficiently. I'm done talking I asked these questions from the perspective of exploring the tools that scientists use and researchers researching researchers using so for example because the day in the other room can if I'm not be able to ask you this question that you are presenting the idea that we can immediately having a thought on the brain and capture as a programming logic and programming processors going into the AI system and to be implemented coming from.

01:47:26
A computer science background in a conventional way of programming after the after the programmer having their code source code is being programmed there is a QC processor to identify any floor and or any box or logic problem that presented on the code itself so after you automate the process, where is the evaluation come in when the the subject having adopt of programming and then being translated into the AI?

01:48:01
And that bugs our whole or loop that is not identified where they go into a complex system will that create chaos in in the whole ecosystem itself. That's a great question Dave. So again, our third patent is focused on something we call level of detail. In other words what that essentially allows for is representing even in the case, as you've described where someone's expressed an idea we semantically then map it to what we call a meaning unit.

01:48:37
Now, it can be represented not just the way the person expressed it but where the machine understands it in technical terms and and encode which gives you the opportunity to examine it to. Sort of validate it to say, oh this is first of all if it's not.

01:48:58
Syntactically or mathematically or you know, based on a rule set that you can determine predetermined such as a programming convention, it does not get expressed in this system as a viable solution. In other words, it doesn't create the error in the first place, you know along those lines whether it's mathematical or otherwise but it also gives you the ability to expose those representations for examination of.

01:49:33
Addition and once you validate in other words basically say yeah, this is what I want to happen and then it goes through a process of essentially as as I've heard described earlier. I think a Katarina was referring to the the or maybe Micah the competitive process that the brain does to to determine okay, what is the most efficient way to implement this in a in a given programming language let's say assembly code, but also how to order the data how to.

01:50:08
Essentially. Utilize the resources are available now and and so is seeking the optimal instruction and and basically flagging the winner as the instruction that's going to be executed but but and then deleting it along with all the losers because it's stored of metric to establish the baseline going forward, so it doesn't go through this process of iterating all the time.

01:50:34
So, so in other words, this is more than about. Automating code. It is about. Essentially doing the the process that every programmer should do the program should look for an optimal instruction but because we applied value to the effort of creating code and we're limited by constraints such as time money and so on we lead determine a winning solution for for those imperatives what is the optimal.

01:51:11
So in other words, it is a way of self-optimizing think about it as machine learning being applied. To. The fullness of what computing can do in a massively parallelized environment. If that makes sense. Then I see we are we are limited to program at the API level because I'm seeing the global train now.

01:51:33
The problem today's also the doesn't have a chance to touch on the source and the root. So if the original design of the API itself having limitation and we need a certain execution to to have a total system update and if the API level is limited that then we forever look into a process that not be able to excel from that current bring limit a if.

01:52:01
That applied to your system for the AI direct programming in terms of their yes so so this is a good question because we have spent quite literally years addressing that particular problem which is how to provide an interface that not only supports as some with with readily conclude that we're talking mostly about allowing people to.

01:52:36
Create code but no we've created an approach that allows us to take things like APIs drivers all the other legacy components of a compute environment and bring them into a universal methodology for packaging them so that they become like the digital equivalent of the Lego brick. So that you can essentially not just utilize them more efficiently.

01:53:03
But you can swap them in and out of memory so that they're not occupying resources that are limited and and we're managing the RAM or the memory at for zero fragmentation ever so so you gaining levels of efficiency that also accommodate things like what a particular system requires whatever that system is via is API.

01:53:31
They all coexist and environment at as if they're they're like, well we refer to them as, Powers. So what is a power a power is the ability to do X and then a skill is ability to apply that power in a customized efficient way. So so I don't want to take up too much of the the room with that conversation.

01:53:59
I'm trying to answer the question that is put to me, but but I think what I want to emphasize is the most relevant take away to this room is the ability to apply some of these concepts. Of how the brain works to how machines are instructed has significant value particularly to the level to the degree that you're able to.

01:54:25
To inform the machine on a very granular level right that this is what I want to happen, in fact we refer to that as want where versus software software being something that programmers write and maybe is the outcome of some very specific AI algorithm its process particularly around learning and and but basically creating this.

01:54:53
I think of it as a scale on one side you've got the ability to express an idea which is. This uniquely human right on the other side of the scale, you've got the machines ability to execute the idea what what's in the middle predominately today is programming languages that are very limited not precise mechanism for understanding what the was meant was to underlining meanings that support the idea.

01:55:30
All right well I'm in you can you can think about it this way but you can all speak about programming languages as the ways to sort of like think about your idea more right like when you have your idea and your brain it's half a baked right it's just really, you know, the programming languages are in a way the language is right with which you describe your idea in a more formalized fashion right and then quality control what Dave was mentioned and it's also a way to further refine your idea like it's very rarely unless it's a very simple and really useless idea that you can really fertilize it in your brain ahead of right in the code you think about the problem.

01:56:05
And as you write in the code, right so it's it's a iterative process inherently right that's not like, you know, everything that you want to code ahead of time it never is that way I don't disagree with you and we're not trying to solve that problem of can you codify your idea in a language that can be compiled what we're trying to address is predominantly, there is no semantic or meaning representation in that code sufficiently for for example, if you write code, not only what I'm, A challenge of understanding what you're thinking was what your your your mind or your your thoughts were which led to your decision around a particular line of code, but you you sort of fast forward a year or two years or three years and you might even have trouble understanding what you were thinking so you've got to go through a process of figuring out what you or another author of code meant a semantic approach allows us to capture that it through the process and basically.

01:57:15
Say this is what I mean to happen now represent that in code and by the way, pick your programming language where there's assembly or she or Java or pearl whatever whatever it is, it matters less than what the idea truly was on an on a granular level if you if that makes sense.

01:57:39
I was kind of listening to see if this was somehow connect back to how we might decode the brain. I I think that maybe in the future there's a path to to you. Seeing your semantic modular coating concept to for decoding brain activity, and and maybe encoding robot brains or something.

01:58:00
I did that that's another absolutely yeah, that's another another topic for another day for sure sorry. I haven't actually questioned about the like the neurons getting back a little bit to the topic to voice them visit. I'm sorry. Okay what's the worst question yes so the question was so so I like the point was that you know that the neurons send them brain they're not like sort of the neurons in this sort of like the computer based neural network, they're more like sort of computers on the internet right or like in the disagregated system which is you know, a fascinating idea like I've heard before a few times that you know saying that essentially the neuron is just like enough on and off switch or like a thing with a very simple mathematical function is just tremendous insult to the neuron right there is like a lot more going on there, right?

01:58:50
And right and and to be honest I mean the reason why I sort of like you know we do we're on your own networks the way with random right now in the computer is because they're just the mapped like what we run mapped better to the you know, the GPUs to GPUs that we have right I build alley who's I think chief scientist of an video he puts it, right?

01:59:10
I mean getting the guarantee inspiration from the brain right it's a lot like getting inspiration from the birds to create the planes right like if you think about like at first when the planes were created like those architects right what they start. Ed to do there they started doing those ridiculous designs where they're like flapping the wings of the plane they tried to essentially imitate the birds and how they fly and was very stupid because it really never went anywhere right we have to think about what our technology allows us to do right at first it was propelled prop based and then the chat based and we have to complete a design how we believe about flying right and really the inspiration from the birds is on a very basic physics level, we didn't really take a lot of inspiration from the birds right so very skeptical about this idea that we have to have the inspiration from the brain to create sort of the neural network basis and we Don't do it right now really right the reason why the neural networks explode it in computer science and they work right now it's not because people came up with the design of the neural network like it was known for decades before like it like the first designs who came up in like back in 70s or something like that and it went nowhere right the reason why right now it works is because the computer architecture allows us to have necessary parallelism and necessary sort of horsepower to feed them with enough data right but but that aside right my question to why is I'm sorry is when you're saying that there is a lot more.

02:00:35
Going on inside the neuron can you give a little bit like taste of like what that something cool to be right like with kind of processes are happening in the neuron so that it does something more to the it's inputs so that the output is sort of like a more complex or more non-obvious right and something that you know, we don't we don't assume for our computer architecture these days if you know, if you understand what I'm what I'm asking.

02:01:00
I think if I can just give a short thing so the thing is though the problem is we waste a lot of resources with flying how we are flying was a design of our life and to say the same is right now with AIs and and and how we do computing an artificial way is we just need way too many resources to do the computing we would need to do to recreate something that's human like it would be outrageous a month of resources, so there's no way to skate.

02:01:35
A little it that way and I think it's not really to imitate more with the brain is doing in order to solve like specific intelligent problems you can do that if we stay specific but the problem is we need to scale down the resources we need so the energy efficiency and for that as we discussed yesterday and another room for that we need to imitate more to what the brain is doing and so the the the, Neuron can it's just it's like integrating a lot of information and then giving an input based on the integration of the information so the integration is different brain input so different information sources that's integrating on a chemical level and electric level and then it's generates based physically and outputs based on that rate quite complicated information input which comes from different chemicals it comes from.

02:02:45
The different iron levels. And it changes based on. The that stream of information inputs how it then generates the the output of information I think to to use a more granular way of doing it with just an enable us to scale computation to a level that we would need to but thank you okay if I make Karina you are.

02:03:18
And I'll I'll be brief and saying that that's exactly the approach that we've taken we're not trying to to fully mirror what the brain does first of all, we don't know there's so much we don't know but what we were able to find is an approach that allows us to on a very granular level determine what is the best and most efficient way to apply processing to to a particular level of detail that we want to expose and that process is proving to be very very efficient.

02:03:53
And we estimate we have a plan to build the equivalent of the most powerful supercomputer in the world that now takes 400 rags to do it in less than a hundred. I think we're going on a little bit off topic again. I wanted to hear from we Sam was probably going to answer that.

02:04:11
I think as well that's I can. I think that's a little bit off topic, that's all I'm saying, oh I'm thinking. Um, yeah, I saw.

02:04:23
Um, yeah this this is something I can talk I can go on and on about and I won't but it's just kind of put it in perspective. I guess what I'm not saying we need to do bottom up the only way to go is bottom up and I'm not saying the only way to go is top down.

02:04:43
I'm actually saying we need to be doing both at the same time and we need to meet in the middle. And you know, there's a lot of ways to think about that, but the, You if you look at historically at what's happened you you had something like the perceptron pops up Minsky points out that it can't do X or they add layers nonlinearity's then, you know, you move down the line another AI winter then you go into back prop which is completely non-biological so you're totally throwing out the credit assignment problem, but you're getting great, you know performance out of these things which is great, which is good and we're learning a lot about the brain.

02:05:30
Doing that I'm not I'm not saying that but is the brain doing brackpop. I think that's a I actually think it's a terrible question. I don't think that's the way we should be thinking about it and you know I said this last night my apologies if anybody has heard me say this before but the the bottom line is you ninety percent of neural tissue is dendrites ninety percent of synapses are on distal parts of the dendrite, which means they in vivo it's it's the data doesn't support that back propagating action potentials can reach those synapses.

02:06:05
So there's obviously learning rules that we don't know we don't understand and then and then and now, you know, I can play doubles advocate and I can say we are light years away and AI from intelligence and my in my view and and and just look at something like continual learning for example, and then you start to think about oh, well there's all these these possible computations that could be happening in the dendrite a single neuron could be gaining signals, we know that synapses cluster on a specific branches.

02:06:40
So things that algorithms that have worked to a certain extent for continual learning such as you know, gating units at the front of a network, maybe all that's happening locally in a single neuron and maybe that's one of the big conceptual things we're missing between you know, the the AI neuron models that we're using now and and and a you know neurons that are more like computers and I could go on with other ideas and examples some of them are more speculative than others, but my point would be that we.

02:07:15
We have a lot of to learn from doing physics in the brain still and there's there's a lot of work to be done. Sounds great. I love to hear more about emotion in the brain specifically how we could if mementos theories correct how the how to that applies to emotion in cortical columns and how we might detect them with and change them with with neural links technology anyone want to respond.

02:07:48
It's it's it's like what is what are the narrow coils for motion? I know that there are some studies in opportunities.

02:07:58
Well yeah, they're different. So they're basically neural secrets representing emotions based on you know, what type of neurons and what neurotransmitters are being released and the amount of neurotransmitters compared to other neurons transmitters that are being released represent emotions, it's not like. We solved emotions we have like an idea that but even in the make the law there are next to each other the positive labeling emotional negative labeling motion themselves, so it's not like that one brain region is responsible for an emotion and then not one neurotransmitter is responsible for just one emotion, it always depends on a gradient of concentrations.

02:08:59
And they like dopamine is supposed to be a rewarding. One and then a norepinephrine can be.

02:09:14
Pure modulator, but it can also enhance memory closet level depending on the amount so it's. A quiet fine. Tuning that needs to be done, but if we if we can like with up to genetic work was done, it's just. Reconnect neurons to different to a different circuitry. So that the near the the security was not this memory was not connected anymore to a negative secretary let's say but it was then reconnected to a positive labeling secretary so.

02:10:01
Elect with electric stimulation. I think it would be harder so you need to be more you would I think you would need to be more precise than that either by using oxygenetics another way would to do it would be to. Use maybe iron a's and an epigenetic tool, so they are drugs.

02:10:28
So epigenetics nowadays is another way of. How long-term memory is stored is with epigenetic mechanisms and you can modulate the intensity of those memories or the labeling maybe even the labeling of those memories. There was shown in certain and dopaminergic sycopetry that epigenetic mechanisms are going on, so you can change by targeting those epigenetic mechanisms.

02:11:08
The the labeling of emotions are the intensity of a memory. I have started to use those so. What I did was in cancer research we have way more advanced drugs because there was always way more funding and cancer if you look it up it's um, it's a utter month of difference between cancer research and mental health reasons.

02:11:38
So what I did I I took a very specific small compounds, um from those novel cancer drugs and injected them while um, Well that habits a compulsive memory was performing and anxious memory was for me which led to habitual avoidance and when I injected that drug I could specifically.

02:12:12
Erase the habitual avoidance of a fear but the reaction to actual threats state intact. So, I don't think just by just to summarize. I don't think just by electric stimulation patterns you can modulate. The the emotions you would need to use other tools just like epigenetic tools or optogenetic tools or RNA like silencing or in expressing more RNA.

02:12:51
But that needs to be tested more.

02:12:57
One wonderful, thank you while you're talking and invited so more people to the group and of course anyone can can do that as well. Does anyone have anything they want to do wanna say go ahead and just meet myself? Yeah, I want to clarify because there is some confusion confusion that I'm thinking is our brain working in a on-off manner or in analogue manner and if it's in an analog manner I expecting the reading of the data will be a branch of a histogram going into the computer for analyzing.

02:13:34
So if we have the behavior of the spy, and the law can be modified the analog signal into the middle and then reproject to the subject itself in present another. Here so that is my question. Dave here. So we have both like the code as I imagine or. Understanding and I see it is yeah.

02:13:58
Code which is the DNA then you have analog data represented and reflected in different ways in the brain. You have them as electric signal and then you have them as changes in gene expression. And which represents mostly epigenetic mechanisms, so you have on the DNA are formed either chemicals around which represents methylation and then you have.

02:14:29
Stone modulations and you have folding of the nay which by having analog information input you change how the DNA will be read and then you change that in and this will be then leading into different protein expression and this will also lead into electric signaling in the brain. So you have let in different ways and other cell types, you just have the epigenetic mechanism but not you know, the, The electric one so.

02:15:07
If you have enough knowledge you can reflect both. You can as I said end-use or reduce epigenetic mechanism and on specific targets, you can change the protein levels by RNA different type of different RNA expression and then you can by stimulating directly those neurons and specific patterns also reflect on the electric signaling so my answer would be as you just need to know.

02:15:43
What how to you know, you need to know how this analog information was stored and reflected and in order to to protect.

02:15:57
I just wanted to welcome Dr. Ou and abyss to this stage if you each want to take it take a minute to say something you may. Sure thank you for bringing me up I was just catching up with what's been said and it's a really interesting. I think if I get what the Katerina if I'm saying that properly was saying is that you have basically different modes or different levels at which you can manipulate the system and so depending on what the outcome effects that you want to get you can decide at what level you want to intervene which is something that I think about in our own work where we do a lot of work with neuroimaging and look at things that more at a systems network level.

02:16:39
Without taking into account how things might be changing at a neuronal level and so you could have all these changes happening at the neuronal level that you're not even aware of. Yes, I'm trying to understand a phenomenon like in my case a disorder that we understand it as a network dysfunction we can actually fix it at the network level and get the desired outcomes that we want.

02:17:04
Now, this is over when I'm done speaking. And I miss if you want to say something and then I'll recap the room real quick. Yeah sure thanks for inviting me up and it's been really great discussion. I was actually you'll know listening mode for for the most part but I could have some some questions for a Katerina, um, do you think of the genetics will be applicable to human, you know human subjects because right now I think on not sure if there's like a non-human primates experiment using optogenetics and and if you should choose between dreads and dread and off to a genetics like which one would you prefer for say like?

02:17:47
Subcortical structures, you know, thank you. So I I know from the conference that I was in Boston not the last fall because of the shutdown but the thing that year before of it's an people want to sign up for it scientists, it started that year like the opportunity engineering and application conference is really good because a lot of really great people that invented those tools and keep adding ones.

02:18:27
Amazing. And technology to it it's a it's a it's amazing conferences and it's still quite small so you can directly talk a lot and ask a lot of questions with amazing people and there they showed that they were starting clinical trials, but for the visual system like a blind people they.

02:18:53
Expressed CHR2 and NPH are in different levels to basically reflect shades of intensity of black and white and even color so I know but that's really easy because you don't know you don't need to do deep brain injections so on. I think at some point when tonight. Treatments will be applied more generally.

02:19:28
I think it will one day using but I think it will still take time so we're not just an amazing a research tool. Awesome camera genetics, right, can we genetic I don't like them too much we have them in the lab but mostly in dreads in reds because you know, we we know really well the the the genome and when we do anything to the my genome we we know what will we know.

02:20:03
Quite well what will happen and read it a little bit different they are not too many genetic tools and reds and it's quite expensive you need more amount and so on so we but you don't have the temporal resolution and you don't have because you have to apply dreads in a systemic way like the dreads is.

02:20:31
You use a chemical systemically and you only express the receptors in a specific brain region that you want with the virus but as I said you use it systemically so you don't have the precise temporal resolution so you can't switch on and off and neuron and now I'm really sick level so you the dreads will be in there for about 90 minutes the the time of the onset is about 15 minutes, so we use those when we just very bluntly want to be you.

02:21:06
The inhibitory ones to take out part of the prefrontal cortex, let's say the IL is certainly matter like specific prefrontal cortex brain region and we just want to take it out while an animal is retrieving a memory or a while habituation is going on and we just want to see what the whole brain reaching if the whole brain region is not online what it had what happens to it, then there's new it's bioluminescence, it's just better.

02:21:41
Because you um by luminousness is that the brain itself you also coexpress a protein that produces cold light either blue to activate. And you also have inhibitory ones.

02:22:07
Which has the probe that you can visualize what you are activating while you're doing the experiments and drags you have to you know. Do is to chemistry after the whole experiment and see if you end up in the right spot and and and do immuno but with the bioluminescence you have the light source expressed and you will visualize it right away which has a lot of purpose I wanted to sort of re-fresh the room because a lot of new people joined us including doctor, oh who and many others to sort of explain how we got a little bit about how we got here so the title of the room memento and neuro-link.

02:22:54
We came about because there's a lot of overlap between the two and the new book a thousand brains. I read it it. I also read about the basically the court the eight say I read this and actually 2017 so he's the main idea which is about the cortical columns are organizing all the information that you're perceiving like every like if you have a table every object on the table would be managed by a different cortical column, but not only that like if you, It like if you have here now if you have your phone for example because it's a great example because we're all on Clubhouse so if you have if you have your phone you're gonna have maybe a thousand core columns in the visual cortex that are modeling your phone and I I confirm with Jeff Hawkins.

02:23:45
I asked him as I said, so you'd also have a thousand critical columns in your audio cortex and your somatosensory cortex and he said yes exactly it's not as if these it he's not saying that a neuro column is is multimodal but he's saying that these columns have to model, you know, the phone individual cortex and the audio cortex and then in this matter since your cortex.

02:24:05
And then vote on which representation is the most accurate or the most correct and then then I guess arguably they're they're gonna be modeled by fewer cortical columns after that but you're still gonna have this sort of link between the different primary the primary input cortises the for for for what you hear and what you see in what you feel and so but that that is directly relevant to neural link because near link goes there they're sticking, you know, 16 electrode.

02:24:40
's per each one of these strands which is gonna into the the cortex so you're gonna be able to get not only are they doing like, you know, they're 16 electrodes in one strand but they're putting in many hundreds of strands simultaneously, so they end up with we know whatever the number is three thousand something electrodes in there at one time and if you if you are trying to figure out what fired and when you're gonna want to have a lot of a lot of electrodes so you can do you know, like if you just have three electrodes the the analogy is that if you just have Three electrodes and imagine you have three microphones in a dark room and you're trying to figure out where a sound came from which the sound represents the spike in this case you might figure out which which whichever microphone was the loudest might give you an indication of where that that sound came from but you know with the neuron it can spike in multiple places and so if you get a sound in another place if you only have three microphones, you might think well that's a different neuron it could be the same one or if you get two spy if you get two sound spikes in the same electrical spikes in the same area, you might think it's just one.

02:25:50
Neuron but it could be two because we're just close together so with many different electrodes you can get a high resolution image and you can you're much more likely to figure out you know, if the there's really two electro two neurons that are close together or if if one neuron is spiking in two different places and then you can you can think about you know, doing things like okay well can I detect if the if the neuron is about to fire if it's just like maybe like a dendritic spike or any in the spike you can you can increase your granularity with increased resolution that's exciting but basically I asked the folks in your test.

02:26:25
Do you think that we're going to be decoding I asked them yesterday on a clubhouse I talked to super tie and I said do you think we're going to be decluting the decoding basically cortical columns the corticoms that represent the cop vision the visual cortex and the represent the copy in the audio cortex and represent the feel of a cup in this amount of sensory cortex and he said yes and the the end the implications of that are are profound because basically that means you know, if an airlink is a device that's going to be enough to potentially decode what we're seeing and hearing and feeling.

02:27:00
So what we're thinking in the prefrontal cortex and also our emotions as Katerina was just explaining right before Dr. Other who joined the room and many others. So that's sort of like recaps the the thing and I'm not about obviously, you know, the nerve gear is closer to brain computer interfaces and what what neural length is doing and the and neurophysics, you know, we're talking about brain waves and an oscillations a brain activity and cortical column activity in the networks of of the brain but specifically the networks of of cortical columns and the network protocols.


02:27:35
If in what is voting, you know, when when when different cortical columns agree? So these so these are all like related topics and so I'll go ahead and and mute myself and then let people say whatever they want to go ahead.

02:27:54
So I had a question about sort of the the amount of real estate occupied by something like the neural link electrode like how big a patch of cortex would be covered by their current setup. So okay, so the the each electrode is about the width of a hair, but then you know, depending on the density of neurons and a given area that each electrode could potentially detect as many as a thousand as many as a thousand neurons in a in a radius.

02:28:28
I think that's correct and and or it's like 140 micrometers or something like that, but I may have to look that up it's sometimes I forget micrometers it might be but it's like that it's like the distance from the electro from the electric. Road to to what it could potentially measure.

02:28:48
Kettering it might have an answer for that actually.

02:28:54
How many in your link? I have. Sure right now. I have to look it up. My guess is what I'm. There. There's a lot of debate about how they are cortical column is which you talked about and Jeff Hawkins talks about and he kind of formalized it as like a cubic millimeter of tissue and I think I don't know any details about neural link, but if you're talking about like distances from electrodes, and I think microns is pretty appropriate.

02:29:27
Yeah, but what the dimensions of there of the areas of the microwave? I don't I don't know right now. Do they have it published somewhere? A thousand channel but I don't know what the the dimensions are. They do have the then in the video they when they come out with the first I think it's two years ago when they're like first came out with all the details of it, they they did publish an information.

02:29:55
I'm just forgetting when it was offhand.

02:30:03
Yeah, one of the reasons why I asked is I sort of mentioned networks before and I think it's a important to think about things from a network perspective. So, you know, I'm a psychiatrist and when looking at the literature of neuromodulation and psychiatry people were very focused on sort of what the target was of the electrode and not where that'll not the where the target was connected to and they actually found.

02:30:30
That makes you look at a very ability in clinical response. It wasn't because of problems with locating a particular, you know deep DBS electrode in a particular part of the you know, subgenual singular or part of the striatum, but it was actually the either structural connectivity to where you place the electrode or the functional connectivity that was really important and so I think in any of these strategies I think of good sort of napping of all of the connectivity and the network characteristics.

02:31:05
Of the brain are crucial to a target. So, that's that's the common. I wanted to make thanks.

02:31:16
To secure this question. If I come from the perspective of the ancient with ancient wisdom that I always think they are much more advanced than us. I'm not sure you're familiar with the Chinese acupuncture. They have a whole diagram of the point to put the needle into the body, which I suspect is a needle of capturing metrics and also the histogram of all these.

02:31:51
Brain activity. Are we at the current scientific now also capturing the input data from a human being from that kind of diagram that the Chinese ancient Chinese already have for their argument 0 point.

02:32:15
That's a really good question. There may be studies, but they're not that I'm aware of.

02:32:28
Handsome is coming up. I'm an amazing. So some maybe someone has a response to that. Hello, Hanson. Hey, are you doing good? Actually have a question. Maybe you really naive are you probably have I just came into a probably have covered it a long time ago, but maybe I'll just ask my question and then you can see if it is relevant.

02:32:57
So the electrode the electrodes that are planted. I suppose it's implant inserting to the brain is that correct? The electrode. Yeah for nerve for nerling yeah, they're implanted into the brain yes. Okay, so I suppose it's not exactly inserted into the neuron and if it is not when the neuron fires the as I understand it the electric potential transmits into it through the neurons or exons the I'm just wondering if the electrode is a wave from the neuron, how does it receive this?

02:33:45
Signal. Is it through the let's say the coulomb the static potential or is it is there any is it the the change predation in the charge field that the the electrode is receiving and or is there current going through the the medium and in the brain and brain tissue and the current?

02:34:20
Going from the neuron to the electrode if it is if it is it seems a little bit strange because that means that elect in the current is leaking from the neuron so how does it exactly how does the electric road detect the the neuronal activity? Thanks asking the question.

02:34:47
Okay, I could answer that but we've got really capable people on the stage anyone else might take a stab at that.

02:34:58
I guess it's me so it's it's an electrode right so it's it's a they the idea with an early link is there's a microsurgery robot and the only thing that the micro surgery robot is doing is trying to implant the electrodes in between blood vessels to create the least amount of damage when you implant them and hopefully the electrodes end up near neurons.

02:35:23
I don't know if they're trying to avoid puncturing neurons yeah, so that's that's yeah, that's um, that is one particular. Detail that I don't know but the idea is that they want it to be close enough to the neuron to measure the actual spike and the actual actual spike you have to be really close to measure that and and I mean the electrical the electrical spike the electricity so yeah, so the neuron is is when it it is leaking electricity when the action potential fires it's it's it's, Elect the electrons are sort of I guess it's like it's like lightning it in a way it's you know, you have an action potential spike the issues there's and a lightning strike and both situations there was a separation of positive and negative charges on the in the case of the body, it's the positive negative charges are inside the the the electrical gradient of a neuron and we're talking about like, you know, the the sodium ions and the potassium ions.

02:36:38
And but in an in terms of lightning strike of course, it's positive negative charges in the sky, right but in either case the neuron has to reach reach equilibrium in order to maintain it's equilibrium because it's a it's a dissipative system it's a vortex and so it has to fire and it has to fire off its electrical charge along the axon body, but it is going to leak and that and so we're going to measure that I I believe that's correct but again, we've got extremely qualified people up here who can correct me if my understanding is not right.

02:37:13
So usually you record potentials like field potentials and then you can analyze them by the hurts of the potentials you have and you will have depending on the urine type and depending on the simulation type and. And so on you will have those field potentials in different frequencies. Which is expressed so yeah, it's field potential to usually we try so I'm confused though.

02:37:48
I don't know anything about the neural link but uh, is it measuring LFPs or is it detecting spikes?

02:37:57
Well from what I can understand that they can implement implement this symbol machine learning algorithm to to determine this spikes, but I would assume to tell if be but I could beams taken but it I've seen like LFPs can essentially be breaking down to like different like a very simplistic spike sorting and and using some some kind of like component analysis they can determine individual spikes.

02:38:23
I mean, there were deep if we're deconvolving on LFP signal into spikes that's going to be rough. I mean, like traditionally with touch roads you're Measuring spikes directly and then you do a spike sort from spikes, okay explain what is the acronym what is it it's local field potential.

02:38:46
Local field potential there, you're transient electrical signals generated and the nervous system it's basically what electrons have program means even though eg refers to scalp electrodes but yeah electrical signals generated in their system and other tissues yeah, so I mean, they cooked the recording.

02:39:10
You would know the the you would be able to analyze the exact spike and interspike interval and so on.

02:39:22
But nearly specifically said they wanted to be close enough to a neuron to measure an actual spike but I imagine for everything that they're not close to the thousand neurons or they're not close to talking about local field potentials. So whether that sounds more like a tetra to me than.

02:39:40
Yeah and yeah, I think it's more like a tetra because that that would be the reason to have 16 electrodes in each hair and put lot many of them in there, it's using like a tetra to triangulate the locations of of spikes. Yeah, so cool now we're done it's folks they measurable.

02:39:58
It doesn't matter if it's a field or a unit it's involved like if that anti is no question if that's the case. I suppose it is a measuring the potential the perturbation from the so basically electrostatic potential from the perturbation in resulting from the spikes instead of the current that is the the iron let's say the the potassium were the, Calcium iron the current that goes along the neuron.

02:40:38
So is that correct? Yes, it's in order to measure currency. In neuron or which you can do and people I don't think that those errors are doing that, um, you can you know patch a cell and people but I mostly do it and be true then you would measure directly currents and then you can empty tango, you know the different receptor.

02:41:05
Receptors that are a contributing to those currents or very near the Exxon because that you do have current outside the iron current outside just immediately outside the neuron correct. If it is not then then I suppose it is measuring the potential different just the electoral. I mean, the inertial static potential did it it caused by the specs of the Well the axon would.

02:41:40
Release this then because of the spike a neurotransmitters, usually. I mean, you have electric. You have electric sign ups, but those are not I don't know about the human right actually, but those are not as common. I usually aspire emits done a neurotro to neurotransmitter release which then goes to the next cell activates receptors there that opens ion channels and it needs to the next action potential and then there's again, no transmitter release.

02:42:19
That's more often the case. You have electric. Transformation transmission to get junctions mostly but those are not as common. So basically the conclusion is I suppose the electrode is far away from the neuron that it cannot measure the current but only the the electric potential that caused by the the the excitation of the neuron and which caused the the change in the iron concentration is there right just.

02:42:59
Yeah I mean it's not just location to like if you want to measure currents in a cell you want to there's a few ways to interact with the membrane but you know, the simplest one to think about is your your pipette fluid is literally continuous with the neuron and then you can start to measure currents directly from the cell and I think maybe this is what you're driving at if you're measuring spikes relative to currents relative to synaptic currents, that's a very low dimensional signal like the the actual.

02:43:34
Current. Inputs into a given cell or even to populations of cells that's even higher dimensional and yeah. I couldn't imagine that the devices measuring something like that. So I'm pretty sure they just yeah the extracellular recordings and I think they can measure probably if they're similar to other electrodes about a hundred microns from the electrode and put that into perspective the cell the neuron could be anywhere from 10 to 30 microns in size itself.

02:44:11
Okay, so the conclusion is just the potential they're measuring right there, yes static potential.

02:44:20
I mean at the root of it, they're measuring voltage, right? So, Right so I'm just wondering if the voltage. Yeah, which is yeah because I was wondering whether it's current measuring current directly or what they the voltage from the electrostatic potential. Okay, so it is the voltage I kind of had a question this will pull everyone in a different direction if you don't mind but I it's kind of it's a I think it's a good a fun one.

02:44:53
And it so goes back to I so I was at the the grocery store and I had this idea because I was listening to Katarina. And the other day and another talk where we had some other great speakers and so the idea was so Katerina was just saying that earlier before many people came that she was she she managed to stimulate a mouse to basically she elicited long-term memory with high frequency stimulation and then generated a compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation and the mouse has had like impulsive behavior.

02:45:35
And and then she used a low freak frequency stimulation to induce LDT and long-term depression and that caused the the animals compulsive behavior to go away. So that's an upcoming paper that she's working on. It sounds really exciting but what was what what I was thinking about a lot was well, what is the role of of high frequency stimulation and and low frequencies this?

02:46:07
I don't know if I should be saying stimulate. But that is like you know if someone has if someone is too impulsive in them they interrupt too much, if they have attention deficit disorder if they have less self-control, you know, like so I get oh yeah, so what I think it was Katerina and maybe it was someone else but I think was Kettering and who's talking about the inhibitory neuron system or the inhibitory neurons basically helping to to fill a role of of inhibition whereas like if we didn't have inhibition then we would just be you know, either we would be epileptic or we just be out of control and we wouldn't be able to you know.

02:46:43
So they, Inhibition is what gives a person choice. It gives a person and that choice but the the feeling of agency inhibition gives us agency. It makes instead of being like this like floundering fish with the inhibitory networks we have a sense of control that we might not have otherwise.

02:47:03
We over ourselves and so people who have less self-control who interrupts too much that maybe they they're they're interneuron system is damaged and you know, and maybe people have or ADHD have a dysfunctional internal system or in him. Atory system and and and then and then maybe we could solve that if we gave people low frequency stimulation to induce LTD in those areas that were really, you know, they had too much stimulation.

02:47:37
So like imagine like imagine like, you know, there's too much stimulation in the part in the part of your in a part of your brain and that causes reduced blood flow in another part of your brain like the reduced blood flow that we see and and people who have ADHD, for example.

02:47:50
But I mean that this could be this could apply to a lot of different analysis. I don't want to just like stick it to ADD but. God. Yeah, there's a lot of research being done in the direction. And actually those those magnetic stimulation devices there are clinical trials going on, especially in kids that have autism it is known that the inhibitory system is disrupted also in the coupon for cortex and that's exactly what they are trying to do and what was what does interesting as that most likely a lot of research points towards that the glia.

02:48:35
In those brain structures that a malfunction in the glia actually leads to a malfunction in the inhibitory neural system, which then links it to the immune system and there was a very cool paper. From the lab I forgot the name right now because it's really like that found the immune system in the brain because like before we always set the brain doesn't have its own immune system.

02:49:11
And they found that a disregulation of the immune system and the brain can lead to such complicated behaviors like social anxiety. Which then explains a lot about autism disorders. So yeah, it's a really cool thought and is we're going on towards that direction. Frequency versus low frequency stimulus a you're talking about the electric stimulators.

02:49:53
I use opportunity stimulation for that to be more precise on first of all which inputs arms stimulating and which neuron types. I'm stimulating and where and and to have a temple resolution because I needed to stimulate those specific inputs onto the neurons only when the mice will performing a specific test.

02:50:24
So this stimulant did you say optimum of the reused light so we induce a gene that produces a channel that is usually found in algae. The algae used this to detect blue light so they know you know, where they let and where there's food basically and we use those receptors and express them in neurons and, By using genetic tools we can we can make reduce them in viruses and.

02:51:10
We can select and which neurons it will express or which cell types it will express and and which it won't and by injecting it precisely into a brain region we can be precise with which brain region and which neuron type should express those and then we implant a light source you would usually have optic fiber cables in there.

02:51:41
And then we'd hook it up to a laser and then we can millisecond precisely stimulate those neurons and also inhibit the neurons and and that's. Precise way so that made it possible for me to just stimulate a specific input onto that brain region in that neuron while specific behavior was going on.

02:52:09
So it's I was just gonna say it's really interesting that the same paradigm also applies in a less precise way with clinical RTMS where you know, 10 hertz high frequencies stimulation as opposed to increase activity of the dorsal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but if you, Stimulate at one hertz which is relatively low frequency it actually inhibits and what people do is they'll use high frequency on the left hemisphere and low frequency on the right hemisphere because of somewhat dated ideas that there are some laterality in depression pathologies such that you have under activity of the left hemisphere and over activity of the right hemisphere.

02:52:57
So it's it's really interesting to see the same sort of pattern of high frequency low frequency stimulation of sort of being sort of recapitulated at a larger scale. Yeah interestingly totally.

02:53:17
Easily so we you know, we all are more complicated than we realize and you can you know, you can do a lot of work finding out and tracking and mapping these um inhibitory pathways and excited to pathways and because obviously if you stimulate with high frequency and inhibitory pathway, you're actually then inhibiting that part of the brain even though you're using excitatory simulation.

02:53:44
Actually really. Complex but then it's also hard to be generalized across a population so and a lot of this stuff. I think is quite outdated some of these. Stimulation parameters, but as a general rule of thumb, you've got yeah, you've you know one hurts as you never trim and hurts, really.

02:54:06
Then it's you know, there's extra layers. I guess to. So the light the frequency your printer is the pulse frequency is there right and yeah exactly so the the light the blue light opens up, um positive ion channels which then do polarizes the cell and then generate some action potential and then we have the opposite effect if one puts on puts in the cellular adoption with the yellow light, you would activate a chloride pump so it have high.

02:54:46
Performance the cell, which makes the cell being more inhibited they are also. Labs that do that with the inhibitors neurons like the activate them inhibitory neurons which activates the neurons that leads to more inhibition in the signature tree and so on. I guess the color of the light corresponds to the excitation energy of the the the let's take calcium mode potassium, it's absence, it's options are receptors that we get from algae and other organisms.

02:55:35
I think that yeah, I'd like to give Leonard and Jennifer each a minute to speak if you want to say anything.

02:55:49
Yeah thanks Mike um I'm barbecuing right now I just popped in and came on stage to add some value later versus just listening but I want to maybe have you reset the room it's great to have been listening for a couple of hours back and forth it is great to tie that the mind to AI and into what we're you know, what we're all collectively building specifically my company machine intelligence neural network database, we're more focused on decision three and probability three and economics but I love the mental health side of it and chemical neurons and my CTO is worked on.

02:56:24
A. Computer interaction at lowest technical universities. He's a senior 10 year professor there. But just want to add value and thinks Michael if we can I'm just following the thread and and it looks like we're more on the more medical side, but I think at the beginning of the room we were more on the sort of the neural link side and one of the probabilities and possibilities.

02:56:44
Here let me link it all together. So cement nomencl has these really great ideas about how cortical columns are helping to organize our the sensory modalities in our in our of. Information in in our brain I'm gonna make this description letter shorter than I did last time but basically the idea is that you have a cortical columns in your visual cortex and audio cortex damage sensory cortex that are each representing, you know, what you see what you hear and what you feel and in terms of like they have to talk to each other so they take an integrated information to make predictions about your phone that you're holding right now how you're holding it where your fingers are how to moving on the In addition to that you're gonna have basically you know the pre-frontal cortex and other areas of your brain are going to be creating a representations of your ideas and how different how your ideas are connecting to concepts that are modeled with the different with the visual cortex and somatosis report text and so on.

02:57:45
And so and there's a process of voting which reduces the number of columns that were that are cortical constant are going to be involved in this modeling but basically everything in the room with you right now every object on the table with you, you know is going to be basically modeled by.

02:58:00
Cortical columns and so because it's true with with a device like with neural link and with its with with as many electrodes that are you know, sort of like I think of like the reason you have this many electrodes ridiculous amount of electros is you're going to be doing you know, basically trying to triangulation sort of like a tetrode where you're going to try to figure out a high-definition, but much better than tetragonal trying to figure out a high-definition model of what's firing and where it's firing that goes beyond what you can do with attachment.

02:58:33
And so to bring that to The medicine the medical topic right now so we we brought it we it's a neural link has proposed that they're going to be able to treat basically every sort of mental illness and yeah they came up with that and and so the question is well how and they're actually Nick just joined in I wonder if I should reset it one more time.

02:58:55
So invite to speak but so but yeah, so the idea is that nomenclature is saying that with the corticoms where modeling you know, everything in our in the room, you know, so you've got the visual cortex and you got auditory to get this medicine report. To actually get the pre-frontal cortex and there's more there's cortical columns in each area that are talking to each other to predict anything that you're holding including your phone how you're rotating it a coffee cup how you rotate it where your fingers are on that phone what it looks like what it sounds like if you bing bang the phone or the coffee cup against something and and and then there and then over time they're gonna reduce the the representation so that's their sequence learning their sparsely disturbing representation.

02:59:39
These are the main ideas of but the big implication of that is that with devices with these. Like I. A common super tetrads the narrow link device because you can do really advanced modeling of what neuron fired and when and do advanced decoding of cortical columns and I asked Subutai from neural and yesterday in clubhouse I said, can you basically, you know, decode cortical columns and figure out when cortical columns are talking to other corticoms when a vote has happened between cortical columns and, And and also in he basically he basically said yes this is this is possible and there's already examples when I pressed him out of further I said he said there's already examples of you know of you know, if you can if you can if you hear something with the visual cortex, it's going to it might cause you to think of of some animal like it was allowed cat you might if you hear a loud cat you might you might imagine you might see in your mat in your imagination a some.

03:00:47
Where or some other like really angry cat and you know could be in California right where might be a little bit different but the idea is that you're gonna be able to sort of like if you can deconstruct the network protocols of corticoms you and you can decode the cortical columns with neural link then you can begin to pull you know, basically predict what images are happening and then we're talking to Katarina and Katarina was explaining well, she's already with mice who's already like decoding basic things in in microcortical columns, it's.

03:01:22
Such as a fear response she's able to with with great precision to make a mouse less afraid or to answer. I might be mixing that up with with a different so that was okay so that those the story that Katarina was talking about was was about in causing increasing the, It was is about that was about increasing the here it is.

03:01:51
I think I took a note basically so there's a story of transferring members from what I'm animal to another which is basically like in in opportunities which is an example of like if you can capture a memory from one quarter calm you could transfer to another but there's also so that's been done in with with neural ink will have to be able to do that at a much higher resolution and then to get to basically.

03:02:19
Oh so in terms of the the granularity with an early ink or with oxygenetics potentially like what what the catarano did was she listened to long-term memory with high frequency stimulation generated compulsive behavior with high frequency simulation in a mouse and then so so maybe I don't know if that means like the animals hand was was was moving compulsively or something like it's it's arm but then with low frequency stimulation the the long-term depression was induced and the animals a limb stops moving in the Then I I've been thinking about this idea well what if for a couple days actually what if the inhibited inhibitory interneuron system that Katarina was talking about yesterday what if that dysfunction is sort of like responsible for things like attention deficit disorder and it turns out that is that's that's that's um, that that was a good guess because there's a lot of research in that area there is you know, Ketteringer product that the inhibitory neuron system might be damaged in the case of of Alzheimer's and then, It was it Alzheimer's and then also I think the one that came up was autism and nervousness if that was another thing that came up which is these are all very interesting things that so basically we're talking about like okay well would would a person gain more agency if they had more low frequency stimulation basically inducing more more long-term.

03:03:56
I'm sorry more inhibition because the idea is that inhibition might be the thing that gives us more agency in some case. Is worth too much if it's too much excitement and then you're just I guess flocking around like a fish, you don't have agency you don't have self-control so or not as much if you have less agency and so and so bring this back to yeah, so bring this back to like medicine it's like okay, well there are link proposed they're going to be able to treat any kind of dysfunction and maybe they're talking about, you know, doing things like in in, you know, increasing the frequencies or in decreasing frequencies to treat various illnesses in and that would deck might relate to.

03:04:39
Autism and and and ADHD and and others and but but they're also sort of like, you know, what what are the others what are the other things we can think about in terms of treatments, you know, and so immunology has been sort of in the background a little bit.

03:04:56
I meant of this discussion Katerina brought up immunology because that's directly related to potential cause for the glial cells being damaged which led to the damage of dysfunction of the internal system, so the immune system. Was compromised it it it it disrupted the internal system and so inhibition was decreased people hadn't the subjects had more the the glia was destroyed in a subject had more social anxiety more autism just sort of like rephrasing what Katarina kind of said and and but yeah, so so let's talk about immunology for a second also Katarina worked on a cancer.

03:05:39
I know that car T cells and treatments had or immunology treatments with cancer came up and but that sort of recaps the room. And for the way lighter to ask and I also want to give Jennifer Nick and Carly to chance to speak as well. Thanks so much maker yeah and thank you for all that background that was really helpful.

03:06:01
I just dropped it so so it's really helpful to get up to speed a little bit and I am kind of coming in here from the angle of being curious it's about neural link and where you know where that is headed and also exploring this from the the point of view of actually autism as well, which is wonderful that you just brought that up.

03:06:21
I'm really curious where we're at with respect to like, of course building out the like neuronal model and being able to predict these things and Read and interpret is a huge project and of itself and very fascinating. I'm incredibly curious about kind of the writing back mechanism or the inducing certain states and the fact they got to an addition is exactly on my mind and here this area like for autism yes nervousness, but in general, like I can curious the degree of life some soil inhibition or or or even amping up in certain cases where there's hypoactivity of different inputs different sensory inputs, if there had been any research in this area or much talk around it, so I'm just excited.

03:07:06
To be here and hear a little bit about like I'd love to hear what if there's a paper anything you could point me to that that said that is already looking into that sounds like this has been a topic so um, yeah, I don't know if I have too much to add necessarily for my ankle of the world.

03:07:24
I'm not directly involved in this quite so much my research with autism has been more in how to improve like digital communication channels for those who are autistic but I'm very happy to be here and I was a great topic, so thank you. And I will add quickly and I will have to step out unfortunately too soon from this conversation as well.

03:07:48
I have a few other things going on tonight, but but yes, it will be here listening for at least another 10 minutes or so and very happy to be here, thank you. Nick your next. Yeah I also jumped in catalase and apologies at first tooth and off to jump off really.

03:08:09
I gotta give a minute seminar all week, so I gotta give a talk on Wednesday some working on that but no I think that the the cool thing, you know, obviously mirror link has paved the way at least for a lot of the innovations for many of the tools within that space but the thing that I'm curious about and and that I don't know much about is more of the learning process that has to go on with the implantable devices themselves, so for example, like, You brought up the the example of the cat like if you take a look at a cat and how you can sort of map the associations that occur within the cellular patterns that give you that visual representation of the cat how that is going to occur from one person to the neck does not necessarily gonna be identically you know what I mean, so when you start to when you start to, Let's say you you put the neural ink in and you map with the person's sailor firing patterns that associate with them staring at a cat and you take that exact same firing patterns and you stimulate that in another person.

03:09:16
I would be hard-pressed to believe that you're going to give the exact same thing of their visual representation of a cat in that other person, you know, because it's there's a whole host of factors that have gone into whatever that person associates with being a cat, you know what I mean, and so I'm curious as to not only.

03:09:35
Like the inner individual differences that are going to occur in in sort of the ability in order for each of these machines to be widespread across in the public but also how each of the different perceptions or whatever it might be shapes over time within us given individual, you know, like how you perceive a cat when you're five years old and it's like fluffy thing is going to be one certain neural firing pattern within the cortex but of suddenly at age seven you got attacked by a cat now you have a fear response that's added on top of that.

03:10:08
Is that going to be effect the neural link input or output if you will from it's the you know, the the stimulus is the same but now the associations and the firing patterns that are going on for the same stimulus are very much different and so I'm curious if anyone knows anything about the sort of learning process that has to go on within the machine itself or the adaptability to change over time.

03:10:35
It's a great question. Nick it makes me think of just.

03:10:41
Yeah and I'm in the reason I was thinking about it sort of along the lines is like let's say for you know drug sensitivity you know if you give a patient one drug, you know, they're gonna have a certain response and you give it a patient the same drug under a different condition, they're gonna have a very much different response and that's sort of wide known in the physiological world and it gives rise to many of the variances that would see but when it comes to implementing a crowd people, I think it creates sort of a big problem because all of a sudden you have this fantastic beautiful model that you modeled on three people with.

03:11:16
This neuro-link implantable device and all of a sudden you take that and you put it into another person that they're instead of seeing cats, they're seeing, you know, zombies and goblins running around, you know, so it's an interesting thing. I think I would. Cause.

03:11:36
The recipe. I think he's one of the most advanced researchers that is working on making specialized. Helping devices like from parallelized people to make like connection devices so you can basically with your brain controlled all kinds of devices for paralyzed people or people that are not able to talk anymore and so on he's doing amazing work but yeah, they there's a training phase for each single person.

03:12:19
I would totally agree on that. And mouse experiments. Caterina you you have transplant you you know of transplants of memories from from one animal to another you can is that. Yes, yes that they are like fear memories and context there is but um, I'm not sure how specific like to a specific like if let's say a general idea of a cat.

03:12:53
I think can be transmitted or general. Visual cue of a cat. I think can be transmitted but not the specific cat combined with them emotional cue. Can be very easily transmitted. I think so for talking about those hippocampal studies. I mean, it's a very very vague kind of notion of like a general fear that was transferred but like something super specific like that.

03:13:27
I don't think anything's close to that so I have a different take on on on that idea so so memento is big is basically they're saying that you might have a very specifically these and the analogy of a coffee cup you might have the coffee cup and hey, It is basically modeled by a thousand different cortical columns individual cortex and a thousand different cortical columns in the in those in the somatosensory cortex and a thousand different cortical columns in the audio cortex and a thousand different columns in the prefrontal cortex and so on and and then they the different areas have to vote so even if you could what I think is like, even if you could stimulate if you if you could decode basically the pattern of of a cup in the audio cortex and the pattern of a cup in the visual cortex and then you could.

03:14:21
You could take it over and stimulate another person's brain with those exact patterns with with with amazing detail and then and I mean like the like assuming those patterns had each have a temporal spatial characteristics like the pattern of broccoli has wrecked recognizable recognizable temple spatial characteristics, it has you know, it has a texture it has color it has a crunch as recognizable characteristics that you could I guess if you if you if you put together a voxel a four-dimensional box will temple spatial patterns in.

03:14:56
Broccoli and then you've fed that to the brain the estimation instead of through instead of through the mouth, then maybe you could cause a column to replicate that sense of broccoli, but the thing is if that one column is disagreeing with all the other columns maybe that will never become a conscious representation of broccoli in the person's brain maybe you'd have to stimulate many columns in order to convince the overall system to vote that in fact broccoli has been detected so that that's my my thought there.

03:15:29
So and my understanding correctly that we can start all working and view a place called debit and then we have our own Lamborghini deployed again for reconnection.

03:15:44
Could you reference that sorry? I mean with the current technology that you you just explain this now and my understanding correctly that we can start again a new religion and then having the reincarnation again and call it a rainbow team from Tbit and then we can stimulate the whole memory into another individual well there's a lot of I mean not tomorrow the idea there's a lot of problems currently we're trying to trying to as we were talking about earlier trying to simulate the, Brain with with the electrodes it could be very imprecise so that's why people are talking about stimulating the brain with other ways with optogenetics or maybe with ultrasound but but whether we can get that the kind of precision we need with electrodes.

03:16:39
I I think there's a lot of skepticism right now by the way, if at Carl hasn't had a chance to speak and car wants to go in anywhere else, maybe just let us know if something burning you want to say just flash your mic a lot and and I'll try to get you so looks like abyss and neck both want to go to.

03:16:56
When I say something real quick or.

03:17:02
Okay, um this and then necklace. Yes, so I have sort of like a loaded question because I have to leave like an a pretty soon but I seems like this is a great opportunity trust question because we have like lots of accomplish near scientists here, so I was kind of reminded of like the paper that was that was released by the Carmina group at Berkeley which actually demonstrated that there is a cortical protocol striatal plasticity using on your prosthetic techniques, like they actually inject like put in.

03:17:41
Some raw like tungsten blood throats dried claim deuce, um some kind of critical plasticity between M1 and the striatum so do you think like some kind of functional group plasticity is possible to detect using the the rampant technology that we have right with the neural link and whatnot like do you think it's possible to kind of go into a research router, you know, it's such a job plasticity between different functional groups can be detected the other.

03:18:16
Question that I have is that I think with the like I said with the rampant use of you know invasive techniques to read on neuronal signals you think we can actually make an event on a near basketball coupling because that's also one of the things that's been left to you know on Facebook techniques like using FNS and whatnot the F nearest with EEGs and they have you know, different convolutional problems but with invasive techniques you would think that we can remedy that situation and land.

03:18:52
Um, I don't know if anybody has read the new publication from brain gate, they actually implemented a wireless bring computer interface which kind of in my expectations and proceeds that of neural link and any other wireless technology that I've came across which which like they use their own antennas design which is like around 3.5 gigahertz or something and they have the signal capability of a wired brain computer interface because there were conflict.

03:19:26
The pioneers and and that whole area and they were able to record for 24 hours but yes, so I'm just gonna explain what the paper says but had if anybody has read it and if it went and if they did like say have a general opinion about that, thank you I'm done speaking.

03:19:47
Yeah, they're various approaches like many laps are working on our wireless and the research and because. Having wires I'm sticking out and you can basically do any social interaction tests and study so yeah many labs um working on that and they make a lot of progress so. Um, the other question you ask about being specific to brain region connections using electric stimulation would be very hard to to stay very precise they for sure.

03:20:32
I don't know the the paper you mentioned but there are many studies right now, um using what I said up to genetics. To detangle basically the role of specific connection between the cortical striatum and I make the last triadum and ETA in a place that comes prefrontal. I mean, this is being on being mapped out with opportunity and I think the only way to be precise because you can't really control with electric stimulation.

03:21:14
You can't really control that just exactly this neurons that will project there will fire you will always affect in the neurons and other neurons around. So to 100% say just this input was used or if this projection was used you have to go to tools like up to genetics unless you inhibit the whole rest of the brain with TTX or something like that, which you know, put the whites lethal if you would do that energy will because yeah.

03:21:55
So that you can do that in the slide. That's how we do it in this life if we inherit the rest of the slice with TTX and then we just stimulate the specific connection. I can answer real quick. So it's a nerve vascular coupling with EGF here's I believe you're talking about the fact that F nerves is slower than EG and I believe the solution is laser F, nurse so laser F nurse is what open waters using.

03:22:23
You need a faster camera to do it. That's also laser. Doppler is something that is being. Used combining with holography, which is similar to an open water is doing but it's a bigger machine. So laser doppler with lography or you know function ever spectroscopy with the EG but laser F nares.

03:22:43
So it's it's basically much faster. It's fast as EEG and that's solves the neurovascular coupling issue. I believe and I think Nick Nicholas next. I can I was wanted to speak to answering that question a little bit, but you know if we want to move on again. Oh, please please sorry god.

03:23:04
Um, so I I I study Tramadol neurons and auditory cortex specifically the one the primal and neurons that project the striatum and. One of the things from Jeff Hawkins theory where since we're you know, we're talking about this and that in that context that I think is significant as these pointing out that he each cortical column is this is a sensory motor circuit and.

03:23:36
When I we were when I when we were talking about this, I think it was last night. I think me and. Sumitai agreed on this, you know, my my heart take on on you know, what resolution we should be these BCI should be focusing on right now. I would say it's interlaminar.

03:23:55
So if you could track and stimulate precisely at the precision of you know, say layer one in the cortex versus deeper layers which are more involved with motor action and we could kind of understand things, you know relative to to you know, the the level that I'm studying things that's kind of a course grain.

03:24:18
Thing but it seems like a reasonable thing for the current devices to do now is to to kind of get a handle on what's happening across the laminar layers of the cortex and then I think it would be essential for these therapies. You know, the other the other thing I study is the the inner neurons in layer one of the cortex that are controlling dendrites and I think reasonable like, First strategy therapies that could work with these BCIs would be some sort of pairing with you know, motor movement therapies paired with with a sensory stimulation and accurate interlaminate or stimulation from these these PCIs.

03:25:03
I feel like that's. Got to be a better place to start right now.

03:25:11
Alright. I appreciate it. Thanks everyone. Okay. I don't know if Nick wants to go next. By the way, I'm so I think Jennifer was asking Katarina at first some papers if but I like that's right. Let me just meet myself. Go ahead, Nick. I was just gonna say if you think I mean obviously oxygenetics is awesome.

03:25:34
It's very specific but any of us that work with it every day know that it's far from a panacea of specificity and I think Katerina kind of mentioned it a little bit like it's very hard to necessarily opportunities stimulate one specific cell unless you've obviously transfected the cell with a you know, the specific protein or you've genetically engineered the the model in order to express it only the Pacific side of the cells and then on top of that you have the synaptic connection, so.

03:26:04
Unless you're willing to like you said at TTX or synaptic isolated by seeing QX or something. It's there's many off target effects. So it is more specific than general electrical stimulation, but it's certainly far from this elixir of the all-knowing answer. And, Yeah we were talking about earlier too There's a there's a lot of barriers to using it in human subjects right now.

03:26:31
Like there's a lot of the techniques that make it work and animals are just not options for human subjects. Right, like even even in the papers that we publish with it, you know, unless you snapped by isolated the cell that you're doing, you know to actually say whether or not that that certain sub that certain cell type that you're stimulating or inhibiting is the one that's expressing it rather than just receiving synaptic input from another one.

03:26:58
That's expressing it within the field of light is oftentimes difficult obviously you can use retrograde tracing that you know that you will only like it won't be one cell but if you want to be specific for a pathway and only if a pathway got activated you can do express it that it's retrogradely traces and then expresses in those mirrors and then Right, right.

03:27:33
Implementing it in humans. Yeah, you would you'd have to do injection right in person. Yes. Yeah, we can do all the stuff and then and then it's gonna bleach eventually, right? Yeah, I mean, it's only gonna last unless you know how to open a critical period of buses to be in that short window you have with it.

03:27:51
It's it's it's not like a chronic thing, right? Well the pens on how often you activate. I mean you a CHRS. CHR2 is as not really good. They are newer ones that don't have the desensitation effect as bad as you are too. Um, But um, Yeah, yeah their new improved up to genetic tools that don't have this effect and you can use lowers stimulation like lower light intensities because of course if you use blue warm light, you will have and a lot just by using that light you will change to some extent excitability and damage to some extent the tissue of course, but, Definitely a lot of improvements made but yeah, we are not there yet to do it in humans as I said there the only clinical trial I know office for retina stuff from.

03:29:00
But. If you want to be precise at some point and to really fix tissue again in a precise way. I think you you have to one day go that route because you know that those implants. Doesn't matter he does different simulation and humans because it isn't neurosurgeon and you have also over time that you have tissue dimensional electric stimulation and then it doesn't work anymore after a while and then you have to adjust the frequency or the view implants and, And so on and so forth like the electric stimulation how we do right now and humans have also a lot of complications so.

03:29:54
There's some sort of push from. Professors and so on there, it's a hospital that we should. Start thinking about using opportunities in humans one day, but. It's not like in the next few years, but maybe like in the next decades I think. Well regardless it was kind of a minor point just as it often times yeah opportunity, you know the next answer and while it is very innovative and it's cool it's certainly has it's a limitations as well, so certainly points us in the right direction, no doubt but to have it be the answer is relatively maybe far fetched but I guess the original point as well as and say or what I was going to sort of propose to ask to anyone that may know or has any insights into is that oftentimes when we're, Sort of thinking about using these like in our link type of devices or something like that in order to elicit their behavior or response or a thought or a feeling oftentimes kind of similar to what I ask before we assume that if you stimulate XYZ neurons you're going to get you know X response from the patient to the human and while that's certainly the case, you know on a Tuesday if you take that and do it again on a Thursday, you know, you can stimulate the exact same XYZ and now you're going to get wire response from it and so.

03:31:22
You know, what am I trying to say here is is how how is. How do we sort of bridge the gap between assuming that the brain is only producing responses in the absence of any sort of varying input because you know, obviously one of the big functions of the brain is to produce different motor actions or patterns or emotions or feelings, but at the same time an arguably more so task heavy is the modulation factor as it's overcoming the modulation modulatory inputs coming from every other part of the brain.

03:32:01
And so is there any sort of integrated way that the same sensor can monitor the inputs coming in in order to tailor the output so that's going to be using.

03:32:17
Um, so I do have a kind of speculative answer about that so if you so it goes back to yeah so the idea that you have many many columns that are basically simultaneously rendering the same objects a cup so you may have thousands of columns rendering a couple of visual cortex and so but they're voting on whether that cup is is real and then eventually it takes less representation so but so maybe you're so the idea is that so your brain is always.

03:32:51
It always has a context that it's rendering it's always like the it's not just what happens not just the neural correlates of what happened right now it's it's basically you know the whole afternoon is being felt by the whole brain and that's all it's all done there, it's all it was rendered it's it's it's in the it's in the short term memory, it hasn't been deleted yet the person has been gone to sleep yet, so it's there it's there in a temporal way and so the brain can notice temporal patterns and so on and so forth and that's going to basically if you have if you if you have something that's going to be a simulation that's going to be effective one time and not affect the next time it may be it's because it's it's seeing it's It's so like in the case of like a very metaphor would be like when Katerina is stimulating a neuron that is just below threshold so that the next time that it's likely to fire if I was a little faster because it was already ready to go and that is enough to trigger the memory it's like so the source of the same sort that we met if we take that micronology and make it bigger if we if we get a neuro column to behave the same way the brain it's only going to become potentially conscious, you know, effective person's conscious state or effect them in the way you want if it's an alignment with what all the other.

03:34:01
Microcortical circuit with all the other cortical columns are also sort of like predicting is real at the other on the other side of things next Tuesday when you get the person that same treatment they respond completely differently because their brain is predicting something that is not in sync and so your question is yet can we met can we somehow stick our neural link electrodes all over the person's brain to figure out what their focused on now so that we can design a treatment to stimulate the brain that is actually an alignment with the with with their brain is modeling at that moment so that the brain actually picks up the stimulation.

03:34:36
That. You're giving and carry it the way you are hoping it will be carried instead of you know casting it out like oh no, I I don't want this stimulation right now doesn't agree with the rest of my voting cortical columns, that's my thought. Yeah it was just and I guess to be a little bit more specific but it sounds like you're kind of going to that right direction it was you know, let's say that you're stimulating one specific aspect of the prefrontal cortex and I'm just taking one random area and that area within the prefrontal cortex, whatever this synaptic space is is bathing in let's say, you know 10 nanograms per deciliter of norepinephrine at that one time and if you give a five heart stimulation, you're gonna get a behavioral response out of the animal person now put them in a different city.

03:35:25
Duration and that same synaptic space now has 15 nanograms per deciliter of norepinephrine which is a very very very easily doable change you can see three four four changes with these very quickly and you give that five that same five hertz stimulation to elicit the same response and suddenly you've triggered a you know, a grandma seizure or something like that because now you have so much extra endogenous nor modulators that are within and acting upon those same synaptic spaces, you know, so I guess with the thing that would be kind of cool is if there's sort of a biofeed.

03:36:00
Back mechanism in that it integrates a what? I want to say, um client is yeah. I was loop therapy. Exactly you have your negative feedback and they don't biological systems and sometimes you have positive feedback and it's a very very very important mechanism in order to prevent post sort of things from happening and when you implant an artificial device, you know, how are you going to in how are you going to implement this sort of natural negative feedback mechanisms that are constantly varying and if we can figure that out that we've been amazingly fantastic and maybe it's already there.

03:36:37
I just don't know. It's like a reinforcement learning stress, um, but then still your question about variability between humans is also fascinating and I think very much still it feels like an open question that's really very ability that addresses the temporal variability potentially, you know among one but when you expand to the many, it's a still a very sense it seems this scary and exciting and I think I can inject a pretty strong constraint on that that exact issue where because I was talking of we were talking to cementite yesterday about this.

03:37:14
Man, I brought up the the no free lunch theorem which just you know, it's it's it's actually a very robust mathematical proof but just kind of very kind of broad strokes here you're just saying no learning algorithm is better than another learning algorithm or you could think about if you plotted.

03:37:38
You know. How good the algorithm is doing on the y-axis against you know, an access of problems at the area under that curve would be the same for all learning so the the thousand brain's theory is saying implicitly that there's well yeah explicitly that the the cortex is using the same algorithm that it's been repeating it's repeating and he's hypothesizing that there's reference frames that are being computed.

03:38:16
Some things like grid cells place cells this kind of thing and it's that this algorithm is able to abstract any type of information into this what is like a format so the way the only way that theory works with the know free lunch theorem is that you're assuming the brain is putting things into a format puts all problems into a format that it can solve the same way.

03:38:43
So it's kind of touching on what people were talking about with semantics right reminds me of there's a recent. Andrew McClellan gangli paper about semantic development neural networks and what semantic structures would look like in you know neural networks and so in terms of this there's variability thing, maybe the you know, if we're gonna run with Hawkins being right then we would know then that things need to be put into this this kind of format which might make it robust to these.

03:39:18
Like individual variations between people and and different circuits throughout the brain. I think I might be able to tie some of this together if I can be allowed to speak so we some the note-free lunch thing it reminds me of a wolf from idea of computational equivalence of where you know, you can you can have solved the same problems with different algorithms and things that some are more efficient than others a supatise said yesterday that he thinks you know, maybe the no free lunch theorem is true, but the, The brain is tuned to solve the exact kind of problems that people encounter in the type of stimuli that people experience and therefore it's maybe an optimal a more optimal choice of computational algorithm algorithm and this idea that these algorithms are general whether you're in the visual system or the auditory system or so forth leads to something that Jeff Hawkins points to is that there have been experiments apparently in which the the visual system of a developing animal has been connected to what should be the auditory cortex and vice versa.

03:40:36
And each one just takes this the input that is given in an adapts to it, so this all this points to the brainhead in this general algorithm of data can adapt to whatever input you give it. Which leads us back to where we were talking earlier about or you guys were talking I wasn't talking earlier about how do we interpret signals that come out of neural lane or how do we put the right signals that go to through neural linked to get the things to happen that we want to have happened in the brain and I think what Elon Musk is counting on being a very smart guy is that the brain will do the work so we don't design the exact input pattern of the exact output pattern for outputs, he points to the idea of connecting.

03:41:23
Say a through neural link or some prosthesis to a physical prosthesis to say someone has a prosthetic limb and they have to learn how to use it now people use to think you have to hook exactly the right nerves to the right nurse to get it to work but basically you just give the brain an input and it figures it out and and and and give them an ability to an output and it figures out give it some sensory feedback and you can figure out how to move the machine it can turn on motors and turn them off and interpret whatever sensory information you're feeding in through the prosthesis.

03:41:58
So and this is also a good yes of the idea we're talking about about transferring memories from one person to another like how could one person possibly take a signal out of one hit the first person's neuro link and put into the upper end of the second person's neural link through the second person, how could they communicate you where with where would you direct those signals and how would they ever interpret one another basically?

03:42:24
I think you know musk's idea is that the brain just figures it out the two brains are sending noise back to each other and then they maybe getting some feedback. And some other way to spit to the biofeedback idea of some you know, they could actually use words to communicate as well and figure out a way to communicate just because that's what the brain is made to do well, that's what I have to say, so there are some research that backs it up.

03:42:49
I don't know the carried you want to go first. I'm sorry. I was just gonna say that's a really great point and I am. I agree. So David Eagleman isn't another neuroscientist he's talking a lot about research that that back set up and that includes pulling a rat's eyeball out of the eye socket and plugging into the audio cortex and the rat's brain just figured out that it was his this began to see with its audio cortex the audio cortex began to behave like a bit like a visual cortex basically and see without a heart with that eyeball and another case he David talks about using a tongue strip that's the electrodes on the tongue strip are connected to a camera and so.

03:43:33
Someone who's blind can begin to see because they're tongue is being stimulated like the grid of electrodes on the tongue represents the pixels on the camera and then the person's brain just figures it out so you so the idea is that you could just dump any kind of data into the brain.

03:43:50
And that could be stock data and your brand is going to figure it out and where you dump the data, it doesn't really matter that much but but yeah, so that's pause there. Yeah.

03:44:11
You made a? Work he says that's a new level so that's a brain nut so that our brains are tool more animals can be network together and be part of a single computational system to perform motor tasks which points kind of into into that direction and he made a brain to brain interface allowing transmission of textile and motor information between reds so all of this.

03:44:44
Like his his blood work points into the direction that the brain most likely can figure those things out. Wow. Would you would you think some research paper some more research papers Katerina as well the ones that Jennifer was asking about I forgot what they were but when what you just said?

03:45:09
Thanks to makeup um, specifically. I just declared my site the ones when you were you were talking about inhibition of sensory experiences with respect to autism there was anything specific to that. I'd be super curious, thank you. That's like such an abundance on autism and any retiree are research.

03:45:29
I can I can pull up I do more interested in like that. Immune response related autism the lights. I can animals is like a lot of work are you are you more interested in human work? I can check yeah, I think. Sorry kettering it didn't mean to cut you off um, yeah oh no work is specific to humans with autism would be most interesting to me and if there is kind of inhibition or excitation of certain sensory systems any example of that is I could starting point that can kind of run off of linked research papers into my own follow through yeah, yeah, there are a bunch of where they use the magnetic, you know, the youth organic fields to change the, The system and yeah, I will I will pick some up and put them on Twitter and then you can go from there well thank you so much yeah.

03:46:31
I usually appreciate it all. I will send you a DM as well. I did send you one make around the same topic so but I'll continue the Katarina and this is probably me saying goodnight as well, so thank you so much all of you and it's been a pleasure and look forward to being in future rooms on YouTube, thank you yeah thanks.

03:46:48
I will go tomorrow too have a good night.

03:46:56
I self to play devil's advocate and as my kid knows I'm a neuroscientist by trade side. I'm obviously fully on board with everything that's going on in our link but to play devil's advocate in the statements about you know, that the specifics of the stimuli may not necessarily matter because the brain can let's say sort them out into its own independent use along those lines of thinking do we necessarily then need to go towards the invasive brain approach or can we derive the majority of the functions through?

03:47:31
Let's say some sort of systemic perturbations, you know that are less invasive or through infusions of varying molecules or whatever it is that you might think of I mean as either way your permanent either way you might be providing access into the brain and whether or not it's a specific electrical stimulus or if it's a sort of more of a biological stimulus that's coming from the periphery which the brain is perceiving, you know, can you take some sort of?

03:48:06
Complex systemic stimulation that then the brain has to encode you know, just as it would an electrical stimulation within the brain and get a similar response if the brain ultimately any of itself is going to sort out what the stimulus is anyway. So I agree with that 100% in fact.

03:48:27
I I've I don't know if I've written about this but I've been thinking about you know, what is the the it may turn out that that the fastest way to to simulate the brain into a virtual reality is through your eyes and that sounds like ridiculous right because we do that already but your eyes are like this high bandwidth port into the brain but besides that yeah, so by the way, I wanted to mention because, There's been there's a debate about stimuli you know stimulating with opportunities being totally necessary I think.

03:49:04
I heard Mary Lou Jefferson talk about us simulating with with optical acoustic a submillimeter precision, but there's a paper that I can mention I'm put or something me post anything right now because I'm I'm not I'm doing things too fast for Twitter, but if you look up opto acoustic stimulation at submillimeter spatial precision, oh it let me it's right it is a mystery it's the thing.

03:49:27
I just posted so opto acoustic brand is stimulation at some millimeter spatial precision, so this is like the, Emerging modality for neuromodulation, basically low intensity ultrasound the regular ultrasound can't can't do anything below like two millimeters or something but this has a diameter of 600 micrometers and generates omnidirectional sound wave locally at the fiber tip through optoche stick effect, but it's just an idea that in the future perhaps we'll be able to do stimulation direct stimulation with optochistics, but but but yeah, so like I imagine yeah that we could we I had the stream once that.

03:50:09
They can I put something on my belt or my shoulder and the computer connected AI controlled my my body so it looked like I was upright into cafeteria and allowed me and then induced me into elusive dreams so I could get up out of the cafeteria and elusive dream and begin to like walk out on the street and begin to play a computer game that involved in that case angels falling from the sky with with axes and swords and medieval weapons and I had to fight them off somehow but the idea was that basically that the input to to the lucid dream.

03:50:44
Could could be any part of the body and I think that is that as long as you're connected to nervous system as long as you know, that the networking protocols of of being able to stimulate one part of your nervous system and cause reactions in an in your brain and and I think that you know, the examples of it as a super tide was saying was that, you know, if you similar the audio cortex the visual cortex is also going to imagine the cat that you're hearing right the big cat.

03:51:19
I think you need it yourself. Oh yeah. I mean, I was sorry. I'm Mike and I was done.

03:51:29
Yeah no that was exactly the the point I was a you know, wondering is that you know, perhaps we could get a majority of the way there before we even get into the brain which is inherently gonna be a more risky procedure, obviously, you know, it's gonna open up a new frontier and in certainly evolving if nothing else the different techniques in order to modulate it and measure the brain activity, but perhaps if the stimulus isn't all that necessarily to be specific.

03:51:57
You know we can get those stimuli from somewhere else that might be a little less risky or at least on the trial runs a little more generalizable to the public with without having to worry necessarily about the innate risk of you know, imminent danger right away, so when catarina was saying she's she's gone for the night but she was saying was that she basically so, you know, our neurons are being they have tonic and phase acquiring patterns, they're they're cyclic rhythmic patterns all the time they're firing every so often and and whether you stimulate them or not, but it but About the idea is that so so what she did was she stimulated a neuron just enough to get below its threshold so that she was extremely granular so that it wouldn't fire because of her stimulation but it would fire faster it would peak faster so it eventually produced the pattern that she was hoping to produce and I think perhaps we might decode the the brains to a sufficient extent that we don't have to stimulate as much as we as we might think we need to simulate now to produce the kinds of kinds of effects that we want to we might be able to reduce it down to just basically.

03:53:07
Just just stimulating just enough to disrupt the the rhythmic pattern but not but not as much as you don't may not need to actually cause any neurons to fire but just just get them ready faster. Yeah most of the neurons I mean when you you're manipulating them in general I mean they're not obviously they're extremely complicated but they're not all that smart of things.

03:53:31
I mean, they're pretty easy to entrain with different firing rates, you know, especially how genetics we do that all the time with the rhythmic systems is can these subset of cells and train the rhythm in order words in other words, like what is the minimum necessary amount of cells that you can stimulate within a repeated fashion that's in a different frequency than that of the normal biological frequency and can you entrain that rhythm so that It resets it and you can kind of figure out the underpinnings of what is the minimum necessary circuit in order to take control of whatever function is that you're measuring and we do that all the time but yeah, it's a you know, it's an interesting thought that you know, perhaps we don't necessarily need to stimulate as much as we do you know, you can you can take three neurons and control 30 of them something like that.

03:54:22
Wow, that's really cool. You're invite.

03:54:30
So popcorn style anyone wants to speak go ahead.

03:54:37
So I want to say thanks guys. I've got to jump out I'm working from home today and I'm keeping a lot of work done. I'm in Australia, so it's not one o'clock in the afternoon here yeah thanks for the really interesting discussion and I look forward to being back in 20 you all again, yes.

03:54:57
I thank you. I'm also gonna jump off I'm on that East Coast so it's 1 am here but it's been a great discussion thanks for holding the room, right? I will start inviting some new people since people are jumping off this is a six-hour marathon. I expected people will be coming and going so let me do some more invites and and if you haven't had a chance to speak yet or if you if you're if you down below and you you would like to say something just raise your hand and and I'll call you up.

03:55:33
Yeah, thanks Mike I got to jump off too. All right, all right have a have a great night and so.

03:55:45
I just thought want to say the sentence I woke up five minutes ago. I want the loading my brain not loaded but I just want to say for making relation between computer and brain is not necessary to using implants there are many other ways and we need to research on why not only is important and the Elon Musk projects because when we, Start using 6G.

03:56:23
Internet. The IOGVB joined to our life. And this is so danger but I'm researcher and working on it. And I love it, but about normal link. I think it's not new. We know many projects before it. The people using implants on brain that after three or five years and I just want to say it's not necessary be using implants.

03:56:58
It was Cena and I'm signing off.

03:57:05
Awesome. Anyone want to reply? I'm still just inviting some folks.

03:57:20
It's just a quick question because since we are talking about, you know, the technology available and we sequel to the public right now and Elon Musk seems to be a very multi-talented person, you know from paper from the whole AOL until today he had been involved in so many projects.

03:57:38
So at this project our government involved because if we involve such a high tech project normally the government and the military will be the first involved. And when he get into the public, it will be like 10 times. Lower than the actual technology that already available for them. So what is your point of view of the current discussion and the technology that we aware of right now?

03:58:06
Are there a line with the level of the government project that already running at the background?

03:58:22
I am not sure what direction take that question. My energy of thoughts on that.

03:58:41
So I so you would so okay so let me just sort of like so the question is about given the implications of neural link and memento and the technology that we have now today, including the the things that Elon Musk is working on you wanted to know how the government and people around the world should react to to that technology.

03:59:04
It was that is that right? I'll be I'll be understanding the technology from the alignment of the actual technology that already. How to say mature riches maturity because normally when the public sector receiving the technology is already 10 times lower than the actual technology due to the secrecy of the CIA agent and other government sector that is reserving the knowledge and information as a weapon.

03:59:37
To the to not show what hidden agenda is. I'm not going to mention it so the you pretty sure that the current knowledge that available to the public can be discussed is a line with the level of the knowledge that maybe the government or some agency that is hiding behind.

04:00:01
So I mean, okay, so it so I mean the part that I'm stuck on is like how do I compare this to the knowledge that is hidden right the knowledge is some agency has and I don't know how to respond there. I don't know if I am I guess.

04:00:23
I guess I guess you. I guess you kind of want to know it is. Yeah, I'm just not I'm not clear like when you when you said, you know when secret government agencies are I how I don't know what they're what they're what they're doing. I don't know what secret agencies are doing, so I'm not sure how to.

04:00:44
How to respond yeah, I don't yeah I think we can look at look at from different perspective if if we trace from the talent pool and the scientists that available are they a missing group of talented scientists that is hidden at the background doesn't come to the public and do their speaking so and then if we have the awareness that what we are knowing today for the public sector is a slow slower than the actual.

04:01:19
Normality ten times, for example, then we need to start to think of the perspective of what is already available and what we are doing research right now and we need to do the critical thinking ten times faster ahead so to avoid 
to be the weak team of the weaponize of the technology that is my point of view day here.

04:01:43
I'm done speaking okay, yeah, I mean I so I yeah, I understand that part so yeah, so for example, I eat at the first talk about knurling they. Elon Musk slipped on stage and he just started talking about the monkey right the monkey that they showed everybody two years later so that was I he started to talk about the monkey and everyone else like stretched them like hey, we're not talking about that yeah right with that happened two years ago and then two years later the we the the we see this video an early video and a monkey is controlling a cursor on a screen and it's basically a replication of brain gate so brain gate was is one of the the goals that they're trying to do is they might create like a mass produced.

04:02:29
In gate that you can. You can leave in the brains of people who are paralyzed and they'll be able to control cursors on screens and and maybe a lot of other things. You know hands like artificial and limbs and they'll have more fine motor controls with those things to narrow link and this is like low hanging fruit for a device with an early capabilities and so these things will be mass produced so my perspective is that that whatever whatever the public knows about that.

04:03:00
I mean, like even like covering a lot of these stories, you know writing about them, you know, if you're focused on it what you know is usually a like what I know is usually a couple years ahead of what the general public knows because that can be very focused.

04:03:15
On uncertain things but when what what I don't know is probably a couple years ahead of what I do know and and then and that that's where you get to like, you know the with the military the the lady the the secret scientists who are not reporting to the public yeah, they're maybe the bacterias ahead of the companies, you know that are working on the similar technology, there's lots of cool technology that darker worked on that the US Navy owns and and you know that has leaked out after you know, 12 14 years.

04:03:50
Of you know now that's going into the consumer and that's where people like me get to learn about it but but yeah, there's so I I just expect that whatever is being worked on behind closed doors by independent scientists who are not talking to the public is is is probably some really really cool stuff and some of the things that we are speculating about today, they may have made a significant advances towards.

04:04:19
I was just like realizing that basically that that you know with. With with laser doppler that you know someone mentioned laser doppler is being as fast as EG and that's when it that's when it like it really clicked for me that like for two years many legips and has been talking about laser f nars and at that the part that the the functional efforts microscopy was laser the entire time means that it was it was as fast as he that merrily Jefferson technology is probably as fast as EEG and has been this entire time but I don't think that she ever mentioned that it's just like it was like, oh my gosh, she's she's had these.

04:05:00
Capabilities and I don't know she's mentioned that but but I don't know why she would but but yeah, so that was just yeah, that's just like, um, I don't know who that was someone just popped into the room real for a second and someone is wants to come up but yeah, so um in terms of uh, you know, there may have been really interesting developments that have already happened that we're just sort of like vaguely speculating about but we but I don't know how we can know go ahead mark.

04:05:27
Are you saying that many of the AI problems that we think we're dealing with on the cutting edge. Um, I I don't know but they may have some cool technology. I'm not sure what what exactly they have so obviously but but I will say as much more limited that there was like 30 years ago because how the economics work and how much money the private sector now can put into use on this when you listen to to people who work in government.

04:06:07
They complain all the time that they don't have access to the top talent. And there's also people in AI talking on their relationship or how they get approached by our path another agencies and I will say there's should of course be some the day and something knowledge that that they have not public but I will I will say two things one they become public much much healthy than like thirty forty years ago and, There is not that much there used to be I know megawatt but.

04:06:52
Um, Well I want one of the major things is slowed down the spread of information, so yeah, so the only current one of the core contributors of of deep learning he got one of the nut he was one of three got a Nobel prize right with Jeffrey Hampton in Yahoo, he was saying that back in the I think was in the eighties, he he came out with his open so he had I guess this was before open source they wanted to release software basically open sources it open source wasn't a thing yet, but they they wanted to release them.

04:07:28
I think it may have been a neural network yeah it was like the it may have been the first CNN but but the thing is like the this is before the internet and so trying to release code in the eighties before the internet was was really hard it was really hard to share your code with other people and this came down to like basically like a bandwidth constraint if you can imagine the pre internet world or remember it like me, like right that there's some.

04:08:02
And so yeah so just because of that there's so much information to so much research that I imagine that the you know, the US government couldn't even accidentally distribute software in the eighties right so that sort of like led to they had they did have the internet right before everyone else right but it's like, you know arpa net and so arpa before dark but the thing is like yeah, so the information travels so fast that, If the government has an edge in terms of time, it's probably like like you're saying it's probably a lot less of an edge an innovation than it used to be in eighties because information gets ran off faster and so I I would expect there that the government could be two years, you know ahead of us ahead of but been but maybe not 30 years so it made maybe tent to maybe 10 years is kind of a stretch.

04:09:10
I think that the that that, What? Ever they're hiding is probably not more than tears more advanced. I'm just a wild guess but who knows?

04:09:29
What's your salvation with a monkey and a mask doesn't it he was talking about that two years ago before it was a vision officially released so yeah, that's something right.

04:09:45
I remember a good example there was this um hearing about this the satellites that only the military backs was to hearing that they have extremely high bandwidth to send data back and forth and they're really really fast and it's just not we in and they can do like GPS precision like extremely precise GPS and and and and oh, you can kind of you can find a reference to this actually online if you search for the I think the US government was trying to stop the European.

04:10:20
People in Europe from from deploying like extremely high precision GPS because that was like an advantage that they just wanted the US military to have or something like that and and but as soon as you get high percent GPS in Europe, well okay, well then what's the advantage for for the US military but that's like why we don't have high precision GPS in the United States is because they wanted this to be like technology that only the they wanted the military to have a technology that consumers didn't have and so, you know, the military doesn't fulfill good about that if everyone has the same technology.

04:10:55
They do but I'm kind of like yeah, I want high-precision DPS, how about you?

04:11:10
My name that the point is how people who work in this agencies so often complain about how they don't have access to top talent that's like apparel really really important to me. All right well, I mean, we're kind of I think we're kind of at the we're going way off topic here so the topic maybe I should recap the topic so yeah, we're just talking about neuralink and nementor in the massive overlap between the two mementos given us this sort of map for how our cortical columns are creating reference frames that reference the objects and and they can work together to represent everything we can see in here within our conscious work space right and then amenta so Nementa is going to be.

04:11:58
Putting new sensors into human beings that are you know have vast capabilities that have you know, when you have 16 electrodes per per tendran and you have you know, 3,000 of these electrodes with all these tendrans then you get to a situation where you can do things like like very like each electrode may be able to.

04:12:28
Detect create a map of of neurons that are firing within a 1,000 neuron radius or 140 micron radios and if you have like basically the way Ted Troy's work you can if you have multiple electrodes you can triangulate and if you have a lot of electrodes you can get high definition triangulation of of where the the neurons are firing and so allows you to figure out if you get it firing in the same area as a two different neurons or just one neuron or firing in two different areas is it just the same neuron or is it really two different neurons and the this kinds of this is?

04:13:03
The this is something a lot of electrodes to do I sort of like a high resolution reconstruction our medical imaging that and what stations that's neural link, that is near link, that is a topic of the room today. Okay and so the idea here is that when you combine basically the research of memento with research of narrow link potentially we're talking about with the narrow link devices is decoding the cortical columns and decoding what people are seeing and hearing a neuroimagers will be able to know when cortical columns are voting on a representation and what what the representation is, so that means that that that means and I and by the way, I the guy one of the guys who works at the Vice President of, Was here on Clubhouse yesterday and I asked him if if the narrowing device is something that will be decoding cortical columns and he he affirmed it yes that is that is something that is in the range of the devices capabilities, if you put enough of them in the right places this is possible and so that means that we're moving into a world in which you know, the courts will may be able to the I don't know what the timeline is, but we're moving into a world where for real the courts will be able to search your brain if they have a warrant to see if you committed a crime.

04:14:32
And they'll be able to perhaps trigger, you know, you're you're you're part of your cortex a trigger like you know, if you trigger the audio cortex, you know with the sound of a cat a big cat your visual cortex might imagine the visualization of a big cat running towards you really fast like a like a puma right it's a very dangerous cat and so you you might be able to basically pull up old memories.

04:15:04
I don't know but but but, It's an interesting it's interesting idea that what you can see and what you can hear what you can feel even what you're thinking your thoughts themselves your emotions these can be decoded from from neuro columns we had a guest earlier talking to us about explaining how emotions will be able to.

04:15:30
How you'll be able to just if you can decode a cortical columns you can decode emotions she was working with optogen in it optogenetics and mice but yeah, so those are big those are big things to think about in terms of like well what is the what is the public's reaction going to be what is um was the public gonna ask the government can do to do what kind of laws does the government want to consider passing what what is the real like, you know, these devices are gonna be mass produced for?

04:16:05
Initially for for the low-hanging fruit of of helping people who are immobile to have more mobility right to to give to let someone control the cursor on a screen with thought or to control artificial limbs with thought and then but then you know, we've mastered then we've mastered distributed these devices right because you have people all over the world who have mental illnesses they have autism and and depression and post traumatic stress disorder and, And attention deficit disorder and these devices can provide potential treatments by stimulating and and also depressing they can you know, like we had that this speaker earlier was explaining how she was able to make an animal that she was treating basically have a,

04:17:08
I should see if I can if I can pull my notes up right here, she was able to basically elicit a long-term memory that involved height frequency stimulation from an animal and then she had another animal to generate the compulsive behavior with high freest high frequency stimulation that matched that frequency and then so the animal then began to exhibit the the, Compulsive behavior right because because it was based in this high frequency stimulation, but then she used low frequency stimulation to to induce LDT which is a long-term depression and what happened was the animals compulsive behavior went away such so that's sort of thing is like has been demonstrated in a mouse what's also a demonstrated amasses is them, you know, taking a scanning base the basic primitive memories like fear and, Like a fear response to a certain thing and then transferring that with opportunities to another mouse so that's it's an example of reading and writing to the human to to a brain and when we have the high definition of neural link we're gonna have high definition reading and a high definition writing capabilities in the future, so maybe a high definition image.

04:18:36
Will be able to be downloaded from one person and upload it to another person so you can see with someone else saw and that's real. I mean, they were precursors of this technology there are papers that we can point to and and so I mean, I do have a group that of course people can join the group is on Facebook has the same title as this talk so if you type the title of this talk into Facebook, you see a group with about nine thousand people 9,900 people and but but yeah, we've got lots of papers and Of course if you if you need more papers you can ask and we'll get we'll get them for you but yeah so like what it so you know, so you're gonna have a lot of people are gonna want to talk about those you're gonna have a lot of people gonna want to ethics discussions legal discussions what laws we do we want to pass and and in a lot of scientists we're gonna want to talk about this like houses how soon is this coming what what are the sort of like technology hurdles that in in science hurdles that we need to do to get to this point and The thing that won't happen is it won't won't be stopped and and that's because it solves too many problems it solves too much human pain it's solves too much disease and so when you have a lot of people who are in pain and they have diseases, they're money is going to be at the forefront of their concerns so they're going to be paying into these expensive healthcare systems any healthcare systems, they're going to be looking to lower their costs and so the to pain is going to drive money which is going to dry this innovation which is why this technology is coming no matter how we feel about it, but but if we know that it's coming.

04:20:19
Then then what do we do is is is we talk about it and we yeah, so the world is going to change but but the the kind of thing that is being handed out is is more dangerous than a scalpel it's more dangerous than a gun it's a so it has to be so regulation has to be considered in in terms of in terms of being realistic, yes, it does need to doesn't need it will like need to be to exist because because people need really people need medical relief.

04:20:54
Right, but but it's also a very serious tool that can be misused so. Yeah just come to my come back to my point that the get of technology available between the government's mini the re and the public sector so the public is starting to have awareness of the tools can read your your your mind and expose all privacy and everybody is naked at this no privacy at all so how how sure that we we be sure that the government is not already deployed and reading everybody my in the background for the past like 20 years of the years or 40 years.

04:21:37
D has been deployed and they come to the legal legal policy that the public started to have awareness that we need to have some policy and legal way to protect ourselves. So therefore, therefore, I also searching is there any device that can detect such activity reading other people minds for their own objective already happening in the background of the society.

04:22:03
Let me give you some example. In Malaysia, we have this culture of afternoon. Lunchtime natural at the big corporation like Malaysian Airline, and we also having the CEO has been changed and he cannot accept this kind of culture in the corporate world. And when you think about reading people mind you need the subject to be stationary.

04:22:31
So the whole group of people in the conference is having their head down and having the afternoon nap during lunch time and then when the wake up the immediately execute what has been programmed. So like looking at this kind of a nominal you can like, To place a bit that is something physically going on in the background and that's speaking undefeated.

04:22:58
All right.

04:23:14
Where are we with a regulation? What whether you see me in regards to what this being proposed if something is already been proposed or not how that is coming. Well there's an I guess there's a sort of a example in the European legislation for artificial intelligence, which everyone might be to have seen in the news recently.

04:23:36
I don't know how familiar everyone is but I'm not definitely with it. I briefly looked at it and I and yeah, so there's a proposal in Europe about will you know, maybe we should restrict some AI, you know some businesses from doing some things some corporations from doing some things people from doing some things.

04:23:58
Maybe maybe the military. To just have like the best of the best AI but only for specific reasons right Only only if we're looking for terrorists or something and and I I when I hear stuff like that, I I think well if you look at the history of all governments like the history of all governments, there's no government that you can really trust.

04:24:19
But then someone else might yeah, there's no corporation, you know that that you can really trust either. So it's not it's so it's like it's but it's like a situation where like well, I think we don't want to make one group a lot more powerful than everyone else, right?

04:24:33
I mean, I think so. I mean, I, That's that's my thought. So the idea that the only the military should have with Facebook page recognition, for example. I don't know that's I don't know it's there's a discussion has to be had but but I'm not in Europe, so it's but I mean, I don't know what will happen in the US.

04:24:54
It's at some point.

04:24:59
Uh, Let's see does anyone else want to respond to that one? I'm.

04:25:09
Okay, we got someone. Okay, so welcome no that was completely incorrect okay, not not last years not next 30 years. It will never be it cannot be used against a little people unless they are a tied up in a like torture table or something like that you cannot from far away, it's again, it's the physics tells you that from far away.

04:25:41
Record activities of the brain of people or change them, it's a physics laws. Even EEG that's like where you record from the sculpt. The resolution is so low that it cannot see it cannot at all. I mean, absolutely. I mean, it's a lot of physics that it's impossible are you referring to what for that?

04:26:14
People against the will you have to arrest them tied them up and besides them

04:26:25
etc, so you will obviously don't if you happen. Like you're referring to the idea that someone said earlier about the government already reading your mind 20 years ago. I'm not suggesting that I wasn't I'm just talking about the last thing that was. Okay. I may have not heard the last thing that was said.

04:26:50
I'm I may have zoned out and maybe I'm getting tired but.

04:26:58
In terms of in terms of neural link in terms of gnarling this device that is in is in memento the idea is that your brain will be creating many models of what yours experiencing and many different parts of your cortex, but specifically in the cortical columns and then you know, I ask super type of nomenclature if a device like neural link could be used to decode those cortical columns and and and if and the the voting process that they go through 
to to recognize.

04:27:35
And object to affirm it and and he said yes that basically a device like neuralink could be used to decode court of comms and now if you're thoughts and feelings we're just saying yes, you said hmm festival possible and I don't know when we could achieve that but. It's there possible.

04:28:03
Okay but I mean, I'm not from I'm not I I didn't propose anything that was not possible. I am saying that you know, there's a lot of a lot of a lot of papers we can point to to support this argument as well that's what the whole discussion has been about as is basically, you know, it's it's I guess there's different a lot of different ideas about how the brain is processing information, but if if the folks at no mentor are correct that that cortical columns are.

04:28:36
Can be decoded in that that will potentially will find the representations of what we're seeing and hearing and feeling in in microcortical columns across the brain and in potentially that means that we'll be able to download those representations or predict what is there even if we you know, which is a different way of getting at those representations and, But in the yeah so in the long term.

04:29:06
I mean, if we're if the same process is also happening in that an outside this matters after the primary sensory courtesies, but also like in the prefrontal cortex now that and and and the other areas of the brain that the idea is that if you have an idea an idea has properties and that is also a reference frame it's a same sort of like mechanical operation is as as your brain tracking physical objects in your environment with your cortical columns, which is with the memento book is about.

04:29:38
A thousand brains theory and that the same idea applies to concept so just like mapping everything physical with different cortical columns with the thousands of them all over the place, but in the your your cortical columns are also tracking abstract ideas and a similar way and so you may have many different representations of the same idea and the protocols are helping to track the integrations of the different components, so there's like there's like in it and it's the structure of how that works is supposed to be similar to.

04:30:13
The the the way that you get a reference frame out of the interaction of out of place cells in grid cells and internal cortex and so that so if we can basically decode what cortical columns are doing in the sensory courtesies, you know with psychophysics and then potentially we can decode what the corticons are doing and in the in the rest of the cortex and then and then we're listening to your thoughts at the at the at the level of of course.

04:30:48
Of of cortical comms firing with enough sensors placing enough areas and and so that's what I'm saying, it's like well okay now for decoding the brain on that level which which I don't think I'm disagreeing with you but in terms of this is this might be a long road to get to this point it might be a decades of research maybe but you know, but,

04:31:16
But but yeah but if we can figure out the the network protocols then we can figure out, you know, exactly the right of management stimulation like this one optogenetics researcher came in earlier and she was saying that she delivered an amount of stimulation to one neuron that was sub threshold so that when that neuron was going to fire again the next in its next cycle it fired a little bit faster and that produced the pattern issue was hoping to generate which you know, she was doing things like causing causing neurons to basically.

04:31:51
Fire a lot faster and in introduce basically dysfunctional behaviors for the for the animal or then have them, you know fire a lot slower and make the dysfunctional behaviors go away because she was introducing long-term depression and but she was like really just getting very granular and very I guess doing coarse grains stimulation to just produce just the right result to change the rhythms of the brain to to create the effect of.

04:32:26
What she wanted to do and and so I think that I don't know exactly how we're gonna like I'm looking at like opto acoustic brain simulation, so I said my limiter precision neuroscientist came in and he was talking about what if we just stimulate outside the brain just to create the you know, because you can you can throw stimulation at any part of the brain that's gonna if it's if it's like, you know, if you if you plug in a third eyeball into the audio cortex, the brain is gonna figure out how to see with that eyeball, it's gonna take whatever information you give it wherever you give it and like a general learning.

04:33:01
Yoga algorithm it's going to adapt and learn what that is and and learn the data stream and pause because I'm just I give someone else gives so highlight a chance. No I'm coming from the wisdom of the ancient wisdom 
04:33:34
The journal that is being assigned to record down human thought 24 times seven, so now if you replace the angel as a satellite and according to the timing of the written of the Holy Quran when was saying and maybe they already achieved the technology that already be able to record all the human race thought to the technology that has been missing or being brainwashed from the society that we lost touch of the technology so and this is really clearly stated on.

04:34:09
The Holy Quran that maybe the scientist should also you know take a reference maybe a 2000 years ago five thousand years ago that that century that generation already achieved the way we want to achieve right now, so if they are so daring to put into the holy Quran that is angel that the recording 24 times seven what is your thought on this and if I'm done speaking so um, I want to escape that because it's too I want to keep that comment that going into that direction.

04:34:44
Because it's too far off off topic but let me see if we can invite some more people here and we'll sort of move move the conversation around a little bit let me just change some things thank you very much Dave and let me actually I'd love to hear more from Sohail for a little bit and then of course who should who can we invite to this room.

04:35:10
I want to bring some more people up here, let me just invite everybody down there. To come up and talk if you like. D was yeah, that's that's good, so I didn't get what like, I don't know what to add it to it's it's like. Not again sound like the question or something like that, yeah.

04:35:36
I think that's their money points. Yeah, for example. That other three quarters can do the job of the visual context. I mean principal and hearing. Things like that. Yeah, I mean oops I made it myself, um, the yeah, there wasn't it so David the researcher was David Eagleman and he talked about how a rat's eyeball had been pulled out of the eye socket and plugged into the audio cortex and the rat's brain figured it out began to see through the audio cortex another experiment that that has been done was a connecting an electrode strip to a camera and then connecting that to the person's back and a smaller electrostrip was attached to a person's tongue it.

04:36:28
Both cases the person was the subjects were blind and they began to see a primitive image on if in in their mind they began to see through the camera because and it was very simple because they just took the pixels of the of the camera and they had that create the electrical simulation on the electrode strip which either went on their back or on their tongue and their brain figured out the image based on the electrical stimulation, so the idea is that you really could plug in any kind of information.

04:37:03
To to a part of your body that has enough nerves like your feet or your back your tongue or into the brain directly and your brain will figure it out because it is essentially a general learning algorithm the neocortex is essentially self-similar across the entire thing like like I guess it's about I guess you say it's divided into cortical columns, but the cortical columns are essentially repeating and others differences, but the argument from the menta is that the similarities are are broadly.

04:37:38
More common than the differences in the and yeah, so let me just pause. Yeah cortical current is like almost like a universal computing device and competing machines something like that in computer science will have universal trueing machine. I'm not saying cortical column is universal through machine but it's similar similar kinds of it can adapt itself to.

04:38:06
Save their soil, so they'll do multiple senses and maybe friend computations and calculations can be done in. Quote-unquote a generic way and this is kind of in evolution this is kind of a later stage so like the software called areas of grain we're kind of almost like special peppers computers or special peppers devices.

04:38:34
Then could go column could kind of achieve the new technology in some sense that could do a general peppers computation that. I'm but it's slower. So that's what I yeah, it's it's very slower so cortex and software group areas they work together in different time skills and that's more or less like the fastest lowest that can be like vaguely related to us and those systems as well, but that's a different issue so it's I'm not saying that precise statements here, but yeah.

04:39:17
But here this is one of the processing things about columns have been kind of identified or discovered by a mons castle in I think 70s or. I may be wrong about it, yeah, we're in a mouth castle, yes. And it was before 1950. I think with 1940s, maybe.

04:39:49
Oh we lost you let me I'm bringing back up.

04:39:55
I don't know yeah I can say about like in court every computer but. I don't know what is useful to say. I just don't want to like start talking and purpose or something.

04:40:13
I think I'm. The ball into this to the stage by accident. Yeah, you're fine so hard that was an accident, so if you want um, go ahead and keep going. And then so later the more qualities where first of all they discovered that. So the maybe it's good to to know exhibit is a details, maybe it's good so one month castle where no more castle said an electrode in across the thickness of cortex.

04:40:48
When the electrode was rectangular. He observed different things and when he was like slanted I don't know what's right then the nuance had different policies but it was when he first surface of the cortex basically when he was going through the thickness of cortex he was seen all drones do the same thing and he was surprised because it's very tiny like how many millimeters is like less than a millimeter or something like that.

04:41:21
It's like six years. I forgot how I fixed the cortex is six layers, but. It's long enough so that you can see a variety of neural sponsors and functions. But he was consistently seeing that across the depth of cortex actress of codex. Moves exactly perpendicular to the surface of the cortex, he sees exact same responses.

04:41:52
So we kind of. Propose this idea that it's like a imagine like a cake that you cut it with a knife vertically and there are layers but each of these columns. Has a make a basic same functional unit, and those are only work together to do this kind of computation.

04:42:13
So this idea was kind of. First it was not accepted well because all new ideas are like that because it's like it was a true general two weeks claim about organization of the brain because what if it was just one so twice he it had that accidentally. But when other people start the same thing it was generally slowly accepted and won't castle was one of the very very important nurse scientist, but before expecting to.

04:42:44
Expected him to win normal prize with other hidden maybe because adoption of his Siri was slow. So critical columns and then there are so this is more about organization of the brain initially but then later he suggests a more thing like the hyper columns like multiple of this columns make bigger columns that are.

04:43:08
Still closely related but not identical and etc so they make if they're organization create kind of modules and this different modules and different areas work together a distributor process etc so he developed these kind of theories with lots of rigors. Experiments on my etc. And so neuroscience was already there and they were doing this stuff like in 70s and 80s.

04:43:35
Yeah neuroscience is all has other items just talking about the history of columns so during time people try to understand the cortical cone, what is that magical? Circuit that can do every calculation. So it was later on that if it's discovered that it's a universal circuit that can do same secret or same micro-architecture you can do many many versatile functions across different brain regions, not only different senses like.

04:44:09
Vision and hearing but also many different things like calculating physical calculations, like how objects in the physical work behave and basically most of the things that brain do it was later gradually identified but it's remained as kind of secret and is still almost as secrets that not almost like it's very they have studied many many different.

04:44:39
Types of newer and many different connections that they have. So they have like a detailed map of how these are connected but there's still a lot more details to figure out to see how exactly it works. So each of these columns has a similar. Connection to some other critical area, sorry brain areas, like as you said like played cells.

04:45:04
Recently. Or columns very like I'm very regularly they're all directly all the time back and forth sending microphones information to animals. Another area of the brain that kind of almost coordinates or manages the information processed by these critical columns. It's like a call center. But these are all theories that over time they are more functions found for example.

04:45:38
It's not just a call center that the coordinates scored by columns. And other things but a new mentor. Jeff Hopkins, he had had his own theory, he's a great. I think he's a really good neuroscientist in what in the rare case that. A businessman is also a neuroscientist. And they invested in proper.

04:46:06
Neuroscientific experiments to really using a cyclic approach unlike other companies. Find out like focus on what this. Focus on one problem and find out this what this could become more does as empirically question not to produce not to be worried too much about the application because if you want for each experiment five application for that particular experiment, you won't be able to find out how the protocol column works for example.

04:46:44
So he has said at least one either. There are other businesses as well like Alan Institute. Like co-founder of Microsoft all other. Before then is less famous than Bill Gates but he was actually the initially the brain of Microsoft was Poland but he later. Founded. Alan Institution using the money obviously vibration.

04:47:13
So an institution is one of the big companies also an institute invests in basic signs in the sense that when they do a research or when they map. The brain of bowels etc. They don't afford each project they don't look for how much business value it brings to them immediately.

04:47:31
So, they do basic rights science similar to academia bit. So new meant to because of that new mentor and Alan Institute. Have been able to achieve some basic finding understanding similar to what is not all the time in. In academia. So but they're more famous because per me because their companies that the companies usually get more publicity.

04:48:01
And yeah, this is a very simply finding by a new mental that in line with their basic science research that go to the columns of the understood more things about. Vertical columns in a similar way that many like thousands of. Let's say like for protocol, maybe hundreds of neuroscience working on that area.

04:48:26
So new mentality research centers are. Other research centers alongside of them. So they found interesting results about like how the location or? Place of the. At each and if I understand this correct at the level of cortical column in that basic or versatile competing you need. Kind of takes into account the location all the time.

04:48:57
And it uses it's using optical recognition and other functions. So they are kind of driving momenta is also driving the progress of. Science as well. Newerling is good in like methods, for example, they are. Found some apparently some. Surgical techniques and stuff like that, which also helps science as well, but they focus.

04:49:29
Is not a driving science necessarily right now but numerator is so that I was also fascinated by. Cortical columns and also Jeff Hopkins like I think he's real scientists that he's driving it is using more or less good approach and that's why he is like teams or he's that are.

04:49:57
Of achieving understanding new things about protocol, sorry. I'm I couldn't very well because it's kind of the morning here is like six o'clock. This has been great yeah, thank you for diving deeper into engineering. I'm sure many people are interested in in both companies since that's the topic. Leonard are you up for chatting I'm inviting more people up but but yeah, I just I love what Zabala was saying and I'm still like, you know cooking and and trying to do that but I think the Eric Weinstein's working on some of this work and I'm just kind of listening and taking it in and I think my only thought my conversation is the bridge between the chemical research of the brain.

04:50:56
Or the human brain, you know and how we function versus assimilated mind. I mean my company we've been working on machine intelligence doing network database the way we're clustering it is that sort of human computer interaction and. How we kind of focus on decisions theory improbability theory versus the earlier health care, you know ramifications which I think is just really vital and what stimulates, you know, our processing's going back historically all the way from human history and so you know, why are some people inclined to be acts versus why how are they able to overcome circumstances yada yada and when you start just don't be in that into true AI outside of the competition site.

04:51:48
You know, artificial intelligence and compasses that psychological side of philosophy and questioning what is it to be human what is it to exist, you know, whether you're human or not all these things that's variables and then what do we measure as this this output, you know is interesting because me and my girlfriend were watching a movie on Dan Brown's movie what am I thinking of?

04:52:15
Who was it we just saw it yesterday and it was all the da Vinci and so you you cross over that with the original one with religion belief in society a little bit of science and so forth so it's just across intersection near that fascinates me but my focus has been more on the narrow side of decision probability theory human decision making science things, but in decision quality and so forth but when you can encode that rather, Neural language processing, you know, if it's encoded binary by structure or syntax or semantics if you really can get this machine to infer to really draw inference so they'll say if we get the hybrid of taking on alpha go over at deep mind and then apply that to the human across the board, you know, we really looking at a true AGI.

04:53:15
In artificial general intelligence, you know, and I really tried to get closer to that and what does that mean for us so I'm still pondering and fascinated by both sides of it, but it was great that I'm not sure. I think it should call Cheryl if I'm pronouncing your name for everyone.

04:53:35
Oh, how do you pronounce your name? So hey so hey, okay, I'm following you sorry so love to follow up with you at any time and for anyone consider my in my profile my emails there about work and stuff like that to drill down deeper and Michael knows this but you know, yeah, it's just it's a great room like that you're doing and I'm falling in early for a while because it's interesting that I think and they're getting closer to.

04:54:07
I'll start just going off the grid here of when we start looking at edge computing and devices and the data update and download feet what can really be possible, you know, and so on we can see a world with that and as a side note for some of the rooms for some of the guys here girls and guys, excuse me, you guys might like I didn't participate this last Sunday, but there's a sci-fi talk that Hollis Dr.

04:54:38
Hollis has accepted or somewhere up in Northern California. Every Sunday on Clubhouse it's a sci-fi room I'll send out the sci-fi talk to something and they kind of just go over these hybrid things that what science fiction and what will become sized fact because a lot of this has led us to where we are now in this technology of at least imagining envisioning and then looking at new models and new ways to do things versus the repetition of applying certain data models to old axiom of paradigms because there's always someone in the lab that's kind of reinventing the wheels, so to speak it that's kind.

04:55:17
Of how we've gotten to where I think we are in this world right some you know I don't think we discover anything in my opinion, we rediscover you know how to use electricity because I just keep always building back to my favorite innovative which I just kind of love and you know, my girlfriend will say I'm obsessed with them but that's nigga like Tesla and if anyone knows and I'm not talking about Tesla the car manufacturer who patented all this and it's something that I've done already but when you show down in this work, you know, he's been able to connect this in the 1800s and we're just, The inner fruit from that tree, so those are my few words.

04:55:59
Hey thank interesting, you know, I think you mentioned decision yeah decision making is one of the few areas of the brain that is more understood kind of well and stood than there are very good models. That and describe how the brain circuits do decision-making but in certain contexts and limited context, but because there are many many things that the brain does and we don't understand but decision-making is one of the areas that is relatively more advanced and more understanding detail so I think that's why it's a very good area to target for maybe we are in the stage that we can find applications, so I think that's a good approach in my opinion from my, Knowledge of neuroscience.

04:56:53
I think it's a good area to try to find applications for and yeah decision making and it's one of those areas. And about chemical. Yeah we. Electrical activity is just one aspect of one of dimensions of the brain activity and chemical.

04:57:20
Transmitters also neuropeptides neuropeptides kind of slower. Molecules that slower than your transmit also genes gene expressions. These are like three more layers that they are being studied with these are not like integrated so they closely relate to address electricity generated expression another and other more complex molecules work together to build the function of the neurons but we are still far away from understanding them, so yeah, there are complexities about chemical versus electrical activity as well.

04:58:08
But still more research it needs to be there and there are already like. Hundreds of thousands of groups working on brain but it's component so slowly and there's lack of funding because the studying each small question requires like six months or a year of work of some people in the lab to working on on brains to find out answers, so that's the main limiting factor how much funding in science research we have so I graduated.

04:58:47
But yeah it's it's great that we're using I think if for example find out how people make decisions and how brain state of people are in learning we can help in learning so already there is I'm a personally know about one application. I haven't used like for example QEG you might actually use key, I don't know but QEG already is useful in that because you can see like, At a very very long rough level but at least that's that rough map of activity of your brain at least tells you what the state of your brain is at least you'll know.

04:59:29
I don't know if your eyes kind of anxious in a certain sense or how focused you are or maybe I gives you some indicators some just indicators of your decision is like, for example. Like very at that point we still useful for maybe actually useful for people who are like students who want to learn or people who want I think why am I not learning this and then when they see their brain in the mirror of this QEG like metaphoric me or not then they can see oh because kind of there is a bit of anxiety sitting there, so I'm just talking allegorically not literally.

05:00:13
Okay, it's not my brain is not this functional for example, it's always not that I cannot learn is that things sitting there doesn't allow me to think so let me search it out and then they change your brain of a state of the brain a bit and maybe takes practice and then they see they learn better and then so they don't fall into trap of.

05:00:38
Oh my friends are working. I cannot learn. I'm not. So. I'm not in casual something like that this kind of trap or talk about just that people find too these are great benefits for people they can easily use even now.

05:01:11
So are you learn are you kind of? So I know what it's saying something. I just asked my crucial oh no, are you are you using yeah something already or like in your kind of?

05:01:30
Go ahead well what what you just touched up on it? I apologize when a multitask because I like to get it. I'm going to be on stage be more devoted like what other activities or for education is stuff like that. I mean, can you elaborate how you think that can be used for education more detail at your house, yeah 100% what 100% I think we're touching upon is like well first of all and I was a former Marines hasn't the United States Marine Corps for you talking about so.

05:02:05
There's learning a new trade and skill or dealing with you know, PSD post about it, you know stress syndrome or PDF to your address. I would say how do they code right so sometimes it's just it's interesting to me personally as my experience because I'm older than 42 but it's it's like you'll see where it's reinforcement learning if you know AI between learning you're in that space that's all that's being reiterated to the brain like we're just looping in the sense.

05:02:37
I call it. And you're just reiterating the same thought pattern, or which are actually separate typically and separate from neurons but they're just sort of isolating about 80% of that repetitive pattern that says you can or cannot do X or Y or Z or you're still traumatically going through this when when that movement, you know, that you know, that that memory is sort of in the cortex of the brain that's still feeding that into people which makes these individuals relive that that situation and even produce the Chemicals you know within their brain to relive it I think it can be applied in educational efforts 100% I just believe that you know old school we would go by I'm calling old school versus so world you go by the discipline of just you know, and I think even Tony Robbins and other these are in the US sorry speaking to the US, you know, the US artists Tony Robbins is a motivational speaker and there's a lot of these people that used to say, you know just think you'll believe it and just keep reiterating that and you know, you're able to kind of come out of your circumstances and change your life to tractoring.

05:03:48
But a lot of this has been studying and research that what occurs doing these people going through this process for a couple of years or two of or two five years joining programs such as Landmark or whatever they join these programs and they're changing their chemical structure in their own brain because that neuroplasticity which was spoke upon earlier about ourselves and that's going to touch up on that are the neural, you know, the plasticity of the human brain that you can actually even though it was hard coded it could actually reload itself almost like a Computer or a simulation or an AI right because we all know that AI is the everything is software and and if you just have a hardware model you can you know send data to that hardware model to up to updated upgraded but the software is the fluid fluidity part of the or the Pacificity part of it that allows us to expand that's how we as humans can look at space, you know, my chairman is the former program director of NASA our Dr.

05:04:53
Alexander Rocky and you know, and please to always have miss a friend. But he helped program the International Space Station of me manage twelve hundred engineers and I was asking him why were you guys successful why did you think you would be successful of sitting the space station up there because it's been about 20 years since it's been up there 25 years and he's like, well, we knew if we just did the work and but at some point, you know, there was a belief and that goes even further for them to be able to add to that and then having continuously work.

05:05:28
I mean, we as humanity have created some great feats and have overcome. A lot of you know troubles and I think we we can continue to do so as long as we're we're reminded of the science and the knowledge and the technology and the belief and and what we can do versus what we cannot do so I was trying to finish up on that thread or touch upon that thread of.

05:05:51
Of the human facility of the brain of being able to sort of chemically neuron switch and then over time it I think it in some of the neuroscience in the room and maybe use a cell speak to this where I believe it kind of becomes fixed mindset it fits my fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.

05:06:12
I think one of the psychologists at Stanford data of study on that for years and basically what she was pointing out was that it literally there was a part of the brain that literally it's like frozen like a cube of ice which is shocked me, you know, 15 years ago.

05:06:26
Whatever it just really surprised me that our braids can be that hard wired but we do have the ability to melt that sort of ice.

05:06:49
So I've I've been listening to Leonard and so hey and David came back welcome back David in terms of agency or choice well both let's talk about both but you know, so that we have the the feeling of of the agency and we were talking about how if you don't have if you're into if you're if you're, Internal if your intern neuron system is is dysfunctional if it's disrupted if it I guess if you're if you're glial cells or damaged and you have internet on dysfunction from front and you know, I guess your immune system your immune system could cause your your glia to be destroyed and and then you're your brain is not producing enough inhibition and so you're inhibitions off the rails and some examples of you know, if you have too much too much excitement.

05:07:54
In one area you may have a compulsivity disorder right you may have you may interrupt people too much you may I don't know you may have too much stress to you know, like maybe maybe there's some length between PPT SD and certain or OCD and a certain parts of the brain that are stimulating like basically over stimulated and so if you could if you could basically estimate the stimulate those those parts of the brain with, With a low frequency stimulation and induce LT LD LTD low, basically the idea is that you could make that behavior go away and and you could so basically by using you know, either high frequency stimulation like 10 hertz or low frequency stimulation at one hertz to stimulate or inhibit different areas of the brain.

05:08:54
You you could cause behavior improvements or for people who are having a variety of mental issues or including issues with self-agency or issues is making with the feeling like they have choice and with devices like neuro-link and and perhaps also the open water technology you were talking about like, you know, potentially stimulation with a acoustic opto acoustic stimulation.

05:09:26
You know, which has some sub-millimeter precision then perhaps we could think about like devices where you can really address some of these. Issues that are the people have around the world in terms of their brain is just not firing the way other people's brains are and and so they would have maybe have more treatment options.

05:09:51
I think.

05:09:55
A positive for a second if you wanted to respond later or anyone.

05:10:08
I did not send David down there to that anyway, but if anyone wants to come up and and talk you just raise your hand and that was we've had some accidental movements today that know anyway, so people are welcome to come back up.

05:10:46
Yeah, I have no idea what's happening there, that was weird but. So yeah so agency yeah so agency was inhibition, that's um. I mean, I could go deeper I decision theory, so there was there was this situation where I believe it was people people that there's I think it was 2015 scientists came in and they said we've got figured it out we figured out twice in the brain it's an it's these neuro circuits in the prefrontal cortex, right that's where this is that's where it's happening and we've got this computer model that proves it and or not proves it demonstrates how it works and so um, It was these articles the neuroscientists identify brain circuit control decision-making and MIT and then there was there was something oh, let me see if I can.

05:11:46
I think I saved it, let me rotate to sit in theory, oh I just saved it, so I could pull it up again. This is weird, oh Work okay, so there's a paper check you can try it out, it's called. Working memory and decision making in the frontal. Parietal circuit model, right?

05:12:12
David's back, it's great he's coming in and out. I'm assuming just a very bad connection that's about trying to listen in but internet's not helping me out at the moment how can no problem we understand so yeah, so we didn't know why what was happening but but thanks for saying that.

05:12:34
So working memory and decision-making in this in a front of paradise circuit they created this really amazing check to check out this article I should probably link this but I I've assumed my Twitter is is is isn't I think Twitter doesn't like me linking all these really nice research articles or something.

05:12:52
I don't know but I'm just kidding I'm using Twitter too much so they're like you can't do it today are they okay all right but I'll link the articles another time so the articles called working memory and decision making in a frontal parietal circuit model, so if you look that up, you'll see the article and This they created this basically not nice computer model computer models of how decision-making works and I remember reading reading this so a long time ago.

05:13:19
I think this was the 2017 paper and if you look at the pictures below, they they sort of like explain how how the decision is, the decision is is being diagrammed by by neurons firing it's really cool and I was so convinced at the time but then I read this book called the narrow basis of free will a criteria cause.

05:13:44
And he had a better idea and I'm still convinced by his idea I still think it's a good idea but the idea is that okay, so the neocortex itself sort of self-similar across the entire cortex, so if you have decision-making happening in one area of the cortex and arguably it's happening everywhere right same mechanical process everywhere and so this guy who wrote the narrow basis of free well criteria causation.

05:14:09
Peter this last name is TSC I should really just figure out remember I should remember how to pronounce the name. I because I talk about his book all the time. And so he has this there are basis for you. I was like, you're neurons are detecting information and they're they're the neurons in coordination they're detecting like the basic basic roots of information and the in the cortical columns are taking these detections and and so this is so in some sense neurons and and neuro circuits are reacting to incoming information.

05:14:48
By setting the criteria for how for what is necessary for them to react in the future, so if you have if you have a neuron that let's say that say that. The idea is that the the it's gonna store a temporal memory it's gonna store like okay there's a song and you're gonna have the the neuron remember when in time certain beat happens, so it can predict that song when when you hear it again and so some ideas are that well, we'll have the what spikes on the dendrite that will.

05:15:28
I think I'm saying, right? I think it's spikes on a tangent right that will represent the temporal memory and and they're gonna help the, The the the dendrite to to resist firing except in the case of situation where it recognizes a certain pattern and or or I don't know if it's or maybe it works a different way but the idea is that is that a dendrite is gonna store a long term memory and then so it's gonna look for two memories down below it.

05:16:05
I mean not two memories, this is gonna look for a pattern in a you know that and that's coming into. It right, so it could be like to to neurons that are it could be like the the layer of neurons it's closer to the incoming. Sensory organ so it could be your eyes so so there's a there's the v1 layer and maybe we're talking about the v2 layer, okay, so the v2 layer has a dendrite in it and it's listening to the v1 layer and and it's looking for a specific temporal pattern, so that means that it's gonna say okay only if these it's temple and maybe temple and maybe there's the spatial dimension but but if in the case of piano it's tempo right so it's it's listening for a specific tempo pattern and maybe oh, so maybe maybe so piano would be phasic right because it's it's not just tempo and There's not spatial but it's it's phasic there's something characteristic about the piano tune right so so anyway, so you'd have you know, your you have at least one arm would be listening for when that tune is gets struck and so there'd be some sort of sparse distributed signal in the in the an audio cortex that because we're talking about piano and then you'd have a dendrite that's listening for the tune to land at a certain point because if it doesn't land it that certain point it's, A different song you got to have a certain sort of like, you know temporal pattern to recognize the song even if you change the pitch to the song right so your brain is is doing this somewhere in the brain the this temporal recognition of patterns is happening and maybe it's the dendrite and then when that recognition happens, you see the neuron it has to either neuron itself has to change so that it's reacting to that pattern.

05:17:58
Or. Where the neuro circuit has to change that neuron, so it's reacting to that pattern. And and that means that so that means that the basis of a decision-making is at the neural level or neuronal level because it basically the idea is that a neuron is deciding is detecting information and deciding whether to react based upon the criteria that it sets for when it's going to fire when it's going to react and when you choose when you're going to react that's that's the that is the microscopic version.

05:18:39
Of a macroscopic thing and and so it's it's it's also really interesting that yeah so so maybe if you if you if you don't if you like if you don't if you feel like you are too impulsive like you're interrupting people too much for is a common example that we can all appreciate and club has it's always good a person who comes in the room and they're and they just they won't they won't pause themselves to let other people speak and and if you and then they'll interrupt us right it's fun until they until it's not but The the idea is so maybe that person is having a failure or a difference in their interneuron system where it's over stimulated and we are we're more inhibited and our inhip are inhibition gives us some additional agency and so how did that how does that how does that connect to you know, our neurons so maybe our neurons are setting their own criteria and our neurosurger sitting on their own criteria and, Inhibition has something to do with that as well.

05:19:53
I'm curious and and in the fight yeah, so let me just pause there and I have more of a pause there.

05:20:05
I think important aspect of what is that was interesting and important aspect is? Lots of things are happening at the micro architecture level in the sense that yeah individual neurons each of them or less it takes some patterns so. It's not like if there's a piece of issue for the tissue sorry, there's a piece of tissue that does it computation.

05:20:37
It's not like a. Mushy piece of like tissue but each individual neuron with their dendrites and complex pattern of connection with other neurons. Can detect certain patterns, so they distribute. The computational calculations and patent detections and prediction that you say is I mean, I just said between themselves and yeah do detailed.

05:21:15
Computations and patent addictions, so lots of things are happening at the micro. Circuits it means to understand this so a circuit a small piece of circuit is microscopic, really. Yeah, you said many other points. I just wanted to. After five this part, of course because usually there is kind of misunderstanding in that when for example signals are recorded in EEG or electrodes like not.

05:21:53
A microarray through it, but just broad metal like EEG. That level of details are not seen and lost so we need to see it's like Ishna and can be seen like a person who is working at the impact material the organization of corporate. So each neuron has there's lots of sophisticated and elaborate computations including what you described in a nice way.

05:22:24
Yeah, that's the point I wanted to emphasize. Wow, thank you that was really fantastic because the what the microscopic picture of what you just said is sort of similar to the macroscopic picture that mementos describing and that's very very interesting so do by the way do you know of a paper that sort of encapsulate in cat encapsulates that I'll probably end up finding something but if you think of a great one.

05:22:59
So which aspect because you what you describe you describe many things actually I do mean about the micro seconds or you are talking about that emission thing or it. I talk about the layers that you mentioned or oh I'm activity because the other you touch on many assets. So.

05:23:20
Which what you said specifically about neurons distributing calculations or neurons distributing pattern detection or neurons distributing complications between themselves that specifically is something that at the at the micro level I that would be great to pull up in a research paper because that is um that sort of helps define a little bit more about what's happening at the cortical column and micro column level, but also there's an analogy to to.

05:23:55
To large-scale things that Nemeta the big picture things that momentous talking about so if you can think of a paper that's sort of like describes. Nurse distributing calculations and pattern detections and computations. That's yeah. So basically. So this has been them a main hard time or kind of way of thinking in neuroscience scenes forties.

05:24:28
I would say at least. Even Roman Cajal when he. Found out that the neurons like individual neurons have like elaborated complex. Branches and operation and stuff like that. I don't know if whether he postulated the functional distribution function of the customer, but I think even like before 20th century by Robin Kahala, I think it was probably.

05:24:58
Thought of Oh, he's happy. You were trying to generous sparse distributed representation. Yeah, but in general I get to obviously to have a better understanding better to see latest research, like numerous paper actually would be the one that needs it for that because it kind of culminates or like, Describes the kind of refined view that we have over the the decades but I'm saying like this kind of micro view that the microscopics are there has been like the main actually in maybe 40s like in the earliest neural networks.

05:25:37
Even article neural networks are based on that picture yet because in art scenario networks you have neurons that's a elaborate weights in the weights between the neurons are important that each weight can be more or less contributing to a big computation. So connections models that the roots go back to.

05:25:56
This which is actually almost precede the first computers. So this has been around but but a good paper for that maybe maybe the numeric or maybe there's like a books about like synaptic organization in the brain, etc. So, um, Yeah many things yeah. I cannot like point to one.

05:26:19
Yeah. I know I I get it now. I am you're talking about. Okay, I think there was a sorry just remember there was a book that was kind of emphasizing this on this kind of micro. Market sacred thing. I thought about the name of the person I'll pay later but as I suddenly maybe momenta because they try to give the they work is kind of.

05:26:47
Try to focus on what is that despite her circuit in that column, maybe that's the level the right level of using things. Hey Micah, this is Leonard. Hey letter. Yeah, can you send me your email me you did speak about earlier now. I'm kind of cross-referencing what you were asking earlier, so I'll mention that paper.

05:27:09
Decision I think it was decision mapping or decision theory a little bit on circuitry. I know it's an older paper but if you when you get a chance whenever just email me to my emails in the profile, but yeah, I'd love to look at that paper because I think there's a cross-correlation of what you just said what you are alluded to in what so I'll talk about on and I will pronounce in your name so hell correctly because I'm always doing that we're pronunciations but um, so my friend please I beg your forgiveness, but um, it's a matter of um in a multitasking should be.

05:27:44
Doing but it's a matter of the correlation. I think of circuitry and decisions and then the imprints of the human mind slash brain or what we've kind of taking in sensory perceptions and so some of that I just see across vector there, that's all. Right and so highly I just thought of something the about the neural engine the detector in the brain so I think previously the you all of you mentioned that the recording the detector the the electrodes are recording the potential or a voltage in the is a unit of potential but are there any devices that detect?

05:28:41
S the magnetic field in the in the brain because the current if you if there is a current there's always a magnetic field and so either you measure the magnet field the strength or the or the vector potential of the magnet field so I'm just wondering if in biology or especially in neuroscience is the magnetic field part of the detection or is it too wheat to detect or or something?

05:29:16
It's a bit of because I never met her, maybe people were mentioning magnetic field detection. Yes, there is method magneto some sorry. I might say they're wrong magnetosphilography yeah yeah yeah that's it what do you want to say something that's wrong yeah that is actually very promising because it's a device that you can put on top of your head and if it's quite a big device it's very heavy and it's very expensive because it has to detect a very very subtle magnetic fluctuations in the magnetic.

05:29:58
Field but this is actually has been one of the promising was it can detect to a good precision much much better than like EEG, for example, let's resolution that electrodes between their microwave and inside the brain but still precision but the problem is that it's a big device it's heavy also it needs to be very close to to the head so it cannot be like used to read people's minds on the street or something like that, but me is MEG is very promising but it's quite still an expensive.

05:30:32
Team. So can it so I suppose to procludes the possibility of just like the electrodes inserting into the brain. So to at least presently the magnetal several logarithmic is not cannot be is not to map the militarized enough to be able to to be able to insert it into penetrate something just so.

05:31:07
It. I think it can get as much as the precision that we can. So it speaks so one barrier is that they speak but also there's another inherent limitation in the resolution of information that in principle they can get. That's also a limitation but in the non-invasive method, I think it's highest resolution.

05:31:31
So amount all the non-invasive instrumentation, this is the highest this is of the highest resolution here is I would say, Yeah, as far as I understand yes, from what I have he Yeah, so yeah, I mean I understand that I can eat just I'm just speaking from a physics point of view.

05:32:00
I don't know that because the if you just put the electrode outside the brain and then if you have a distribution of charges inside the brain basically a close to compact region then you the you you won't get the, If you just record the potential you won't get a unique solution for the distribution of charges and I suspect the it's this I haven't worked out the thing but I suspect I think suspected it's the same for the magnetic magnetic field as well.

05:32:43
So but maybe it's better than EEG if it is outside so I think if he can get inside just like the electrode going some. I insert into the brain you'll get a better the the I mean if insert the magnetic detector it's inside the brain that will get a better resolution the neural firing and currents.

05:33:09
So is that the case or you you think otherwise? So let me see if I find this to quirky. So you're saying you use the like basically MEG but in a smaller skate so that we can bring it inside so we can we can use it closer to neurons or different yes, yes yes I'm saying I don't know if that's using my use but that I think you're physics intuition is it's correct that it's quite higher resolution.

05:33:44
So the the microelectrode that yours actually there it has a highest resolution. I didn't get what you were what was the cons what was kind of disadvantages in your opinion the main is advantage for electrode is that it gets a too narrow view like you can see one neuron what it is, it's doing so the benefit of EM.

05:34:08
MEG is that it cannot. With relatively good resolution still less than electrode but from a broad range of like population of neurons across the ear region, but I didn't get what was your the discipline did you mention for MEG of so so basically what I'm saying is a the the MVG the magnetic field he basically you measure either this pin or the the magnet little magnet spin.

05:34:48
Or the spin that generates the magnitude in the brain or the current that that that's going through in the brain so basically because current actually generates the magnetic field so the you can I mean either so there are two sources right they actually the same source but macro one is macroscopic and one is microscopic so macroscopically you have current let's say neuron conducting the is is there's a current going through neuron and then it will generate.

05:35:23
Magnetic field and then the others probably they I don't know about the biology so so I am just saying in principle physics, so if there is a kind of a magnetic like spin like the the the molecules if the electrons going around the the the market if they they line up they're no more producer magnitude, but.

05:35:55
But most likely I think it's the current going in the brain that generates the inlet magnetic field so basically very clear that you you can back out from detecting the magnitude you get back out the current dense, so the distribution of the current location and strength of the current but yeah, I think in principle if you just detect the magnitude outside the brain and it will suffer the same short for the, Detecting the electric field outside the brain because basically you can have two distributions let's say the just two distribution two different distributions of electron but they they charge but generates the same electric field which is measured by the EEG so that's why you you have a the further away you detected the the lower the resolution would be and then the same thing happens with the magnetic field but, He did the degree to which degree of the the low resolution or the none uniqueness of the solution is different but I don't know that the the the specifics but in principle you you'll have this non-specification or non-uniqueness of the solutions for the the distribution of the charge and the distribution was current so so that's why I think but that's why.

05:37:40
If you just measure from the outside you won't get the highest resolute resolution, but maybe when you say the the magnetic field detectors is however high resolutionary probably compared to the the EEG they may it may has a may have a high resolution but still in principle you don't get the you won't get the you won't resolve.

05:38:09
The the ambiguity in the current distribution so but the thing is this is this will be different if you're detectors inside the the region inside the region and distributed as dens as possible inside the region then you can back out the distribution of the charger the distribution of the mega field so that's why I'm asking about that so um, I want to comment because so so what's interesting about MEG is you don't need to attach any electrodes to the scalp because the, Magnetic field emerges from the brain and through the skull and the scalp without any without any distortion it's not like the skull is is it's causing an issue here so that but still okay, um, I didn't mean to do a straw man on you but sorry about that but I wanted to say that that the energy signal mostly reflects intracellular currents so what you see with imaging and what you see the electrodes is different types.

05:39:19
Ivity, for example, the radial sources that form the dipoles the best dipoles for scalp EV, these are not well detected by mg only currents that have a component tangential to the surface of spherically symmetric conductor produce a magnetic field outside the scalp and. So this facial resolution of MEG is better than EEG but but that's some because the magnetic fields are not scattered and just and distorted by by the skull but so that's why we you know you put electrodes inside the school and the resolution is massively better.

05:39:58
I don't think that would happen with with energy so so in practice energy source localization is still not accurate because because of the model that it has assumptions that are overly simplified and are not adequate to represent. The. Actually a physics and physiology involved in human brain under even ideal conditions the improved space resolution of MEG's insufficient to obtain information about the local circuits and the layer differential effects in the cortex about or about neuronal spikes and the neuro the the necessary requirements for revealing not only the local the locations but also know the mechanisms of neuronal operations and and there's a further problem and which is, That you know, when you have if you think about the oscillations of the brain, if they might be very the you know, the idea is that your brain has like lots of different kinds of oscillations and these oscillations are changing all the time and but from from the big picture these oscillations are sort of like interfering with each other so much that the brain I am I may not be saying this correctly because I'm just learning about this now but it I guess it could be the case that if you have so many.

05:41:23
At the same time and it just looks like pink noise and but the but the brain can can you know as a whole like, you know, sort of like seemed to represent a pink noise state but then bounce back and do into you know, something that that's just like the illusion of like all the different oscillations sort of like canceling each other out and so I mean, I don't know like I think that the trying to use imagey to decode what's happening in the brain layer by layer and neuron by neuron.

05:41:58
Might be possible but I think that what needs to perhaps improve is basically a new computer model of of a new mathematical model of and predictive model of oscillatory changes in the brain and and and so like you're it's like decoding this this really complex. Hmm. Electromagnetic pattern from from the complexity of like something that disappears to be noise has some structure to like sort of like doing like that something like a four-year transform where you're as like it's like like a three-dimensional four-year transform where you're where you're figuring out what are the frequencies in different layers and different and different regions because it's because it's all gonna mix together right from the perspective of your sensors unless you've got unless you have.

05:42:56
You know, but you can't like you can't use electric electrodes in anime machine mmg machine because it's a magnet some magnetic machine right so you have to if you if you're sticking sensors in inside the brain they can't be magnetic if you're gonna use image and that's that's another sort of logistical issue.

05:43:15
Yeah, okay well, I mean the I think what I was saying was a bit more specific basically I tried to basically take in this as a just just compute the the distribution of the charges and the current as for how the current originate. From the biological process. I'm not concerned about that yet.

05:43:52
I'm just talking about that distribution of the the current. So what I'm saying is that the the yeah, I agree that the magnet field is not distorted much by the the the skull or the the surface interpretations and scope and the and the air The but the the reason, For the lower resolution of the electric area to solve for the electric distributor charge distribution inside the brain through EEG is not just the distortion of electric field.

05:44:36
I mean it the the so long as we know the boundary condition or the interface condition we can still resolve that issue but the the more fundamental issues that basically you're when you the potential on the bound. Ed region a compact region the boundary of the region of will not is not uniquely determined by the distribution.

05:45:05
Well, actually the other way around and not you can have it the the potential on the boundary is not unique does not uniquely back out a. Solution of transitive distribution in the interior. So that's why it's not about the the change in the boundary the how the boundary changes the electric field.

05:45:36
It's the it's the outside the the non-uniquelyness of the solution. So so that's that's the problem and and it's a fundamental problem and then so the and and same thing actually I have to. Work it out but I would highly suspect the same thing happens at the for the the magnetic field the the current so two distinct current distribution will give you the same magnetic field measured outside the outside of the the regional home on the boundary of the region.

05:46:23
So, so that's the, The that that's the problem. So that's why how you know, that's why you they will have a low resolution if you just measure the fields be its electric or magnetic field outside the region and the only thing that you can. I mean, it's for certainly you can.

05:46:48
Just put some assumptions saying that okay, so there's the possible distribution is the cup it's finite set of them and then you choose the choose from along these possible patterns like a pattern matching pattern recognition exercise, so but to fundamentally if you don't have any pattern unknown don't have any inquiry distribution of the prior idea the distribution then then you won't be able to.

05:47:23
Back out the distribution of the charges nor the the current but the thing is if you put this detection detectors inside in the interior the of the vision then you can from basically firm mathematical point of view then you can solve for the eyes distribution that's that's what I'm saying.

05:47:48
I'm I okay, so I'll accept your physics page argument that we could get improved resolution of the whole brain even if we couldn't you know, do a four-dimensional four-year transformed. We figure out what part of the of the the brain that that the holistic model was representing like the individual neural layers or individual neurons, but I don't know like because we don't put electrodes on people with image it's a big machine that's around your head and so like getting closer to your brain means like removing your entire skull and right that's what I ended up isn't it neural like I I'm I don't I and I know what you say it's it's invasive.

05:48:26
I completely understand with that but I'm talking about I'm looking into say the Same doing the same thing as the neural length is doing inserting the electrode inside the the brain so so if if technology allows can we put also magnetic field detectors inside the brain as well? Yeah, that's a different I don't know that's a different question then and because energy is is is outside your your school so that so then we're not talking about MEG but that's a different kind of magnetic field detection.

05:49:05
I don't know the answer but by the way Leonard I sent you let's look that up let's research that Hansen, let's find out and maybe there's maybe we'll discover something that already exists Leonard I sent the the email to you that you requested so. Thank you very much my guy I got it by the way I was just gonna ask hands and but I don't want to see this threat but you kind of covered it already which was um, yeah if we're talking about electoral magnetic resonance or imaging and demonstration you've almost had some of my own questions like which was there can't be invasive and not invasive at the same time these two will cancel each other out, so if you're looking at I was going to ask if you're doing this in the lab versus the radical mathematical models, have you been backing away?

05:49:55
And leading sort of the electoral magnetic imaging and resolution from the subject and/or subjects and are you just modeling it that way or are you just you know, putting forth a hypothesis which is fine, you know, because everyone's always thinking of what the model could be because I think at the end of the day, you're right you you're going to cancel one of the other out it's neither connected to the skull or to the actual knows of the brains or the cells or it isn't and what data are you leading what's going to be your input output from that standpoint and are you further distance?

05:50:30
This early I was thinking quantum entanglement, but listening more it sounds like you're you're going down a path of either, you know, it's neither a physical connection yet you're you're trying to you know do an AD testing model and I'm just I'm asking a question not making a statement I understand so I'm I'm not talking about the quantum mechanical effects yet and and I don't think we can detect the quantum mechanical effects at the state.

05:51:05
With all the noise and all that but anyway, I'm talking about the classical classical dynamic if phenomena the I'm just trying to see basically. I think the the the purpose of the electrodes is sticking into the brain is to detect the charges or the charge distribution the and and the and and and then the current.

05:51:40
So so if you get the magnetic field in the I mean, if you detect we can detect the many field, then you can deduce the current as well so that's why I'm asking the question whether there's detect I mean magnetic field detector yeah and then whether you can put it in inside the brain as well, so there there there is there are electromagnetic field detectors, they're about the size of the walkie-talkie and they're just they're called the EMF meters.

05:52:13
I've never heard of anyone putting this inside the human brain this might be a really good idea you should jump on on on developing a product that does that you'll sell to millions of neuroscientists who will be very curious. I'm sure yeah if if one can miniaturize a miniaturized field detector yeah yeah yeah just it's, The biggest barrier for our understanding for more understanding of the brain and also better interfaces is better resolution any method that can make that possible any method that can improve that would advance this science of it also the application everything so it's a good and I think in principle people in physics, especially the experimental physics.

05:53:10
Can help that so I think the next breakthrough would be physics, so I think about those ideas would be the great idea by the beat MEG resolution is. Few millimeters, so it's spatial resolution like things smaller a few millimeters it cannot deserve but in terms of temporal resolution it's milliseconds and another point is that m e m e g in principle cannot be more than MRI because MRI is also magnetic that is active so it's resonance so MRI with MRI, they could achieve less smaller and millimeter voxels, but it requires high magnets at the, Idea of bringing it is now closer to the surface.

05:54:04
From the weather invasive or not non-invasive any method that can show us a higher resolution of what happened there or a broader view but with higher resolution would make a big very very big solution so many noble prizes are awakening there for this kind of system and discoveries by physicists.

05:54:32
Yeah, I do believe that and the NMR machine that that's yeah like like you said I just want to emphasize that that's different from the very few detector because anomal machine is actively putting a magnetic field from outside the an exciting nucleus and you know that so so it's different from recording the the, Current recording the electric field a way of field the my argument was that's sorry my argument was that there is a solution cannot afford MEG cannot be more than like MRI or yeah.

05:55:25
I know I completely am yes, yes. I am just trying to get more emphasized that point. I agree with with you what you're saying because the NMR is a outside active. Imposing actor field and which is actually very high like a field and actively exciting the nucleus inside them inside the body so so that's different from the source the having actually you get the radio wave not not the magnetic field you do not detect anybody here so it's different so it's different from the detecting very few to generate by the current inside the brain.

05:56:17
Yeah. Actually, I want to pose another question to soak. I or is so high and somebody other people who may know about this. The the cable theory for renewal signal transmission is just. Is more about the it is just the electric potential basically capacity and capacitance and and and then resistance or know that but it doesn't include any inductance, which is basically the magnetic part of it and I'm just wondering if.

05:57:10
The because is it because the the effect is so small or the theory doesn't just ignore that that factor. So I first of all, I think we should we should call it not cable theory, but conduct tense base modeling. Cable theory is a subset of that, but the conductance based modeling which means like.

05:57:43
How you can host a yeah but yeah the electrical field I've seen a lot of studies and actually the electric fields where related to my own like there was a project that was working of modeling them as well, but magnetic I haven't seen I haven't liked looked for papers in that but I think there is a, There might be a kind time constant sorry.

05:58:10
I'm kind of special constant or time constant as different. I don't know that's interesting for sure. I'll look I look it up but I doubt that they haven't looked at it but let's first look it up before saying if all right great, thank you. So electric I could find like I did find.

05:58:35
I was just gonna say I did find I did find a project why y'all were talking I looked it up and so there was a the national science foundation awarded some researchers money to basically create a wireless neurosensing diagnostic system, that's basically they called it a EMF biosensors that would be implanted neuro sensors and the goals to detect brainwaves and they were awarded something like 800,000 dollars to do this research.

05:59:06
The goal was to go the project this was, In 2013 December 2013, the goal was to develop a fully passive intracranial sensing system. This novel electronic brain machine interface uses an implantable miniaturized neurosensory based upon microwaves scattering backscattering miniature textile antenna and RF circuits on flexible polymer substrate has a unique properties of only minor heating thus minimizing image injury and trauma to the brain.

05:59:40
And so I so I'm gonna post this I'll post this on Twitter a little bit later but but yeah, if you just look up if you type in physiological studies of brain in brain signals using a wireless neurosensing dash diagnostic system, you'll get it now actually this sounds a lot like huraca microwave imaging so because here's what they said is they basically said that you know, the this this not.

06:00:15
Whole electronic brain machine interface uses an implantable miniaturized neurocenter based upon microwave backscattering, so if you if you type in to your browser you type in few rocks, it's spelled if you are a XA.com. You'll see this is called microwave imaging and I did connect the idea of your oxygen microwave imaging being potentially connected to a you know, basically EMF but but it is right so I yeah, so you can check out those two two things if you want.

06:00:59
I'm gonna put it on your Twitter I yes, I will do that obviously if I do that right now so if you rocks by the free oxford microwave imaging is really exciting so I often mentioned like, you know neuralink and I'll talk about open water and EIT and you know, EIT plus EEG plus deep learning but furoxia is the other one geographic is the other major sort of like new medical imaging technology coming along and it's it's it's so it's really interesting that like I didn't like what I'd like.

06:01:34
When I looked this up and I was like microwave technology from an EMF sensor, oh for rock said that is a major brain computer interface technology, so let me just treat this one yeah I did that one go ahead okay, so I'll just read it but I guess if you have a quick answer then I'll just ask the the the microwave is it isn't saying that using some kind of a fiber going into the brain and then generate basically what?

06:02:09
You're and then I'll generate or shoots microwave inside from inside the brain. I haven't I don't know okay, well let me know when you find out I have it I the first time I read the paper I just I read the paper and I was like, I don't understand anything and I was years ago that was years ago, so I guess I have to come and go because of my words that yeah, I gotta go find.

06:02:39
I also have to go have to go to I just pop in. To. I just thought of my question and talking to you asked me the wonderful. I Leonard the room is yours if you want to take it over. Because we're all leaving no. I know Mike let's do this again I love it it's 12 for me midnight I need to go as well, but um, I think we should maybe schedule more of this going in the future because I love the thought process of where we going what's all of this and he touches on something else and I think but I don't want to keep a room going about her.

06:03:17
I think by a center of microwave it's going to be external but in a in a very local distance within like a two feet parameter, but that's just my thought I'll read the paper when you put it on Twitter or something or when I find it myself. Um, but yeah, thanks for hosting.

06:03:34
I think we should do this again and you know, thank you guys for coming and everyone and I'll post additional links in the Facebook group which is called it's it's Facebook rep is the same title as this chat, so if you look on Facebook and you type the same the same chat you're in right now neural link momentum or physics nerve to your happy hour that's the name of the Facebook group.

06:03:56
And I'll post links there to. And I'll send some links. I'll email something later. Goodnight everybody.

06:04:06
Goodnight.
