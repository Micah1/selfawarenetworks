(criteria, causation, neuron)
How organisms make choices is something I study. If you think of the last major choice that you made, what is the reason you made that choice? The reason is a data packet, of patterns, patterns that are in natural tempo-spatial, with varying dimensions over time that are recognized by networks of neurons in the brain, each neuron is recognizing a portion of that pattern by detecting coincidences. Cells that detect coincidence patterns fire and when cells fire they either inhibit or excite neighboring cells which could result in muscle movement or in the cessation of muscle movement. So in short the patterns that our minds detect, literally, cause us to move, or to put it another way reasons cause choices, or criteria causes action. This theory is called criteria causation, and while organisms make selections or choice, that choice is not exactly free, it comes down to individual cells detecting coincidence patterns so that your brain is pushed by information, pushed by reasons, to choose one type of action or another. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neural-basis-free-will
