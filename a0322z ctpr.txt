a lot of money went to places it shouldn't have gone

there was a product that was invented? or researched? or produced? A doctor invented it, he felt that the money invested was not spent efficiently, that who the money actually went to was somewhat of a waste, 

like paying people who are under contributing
at the end of it the doctor/ researcher / inventor just hopes that the product / remedy, treatment is just available to patients, to actual women, at the end of the day
