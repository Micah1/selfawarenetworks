(graph, oscillat, field, decoherence, boson, observer, flavin, ATP, dissipation) The idea of a bad point is that it has no area, it doesn't oscillate, it doesn't increase or decrease in charge

I had an idea just now that ideally dissipating space isn't detecting anything, because the correlate of detection is an increase in the complexity of pattern formation to: information threshold. When meaning emerges from chaos.

It suggests that self aware networks are fundamental to spacetime, not that we can't be dissipated, but that overtime we are natural to emerge from it, from the properties of vortices, oscillations, and neural network structures in physics. But also space itself which has been described as a harmonic oscillator, although I consider it to contain chaotic oscillators and resonators and all possible manner of oscillation, and that even chaotic dissipated space is only chaotic within certain boundaries that allow it to be predictable at some other scale

(mass is part of a gravity wave)

so the idea of spacetime that doesn't oscillate is that it has no area

maybe an electron or proton is that if it oscillates then it has area & time

but if the area is wide time is short
if the area is small time is tall

so space is expanded because its area is the high amplitude of a low frequency

stars are crunched because the high frequency (velocity, relative time of action) corresponds with less area less space and less amplitude

the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)

a particle/wave can contain kinetic energy which is defined by its information configuration which is an identity in a sense, that represents a physical configuration also

dissipation is like electron scattering, the virtual photon pushes them apart because they do not have a complimentary phase, so the virtual energy needed to combine two electrons is greater than their trajectories and that creates the repulsive force

electrons can be pushed together with fermionic 

so the scattering amplitude of particles, and the expansion of space, is inversely proportional to virtual 

the idea is that the potential future and the potential past (anti-matter scattering) exert real forces on present particles

with potential future particles (virtual photons) exerting respulsive force on electrons and on the expansion (scattering of space)

and potential past particles (protons) exerting

positive particles (protons and positrons) can converge trajectories (strong nuclear force)

but not occupy the same space because their phases are not complimentary and the combined mass would dissipate too quickly (unless their combined mass had the right energy configuration)

I'm think of mass as the energy needed to keep a photon (boson) scattered into a positive & negative particle split. 

the idea is that the different configurations of spacetime, from particles to galaxies, determine whether space is going to converge increasing scattered time positive & negative time from the division of neutral space into net positive / negative densities, and positive & negative scattered/condensed space.

as extropy, or the information configuration of space increases intervals of past and future time, the oscillating time intervals expand or contract space, with condensed atom/planetary space being relative to the expansion of empty spacefields around these heavy oscillations.

This is analogous to firing neurons inhibiting the space around them. With a star/planet/quasar/blackhole/gamma ray burst representing the fired neurons, and the scattered waves in space around the firing space creating the expanding field of space time.

However the expansion is relative, and the law of conservation of total energy applies to the total area of space, meaning that if there were zero atoms there would be zero spacefield, and essentially the entire universe would be like one photon with no distinction from nothing.

So at one end of space, space has no distinction, no area, no volume, no mass, and no energy.

The expansion of space is virtual or holographic meaning that it has no real area in total, no real time in total. We only march forward in time from a perspective which is splayed oscillations (positive / negative particles for example) Human perspective is from splayed space that is not in a harmonic oscillation, its in a resonating oscillation

the simultaneous emergence of galaxies everywhere at the same time is like the emergence of lumps of resonating oscillators

with the virtual forces of the potential future & past configuration of space exerting & introducing a combined torpidal flow on spacetime, expanding the past and future simultaneously, towards maximum information coherence & configuration extropy & maximum decoherence entropy dissipation.

however the law of conservation also applies to the total of positive information configuration extropy combined with the total of negative dissipation entropy.

The yin yang is an ancient symbol for the conservation of opposing forces. So is a chess board.

If space was a chess board, all the black squares might be entropy, and the white squares would be extropy.

At the other end of space time marches forward relative to the expansion (dissipation) of oscillations (atoms, vortices, galaxies, stars etc)


I think few people know for sure how long it is going to take them to write a book when they start. There is a 

the consequence of this idea is that the universe began in the middle of time, and then the past and future were generated from a single particle collapsing into waves creating the past and future of spacetime from the center of spacetime which is everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, the forward march of time that we experience is our perspective.

What I just wrote down, in my book, is such a novel new idea about spacetime that 1. It doesn't matter at all if it is correct or incorrect. 2. It sounds so plausible, this new argument, that I think it will be very popular when it comes out.

It's that the beginning of spacetime may actually have been the middle of spacetime, with the potential past and potential future exerting virtual vortex like oscillatory forces that divide a non-physical singularity into the dimensions of the spacetime field, and that harmonic oscillation balances the resonating wave like forces generated by virtual probabilities of future information configurations that the cosmos is essentially predicting through a process of cosmic natural selection

with the end result being something like "Toroidal Universe Theory"

but with time moving in two directions from a singularity into 

The idea of the past and future being co-created at the same time provides a new meaning to the observer effect and to spooky action at a distance

its like the idea that the moment when you observed the particle in the future is created at the same time it was measured in the past

its that the past and future are in one sense relative to the diameter of a photon?? no

they are relative to the diameter of a spherical oscillator, both its kinetic & angular momentum

and that the forces of gravity of any object in space are acting on all objects in space, albiet that effect becomes very small at a distance

the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space

it also explains why light is always the same speed regardless of which way you are traveling and how fast you are moving, because time from our perspective is relative to that photon, its like time is converged at the point of a photon, but its expanding into both past and future relative to the photon.

you can see light marching forward with time & space.

radical pair chemical reactions are spin state selective
you bring two radicals together with their spins paired they bond
if their spins are different they can't form a bond

does a radical have many electrons

we can ignore most of the electrons
the valence electrons are the highest valence
only the spin of the two highest valence elections where the radical 
spin makes electrons magnetic or repulsive depending on their spin, which is how free radicals pair

the unpaired single electron of silver atoms have no spin?


the magnetic field passes through everything in a cell, the cell is unaffected

the radical pairs inside the cell are affected by the magnetic field

a chemical reaction can change its rate and its range in the prescence of a magnetic field
because the radical pair mechanism

The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 


If we accelerate a camera's velocity to the maximum speed we can accelerate anything, the largest camera sensor we can build

if you think about the yin yang symbol as a conservation of energy / force

the white and black circles could represent a negative star and a positive star

or a star moving towards the past and another moving towards the future

I want to draw this in 3D

there are 3 triplet states and 2 singlet states

when you apply the magnetic field 2 of the triplet states become inaccessible

as you increase the magnetic field the two triplet states become further away

the magnetic field affect saturates, saturation value
does it affect
a static magnetic field that doesn't change in time
the reactions take place 100s of nanoseconds or a few microseconds at most

depending on which direction we swept the magnetic field
if we speed up the sweeping of the magnetic field, 
?
the magnetic field is 20-25 microteslas?

how ubiquitous is are flavins in a cell membrane?

is electron spin involved in other kinds of molecule  binding such as with binding together dna, binding together cell membranes
is flavin oxidation related to expanding cell membranes and is it causing cells to become unbound

magnetic effects,
radical pairs
to get a magnetic pair sensitive criteria
where will these show up in biology
b12 enzymes
cobalamine, they show magnetic field responses to light but not in other reactions
the crypto chromes identified a real molecular system where this
no

the only parts of the cell that seem to respond are the mitochondria
in the mitochondria where are flavins what are they doing

electron-transfer flavor protein inside mitochondria
ATP process involves a flavor protein
magnetic field might interupt or accelerate the atp process
might they increase ATP update

oscillating magnetic fields, 
you can affect radical pair / just radio waves, oscillating 

what frequence of oscillations are you talking about? if the oscillations are too fast no effect on radical pairs
too slow the radical pairs will see the field as static

so there is an effective interval of an oscillating effect
if you hit radical pair reactions with the right frequences

The idea that I had was that the fermionic condensate of the mass of the earth was creating a vertical flow from the earth to space in the gradient of the particle field of spacetime,
