http://www.transparentcorp.com/dl/ Is this the program you recommended?

mental stimulation that is not addictive.

it increases connections in the mind, which means new insights, and may eventually mean a new understanding that is a new connection between behaviors, rewards, consequences, and inhibitions, effectively replacing unresourceful behaviors like addiction with better behaviors, but it may feel like you are choosing a better path after having an insight that makes sense to you, at the same time it provides relief from addition by stimulating those neurons and causing them to release the neurotransmitters that would otherwise be released by whatever the person is addicted to.

however since it's a general stimulation, without a chemical signature, there is nothing for your neural receptors (which receive your neuro transmitters) to actually become addicted to.

Brainwaves

okay now imagine that intelligence is in the links, the connections between neurons that are firing, have fired, or are ready to fire, that's where the patterns are that are basically spatial vectors.
then the brainwave is what is lighting up
it's the bits that are conscious or subconscious (ready to light up because other stuff is lighting up)
and all the brainwave is, is a discharge, a potential difference, from each point in the network that has lit up, that is triggering more potential differences (discharges) until the brain has equalized the electrical positives and negatives
seems pretty simple huh?

you know your brain does some amazing brainstorming when it's asleep right?
good problem solution finding time

people mistakenly think they are resting when they are sleeping
but brainscans show that isn't true

oh my memory has gotten so good
that I write down my thoughts, from my dreams, after I wake up
my mind is like a super computer now

with this one day your the mind can throw a curve ball at you where one day you wake up, and your whole life will be integrated in ways you never thought possible before.
it's like having more of the stuff you love all in one place
some say it's an expansion of awareness, imagine if you were experiencing 2 percent of your life, and then suddenly you were experiencing 35 percent of your life, it's almost like getting more life
but when you were experiencing 2 percent, you thought that was 100%

yes, partly, sometimes you can think of it as going from a world that was black and white, to a world that is color, to a world that is 480p to a world that is 720p to a world that is 1080p, to a world that is 2048x.... you get the idea

I recommend a strategy of diversification of sources of stimulation.

get some sleep, super computer dreams
