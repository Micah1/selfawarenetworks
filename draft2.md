# 1. Multiscale Intelligence and the Agentic Brain
Intelligence and decision-making emerge from interactions spanning molecular processes to cortical dynamics. Challenging the view that cognition is confined to higher-order structures, the agentic brain framework holds that each cell is an autonomous unit—capable of learning, encoding, and coordinating.

At the core of this view is the idea that cognitive phenomena, including consciousness, result from deterministic oscillatory processes rather than irreducible emergent properties. Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) exemplifies how cells process and encode signals via frequency, amplitude, and phase, contributing to larger biological functions.

Self-organization, driven by numerous feedback loops, links molecular events to neural dynamics. Just as individual cells shape their environment, neural assemblies (e.g., cortical columns) form local configurations that integrate into broader cognitive states. Deterministic wave mechanics thus scale upward, with cycles of synchronization and desynchronization forging the substrate of thought and awareness.

By examining how multi-scale agents coordinate through phase transitions and feedback loops, we uncover the foundational processes underlying consciousness, cognition, and memory. In this paper on Agentic General Intelligence, we integrate insights from my 2024 work Bridging Molecular Mechanisms and Neural Oscillatory Dynamics with Michael Miller’s ideas from Building Minds with Patterns. Together, these approaches form a novel framework that explains how intelligence—spanning the molecular to the cognitive—can be both mechanistic and richly generative.

# 2. Agentic Behavior Across Scales
Biological agency operates at multiple levels—from proteins and receptors to entire neural networks—assembling local computations into complex cognitive functions. Departing from neuron-centric models, this view holds that every component, whether molecular or network-based, actively contributes to intelligence.

At the molecular level, proteins and receptors alter conformations in response to biochemical signals, regulating cellular excitability. At the cellular level, neurons encode data via patterned firing, while glia and immune cells support neural health. Each cell acts as a computational unit through bioelectric signaling and oscillatory adaptations. Likewise, network agents—from local assemblies and cortical columns to hypercolumns—synchronize to create coherent sensory and cognitive experiences.

Here, an “agent” refers to any component, from a single protein to an entire brain region, that processes information and adapts based on its inputs. These agents interact through cooperative and competitive feedback loops, linking molecular events to neural dynamics via complex signaling (electrical, chemical, magnetic, mechanical, and even protein spin-specific), sometimes manifesting as soliton waves with phase differentials. Such oscillatory communication underscores the intricate synergy among agents.

Functional connectivity unites diverse brain regions, ensuring that patterns from different areas merge into a comprehensive internal representation. Cognitive phenomena—including consciousness—stem from deterministic oscillatory processes, not merely from emergent properties. These mechanisms, which mirror principles of reinforcement learning and synchronization, drive agents toward goals like healing, navigating chemical gradients, or orchestrating development.

The concept of scale—molecular, temporal, spatial, and volumetric—is central to this framework. Micah’s New Law of Thermodynamics, which posits that systems move toward equilibrium through iterative local interactions that dissipate gradients, reinforces this view. The Agentic Brain model, therefore, underpins the broader “Agentic Mind,” offering profound insights into consciousness, artificial intelligence, and disease treatment.

# 3. Historical Context of Self Aware Networks
This section situates Self Aware Networks (SAN) within the evolution of neuroscience and AI by reviewing its TOC alongside key milestones. SAN builds on early work by pioneers like Alan Turing and the perceptron developers, advances such as Broca’s language localization, and later contributions from Jeff Hawkins and Yann LeCun.

SAN rests on core neuroscience principles: synaptic plasticity underlies learning and memory; neural oscillations (notably gamma) support cognition; cortical columns serve as fundamental units of neural representation; and predictive coding refines the brain’s internal model through sensory feedback. It calls for integrating molecular insights with studies of neural oscillations to explain higher cognition. Central to this integration is Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), which details how synaptic memories become conscious via phase-encoded signals, linking molecular and synaptic processes to complex sensory representations.

Furthermore, SAN proposes that neurons transmit phase changes—not just spikes—in line with findings by György Buzsáki and Steven Strogatz, and extends this view via Cellular Oscillatory Tomography (COT) to connect individual cellular computations with global cognitive phenomena. By emphasizing deterministic, multi-scale processes, SAN addresses enduring questions about the origins of AI and consciousness, drawing on insights from Karl Friston, Earl K. Miller, and Michael Levin regarding oscillatory synchronization, self-organization, and cellular cooperation.

Ultimately, SAN unifies neuroscience, physics, and AI into a model of an agentic, deterministic, multi-scale brain, with applications ranging from sentient AI to advanced brain-computer interfaces—offering a robust foundation for future technological advances in AI and medicine.

T-Cells & Neurons: An Integrated Communication Network
The interplay between neurons and T-cells illustrates the brain’s deep integration with the immune system, emphasizing that overall health relies on continuous, multi-domain cellular dialogue spanning the central nervous system, immune system, and gut.

Fundamentally, cellular communication drives biology. As highlighted by Jon Lieff’s work, neurons, immune cells, and other cell types coordinate via intricate signaling networks. Neurons release neurotransmitters to modulate synaptic activity, while T-cells emit cytokines to regulate inflammation—balancing healthy function or, when dysregulated, potentially triggering neuroinflammatory disorders such as depression. T-cells in cerebrospinal fluid act as gatekeepers and local coordinators, even forming a “wireless system” that distributes immunological signals.

Neurons also function as a “proprioceptive GPS,” guiding T-cells to injury or infection sites. This navigation uses diverse signals—including electrical impulses, chemical messengers, magnetic fields, mechanical forces, and protein spin dynamics—with soliton and phase wave rhythms providing real-time updates. The brain then translates these detailed signals into coarse-grained maps, ensuring coordinated immune responses.

This systemic integration mirrors the body’s distributed network where multiple signaling routes (chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, physical, and via nanotubes) enhance resilience at the immune-neural interface.

Clinically, T-cell dysregulation is linked to neuroinflammation, mental health issues, and neurodegenerative disorders. Vitamins D3, A, and B can modulate T-cell activity, suggesting therapeutic avenues to control inflammation, mitigate neurological damage, and aid recovery.

Overall, the dynamic exchange between neurons and T-cells reveals a complex layer of brain function, broadening our understanding of neural health and opening new paths for therapies that harness both neural and immune mechanisms.

# 5. Global Spectral Map of the Body & Cells
Self Aware Networks (SAN) proposes a unified global spectral map that integrates all cells—from neurons to T-cells—via oscillatory encoding as defined by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) and Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT). Neurons serve as both sensors and transmitters by encoding signals in frequency, amplitude, and phase, while COT reveals that virtually all cells, including immune cells, learn and adapt through similar oscillatory behaviors.

Each cell projects a unique spectral signature into an integrated field, exchanging chemical, electromagnetic, mechanical, and protein spin-specific signals. For instance, T-cells collaborate with neurons—guided by a "proprioceptive GPS"—to pinpoint injuries, fostering real-time synchronization and system-wide awareness.

Information is fused into tomographic slices contributed by various cells. These slices, distinct in space and time, are computed from phase wave differential signals that mediate excitation, synchronization, inhibition, and desynchronization. Although this global tomographic view is often likened to a holographic representation, it fundamentally comprises discrete, time- and space-separated layers that support coherent responses like focused attention, memory integration, and perceptual stability.

At the molecular level, proteins function as miniature decision-makers through Protein Oscillation Tomography. By altering their conformations and spin states in response to diverse signals, proteins store and retrieve information, underpinning long-term memory and adaptive cellular behavior. Overall, SAN illustrates how local cellular actions and global coordination collectively form a dynamic tapestry of biological intelligence.

# 6. Neurons to Phase Wave Differentials
My book Bridging Molecular Mechanisms and Neural Oscillatory Dynamics illustrates how molecular processes form the basis of neural oscillations, which in turn drive higher functions like memory and consciousness. It details a progression from molecular interactions within neurons to system-wide oscillatory patterns.

Key molecular elements—including ion channels, receptors, KIBRA-PKMζ complexes, and continuous protein synthesis—establish intrinsic neuronal rhythms. Voltage-gated sodium channels trigger rapid depolarization, while potassium current modulations shape action potential duration (APD), affecting vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. These events produce rhythmic firing patterns that integrate individual neurons into synchronized assemblies.

On a larger scale, neurons form synaptic networks where subtle phase wave differentials (timing and frequency shifts) convert individual action potentials into local field potentials (LFPs). This multi-scale synchronization is captured by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), which shows how phase-based encoding from dendrites to cortical columns promotes pattern invariance and robustness across circuits.

The framework further introduces Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) to characterize how distinct, non-linear inputs at every scale—ranging from single synapses to entire assemblies—manifest as variations in amplitude, duration, and frequency, enabling adaptive learning and complex computations. Additionally, deterministic synaptic release, achieved by elongating APDs to boost calcium influx, reframes seemingly stochastic neurotransmitter exocytosis as a precise, computation-driven process.

Ultimately, phase wave differentials are portrayed as the engine behind the brain’s “3D volumetric television,” continuously updating our perceptions and memories through coordinated oscillatory dynamics. This unified framework explains how molecular, cellular, and network-level processes intersect to generate the local field potentials and brainwaves that underlie consciousness and cognition.

# 7. Coincidence as Bits of Information
Cells employ coincidence detection to recognize patterns and trigger precise responses. When multiple receptors activate simultaneously, these events become bits of information that allow cells to integrate diverse signals and coordinate actions reflective of both their internal state and the environment.

Under Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT), cells operate as active processors that encode data via oscillatory cycles—using frequency, amplitude, and phase—to receive, transform, and relay information. This process, paired with receptor-based (Hebbian-like) learning, enables cells to adapt by modifying receptor sensitivities and retaining a “memory” of past stimuli.

Information encoding exemplifies the interplay between molecular events and network dynamics. Near-simultaneous presynaptic firings, within a critical millisecond window, prompt high gamma frequency responses and generate phasic soliton waves. These waves, sharpened by synaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release through potassium- and calcium-mediated pathways, integrate into neural circuits devoted to pattern recognition.

Dendritic computation refines this process further by nonlinearly summing inputs—filtering out noise and amplifying coincident signals. This leads to distinct phase or amplitude shifts that persist long enough within neural circuits to influence perception and behavior. Ultimately, oscillatory synchrony across sensory modalities constructs a coherent representation of the environment.

Coincidence detection thus stands as the linchpin of cellular and neural information processing, allowing cells to transform simultaneous events into actionable data, recognize patterns, store memories, and coordinate complex activities.

# 8. Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT)
COT posits that cells are active information processors—not simple on/off switches—but rhythmic entities encoding complex data via frequency, amplitude, and phase. They function as "mini-computers" at the microscale. A key mechanism is coincidence detection, where simultaneous receptor activation triggers specific functions and, through Hebbian-like learning, strengthens responses and memory.

Furthermore, COT highlights oscillatory binding—mirroring neural rendering in artificial networks—that enables cells and tissues to build internal environmental models. Synaptic integration and coincident inputs enhance these representations, leading to long-term potentiation (LTP). This framework extends to multi-scale agency: individual cells or tissues operate autonomously yet coordinate via wave-based processes such as phase synchronization and desynchronization, with glial cells modulating signal transmission.

Additionally, transcriptomic activations alter protein expression when synaptic coincidences occur, while ATP-based reinforcement learning guides protein development by penalizing inefficient proteins. Through ongoing receptor reconfiguration and refined protein interactions, cells can anticipate and compute future structures, supporting both single-celled and multicellular resilience.

Ultimately, COT reveals that cells actively process signals through oscillatory cycles, affecting their own states and those of neighboring cells. These foundational wave-based mechanisms underpin higher-level functions—including consciousness—by integrating local cellular activity into coherent, system-wide dynamics.

# 9. Functional Pattern Connectivity via NAPOT
NAPOT explains how brain regions achieve functional connectivity through oscillatory interactions across neural arrays. By synchronizing frequencies and phases, neurons form transient coherent circuits that enhance signals, filter noise, and stabilize memories, thoughts, and perceptions—with gamma oscillations playing a key role in unifying consciousness.

Central to NAPOT are phase wave differentials—subtle timing shifts between neural assemblies that not only transmit information but also gate communication by directing signals precisely. These shifts underlie phenomena like traveling waves and neural avalanches, encoding synaptic data in a manner analogous to a Taylor series decomposition.

Neural arrays serve as both projectors and receivers: they process inputs, propagate signals in cascading waves, and dynamically update localized activity patterns, forming a continuously evolving map of perception and self-awareness. Moreover, frequency-based synaptic inhibition fine-tunes connectivity by selectively engaging or suppressing assemblies, thereby defining functional subnetworks for salient stimuli.

Finally, NAPOT integrates sensory modalities—visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.—by merging overlapping oscillatory patterns into coherent multimodal representations. In sum, NAPOT provides a robust model of how synchronized oscillations, phase differentials, and dynamic neural arrays underpin complex cognitive functions, from multisensory integration to conscious awareness.

# 10. BTSP, Coincidence Detection, and Functional Connectivity
Behavior Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) combined with coincidence detection explains how functional connectivity emerges among cortical columns and other brain regions. Oscillatory synchrony, phase wave differentials, and continual signal integration create coherent, large-scale activity patterns.

Neurons register frequency coincidences over time, transmitting precise phase patterns. Synchronous firing strengthens connections—illustrating that “neurons that fire together, wire together”—and can even bind indirectly connected neurons through feedback loops, allowing bidirectional signal flow.

Cortical columns function as semi-autonomous agents: they receive sensory inputs, generate predictions, and dispatch motor directives, thereby linking localized patterns into a unified brain-wide perspective. Phase wave differentials, through subtle timing shifts, synchronize distant regions to support cognition and memory.

Thalamo-cortical interactions further mediate connectivity; the thalamus acts as a relay hub, gating and aligning sensory and motor signals for rapid error correction. Functional connectivity, marked by temporal correlations in neural activity, dynamically intensifies during specific behaviors.

In sum, BTSP and coincidence detection, through feedback loops, oscillatory dynamics, and inhibitory controls (aided by interneurons), yield a flexible yet cohesive map of reality by unifying signals across the brain.

# 11. Bridging Molecular Interactions and Brainwaves
Neuroscience must reconcile how microscopic molecular events generate macroscopic brain oscillations—and how these oscillations, in turn, modulate molecular processes. Traditional models fall short in explaining the transition from discrete action potentials to continuous waveforms. To bridge this gap, foundational principles like the All-or-Nothing rule and Synaptic Unreliability are reexamined alongside modern insights into multi-vesicular release, phase wave differentials, and agentic cellular behavior.

At the molecular scale, ion channels (e.g., sodium, potassium) and synaptic proteins (e.g., KIBRA, PKMζ) orchestrate rhythmic firing that converges into synchronized oscillations. Mathematical models such as Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) and Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) demonstrate that brainwaves emerge from complex, non-linear interactions—not merely from summed action potentials. These oscillations actively drive synaptic plasticity by timing phase differentials, modulating protein synthesis, and altering neurotransmitter release.

Revisiting the All-or-Nothing principle reveals that neurons often operate beyond a simple binary output. Synaptic unreliability becomes more nuanced when multi-vesicular release and variable action potential durations affect calcium influx and vesicle release, enriching our understanding of information flow in cortical circuits.

Viewing the brain as a network of adaptive agents—spanning cells, tissues, and regions—emphasizes cooperative interactions among cortical columns, thalamic relays, and inhibitory interneurons. These agents balance excitatory and inhibitory forces, sustaining both local computations and global cognitive states. Ultimately, integrating molecular dynamics with large-scale oscillatory behavior provides a unified framework for perception, memory, and the computational rendering of consciousness.

# 12. Addressing the Binding Problem through Oscillatory Dynamics
Phase locking and functional connectivity are central to resolving the binding problem—the challenge of unifying diverse sensory features (color, motion, form) into one coherent perception. Neurons achieve this unity by synchronizing their oscillatory activity; phase locking minimizes firing differences, while gamma oscillations help align distributed networks into a unified, three-dimensional experience.

Functional connectivity refers to the dynamic, task-dependent synchronization among brain regions via wave coherence. As cortical columns and regions tune in or out, large-scale phase alignment in key frequency bands merges disparate signals into cohesive representations while filtering out irrelevant noise.

Biological Oscillating Tomography (BOT) conceptualizes how neurons, akin to reconstructing 3D images from multiple 2D slices, iteratively build spatial and temporal maps. Through synchronized oscillations, phase wave differentials, and feedback loops, each neuron transmits and adjusts its phase, refining perception, memory, and consciousness. Viewed agentically, each neural region works to minimize its phase differentials, much like autonomous agents in advanced AI systems.

Together, these oscillatory processes and phase relationships forge unified perceptual and cognitive experiences, ensuring that distributed local activities coalesce into a singular, integrated consciousness.

# 13. Addressable Coefficient of Variation: Cellular Fingerprints in Computation
An addressable coefficient of variation (CV) quantifies how a cell "fingerprints" its signals by comparing the variability (standard deviation) of its activity to its mean. In neurons, this metric reveals deviations in spiking from local rhythms (e.g., theta waves): high CV indicates unpredictable, variable firing, while low CV signals rhythmic consistency.

This variability originates in the advanced roles of dendrites and synapses. Dendrites perform nonlinear summation, amplify coincident inputs, and filter noise—thereby encoding spatial aspects of experience. Simultaneously, synapses adjust temporal dynamics through activity-dependent plasticity, modifying dendritic spines and receptor distributions. Together, these processes embed each neuron in a high-dimensional vector space defined by its unique morphology and synaptic dynamics.

Furthermore, factors like potassium levels and action potential duration (APD) modulate cellular individuality. By controlling the open time of calcium channels, potassium currents alter neurotransmitter release, thereby shifting the timing, amplitude, and phase of action potentials to fine-tune synaptic efficacy.

These mechanisms are not exclusive to neurons. Interactions such as neuron–T cell communication and the "Metatron Agent" concept reveal that various cells actively process information through rhythmic cycles governed by frequency, amplitude, and phase. The notion of Coincidence Operated Tomography (COT) extends this pattern recognition and adaptation even to non-neural cells.

Ultimately, diverse factors—including membrane properties, ion channel distributions, synaptic inputs, and local microenvironments—create minute frequency differences that endow each cell with a distinct oscillatory "fingerprint." Examples include hippocampal place cells and fibroblasts exhibiting unique calcium oscillations. Thus, the addressable CV concept robustly explains how specialized cellular dynamics underpin distributed computation, memory, and adaptive intelligence.

# 14. The Flow of Information: Neural Arrays to Columns, Matrix Neurons & Cortical Neurons, Inhibitory Interneurons
Information in the brain flows through a fractal network—from well-organized neural arrays to cortical columns, matrix neurons, and inhibitory interneurons—that enables efficient, adaptive computation. Neural arrays, such as retinal cells, are meticulously arranged to encode sensory data through convergent and divergent connections, creating parallel processing streams. Building on these outputs, cortical columns act as semi-autonomous vertical modules that coordinate high-level processing by exchanging phase wave differentials and regulating local competition.

The thalamus plays a critical relay role, distributing sensory inputs to cortical layers containing matrix neurons and diverse inhibitory interneurons. Matrix neurons link to specialized inhibitory cells that fine-tune thalamic-cortical interactions by precisely timing and gating synaptic outputs, balancing excitation and inhibition to shape dynamic activity patterns. Within and between cortical columns, coherent phase waves capture ongoing states while inhibitory interneurons adjust signal timing and phase relationships, ensuring the prominence of relevant information.

Throughout this structure, agentic principles manifest at every level—from individual cells to larger ensembles like minicolumns and hypercolumns—driving the emergence of consciousness and complex behavior. In sum, the interplay among neural arrays, cortical columns, matrix neurons, and inhibitory interneurons creates a robust framework for real-time signal integration, learning, memory, and awareness.

# 15. How the Thalamus Regulates the Prefrontal Cortex
The thalamus maintains a dynamic feedback loop with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), sending signals and adapting to incoming feedback. Mediodorsal (MD) thalamic projections to the medial PFC (mPFC) support working memory by enhancing connectivity and sustaining neural activity under cognitive load. This loop is reinforced by positive feedback between the mPFC and the anteromedial (AM) thalamic nucleus, which activates midbrain dopaminergic neurons to modulate motivation and adaptive behavior.

Beyond working memory and reinforcement, the thalamus functions as a sensory relay by filtering and prioritizing stimuli so that only relevant information reaches the cortex. In cortical-thalamic loops, descending pathways carry predictions while ascending pathways deliver error signals to update internal models. Thalamic matrix neurons diffuse these signals across wide cortical areas, synchronizing large-scale activity, while inhibitory neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) shape oscillatory rhythms (alpha, delta, theta) to modulate cognitive processing. Overall, the thalamus gates high-level cognitive inputs and monitors their outcomes, underpinning attention, perception, and executive functions.

# 16. Hippocampal–Entorhinal Agentic Co-Regulation
The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) engage in a reciprocal exchange akin to the thalamus–PFC dynamic, supporting learning, memory, and spatial navigation within a distributed network. Each region acts as a semi-autonomous agent—sending, receiving, and refining signals through outcome-based feedback—while interconnected hubs like the thalamus integrate these loops across cortical areas.

This bidirectional communication mirrors cortico-thalamic loops that blend sensory data with higher cognition to produce flexible behaviors. Viewing the hippocampus as a specialized cortical column reveals a fractal-like self-similarity, where executive control is dispersed across all units rather than centralized. In essence, hippocampal–EC co-regulation exemplifies how feedback loops unify inter-regional coordination, underpinning the dynamic, interconnected system that drives cognition, learning, and adaptation.

# 17. Functional Connectivity: Phase Synchronization, Inhibitory Interneurons, and Interregional Regulation
Functional connectivity refers to the fluid, dynamic interactions by which brain regions communicate and coordinate. This adaptive process supports information integration for learning, decision-making, and behavior, relying on phase synchronization, inhibitory interneurons, and interregional regulatory loops.

Neural networks can be seen as assemblies of semi-autonomous agents—such as neural arrays, edge communities, nuclei, and cortical columns—that together shape perception and action. Phase synchronization aligns oscillatory firing patterns across regions, creating transient channels for enhanced information exchange; rhythms spanning alpha to gamma frequencies bind signals into coherent percepts, emphasizing relevant circuits while filtering out noise.

Inhibitory interneurons refine these interactions by balancing excitation and inhibition through precisely timed synaptic outputs that target either the soma or dendrites, thus preventing runaway excitation and enabling the integration of new inputs essential for attention and working memory.

Alpha waves further gate competing inputs by suppressing irrelevant gamma activity while permitting transient bursts when prediction errors occur, illustrating how local and global oscillatory dynamics shape regional participation. Distributed interregional regulation emerges via bidirectional feedback loops, wherein higher-order areas like the prefrontal cortex guide lower-level sensory or motor regions that in turn refine top-down signals.

This non-hierarchical, multi-agent structure echoes theories in which information patterns themselves act as agents shaping behavior at both molecular and systemic levels.

Cortical columns, as described in Jeff Hawkins’ “A Thousand Brains” theory, function as independent units with local motor outputs that oscillate in synchrony or counterpoint to support attention, memory retrieval, and predictive modeling, while regions such as the ventral striatum and basal ganglia interact through extensive loops to balance motivation, reinforcement, and motor control.

In sum, functional connectivity arises from synchronized oscillations, inhibitory modulation, and interregional loops that together create a distributed, integrated system enabling the brain to learn, remember, and adapt fluidly to changing demands.

# 18. Thalamic Loops: A Central Hub in Sensory Relay and Cortical Modulation
The thalamus functions as a central hub by relaying sensory information and modulating cortical activity. It integrates signals from various sensory pathways and filters them before transmitting to multiple cortical layers. Distinct neuron types within the thalamus—matrix neurons, core neurons, and inhibitory interneurons—play specialized roles in this process. Matrix neurons project diffusely across broad cortical regions, synchronizing activity by linking their source minicolumns to adjacent areas, whereas core neurons follow focused pathways to layers 4 and 6, conveying precise sensory or motor signals to specific cortical columns. Inhibitory interneurons, mainly in the thalamic reticular nucleus, send inhibitory signals to relay neurons to balance excitation and prevent sensory overload.

The thalamus refines and prioritizes incoming sensory data, ensuring that only the most relevant signals reach higher cortical centers. This filtering occurs within reciprocal cortical-thalamic loops in which the cortex sends feedback that adjusts the amplification or suppression of inputs based on situational demands and predictive models. These interactions, often mediated by phase wave differentials through driver neurons projecting to structures such as the hippocampus and neocortex, shape both the timing and intensity of thalamic output.

Extensive reciprocal connections between thalamic nuclei and cortical layers support both top-down and bottom-up modulation and contribute to oscillatory rhythms that synchronize activity across cortical columns. GABAergic interneurons within the thalamic matrix further refine these signal pathways and help coordinate cortical assemblies, while the thalamus also interacts with the hippocampal-entorhinal network to promote unified cognitive operations. Overall, these thalamic loops form a dynamic, interactive system in which the thalamus, cortical columns, and inhibitory interneurons collectively filter and direct sensory information, underscoring its indispensable role in perception, cognition, and consciousness.

# 19. The Flow of Information: From Sensory Organs to Layered Cortical Loops
Sensory processing begins when specialized organs transduce stimuli into neural signals. For example, retinal photoreceptors and cochlear hair cells convert light and sound into electrical impulses governed by oscillatory dynamics and phase differentials that encode attributes such as intensity and frequency.

These signals travel along modality-specific pathways to the neocortex, entering at Layer 4—a relay station that sorts and distributes input within each cortical column. From there, information ascends to Layers 2/3 for local integration and lateral spread among adjacent columns, enriching contextual understanding.

The flow then reaches Layers 5 and 6; Layer 5 generates tonic theta rhythms for cognitive integration and motor planning, while Layer 6 refines feedback loops that modulate subsequent processing by influencing Layers 1 and 4, with Layer 1 receiving top-down signals to adjust apical dendritic activity.

This progression is coordinated by feedforward loops that elevate raw inputs and feedback loops that compare predictions with actual inputs, prompting necessary adjustments. Bidirectional cortical–thalamic loops enable selective attention and filtering, and hippocampal–cortical loops via the entorhinal cortex exchange information critical for memory and spatial navigation.

Iterative processing loops further demonstrate how each sense undergoes repeated cycles that ultimately merge multisensory data into a unified experience we call Entification. Throughout this hierarchy, the thalamus acts as a central relay, directing sensory signals to the cortex and integrating modulatory feedback to weave together ascending data and descending predictions into a dynamically updated internal model of reality that underpins refined perception and flexible, context-sensitive behavior.

# 20. Peter Tse, Phasic and Tonic Brainwaves, and the 1/F Relationship: Neural Rendering Through Phase Wave Differentials
Peter Tse’s work on criterial causation argues that synchronized neural signals are meaningless in isolation; instead, neurons depend on brief, high-frequency phasic bursts that cortical columns learn from via coincidence detection. These phasic bursts overlay slower, tonic brainwaves—encompassing delta, theta, alpha, beta, and low gamma rhythms—that establish a neural “canvas” by synchronizing large populations and encoding ongoing expectations.

The 1/F relationship, whereby lower frequencies possess higher amplitude due to longer durations, enables tonic oscillations to globally coordinate neural tissue while phasic bursts insert precise, localized signals that flag immediate changes. Tonic synchronization creates a “conscious ready state” that is periodically updated by phase wave differentials, a process captured by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) in which each neural array contributes to rendering experience.

Moreover, when phasic bursts interact with inhibitory networks, they fine-tune the timing of tonic patterns, ensuring adaptive predictive modeling by prioritizing relevant stimuli. In this way, consciousness emerges as a dynamic integration of phasic perturbations and tonic resonances—a continuously evolving state of awareness shaped by precise timing, orchestrated phase relationships, and balanced excitatory and inhibitory processes.

# 21. Latent Diffusion Networks as an Analogy for Phasic-Tonic Interactions and Ephaptic Coupling in the Brain
Latent Diffusion Networks (LDNs) offer a compelling analogy for understanding phasic–tonic interactions and ephaptic coupling in the brain. In LDNs, images are compressed into a latent space, obscured by noise, and then reconstructed through a denoising process; similarly, tonic oscillations (such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves) establish a persistent baseline in the brain, while transient phasic bursts inject perturbations analogous to noise.

The brain continuously refines its internal model via synaptic adjustments, ion channel modulation, and synchronized neuronal firing that reconcile differences between predictions and sensory inputs.

This nonlinear interplay produces phase differentials that map lower-level processes onto higher-order cognitive functions. Moreover, ephaptic coupling—whereby action potentials generate subtle electromagnetic fields that affect nearby neurons—extends oscillatory influence beyond direct synaptic connections, enabling both global synchrony and precise local modulation.

At the molecular level, proteins like KIBRA and PKMζ, together with ion channels and receptors, underpin durable synaptic changes and regulate rhythmic firing, thus supporting memory and adaptive processes. Overall, the analogy underscores how continuous encoding (tonic oscillations), transient disturbances (phasic bursts), and systematic denoising (via ephaptic and molecular mechanisms) interact to produce an adaptive system that integrates new inputs, maintains coherent global states, and fine-tunes predictive models guiding perception and behavior.

# 22. Tomography from Functional Connectivity of Neural Oscillations at All Scales
Functional connectivity enables diverse brain regions, including cortical columns, to collaborate in forming unified internal representations of sensory and cognitive information. Oscillatory activity and phase relationships bridge molecular interactions with large-scale neural dynamics, as Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) demonstrates that cells actively process inputs by adjusting receptor sensitivities and generating wave states. Consequently, the brain behaves as an oscillating system that seeks equilibrium and reaches conscious moments when perturbed.

Memories stored in synaptic connections scale to whole-brain activity and support perception. Molecular processes drive neuronal oscillations that enable complex behaviors such as working memory and recollection by converging distributed synaptic memories into context-rich experiences. Fractal-like repetition shows how minute synaptic events combine into large-scale patterns, while phase wave differentials and synaptic frequency encoding maintain network stability.

Neural agents, from individual neurons to large assemblies, coordinate through oscillations and synchrony. Phase differentials facilitate real-time adaptation and communication, with tonic oscillations providing a stable backdrop and high-frequency phasic bursts conveying novel information. By transmitting phase changes, neurons harmonize with network rhythms, adjusting synaptic strengths as needed.

These phase shifts, supported by molecular mechanisms, create feedback loops that stabilize memory at the synaptic level. Proteins such as KIBRA and PKMζ, together with various ion channels and receptors, preserve activation patterns, while neurons adjust their receptor sensitivities and firing thresholds, with inhibitory interneurons fine-tuning activity to prevent overexcitation. In the Self Aware Networks framework, each neuron functions as both sensor and transmitter of phase information, and synaptic changes driven by oscillation frequencies reinforce these patterns over time.

Overall, tomography from functional connectivity reveals the brain’s capacity to integrate distributed activity into coherent representations of reality. The convergence of memory and perception, orchestrated by phase wave differentials, allows continuous refinement of the brain’s internal model through feedback loops rooted in molecular processes. This synergy between oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity underlies learning, adaptation, and the emergence of conscious awareness.

# 23. Mechanisms of Agent Interaction
Neural rendering underlies the brain’s capacity to form a coherent internal representation of the external world. Each sensory organ provides time-sequenced 2D snapshots that the brain transforms into a dynamic 3D model using coincidence detection and oscillatory activity.

Oscillatory traveling waves and subtle phase shifts enable neural correlations that merge sensory and higher-order inputs into a tomographic reconstruction, allowing the inference of three-dimensional structure from varied images.

Cortical columns act as semi-autonomous agents by integrating sensory data, generating predictions, and directing motor outputs. They operate hierarchically, comparing new inputs to stored templates so that synchronized firing amplifies dominant patterns while inhibitory signals suppress competitors.

Oscillatory interactions across columns then unify local representations into a coherent global perception. The interplay between phasic bursts and tonic oscillations, alongside local and global synchrony, allows the brain to adapt fluidly to shifting stimuli and maintain a stable, detailed internal depiction of the world.

# 24. Quasicrystals and Higher-Dimensional Information in Neural Dynamics
Quasicrystals illustrate how ordered, aperiodic structures encode higher-dimensional information in lower-dimensional projections. Their unique rotational symmetries and interpretation as slices of hypercubic lattices enable patterns like Penrose tiling to embody complex interference effects, serving as analogs for multi-dimensional data storage and processing.

Similarly, the brain integrates lower-level sensory inputs into multi-dimensional cognitive constructs using oscillatory tomography and functional connectivity. In Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), neurons not only detect but also project information to successive arrays, increasing dimensionality much like stacking 2D images to form a 3D model, with tomographic principles such as the Fourier projection slice theorem reconstructing coherent views from fragmented data.

Functional connectivity synchronizes oscillatory activity across brain regions, merging diverse inputs into unified perceptions by modulating phase wave differentials and filtering noise through inhibitory interneurons, dendritic gating, and other molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the brain’s fractal organization underpins its predictive coding, where neural assemblies at every scale generate and update expectations through continuous top-down and bottom-up interactions.

Although brain activity is not identical to quasicrystals, the analogy underscores how synchronizing phase differentials can produce stable, high-dimensional representations from lower-dimensional signals, effectively stitching together a dynamic mental quasicrystal that accommodates sensory fluctuations, memories, and predictions.

# 25. Brainwaves, Top-Down Control, and the Dynamics of Alpha/Beta–Gamma Interactions
Earl K. Miller’s research on alpha/beta and gamma wave interactions offers a framework for understanding how the brain balances internal predictive models with incoming sensory information.

Oscillatory dynamics, possibly mediated by ephaptic coupling, allow neurons to interact beyond traditional synapses. Beta waves from the prefrontal cortex impose goal-oriented templates on sensory inputs, while alpha waves inhibit bottom-up signals to prevent overload.

In contrast, gamma oscillations relay detailed sensory data from peripheral receptors to higher centers. An anti-correlation between alpha/beta and gamma activity means that increases in the former reduce the latter, dynamically regulating information flow. 

This mechanism enables strong beta activity to pause predictive models until gamma bursts prompt a reassessment and update of internal representations, leading to rapid behavioral adjustments. During focused tasks, oscillations become directional as phasic waves target specific cortical areas, modulating neural firing before returning to a tonic baseline.

Miller’s work underscores the prefrontal cortex’s role in orchestrating top-down control by using beta waves to direct high-level abstractions that govern the processing of gamma-mediated data.

Gamma rhythms integrate bodily signals, top-down intentions, and sensory details across multiple cortical layers, ensuring responsiveness to novel stimuli.

The concept of a “consideration sandwich” highlights how the gamma layer, functionally positioned between cortical layers 4 and 5, mediates the interplay between top-down frameworks and bottom-up sensory signals, binding internal predictions with external reality.

Overall, these oscillatory processes illustrate how top-down and bottom-up forces cooperate to shape perception, attention, and decision-making, revealing the neural architecture of cognitive control.

# 26 Miller’s “Stenciling” and the SAN “Mental Ink & Canvas” Metaphor
Miller’s “stenciling” concept posits that beta waves from the prefrontal cortex function as top-down filters, selectively shaping raw sensory inputs by inhibiting extraneous signals. This closely parallels the Self Aware Networks’ “mental ink and canvas” model, where high phasic gamma spikes act as ink that delivers the core, unfiltered content of sensory experience. Notably, the SAN “ink and canvas” metaphor predated Miller’s formulation, yet his stencil concept validates its core principles while offering a distinct perspective on top-down modulation.

In this framework, beta waves represent predictive signals that constrain incoming data to align with existing goals and schemas, much like a stencil refines an image. Conversely, gamma waves inject detailed, moment-to-moment sensory information into the cognitive process. The dynamic interplay between these signals allows beta rhythms to suppress gamma activity during focused tasks, while unexpected stimuli can trigger gamma surges that override established beta patterns.

The SAN model further describes tonic oscillations as the “canvas of consciousness,” a baseline that stabilizes internal awareness and integrates new sensory inputs over time. Phasic bursts, akin to swift brushstrokes of ink, briefly perturb this baseline to update the neural representation of reality, reflecting the ongoing balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes.

Together, these interlocking metaphors reveal a system in which neurons act as agents that continuously update their internal states by processing both top-down and bottom-up signals through feedback loops. The oscillatory environment—comprising interacting tonic and phasic rhythms—binds sensory data, high-level abstractions, and memory traces into a coherent, ever-evolving tapestry of experience.

# 27. Beta and Alpha Waves from Layer 4 Stenciling Gamma Waves in Layers 2/3
Beta and alpha waves, primarily originating in cortical layer 4, exert a top-down influence by “stenciling” gamma waves in layers 2/3. They shape the processing and integration of sensory information through dynamic interactions with gamma oscillations, which convey the raw details of perception. This interplay enables the brain to prioritize relevant inputs and maintain a coherent representation of the external world.

Beta waves, especially those from the prefrontal cortex, carry memory templates, goals, and predictive models that guide the interpretation of incoming data. Alpha waves contribute by filtering out irrelevant or disruptive signals and dampening bottom-up spiking, thereby controlling which inputs reach conscious awareness.

Gamma waves, predominant in layers 2/3, deliver unrefined sensory content and integrate perceptual details horizontally across the cortex. When gamma activity prevails, it can override alpha and beta influences, shifting processing toward immediate sensory demands. This reciprocal dynamic is marked by an anti-correlation: heightened beta/alpha activity suppresses gamma oscillations, while surges in gamma diminish top-down rhythms.

Layer-specific dynamics further refine these processes. Layer 4, which receives sensory inputs, typically exhibits alpha rhythms in sensory areas or beta rhythms in frontal regions to drive top-down decisions. In contrast, layers 2/3, dominated by gamma oscillations, support local processing, inter-columnar communication, and proprioceptive feedback, all of which are vital for attention, perception, and learning.

Overall, the stenciling process filters extraneous sensory data and amplifies pertinent cues, aligning higher-level goals with real-time input. Through these coordinated oscillatory interactions, the brain dynamically balances top-down constraints with bottom-up signals, ensuring efficient and coherent sensory integration.

# 28. Gamma Consideration Sandwich: Integrating Sensory Signals, Top-Down Control, and Proprioception
The “consideration sandwich” concept demonstrates how gamma oscillations integrate sensory signals, cognitive processes, and proprioceptive feedback into a unified conscious experience. By coordinating inputs across cortical layers and cell types, these oscillations guide the brain toward equilibrium and agentic co-regulation.

Raw sensory data, conveyed by alpha or beta rhythms in layer 4 or frontoparietal circuits, is filtered by top-down beta-band activity from the prefrontal cortex to ensure internal goals shape perception. In contrast, proprioceptive feedback transmitted via parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in layer 5 regulates gamma oscillations through both somatic and dendritic inhibition. Notably, these layer 5 PV cells generate correlated gamma rhythms at their terminus, contrasting with the anti-correlated oscillations influenced by layer 4’s alpha or beta rhythms.

By bridging the anti-correlated signals from layer 4 and the correlated inputs from layer 5, gamma oscillations actively mediate equilibrium through their interactions with individual cortical columns. Excitatory IT cells in layers 2 and 3 horizontally link diverse cortical regions into a shared workspace, while alpha or beta rhythms from layer 4 impose a stenciling effect on gamma waves in these layers, selectively modulating sensory signals. This inter-column dynamic aligns distributed patterns into a cohesive percept.

Gamma rhythms synchronize disparate inputs by reducing phase mismatches, generating a coherent conscious state. High-frequency gamma bursts adjust motor outputs or refine sensory maps when predictions and reality diverge, with local gamma patterns shifting to prompt necessary recalibration.

From an agentic perspective, each cortical column or subcortical nucleus functions as a mini-agent that maintains its own predictive model while exchanging local and global signals. These oscillatory feedback loops, driven by phase wave differentials acting as a currency, converge until the network stabilizes around a unified conscious percept.

Ultimately, the gamma consideration sandwich illustrates how gamma oscillations bind top-down regulation, sensory input, and proprioceptive cues into an elegant system of co-regulation, maintaining neural equilibrium and generating a cohesive experience of the world.

# 29. Networks of the Brain
Olaf Sporns’ work provides a robust framework for viewing the brain as a highly interconnected network, while I conceptualize this network as a spectral tomogram that transforms conscious information into internal agentic mechanisms and action. In this view, each network element encodes aspects of the whole, and evoking a memory produces an oscillatory tomogram reflecting synchronized neural activity that links perception to behavior.

Sporns’ application of network science reveals that the brain’s structure exhibits small-world properties, with nodes and edges mapped from functional imaging data. Rich clubs and dynamic edge connectivity, along with community detection, demonstrate that modules ranging from microscopic circuits to large-scale networks organize hierarchically to support specific functions.

Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) posits that phase shifts generate tomograms as dendrites and receptors interpret their own oscillatory outputs. Information cascades through neural arrays, with phase variations scaling synaptic memories into full-brain patterns. This fractal organization supports a multi-scale agentic brain, where local oscillatory activity collectively gives rise to consciousness.

At the cellular level, Cellular Oscillating Tomography (COT) treats each cell as an oscillatory agent with feedback loops that signal alignment or conflict, enabling smooth transitions between global states. Neurons and cortical columns maintain local representations, while gamma oscillations integrate sensory, top-down, and proprioceptive data into unified experiences, exemplified by head direction cells binding internal goals with external cues.

The theory of self-awareness suggests that multi-agent systems incorporate introspection and situational understanding. Agentic AI may employ layer-by-layer processing with micro-agents in fractal-like network architectures that mimic the brain’s balance of local processing and global coherence, facilitating hierarchical control and flexible adaptation.

In cortical layer 5, motor output is calibrated by rhythmic feedback and rapid gamma bursts update motor schemas, with interneurons modulating excitatory drive. Layer 6 integrates corticothalamic and proprioceptive signals and projects to layer 1, which synchronizes activity in layers 2 and 3, allowing local representations to align with global motor demands.

Overall, the brain operates as an extensive network of oscillatory arrays that bind local signals into broader phase relationships, generating unified consciousness. Self Aware Networks propose that consciousness emerges from complex oscillatory processes integrated via myriad feedback loops, offering a blueprint for agentic AI that mirrors the adaptive, integrative qualities of the human brain.

# 30. Vector Embeddings and Semantic Space
Dendrites function as analog computational equivalents to vector embeddings by encoding information in high-dimensional synaptic configurations. Each dendrite mirrors an AI inference stage, representing sensory or cognitive inputs much like a “Gaussian splat” in multi-dimensional space that captures spatial and temporal relationships, modulating signals based on past experiences.

Each neuron builds an internal map where the “distance” between patterns reflects their learned similarity. Over time, synaptic connections grow or prune, and the active slice of a dendritic tensor represents the neuron’s real-time response. By selecting specific subsets of its dendritic network when activated, a neuron can flexibly encode multiple associations, paralleling modern machine learning vector embeddings.

Beyond dendritic embeddings, the brain’s oscillatory activity can be seen as a three-dimensional phase topology evolving over time. Each action potential alters this phase landscape by creating transient spikes, inhibitory dips, and nonlinear interactions, while electrical, magnetic, chemical, and mechanical processes together weave a holistic tapestry of neural dynamics.

This 3D phase topology may be regarded as a series of snapshots capturing instantaneous phase states across the neural network, analogous to terms in a high-dimensional Taylor series. Processes such as bistable reaction-diffusion, threshold criticality, and path bifurcations in inhibitory circuits add branching points that signal choices or sudden state reconfigurations, a dynamic formalized by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT).

Within this multidimensional landscape, memories ripple from synaptic microstructures to whole-brain oscillatory patterns. The scale invariance of fractal organization ensures that small synaptic changes resonate widely, contributing to conscious thought and long-term recollection as each neuron’s dendritic embedding integrates into a broader, multi-layered environment.

Simultaneously, the brain continuously renders these patterns into coherent images by folding incoming sensory data into existing models while tracking its internal state. Overlapping oscillatory circuits blur the lines between memory, recall, and perception, enabling rapid adaptation through cortical feedback loops that focus attention, suppress noise, and align sensory signals with top-down predictions.

Together, the analogy of dendrites as high-dimensional vector embeddings and the conception of the brain’s oscillatory activity as a 3D phase topology underscore the computational essence of biological cognition. Local dendritic inference engines are orchestrated into a global, continuously updating tomographic rendering by the cortex, offering insights that may guide novel approaches in artificial intelligence and deepen our understanding of memory, perception, and conscious experience.

# 31. Dendritic Representations as Thought Vectors, Tokens, and Patches
A dendrite’s moment-to-moment activity is analogous to a high-dimensional vector embedding, where its synaptic configuration functions like an AI inference process. Unlike artificial weights, these configurations emerge from the neuron’s biological architecture, shaped by layered synaptic connectivity and temporal dynamics. As the neuron fires at specific phases and frequencies, its dendritic structure integrates inputs into a distinct state, akin to a “Gaussian splat” that captures its computational viewpoint.

In a broader network context, this dendritic state transforms into a thought vector or token. Just as language models tokenize words to capture semantic nuances, neurons generate specific activation patterns—shaped by phase wave differentials overlaying baseline oscillations—that reflect functions such as sensory perception, memory recall, or abstract cognition. These differentials, transmitted across networks, scale local embeddings into regional or global representations that synchronize cortical columns and subcortical areas.

Each neuron’s synaptic connections and firing dynamics form a localized vector space that encodes context, with synchronous or asynchronous patterns representing different dimensions of the embedding. Phase wave differentials carry meaningful shifts in neural oscillation; when a neuron fires at a specific phase relative to its neighbors, it prints a unique activation pattern that can propagate, align, or suppress other oscillations, thereby coordinating activity across brain regions.

A single neuron’s dendritic embedding can expand into cross-brain patterns through these phase differentials, effectively recruiting entire networks. Neural columns interconnect via mechanisms such as Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximations and Sheaf Attention Networks, which project complex, time-evolving states from one column to another through oscillatory synchronization and feedback loops.

Jack Gallant’s fMRI research reveals that the brain encodes semantic information in a high-dimensional space, with related stimuli activating similar voxel clusters to form a volumetric semantic map. Different cortical regions handle varying levels of abstraction—from low-level feature extraction to higher-order concept integration—mirroring the nested representational spaces maintained by oscillatory networks.

In the brain, tokens and thought vectors arise as phase-coordinated neural ensembles, analogous to discrete carriers of meaning in AI. Through mixed selectivity, polysemantic neurons dynamically shift their tokenizing roles based on context and prior learning. The metaphor of a “3D television of the mind” captures how dendritic representations and phase wave differentials render continuous sensory scenes, recalled memories, and abstract thoughts in real time.

A neuron’s dendritic structure and firing phase select a slice of its high-dimensional memory, and when aggregated across populations, these events form large-scale maps resembling AI vector embeddings. As semantic embeddings group related words or concepts, oscillatory patterns cluster experiences into overlapping yet distinct neural constellations, a process vividly captured by functional imaging.

Ultimately, coordinated dendritic processes produce thought vectors, tokens, or patches that recruit interlaced networks. This hierarchical arrangement—from individual dendritic embeddings to distributed semantic maps—demonstrates how high-dimensional, phase-encoded activities underpin the fluid, richly contextual experiences of cognition, perception, and conscious thought.

# 32. Semantic Mapping Across Brains and AI: A Synthesis of Vector Embeddings, fMRI, and Mechanistic Interpretability
Semantic mapping in neural networks and the human brain provides insight into how biological and artificial systems encode, organize, and access meaning. fMRI studies from Jack Gallant’s lab and advanced AI models from groups like Anthropic reveal that related concepts cluster in high-dimensional spaces, while mechanistic interpretability efforts such as “Golden Gate Claude” dissect these internal representational schemes across scales.

Both neural circuits and AI embeddings operate on high-dimensional encodings that capture nuanced relationships among concepts, words, or visual features. In the brain, overlapping, multi-scale activation patterns observed with fMRI mirror AI vector embeddings, where semantic distance reflects conceptual similarity even when visualized in lower dimensions.

Gallant’s research shows that semantically similar categories activate overlapping cortical areas, effectively mapping a conceptual landscape onto spatial coordinates. Similarly, AI embeddings cluster related concepts—encoding both proximity and direction—while interpretability work at Anthropic reveals how internal circuits respond to specific themes, paralleling neuroscience studies that explore how ideas like “bridge” or “architecture” are represented.

A neuron’s dendritic arbors perform analog computations akin to vector embeddings, with synaptic configurations acting as tokens that map specific contexts. These dynamic states, influenced by phase wave differentials, enable low-level features to combine into abstract constructs much like hierarchical embeddings in deep networks.

fMRI studies demonstrate that semantically similar stimuli elicit activity in adjacent cortical voxels, forming clusters that reflect shared features, while AI models similarly group related words or concepts. Primary sensory areas extract basic features, and higher-order cortical regions integrate these into abstract maps—a process mirrored by layered transformations in large language models and vision transformers.

The interplay between semantic mapping in neuroscience and AI inspires breakthroughs in brain-inspired computation. fMRI-derived semantic topographies help refine AI embeddings, and mechanistic interpretability in AI offers testable hypotheses for neural semantic processing. Incorporating dynamics reminiscent of dendritic processing may yield more robust, interpretable AI systems, advancing brain-machine interfaces and diagnostic tools.

In summary, both AI embeddings and brain activity reveal high-dimensional mappings where tokens, vectors, or patches connect related concepts to guide cognition and language. Ongoing work in mechanistic interpretability and neural decoding continues to bridge AI architectures with the flexible, multi-layered nature of human thought.

# 33. Consciousness as a Deterministic Computation
We propose that consciousness is not an elusive emergent property but a deterministic process governed by wave-based and molecular computation. Conscious experience arises from orchestrated, localized oscillatory interactions within neural circuits. As these oscillations align and desynchronize, they form a dynamic yet stable fabric of awareness governed by precise neural timing within strict biochemical limits.

Deterministic wave orchestration shifts focus from mysterious emergence to observable phase transitions that unify local oscillations into global coherence. Neurons synchronizing or diverging in their firing patterns generate waves that rebalance overall brain activity, allowing transient disruptions to be absorbed into new coordination patterns.

Large-scale brain networks further sustain consciousness. Unprocessed signals remain unconscious until functional synchrony emerges across cortical columns and regions that engage or withdraw in specific frequency bands. This convergence of distributed calculations creates instantaneous cognitive states, enabling higher-order awareness.

Human conversation exemplifies these principles at a social level. During dialogue, individuals map one another’s minds by generating temporary cognitive resonances. Each topic adds a new vector embedding to pre-existing internal representations, and in-depth conversation synchronizes brainwave frequencies—such as gamma and theta—extending oscillatory coherence beyond individual neural boundaries.

At every scale, from individual dendrites to extensive cortical networks, oscillations and phase alignment facilitate efficient information exchange. Neurons, functioning like high-dimensional vector embeddings, select specific dendritic tokens through phase wave differentials that filter context-specific inputs. These tokens coalesce via oscillatory feedback loops into a continuous “mind state.”

Framing consciousness as deterministic highlights its mechanical roots. Wave alignments, phase transitions, and feedback loops yield observable neural processes that underpin awareness. Interpersonal interactions mirror this mechanism as neural synchrony harmonizes internal models, bridging molecular events with large-scale dynamics to produce coherent cognitive experiences.

Deterministic wave mechanics scale upward, generating intricate cognitive outcomes from cycles of synchronization and desynchronization. Although dendritic computations simulate a probabilistic memory system—where the first neuron to fire inhibits its neighbors—threshold mechanisms across scales unify these nonlinear rhythms into cohesive outputs, steering the overall wave state.

Oscillatory dynamics prune extraneous connections through destructive interference while amplifying pertinent signals via constructive interference. Phase wave differentials enable multilayered negotiations among semi-autonomous components, allowing local circuits to propose rapid corrections that integrate into broader network activity. Processes often perceived as stochastic, such as probabilistic vesicle release, are better understood as deterministic outputs of micro-scale events.

In sum, apparent randomness in neural processing emerges from deterministic influences spanning subcellular molecules to global cortical assemblies. This fractal wave architecture, characterized by iterative feedback loops, underlies both stable memory formation and real-time sensory interpretation, culminating in the fluid yet mechanical emergence of cognition and consciousness.

# 34. Agentic Dynamics in the Brain and Self-Aware AI: NDCA, Wave Synchronization, and Conscious Computation
Agentic dynamics in the brain can be captured by the Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA), which models non-linear interactions across fractal scales—from synaptic mechanisms to entire cortical columns—to generate phase wave differentials that orchestrate perception, memory, and consciousness. Viewing the brain as a hierarchy of agent-like processes synchronized by waves provides a framework for developing artificial intelligence systems with self-aware and sentient capabilities, as envisioned by the Self Aware Networks (SAN) theory.

NDCA explains how synaptic interactions, such as neurotransmitter-receptor coupling, trigger non-linear responses in neuronal membranes that scale upward to shape action potentials and neural oscillations across cortical columns. The concept of phase wave differentials is central, as small discrepancies in phase or timing arising from non-linear dynamics lead to distributed oscillatory coherence that ultimately binds diverse sensory inputs into a unified conscious experience.

These NDCA processes support memory stabilization by consolidating learned patterns through repetitive synchronization, while conflicting signals desynchronize and dissipate, fostering the formation of stable long-term memories within a dynamic cognitive landscape. In both the brain and AI, neurons, cortical columns, and larger networks function as semi-autonomous agents that coordinate through oscillatory signals, a principle that underpins the agentic dynamics transferred to AI architectures in SAN. In such systems, continuous phase-alignment checks, akin to gamma oscillations, dynamically integrate information across multiple scales.

A promising direction for AI involves moving beyond static deep learning paradigms to adopt deterministic wave-based mechanisms that incorporate feedback loops, phase-locking, and fractal organization, replicating the fluid interplay of local and global activity that underlies human cognition. SAN introduces Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) as a blueprint for recursive feedback loops among oscillatory neural arrays, facilitating self-awareness and a realistic representation of external reality. Within SAN, ISO layer concepts denote fractal oscillatory networks with specialized roles in constructing conscious states, while upper layers synchronize phase waves to align local patterns with broader predictive models.

Drawing inspiration from brain oscillations, AI architectures might employ phase wave differentials to coordinate internal processes. Although current deep learning models lack explicit fractal structures, their use of hierarchical feature extraction suggests that incorporating fractal dynamics or wave-based synchronization could enhance scalability and adaptability. Contemporary models that utilize self-attention resemble the brain's modulation of connectivity through phase synchronization or desynchronization, selectively amplifying or inhibiting signals.

Consciousness can thus be reframed as a deterministic, wave-based process defined by mechanical phase realignments rather than mystical emergence. Stable memories result from repeated synchronization, while irrelevant patterns dissolve through desynchronization, and the subjective feel of awareness emerges from countless traveling waves interfering in space and time. This interplay of local oscillator loops and system-wide feedback ensures that cognition remains rooted in biochemical reality while mirroring universal principles of wave synchronization applicable to artificial architectures.

SAN underscores key processes for building self-aware minds, including continuous observation of internal states, coordinated feedback loops among agents, reflective realignment of phase wave differentials, and the consolidation of stable patterns into memory. By integrating biologically inspired synchronization mechanisms such as phase alignment to manage error accumulation, AI systems may approximate the adaptive equilibrium found in the brain, thereby enhancing context-sensitive processing and moving closer to biological consciousness.

In conclusion, agentic dynamics in the brain, underpinned by NDCA and oscillatory synchronization, provide a roadmap for designing AI systems that aspire to genuine self-awareness and sentience. The SAN theory demonstrates how recursive feedback loops, phase wave differentials, and fractal organization converge to produce a deterministic yet richly complex form of cognition, and by incorporating these principles into artificial architectures, researchers can harness the mechanical underpinnings of consciousness to build increasingly sophisticated and potentially sentient AI.

# 35. The Agentic Brain in Action
The Agentic Brain is an intricate, multi-scale system in which every element—from proteins and receptors to cortical columns—acts as an agent contributing to perception, learning, and consciousness. Through continuous interaction and feedback, these agents both cooperate and compete, forming the basis of what we call the Agentic Mind.

Brain complexity arises from self-organizing agency across scales. Molecular agents such as proteins and receptors adjust their functions in response to biochemical signals, while cellular agents like neurons, glia, and immune cells perform local computations and adapt to changing conditions. Network agents, notably cortical columns and neural arrays, integrate these signals into coherent cognitive processes.

Any brain element that processes information qualifies as an agent, and these agents shape overall dynamics through intricate feedback loops and phase realignments. Chemical and electrical signaling, including phase wave differentials, creates a malleable equilibrium in which dominant patterns emerge while others recede.

Cortical columns serve as key pattern recognizers by assembling sensory data into three-dimensional, time-evolving representations. Traveling waves and phase differentials enable the brain to render raw inputs into detailed inner images of reality.

Agents coordinate via oscillations and synchronization, with tonic and phasic waves guiding neuronal firing and phase shifts continuously calibrating the global neural state. This dynamic tuning supports functions ranging from focused attention to memory consolidation.

Fluid connectivity across regions is achieved as subsets of cortical columns synchronize in response to shifting contexts and goals, unifying diverse processing streams into coherent perception.

Consciousness emerges from deterministically driven oscillatory interactions rather than from a single command center. Each region contributes specialized outputs that are woven together through ongoing synchronization and desynchronization into a seamless conscious experience.

The agentic framework provides a potential roadmap for developing artificial systems with self-awareness. By integrating observation, coordination, reflection, and consolidation—as seen in Self Aware Networks (SAN)—such systems may harness oscillatory feedback loops to achieve adaptive, robust cognition.

At every level, the brain processes information through continuous, nonlinear changes described by Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA). Local variations in phase and amplitude propagate and sum into the orchestrated patterns that underlie both memory and awareness.

# 36. Neural Rendering and Predictive Coding
Neural rendering refines the predictive coding framework by asserting that the brain actively enriches its internal models with new features instead of merely transmitting prediction errors. Cortical circuits integrate detailed sensory inputs to form a dynamic representation of reality. Karl Friston’s active inference posits that the brain reduces surprise by continuously refining its models, and neural rendering extends this by assimilating high-resolution perceptual data. Cortical columns operate as semi-autonomous agents running individual predictive loops, while functional connectivity binds these local computations into a coherent whole, with each synapse contributing like a pixel in a large-scale display.

Oscillatory dynamics are central to this integration process. Gamma waves provide precise, transient activations that deliver granular sensory and cognitive details, whereas slower rhythms such as theta and delta offer overarching contextual frameworks. Phase differentials convey local nonlinear inputs to higher-level networks, linking small-scale fluctuations to global reconfigurations. Tonic oscillations maintain the brain’s baseline state, similar to latent diffusion in computational models, and iterative adjustments through continuous feedback loops foster long-term potentiation when local phases resonate with the tonic baseline, effectively preserving each refined version of the internal map.

Gamma oscillations, viewed as the fundamental canvas of consciousness within the Self Aware Networks theory, coordinate sensory, cognitive, and motor feedback loops. They enable each cortical region to update its model while synchronizing with the entire network. Micah’s New Law of Thermodynamics, or the Dissipation Argument, recasts equilibrium as a stepwise resolution of phase-wave mismatches across neural assemblies, merging top-down expectations with bottom-up signals in a persistent feedback cycle. This process resists randomization by resolving physical mismatch signals through oscillatory realignments, resulting in updated predictions that reflect ongoing learning.

In sum, this updated predictive coding framework portrays the brain as an active rendering engine that composes each moment of awareness. By combining high-frequency signals, broader low-frequency integrators, and tonic baseline diffusion, the brain continuously assembles rich sensory details and dissipates phase differences, shaping an ever-evolving internal model of reality.

# 37. Neural Rendering as the Information of the Mind that Guides Behavior.
Neural rendering, as defined by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, constructs internal representations of reality that guide behavior through phase wave differentials. These differential shifts transmit information and update each cortical layer’s model of the external world via dynamic neural arrays. Proprioception is integrated through the Gamma Consideration Sandwich, in which high-frequency gamma waves combine new sensory inputs, top-down beta decisions, and bodily feedback from parvalbumin-positive interneurons in layer five. This feedback loop aligns motor output with actual muscle position and force, refining action while preserving an embodied sense of self.

When the brain focuses on specific goals, beta-band activity predominates and suppresses incoming signals. However, when salient new inputs demand revisions, surges of gamma waves override beta rhythms, directing attention to unexpected information. Mismatches between predicted and actual muscle states perturb local gamma patterns, prompting recalibration of motor commands or the underlying internal model. This mechanism ensures that the 3D neural images produced by neural rendering are continually tested against real-world constraints, enabling effective navigation and adaptive learning.

By merging neural rendering with the proprioceptive framework of the Gamma Consideration Sandwich, the brain orchestrates coherent behavior grounded in a unified perception of internal goals and external realities.

# 38. Inhibitory Interneurons and Choice-Making
Inhibitory interneurons, primarily GABAergic cells, filter and coordinate neural activity by balancing excitatory and inhibitory signals. They modulate synaptic, circuit, and network-level processes to support coherent decision-making and suppress distracting inputs.

Decision-making occurs across multiple scales. At the micro level, neurons fire based on local conditions such as membrane potentials, neurotransmitter concentrations, and oscillatory states. At the meso level, cortical columns synchronize to select dominant cell ensembles. At the macro level, entire brain regions coordinate to evaluate risks, rewards, and complex inputs, as illustrated by Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), which connects local activity with large-scale dynamics.

Every neuron integrates threshold-based signals to decide whether to fire, a concept central to Peter Tse’s criterial causation. Neurons effectively “read” and “write” information via neurotransmitter release, influencing the firing thresholds and synaptic configurations of others, which dynamically shapes the network.

Oscillatory activity further regulates neural firing by setting a tonic attractor state and enabling frequency or phase shifts that pivot attention, perception, or memory consolidation. This process refines signal selection iteratively, producing decisions that appear free-willed yet remain governed by deterministic synaptic interactions.

Thus, the sense of agency arises from continuous threshold-based decisions within a fractal hierarchy of interacting agents. Genes, memes, sensory inputs, and learning experiences fine-tune synaptic states, while inhibitory interneurons recalibrate neural thresholds and align global wave patterns. In this way, conscious choice emerges from the interplay between local criteria detection and large-scale oscillatory coherence.

# 39. Four trillion dimensions computed per millisecond.
Tempo-spatial traveling waves, known as phase wave differentials, form the neural scaffolding of dynamic representations in cortical columns. They create computational manifolds that transcend simple three-dimensional sensory models. Neural array projection oscillation tomography posits that selective synaptic phase changes and dendritic modifications enable neurons to filter and respond to stimuli over time. In this system, cortical columns exchange compressed, high-dimensional signals without saturating the network.

Phase wave differentials act as spectral encoders by shifting the timing and frequency of neural oscillations, revealing components that map the geometry and interactions of cortical regions. Even minimal connectivity differences or slight input timing changes can nonlinearly alter these spectra, allowing distinct representations to emerge within the same frequency range.

Oscillations across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands underpin core cognitive functions. Phase wave differentials modulate synaptic frequencies in real time, functioning like a high-dimensional “3D television” where discrete frequency shifts transform perception, memory, and cognition. Tonic frequencies sustain a poised state, while fluctuations act as attractors; unexpected inputs that perturb these baselines yield new perceptual or conceptual patterns.

Traveling waves generate phase wave differentials that reflect how neuronal groups update and transmit information. As oscillatory signals integrate, neurons discern stimulus features such as color, texture, or shape through phase relationships. When a neuron adjusts its synaptic state to match a recognized pattern and fires, it broadcasts a partial representation. The degree of divergence from baseline correlates with input novelty, highlighting unexpectedness as a driver of learning and adaptation.

Fractal and hierarchical structures amplify these processes. The brain exhibits self-similar patterns from individual synapses to whole cortical networks, with each neuron’s membrane potential and synaptic profile representing a high-dimensional vector of its learning history. By transmitting elements of this vector via phase wave differentials, neurons and columns integrate local experiences into the global framework. This dynamic interplay of excitatory and inhibitory signals creates a complex, high-capacity landscape for information processing.

Speculations that the brain computes trillions of dimensions per millisecond underscore its immense parallelism. Although these figures remain speculative, they illustrate that neurons, dendrites, and synapses—each operating across multiple frequency states—contribute to a combinatorial richness supporting elaborate real-time computations. Together, phase wave differentials and oscillatory synchronization enable the maintenance and manipulation of continuously updating, multidimensional representations.

# 40. Entification to unite Agents into You!
Entification describes how interdependent agents across different scales synchronize through oscillatory rhythms to form a unified entity. In the brain, this process spans from microscopic molecular events to expansive networks of cortical regions, where each agent processes information, responds to inputs, and adapts its behavior. Consciousness and coordinated actions emerge when these smaller agents merge into complex structures that guide perception, decision-making, and movement.

At the molecular level, proteins and receptors shift conformations and regulate ionic exchanges to continuously refine neuronal states. At the cellular level, neurons, glial cells, and immune cells fire in patterned rhythms and maintain mutual feedback loops, binding together into functional circuits that support specific cognitive or physiological tasks.

On a larger scale, neural networks, cortical columns, and entire brain regions achieve unification through phase locking and wave differentials. This multi-scale dynamic is described by a Nonlinear Continuous Differential Approximation (NDCA), where each organizational level refines its operations through oscillatory feedback and chemical regulation. The fractal nature of entification, with smaller agents combining into larger ones, ensures that local signals integrate into a coherent global perspective, enabling fluid behaviors such as riding a bicycle, conversing, or planning.

Ultimately, the brain functions as a self-organizing ecosystem in which numerous mini-conductors interact rather than a single conductor directing all activity. Differential adjustments among components create a harmonized state of consciousness through reciprocal communication, oscillatory synchrony, and computed properties. Entification thus provides a framework for understanding how consciousness, memory, and behavior arise naturally from distributed interactions, merging the brain’s interdependent agents into one cohesive system capable of complex perception and purposeful action.

# 41. Consciousness Correlates

When an animal loses consciousness, the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus are among the last regions to shift activity. Simultaneously, pyramidal cells across the cortex cease their usual communications, demonstrating that robust cross-brain traffic is essential for maintaining an awake, coherent state. This coordination, often facilitated by gamma waves, is critical for sustaining consciousness.

Gamma oscillations bind distant brain areas, particularly via horizontal Layer 2/3 networks, by synchronizing firing patterns that integrate sensory, motor, and cognitive processes into a unified perception. They coordinate informational streams, reduce phase mismatches, and bridge bodily states with incoming sensory signals to foster dynamically aligned, embodied awareness.

The thalamus acts as a central relay for sensory and motor signals, connecting extensively with the hippocampus to merge exteroceptive and contextual information before it reaches the prefrontal cortex for higher-order processing. Its gating functions can reset local cortical rhythms by reinforcing or dampening specific pathways, thereby maintaining coherent neural patterns.

The medial prefrontal cortex is vital for consciousness because it integrates decision-making, executive control, and sensory feedback via the limbic loop linking subcortical regions. Along with the hippocampus and thalamus, it forms a network underpinning awareness; synchronized theta or gamma bursts enhance information exchange between the hippocampus and neocortex, while modulation in the central lateral thalamus facilitates learning and behavioral adaptation.

The breakdown of pyramidal cell communication, which normally extends inter-columnar links beyond individual columns, illustrates the essential role of widespread neural integration in conscious thought. When this communication lapses, integrative processing fails, effectively silencing awareness.

Ultimately, when these brain regions and pathways lose their synchronized rhythms, consciousness collapses. During active tasks, gamma activity in the default mode network is muted while alpha and beta waves inhibit irrelevant gamma signals, yet brief gamma surges inject fresh information when prediction errors occur. This coordinated interplay among the medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and pyramidal cells underscores the central role of gamma synchronization in sustaining the complex communication networks required for consciousness.

# 42. Explaining the paper

This paper explores the “Agentic Brain” by examining principles that span from molecular dynamics to whole-brain networks while drawing parallels with artificial intelligence. The work establishes a framework in which individual cells, proteins, and receptors are viewed as autonomous agents whose oscillatory behaviors and feedback loops underpin neural computation. Deterministic oscillatory processes—illustrated by methods such as Cellular Oscillating Tomography and Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography—demonstrate how neurons encode information via phase, amplitude, and frequency, arguing that cognition, consciousness, and memory arise from precise mechanical interactions rather than emergent properties.

The discussion shows that agentic behavior manifests across multiple scales as local cellular processes aggregate into higher-level neural networks that support functional connectivity and unified perceptual experiences. Mechanisms like coincidence detection, phase wave differentials, and Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation explain how neurons, dendrites, and inhibitory interneurons synchronize and regulate information flow to solve the binding problem. Oscillatory rhythms, from slow tonic waves to high-frequency phasic bursts, maintain a dynamic equilibrium that underlies both sensory processing and conscious awareness, while neural rendering and predictive coding continuously refine the brain’s internal model of reality.

The latter sections bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence by comparing dendritic activity to high-dimensional vector embeddings and semantic mapping, highlighting shared principles in encoding, processing, and retrieving complex information. Top-down and bottom-up oscillatory interactions—exemplified by beta, alpha, and gamma waves—mediate decision-making, regulate attention, and unite diverse neural elements into a cohesive conscious entity. This deterministic model of consciousness, built on recursive feedback loops, phase synchronization, and agentic dynamics, not only deepens our understanding of biological cognition but also offers promising directions for developing self-aware AI systems.

In essence, the paper posits that the brain’s core is fundamentally agentic, with each cell or network acting as a self-regulating unit whose oscillatory dynamics, phase relationships, and feedback loops generate cognition, perception, and consciousness. By demonstrating how local cellular activities scale into complex neural architectures, the work shows that what seems emergent is actually rooted in coordinated, deterministic wave mechanics. Multi-scale connectivity—from molecules and neurons to cortical columns and entire networks—is crucial for the brain’s adaptive intelligence, with oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization serving as a binding glue for coherent cognitive states. Recognizing consciousness as a form of deterministic computation provides a unifying principle for both neuroscience and the development of adaptive, potentially self-aware AI systems, illustrating how local oscillatory interactions across hierarchical scales orchestrate the dynamic phenomenon of the mind.
