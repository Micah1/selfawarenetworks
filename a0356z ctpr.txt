Note from Mar 20, 2011
as the eye of a hurricane is to a hurricane, so mass curves spacetime, the mass is the eye of the hurricane, and it's spinning is cumulative, the cumulative of tiny hurricanes in the form of atoms, in the particle wind, so that's the reason there is gravity on large dense objects like the earth, the earth itself is isomorphic to a spinning hurricane, the earth would be the eye of the hurricane funneling space itself and everything in it towards the earth.
