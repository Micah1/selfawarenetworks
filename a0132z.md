Quantum Physics & LTD

You are a fractal oscillating node on an oscillating branch of the cosmos which is an fractal oscillating that is actually a single oscillation from the perspective outside time and space.

The perspective outside time and space is seeing the cosmos as the ever present now. One long undivided moment in which the perception of time by the simultaneous increases in extropy and entropy because the two forces are bound in that they always increase together as the oscillators evolve in complexity they dissipate entropy to the surrounding environment, and the perpendicular oscillations of positive and negative electrons (an oscillatory splay state describes the difference between positive and negative charge, fermions are space in a state of decoherence, and bosons are in a state of electrical coherence with W and Z bosons being examples of high phase states that decay quickly by resonator dissipation into the larger group of oscillation, W and Z have too much energy relative to other bosons, which they cannot maintain, its like a top that is spinning too fast, to much angular momentum.

perpendicular alternating phase firing neurons will cause the space that is the line between them to contract slow cool shrink decohere spacetime between them, which is why LTD results in dendritic spine decay. The energy of the decoherence spine decay or coherence spin formation is based on the amount of energy released from the soma of each neuron, eventually reacting the other neuron. It's the explanation for Beta Decay also.

The scale of an oscillating particle such as a W boson is going to dissipate in a vaccum because the signals that it is giving off are bigger than the signals it is receiving off, it is spending its energy over time and eventually it decays because of entropy, entropy because of the math of oscillators, with particles being oscillators Bosons, or attractors for oscillations in the case of Fermions that are splayed in time, but are coherent in space. With the Fermion Condensate responsible for multiscale fermion condesate lines emerging between oscillators, each of them heating up and expanding the space between them resulting in the curvature of spacetime through a combination of multiscale soliton waves in the photonic fields with electricity charge sensation (high frequency/time), magnetism(high amplitude/spatial feel), mechanical vibrational acoustic (sound and inner voice), thermal (hot/cold data for processing hot cold sensation), and chemical (feeling energy state vitality sleep in-the-zone) and the correlations of patterns across all modalities.

The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron

the multimedium processing create isomorphic pattern learning in each of the senses that can be understood in terms of each of the modalities, so a tactile reading of braille text which is bumps on a page can result in words read from tactile sensations but processed in the somatosensory cortex first instead of from the visual (electric field solitons) cortex, the auditory cortex (mechanical soliton waves), decoded from the sensation of heat patterns (its a weird idea but imagine using heat to transmit morse code signals), chemical (the gut feeling), 

but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,

it could also be that the neuron that fires in one layer is causing an inhibitory pattern in the next layer, but I think this does not make sense because the idea is that the neuron, when it fires it fires because it needs to dissipate its energy to other neurons, it wants to increase the excitement in the subsequent array bumping up the voltage of each neuron that its connected to in the next array because we want the second layer to be able to track coincident firing in the first layer, and another array should be tracking coincident firing between the first and second layers, and another layer should be tracking coincident firing between all the layers below it, with six layers in the anatomical sense but perhaps 13 layers in the functional sense according to a paper by Numenta

With the higher layers tracking the largest scale patterns and the lower layers tracking the smallest scale patterns, the layers act like the enlarge function on a photocopier taking each sparse firing and magnifying its area by having it inhibit the firing of a select group, which slows their oscillations relative to the larger oscilliating group, each sparse encoding is magnified by each layer of the cortex, and that results in higher level pattern learning at the top, and that is the grid cell place cell reference frame concept talked about in the book by Jeff Hawkins called A Thousand Brains

The neural circuits, layers, and cortical columns transmit their learned patterns to every part of the brain which builds multimodal models of incoming patterns so you have hand eye coordination and can feel and see and hear the same thing, having an awareness of all the properties of an object, how it sounds, looks, feels, its temperature, orientation, location, momentum, direction, velocity, density, volume, pitch, reverb, etc etc, your whole brain gets involved in modelling all the properties of all the things you sense.

The patterns are rendered and transmitted on screens (oscillator arrays (circuits layers columns and long interneuron networks and long glial networks) in every modality so that learned patterns are modality invariant and so that all the modalities are used to represent all the patterns (its different facets & properities) and its high level information configuration (the high level concept of what it is simplied, like object recognition rather semantic segmentation

see paper on soliton heat waves
"Heat solitons and thermal transfer of information along thin wires"
"Our motivation is to obtain and compare the speed of propagation, the maximum rate of information transfer, and the energy necessary for the transfer of one bit of information for different solitons, by assuming that a localized soliton may carry a bit of information."

It is interesting how much overlap there is between areas associated with olfactory and emotion

quantum solitons may have a big role in sending decoherence patterns to decay a dendritic spine, or to grow a dendritic spine from the electromagnetic membrane of the cell wall

the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync

sparse quantum pattern learning/prediction is probably better for high frequency low amplitude senses, such as olfactory, maybe taste, but taste is also texture which is about high amp high surface area. smell, emotions, and point clouds have a lot less mass and a lot more energy, so quantum signals represent a sparse sample learning spread over a large area

so it could track the most novel activity patterns at the smallest scales such as the breeze on the back of your hand, the wind on your skin, the change in the atmosphere, how fresh the air is, and how you feel about the information from various senses

It's like six scales of sensory representation as a range of power bands at different frequencies, alpha, beta, theta, delta, and tonic gamma.
the fastest would be quantum, so gamma is quantum signalling perhaps? 

then
beta, high frequency, smell, emotion, wind
alpha, sight, sound, voices, language
theta, high spatial, touch, muscle movement
delta, highest spatial, deep bass movements, appreciating mountains
as gamma = thermo/heat signal / quantum decay/growth
as beta = sight, attention, 
alpha = auditory, logitudinal soliton mechanical / acoustic in the synaptic gap waves
theta = magnetic feel, 
delta = touch feel, texture, large scale, big picture

each modality essentially acts as a sensor recorder

its like a thermostat, or a hear sensor, its detected, turned into a pattern on an array, many sequences of arrays firing over time change the organisms attention and internal represents constantly.

Any of the sensor modalities can compete for amplification in a desynchronized brain, but in a synchronized brain what happens when the layers correct their own internal pattern representations overtime, with lower energy pattern representations that preserve the transformation & development and set expansion in time of the phase field phasically firing parts of the grid pattern that includes each interval of time which expands or enlarges the entire pattern of one set in another set. The scale/frequency ranges up scale patterns up, and the brain also scales patterns down thanks to sparse signalling over greater distances, this kind of signalling might be good for balance. But the excitatory network of feed forward sets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.

The cerebellum, for balance, is able to consider the bodies weight position momentum direction etc

because its not about learning novel patterns, its about controlling novel behaviors with large scale but fast and not always accurate movement impulses that become more accurate with the prioceptive sensory feedback happening at each time interval

What if a 7th version of you is virtual having no specific substrate, but instead is like the pattern configuration of negative space or decoherence between the 6 modalities. So that if the orthogonal interactions, between 1. electric, 2. magnetic, 3. mechanical/acoustic, 4. thermal, 5. chemical, 6. Quantum signalling, pairing, and memory in spin states are all interacting with multi-scale oscillatory dynamics. So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales. 

Its a conscious self driving, flying, swimming, walking, running machine.
The sensory data attained through movement and its own causal body of movements are components that provide it with the knowledge of the cosmos that helps it make better decisions.
So the driving part, exoskeleten, artificial arms, electric unicycle, and also a flying part, a swimming part, and a space travel part
