Humanity might be absorbing electrons from high frequency signals, and emitting low frequency tonic signals that either calm or excite the environment at the quantum scale

thats why we have an observer effect or measurement 

our delta wave, theta wave, alpha, beta, low gamma emissions are programming the universe that we observe to be more excited or less depending on the oscillatory state of that which is being observed.
