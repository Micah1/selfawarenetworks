  18: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

  38: (oscillat, synap) map: synapse configuration, SDR, Oscillator, internal recognition
  40: The idea that a neuron's synaptic configuration represents a lot of different SDR patterns, that emerge from combinations of neural firing into distinct internal renderings that an oscillator can recognize
  44: Because oscillations transmit everywhere in the brain any part of the brain can serve as a reader for saving all of the brain's oscillatory patterns.
  48: Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.
  52: I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.
  60: You, the rendering, and it, the chemical structure oscillating with the phase field of space are sharing each interval of the moment that is being rendered as the organism's map of reality. You, the virtual entity of information existing as phases (frequencies) are sharing this moment with your saltwater, protein, chemical body, like two halves of one oscillating nexus.

  14: The large scale dipole reflects the horizontal activity of whole cortical column oscillations in partial whole brain oscillations that have 3 phases inhibition, excitation, and tonic.
  26: The brightest flash of the firefly, or the strongest pulse of the action potential going to cause the most number of fireflies or upstream cells to react at the same time. Sync is a coincident oscillator reaction to broadly distributed high amp low freq signals of any modality type
  28: To have the global sync oscillation altered by the collective action of a neural circuit with different size oscillators might result in a global pattern generation like turning small signals into a flashing image on a screen that down stream neurons receive as an image or a sound or tactile sensation or a feeling which is then observed by another layer
  30: As if the brain is replicating the images it sees outside and the sounds of what it hears outside in the collective signal generated by the oscillator reacting to 
  34: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above

   3: oscillating functional fractal isomorphism
   4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
  10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
  12: space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to oscillators, this space is simultabeous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales
  14: but space is not really expanding, its just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking and space is staying the same. This would make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are shrinking and becoming more dense gaining mass as they move through space attracting new particles through collision lanes
  18: spacetime is the length of an interval between two oscillations that the cosmos is making when particles shift in and out of existence between having a location or having a velocity,
  20: spacetime is like a stretched velocity that is warped around an oscillator, while the oscillator has a location the velocity can't be found anywhere but instead of velocity we get space
  22: when oscillators run out of energy, velocity should resume and location vanish
  24: sonce space is full of a fractal of oscillators, it would not seem to be a stretch therefore for spacetime to be a 4D interval between oscillations
  26: in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator
  30: The new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating particle collision lanes. Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to quantum physics,
  32: that helps explain why Quantum physics looks confusing its because spacetime at quantum scale is moving faster relatively, because of oscillators
  40: since spacetime is expanding everywhere atoms are spacetime is also expanding inside our brains, so our brains are experiencing the expansion of time, because the brain is literally expanding as its atoms oscillate and warp spacetime
  42: If my memories are attractors then it means that I am, through my memories, literally creating myself, creating my simulation of reality, as the oscillator I am also literally creating spacetime, so each oscillator its creating its own relative space phase field, relative to itself, so it being smaller than its space, and shrinking as dissipative systems do over time as they run out of energy well
  46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
  48: So if space is like an oscillation it goes from being all quiet to being all noisy and back again
  50: this means the entire universe will over time have a sort of heat death, the loss of energy from all oscillations and following that time restarts as the heat death oscillates or divides again into a new oscillation.
  52: the uncertainty of whether the universe exists is the key distinction, or the first oscillation, that makes space time possible, and perhaps each new oscillation can be considered to be like a division of the first oscillation, which reverberates for a seeming infinity creating a relative spacetime seemingly for an infinite time with seemingly infinite space. This expansion creates a cascade of new space & time expanding vortices, until the heat death of all vortices/oscillators, which leads back to the initial state of no time or space.
  54: Basically spacetime is going collapse when the last oscillation runs out of energy.

    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   47: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   63: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
   92: All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.
  106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  132: But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote.

  2: (oscillat, field, array)
  3: an oscillating cell, because of the tensegrity or physical forces between clustered oscillators (atoms, molecules, chemicals), is going to be sensitive to the environment as its delicate structure is disturbed by collisions at all scales, so any atom is capable of encoding a representation of its ecosystem in a sense, but an oscillator is not a self-aware entity that oscillates its learned patterns across different sensor/transmitter arrays at multiple scales like the human brain encoding patterns in learned connects between incoming stimulus patterns from the environment.
  5: An oscillator like a hurricane might encode changes from its environment that alter the fabric of its casual body in phase space mimicking short term memories, but more like learning patterns that are never conscious because there is no prior memory to compare the pattern against, and even if the structure prior to the structural change is a prior pattern the pattern isn't sending signals to other oscillators except that it actually is also doing that through light, heat, particle collisions, em field lanes, sound/vibrations, as charge and spin configurations, and so on.

   7: all manner and variety of thought feeling idea sensation, its all tempo-spatially distributed phase decoherence patterns and oscillating substrate to serve as the canvas of observation and the awareness of self as the canvas of observation
   9: an oscillation is a sensor and transmitter at the same time, because it is disturbed by anything that disturbes it and it transmits whatever disturbes it by changing its phase up or down
  13: inside certain molecular structures like the networks of the brain it is possible for the oscillators to form molecular memories, or memories that are encoded on the molecular structure of the brain by electrical wave patterns, magnetic wave patterns, mechanical wave patterns, and chemical wave patterns.

   21: In a poetic sense our thinking is unites with the fabric of spacetime, we are in a sense oscillating fractal folds of spacetime in an advanced information configuration that is defining space and ourseves at the same time
   25: in otherwords as an oscillation pattern we are literally absorbing and emitting spacetime simultaneously it is moving through us because we are dissipative vortexes
   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.
   92: earth has superficial awareness on super short timescales, the smaller more complex configurations of oscillators in brains have magnified temporal awareness
  111: its the attractive force of a spinning oscillator
  118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
  120: Ultimately electrical force also stems as a property of the properties of its oscillator flow as well. 
  122: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity
  124: Attractive and Repulsive Forces on Particles in Oscillatory Flow
  127: In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 
  143: I make the argument that Space might have zero absolute and zero absolute time, just relative space & time, because they balance each other out like positive and negative charges, with space being more negative and time being more positivel Somewhere inbetween a moment that in summary equals nothing there is temporarily something. That something is a chaotic volumetric information pattern called mass in an otherwise harmonic & tonic oscillating spacetime field inbetween a single moment of nothing that is also, on the flip side of the coin, the ever present beginning of spacetime. 
  147: the observer viewpoint is essentially a mini hologram inside a hologram (space) we are each the image of the spacetime cosmos and fhe product of spacetime cosmos, and a dissipative system in the spacetime cosmos which is an harmonic oscillator in total, with space and time being resonating oscillators
  149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  151: in an oscillating field oscillations grow together once they oscillate together
  152: if they oscillate apart they grow apart
  154: its about the idea that your exact location/scale in the universe is determined by your oscillatory pattern
  162: Two objects are composable in phase space if they have the same phase, or same oscillation, they can converge in space, expanding space & time around that convergence relatively speaking
  164: If they have a similar oscillation they can get close to converging in spacetime, so there is a timespace gradient

   8: as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation
  10: A tonic Alpha oscillation might respond more to the sensory frequency expectations of day time, whereas Delta frequencies are slower and closer to the expected sensory frequences during the late night and early morning.

   36: where the dimensions of space and time are carved by orbits, or spacetime oscillations of varying scales because oscillations can combine with other oscillations
   38: the entire field of space is an oscillating phase field, but it the total directional flow of particles does not add up to more than zero energy, so positive and negative energy split apart and we have particles, they combine and we have bose einstein-condensation or fermionic condensation, they orbit and we have atoms
   40: It has to maintain a total of zero energy because it has to real area or space, in essence its like an information pattern that self develops and learns itself, but basically its space that is cycling between oscillations developing in information complexity and oscillations withering into entropic dissonance
   44: and the rest of oscillating space absorbes their oscillation until that oscillation is in tonic sync, 
   46: because holographic space is a harmonic oscillator its also in oscillation with itself and that means that fast and large oscillators matter, they each cause dissonance to the surrounding area that attracts more energy that perpetuates their structure, 
   52: by oscillating in different information configuration patterns it creates a simulation of space area and time area by relative inference,

  64: faster positive oscillation has 
  66: it could be that a particle is the amount of time between each interval of oscillation from a negative charge 
  76: In a fermionic condensate the same principle is that oscillators are pushing each other apart because of their spatial confinement to a given direction
  80: this is because the different attractors in a particle oscillation have taken on different frequencies, which allows them to orbit each other into atoms 
  82: but they are out of phase sync and so they cannot merge into bosons at that point, not until a fractional state meets a compatible fractional state, like neural receptors the fractional state can only accept mergers with particles that add up to a boson which is like an oscillator that has a balanced positive/negative state
  90: everything is relative to everything else, in time space and oscillation phase, including in our brains.
  92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators, its entropy, and its repulsion or slowdown in the frequency or density of mass, and its the expansion of space ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, reduction of space frequency (density)

   88: is "Oscillating Space" a thing?
   92: So the argument for why time dilation around a mass is scale dependent could be that the electromagnetic wave field pattern of space is defined relative to dense oscillators such as planets.
   94: It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in space that it displaces are dissipating the energy from that sphere with distance, the fact that particles dissipate energy with distance causes spacetime to stretch out, but the same principle causes space to fold on itself to become atoms, molecules, chemicals, stars, planets, people, life and asteroids. What it means that an oscillating atom is happening when the path of two or more particles causes an oscillating convergence, where two or more particles start orbiting each other,
   98: The phase state of two electrons in orbit would cause them to merge, but I think by merging they would become faster, so they are merging in a temporal way. Like two oscillators with the same phase pattern they can easily merge, but the oscillating pattern of a proton or a neutron cannot merge with an electron because the phase states are not aligned, and that means the shortest path between them isn't the most direct path, and the result is that neutrons and electrons and protons fall into orbits that prevent them from colliding.
  120: So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.
  122: The combined effect of many oscillators is going to bend space time because each oscillator, and each group of oscillators is bending spacetime according to the density of their combined effect
  124: specifically the center of the perpendicular diameter of any oscillating body, adjusted by its delta in configuration space towards any object in space 
  141: so it's like time accelerates around particles that have converged together in 3D space to oscillate in time, which causes the expansion of space.
  143: oscillation causes the expansion of space also because it creates more heat
  146: oscillations create more space time relative to their density which is how many particles are oscillating together amplifying each other's effect to create an oscillating body
  150: The temporal velocity of combined oscillators in huge things like planets is going to create a large-scale gravitational effect on the local scale, but past a certain threshold it's going to have the opposite effect where space seems to get more stretched out.
  154: because the oscillating force of each galaxy on the fabric of spacetime means that they warp space time in between them, the signals between the two points in space happen faster because in each respective direction signals are happening faster so the whole space between them is happening faster
  156: and in essence all of space time is an oscillating field with fractalized oscillations happening at every scale down to the planck scale, up to the whole of space at the largest scale
  164: the whole of space at the largest scale is either one oscillation or its many, because its size is relative to its oscillations
  166: Space near oscillations moves faster and contracts towards those oscillations, but space in between the oscillations is being pulled towards the hot lines between hot points; they are hot lines because the field is being heated from two directions. These field lines in one sense fold space by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
  170: essentially the frequency of mass is it's density per it's oscillating body ie it's volume
  173: because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 
  189: a fractal of dissipative systems in oscillation
  191: a fractal of oscillators
  194: heat as oscillations in time
  203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.
  205: so there is an inversion where time is expanding inside the oscillator, and space is expanding outside the oscillator, and the two expansions are linked, relative and inverted
  215: spacetime is an oscillation of phase states that is oscillating through possible phase states

   7: I argue humans are not really alive, or that life means an 'active' oscillating dissipative system maintaining its own equilibrium. Life is a type of active oscillatory action & even dead things like computers 'can' consciously experience reality. 
   9: life is an oscillating network of oscillators that cooperate so that we maintain their collective equilibrium, when complex vortices combine forces to stay motivated and alive
  11: A computer is not an oscillating system inherently, but it could be (code can be written to oscillate, oscillation can be simulated, a game engine would be an easy place to create 3D oscillations) but oscillating neural networks also exist, but the point is to simulate how a biological neural network learn tempo-spatial (time & space) based phase patterns in a 3D grid, and have the learned frequencies of coincident phase patterns cluster or clump together the way an oscillations absorb other compatible oscillations or interact with other oscillators.
  13: A dissipative system, like a cell, a brain, a galaxy or an atom is absorbing energy to maintain its oscillation.
  17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  21: "and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)
  23: A disspating vortex is closer to a resonator, which could be described as a transient or decaying oscillator. (I guess in that sense the clapping of a crowd of people, or the light from a group of fireflies can be imagined as a dissipative oscillator, or resonator that will need to rest eventually.)

    8: oscillations, in space like atoms or stars their structure, spin, charge, etc can encode information in a sense, as they react to changes in the oscillating emfield and their reaction ripples through the same field
   18: if the oscillations in a body that is a rock can sense the world and record memories as changes to the rocks structure there is no network constructing complex information patterns in the rock that affect its function
   20: its like saying the observer is just a sensor, encoder, and transmitter without the receiver, decoder, and the reorganization of mental information patterns. There is no mechanism to consider complex information criteria in a rock. So panpsychism is reducing consciousness to a sensor/pattern encoder/transmitter, I think every oscillation is at least a sensor/pattern encoder/transmitter,
   22: but the consciousness is more like an oscillation of contexts and the contexts are information configurations, the information configurations are learned patterns stored in synaptic coupling, and decoupling, its an expert data structure, a network
   45: oscillating bodies such as rocks can mechanically sense, store physical transformation, and refract signals in new ways after but a rock in nature collects random signals, its changes are not from a conscious mind playing back novel new complex information patterns but from unconscious particle collisions
   55: The information patterns of consciousness need to be close enough together in space time or phase i  order to be coherent to consciousness, which is a sequence of oscillating arrays representing, modifying, cycling & dissipating information patterns.
   57: So consciousness as a non-physical configuration of the receptive & inceptive fields of networked oscillators is the result complex reactive patterns moving through sequences of sensory transmitter arrays
   72: the oscillating configuration of atoms in a rock might allow them to act as a sensory array of sorts for molecular transformations but consciousness is different because as an object a brain does discriminately react with coordinated movement to information configurations
   76: the fabric of consciousness is not oscillation, not memory, not sensors, not transmitters, but an internal representation made up of sequences of patterns that learn and materially cause reacts that lead to movements that lead to consequences, consequences themselves that are strange attractors for dissipative systems like people
   78: but consciousness might be, in the most simple way, two (or more) oscillations detecting, modulating, or diffusing a new information pattern, so that there is a pattern for another part of the brain to watch and develop
   90: Consciousness is a system of patterns that represent learned consequences (predictions of movements or paths) cycling through sequences of arrays, reproducing and evolving its oscillatory configurations with natural selection
  104: but these each transmit patterns without modulating, observation modulates and changes patterns and the harmonic oscillation field of spacetime
  108: so consciousness is not just a resonating multiscale learned pattern sequence in a harmonic oscillation field, in a feedback loop
  143: its about the configuration of the brains computational process (reactionary oscillating energy dissipative process) 
  169: The sculpting of reality in our minds is accomplished with streams of coherence (memories) and decoherence (forgetting), and as multiple variations of the patterns are rendered. the internal memory of the particulars of a model grow more accurate, coincidences between renderings by different arrays construct a natural back propogation system or modelling error correction that is accomplished by decoherence or alternating oscillators in a splay state or something close to it.
  194: and the natural selection of spacetime is also about coherence and decoherence patterns emerging and dissipating in harmonic oscillator
  196: and so spacetime oscillatory tomography is why we have planets with people orbiting stars, and not a perfectly even distribution of positive and negative particles
  198: disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy
  202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  212: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets
  220: This is leading to longevity as being about renewing, protecting, and preserving the coherence mechanisms perpetuating the bodies oscillatory continuation.
  224: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
  248: a repelling oscillation
  285: oscillators that are dipoles that are driven by electricity and focused into fermionic condensates are going to increase temporal oscillation in their center like a planet,
  289: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
  295: the space between two oscillators was mutually repulsive, as long as both were positive or both were negative
  301: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth
  324: oscillators attract particles that are in a complementary phase and they reject particles in a different phase

   6: what does an object in your mind need to be distinct from? why do we need an oscillation for a temporal, spatial, phasic sequence of deviations to deviate from? 
  10: So that is why I argue, that the tonic oscillations of the brain are creating the bedrock of the mind, the canvas of consciousness, the ground of being, the beginning of the detection of inner self space for the sentient self aware being to consider and reflect, the mechanical & computational chamber of ephinomenal consciousness in the robotic like human mind.
  14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

   4: Simultaneous Observing / Encoding Oscillators 
   5: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.
   7: This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing
   9: I'm imagining a brain that is all aware of itself, absolutely everything that one senses and perceives is represented by their brain in some place, but with different oscillators, represented by different power bands, with location invariant patterns, with cross brain interneuron enabled synchronicity, neuronal emsembles can increase in their firing rate become more noticeable yet weaker, decrease in their firing rate, becoming less noticable but more powerful. So attention can shift to large brain areas that have more new activity & are more excited, meaning when you become excited some of your senses will have their receptive fields become more aware, which implies a slower oscillatory rate.

I argue that entity of you is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a 3D grid of cells, a rendering emerging from oscillating phase changes, with temporal/spatial configurations across the 3D brain.

  27: I argued somewhere, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.

  16: the transformed pattern, enlarged essentially retains an isomorphism to the original pattern, in that the cells that fire next at a higher level are representing components of a scaled up pattern, one that connects with other scaled up patterns which causes oscillators in the brain to integrate each others patterns, but also to scale down patterns, because 
  20: The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.
  24: So then oscillators are learning and recalling scaled up phase patterns, and these scales up phase patterns are the fabric of organisms internal representations, or its inner screens, because its what neurons everywhere in the brain are communicating, with pattern recognition at the synapse level scaled up to be observed as an effect on the global oscillator which is then observed by neurons the same way that the outside world is observed by neurons.

  30: I suspect that the reason we do not see light decay is because it's moving in normal time which is frozen relative to how fast time moves for us, our experience of time has a lot of harmonic oscillation between entropic states, with the mass (information) of physical space moving slower than light but transforming (decaying/emerging) faster than light.

    2: (graph, oscillat, field, decoherence, boson, observer, flavin, ATP, dissipation) The idea of a bad point is that it has no area, it doesn't oscillate, it doesn't increase or decrease in charge
    6: It suggests that self aware networks are fundamental to spacetime, not that we can't be dissipated, but that overtime we are natural to emerge from it, from the properties of vortices, oscillations, and neural network structures in physics. But also space itself which has been described as a harmonic oscillator, although I consider it to contain chaotic oscillators and resonators and all possible manner of oscillation, and that even chaotic dissipated space is only chaotic within certain boundaries that allow it to be predictable at some other scale
   12: so the idea of spacetime that doesn't oscillate is that it has no area
   14: maybe an electron or proton is that if it oscillates then it has area & time
   23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)
   47: as extropy, or the information configuration of space increases intervals of past and future time, the oscillating time intervals expand or contract space, with condensed atom/planetary space being relative to the expansion of empty spacefields around these heavy oscillations.
   55: The expansion of space is virtual or holographic meaning that it has no real area in total, no real time in total. We only march forward in time from a perspective which is splayed oscillations (positive / negative particles for example) Human perspective is from splayed space that is not in a harmonic oscillation, its in a resonating oscillation
   57: the simultaneous emergence of galaxies everywhere at the same time is like the emergence of lumps of resonating oscillators
   67: At the other end of space time marches forward relative to the expansion (dissipation) of oscillations (atoms, vortices, galaxies, stars etc)
   76: It's that the beginning of spacetime may actually have been the middle of spacetime, with the potential past and potential future exerting virtual vortex like oscillatory forces that divide a non-physical singularity into the dimensions of the spacetime field, and that harmonic oscillation balances the resonating wave like forces generated by virtual probabilities of future information configurations that the cosmos is essentially predicting through a process of cosmic natural selection
   88: they are relative to the diameter of a spherical oscillator, both its kinetic & angular momentum
   92: the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space
  128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
  179: oscillating magnetic fields, 
  180: you can affect radical pair / just radio waves, oscillating 
  182: what frequence of oscillations are you talking about? if the oscillations are too fast no effect on radical pairs
  185: so there is an effective interval of an oscillating effect

a0105z.md:
  2: (LTP, oscillat, field)
  3: The galactic filaments are related to LTP, because the synchronous oscillations between galaxies are heating the space between the galaxies, shaping the curvature of spacetime, attracting particles, creating atoms, like gas, atoms are created out of empty space, defining the higgs field, and creating the path integral formulation.

  10: oscillators are getting more complex
  16: in other words entropy is the oscillatory dissipative of complexity, so entropy is increasing overtime because oscillation configuration complexity is simultaneously increasing over time
  18: its that oscillators are causing other oscillators, nudging each other and combining, atoms, planets, people, but also dissipating at the same time, super nova, death, planetary collapse, 
  20: Earth may collapse? Because the configuration of the oscillations keeps increasing as the patterns combine to delay being evaporated away, 
  22: So the oscillating patterns are ensuring their own survival by becoming increasingly complex, they are combining to form more energy efficient spins that can survive increasingly complex environments of competiting patterns that are trying to maintain their own spin.

  3: I think Yann LeCun's presentation causes us to unintentionally think of the whole brain as a variational autoencoder. It could be that each of those roles described by Yann LeCun are filled by both individual cells, by cortical columns, and by the whole brain (taking turns in oscillating intervals). For example the glial cell could be described as a configurator cell. T-Cells & Neurons could participate in the configuration role.

a0111z.md:
  20: That creates a phase rendering in the oscillation group of neurons (that is acting like a single sensor/transmitter like a group of firelies referencing the book Sync).
  22: SO the phase changes are constrastive, and that points to how while there is for example a powerband of alpha oscillations for example, within that power band there are multiple alpha frequencies, and the contrastive differences amount to the rendering that makes up the information of your mind, allowing the self to perceive reality and at the same time to be rendered by reality.

   2: (oscillat, field, boson)
   9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  24: But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it
  30: So they are oscillating around each other in time, spinning faster, the brighter, warmer relatively speaking..

    3: # Notes on Neural Oscillatory Tomography & other topics
   16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   26: I want to imagine that the visualization makes is so that we can compare the neurons to a group of oscillating fireflies. All lighting up in quick succession. Then sharing an off interval together.
   45: I think the cosmos is a fractal of dissipative resonating oscillations inside a harmonic oscillating wave pattern, from atoms, to life, to the cosmos. We are not really even alive life is type of oscillatory pattern that emerges in certain conditions: game theory of evolution
   69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.

  119: Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networking for downloading uploading and linking the mind to other Neural Oscillatory Tomography Networks
  120: Neural Oscillatory Tomography Neural Network reconstruction, duplication, and mind extension, and mind transmission.
  122: The output of the oscillations of the brain can be used to reconstruct the entire oscillating network at a moment in time, sort of like sending in sonar to probe and record the reflections
  123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference

  134: the thalamus is not just a relay it is an oscillator observer that reflects and transmits its own reflections to different oscillating observers/communicators (sensors/transmitters at a larger scale, a scale that might include an entire cortical column or the suprechiasmatic nucleus with it's 20,000 neurons oscillating together.
  142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  145: like an oscillator overwhelming other oscillators
  146: the larger oscillator is causing dissonance which disrupts the bonds that hold the smaller oscillator
  150: my work proposes that cell assemblies exert oscillatory forces on other cell assemblies, and that memories ripple from neurons to inhibitory waves, oscillating between excite/inhibit patterns, opposite effects are part of the wave rendering the mind.
  155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

  6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

a0122z.md:
   3: (hebb, oscillat, graph, vector) I'm saying the nature of sensory experience is cycling synchronicity. Complex sensory experience is a synchronicity with several trillion oscillating parts per millisecond or something like that.
   5: I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.
  18: So my more updated view of attractors is that our memories are attractors, our long term (unconscious) memories as synaptic connections and our active (conscious) memories as the tonic brainwave oscillation, both types of memories are attractors that drive brainwave oscillations, drive changes to brainwave activity patterns, and drive decision making (brainwave oscillations, representing the state of our memory system, physically drive our actions, and our choices, through the principles of oscillation inside the brains 3D neural network architecture.

   2: (cortex, perception, oscillat, field, array, graph, dendrite, synap)
  10: So the oscillating neuron arrays with their phasic state have a process through which they observe and scale up or magnify the patterns of phasic firing neural sequences, so that groups of neurons can learn sequences together, and this allows patterns to be learned invariant of where they were originally expressed, because other neurons learned close variations on the same pattern, close variations form temporal-spatial connections to other neurons, because energy goes towards stimulation, both phasic firing neurons are stimulating the growth of dendrites in the direction of other phasic firing neurons where the energy signal is increased, just like plants growing towards the sunslight, the increased signal transmission increases the changes that neurons will grow towards the source of the transmission. So that neurons that fire together (or right after another, or with 70 milliseconds can wiretogether, but even if they don't wire together right away repeated firing over a long time establish
  12: One idea is that if neurons end up firing together, they will absorb each other, and from then onwards, unless their pattern is disrupted by other neurons, they will tend to fire together, like a repeating oscillation, so that even if they become disconnected they can maintain the appearance of cooperating as the same pattern at a distance, we see this with patterns in the left and right visual cortex that fire in synch with one another at great distances. Besides interneurons, these distance coupled oscillators are sending and receiving patterns with decoupled oscillators that have different scale and different speed, so patterns can be transferred from one oscillator to another, and a change in one distant oscillator would be felt by the other distant oscillator because the change would result in a change to the oscillators inbetween them. Every oscillator in the brain is an array that can sense the output of other oscillators in addition to tracking neural circuit firing within itself. This makes the whole brain aware of many different patterns each represented in different locations by different oscillators, sort of like a distributed graph of internal representations that make up the representations of everything you can sense and be aware of in your reality.
  17: In short the brain acts as a series of arrays, that create a series of screens, out of phase changes in oscillating networks, they rendering consciousness in the oscillations and distribute the computation of those oscillations to other arrays of neurons, spreading patterns around the brain, so the whole brain learns to see all the patterns generated by all areas of the brain, and then based on its synaptic memory it creates new representations that evolve or develop our memory-predictions in to new renderings or predictions of the future that we react to, as if presented with choices. Here is orange juice, here is coffee, which one does the brain choose? The brain renders both futures, what sipping orange juice is like, what sipping coffee is like, the brain then reacts to one of those futures, probably the future that was the most stimulating, because energy flows where it is the most stimulating. So the best future you can imagine is what you will work towards, and the worse future you can imagine is what you are pushing away from. In a sense your fears are meant to help reorient you to what you want to be focused on, which is on using your action-perception cycle.

   17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
   46: Phase & Tonic relationship, the phasic burst duration or decay rate setting forth a change in the tonic oscillation pattern is a key component of the Self Aware Networks Theory.
   58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.
   73: The tiny variations, caused by the spike timing delay of the phasic Action Potential cause tiny burstlet changes in the timing of the tonic oscillation. Part of this comes from Buszaki 2006 & Peter Tse Criterial Causation 2015

As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.
  107: # Hal 9000 & Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography
  114: Essentially each of Hal's cartridge represents a different neural array. One array reading the previous and rendering something for the next array, and so one. Then if the system oscillates at the right rate the renderings become a picture the whole brain can sense.

a0129z.md:
   2: (LTD, oscillat) I want to expand on how an oscillator is like a photocopier?
   4: because following a single neuron depolarization a larger set of neurons is inhibited all at once. So the neuron that fired magnified it's effect by inhibiting many nearby neurons (and exciting some neurons in the next set). Whether a neuron is fired or inhibited it's phase has changed relative to the normal oscillation, this causes a change that ripples through the entire brain as oscillations synchronize over time or sometimes they don't synchronize but they still affect other oscillations through signals.
   8: and so that first set of inhibited neurons is to going to oscillator together, and the second set of neurons is going to oscillate together in a step right after the first set, and these groups of oscillations are now upsetting (feels like a pun) the oscillations of the rest of the brain in a step by step sequence similar to what I outlined in the two previous paragraphs, but at the scale of oscillating groups with new phase patterns pulling on other oscillating groups in the brain, continuing to magnify the activated memories, like the cascading ripples from a stone skipped across a pond, the entire brain & body transmits signals this way, in a wave rippling manner. 
  10: The neuron firing results in an inhibition of nearby neurons, which binds those neurons together in an tonic oscillation,
  12: the tonic oscillation difference probably dissipates with time and or distance, losing its energy without losing its shape, so active memories fade, but remain somewhat consistent as they fade
  18: The neurons that are inhibited are being put into an LTD process with neurons they are no longer oscillating in sync with (because the inhibition changes their firing rate)
  20: When neurons are inhibited together they oscillate together, but they also begin de-synchronization with neurons they were previously oscillating with that were not inhibited at the same time. 
  22: how is LTD a mechanism for oscillation? The decay or removal of synaptic connections what memories that neuron is most sensitive to, and thus affect its firing potential relative to it's local neighbor of nearby connected neurons, affecting its timing and the timing of its oscillating group.
  24: Buszaki said something to the effect that the decay rate of the action potental became the gamma oscillation for a group of neurons. (need to find a quote)

   6: You are a fractal oscillating node on an oscillating branch of the cosmos which is an fractal oscillating that is actually a single oscillation from the perspective outside time and space.
   8: The perspective outside time and space is seeing the cosmos as the ever present now. One long undivided moment in which the perception of time by the simultaneous increases in extropy and entropy because the two forces are bound in that they always increase together as the oscillators evolve in complexity they dissipate entropy to the surrounding environment, and the perpendicular oscillations of positive and negative electrons (an oscillatory splay state describes the difference between positive and negative charge, fermions are space in a state of decoherence, and bosons are in a state of electrical coherence with W and Z bosons being examples of high phase states that decay quickly by resonator dissipation into the larger group of oscillation, W and Z have too much energy relative to other bosons, which they cannot maintain, its like a top that is spinning too fast, to much angular momentum.
  12: The scale of an oscillating particle such as a W boson is going to dissipate in a vaccum because the signals that it is giving off are bigger than the signals it is receiving off, it is spending its energy over time and eventually it decays because of entropy, entropy because of the math of oscillators, with particles being oscillators Bosons, or attractors for oscillations in the case of Fermions that are splayed in time, but are coherent in space. With the Fermion Condensate responsible for multiscale fermion condesate lines emerging between oscillators, each of them heating up and expanding the space between them resulting in the curvature of spacetime through a combination of multiscale soliton waves in the photonic fields with electricity charge sensation (high frequency/time), magnetism(high amplitude/spatial feel), mechanical vibrational acoustic (sound and inner voice), thermal (hot/cold data for processing hot cold sensation), and chemical (feeling energy state vitality sleep in-the-zone) and the correlations of patterns across all modalities.
  14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  18: but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,
  22: With the higher layers tracking the largest scale patterns and the lower layers tracking the smallest scale patterns, the layers act like the enlarge function on a photocopier taking each sparse firing and magnifying its area by having it inhibit the firing of a select group, which slows their oscillations relative to the larger oscilliating group, each sparse encoding is magnified by each layer of the cortex, and that results in higher level pattern learning at the top, and that is the grid cell place cell reference frame concept talked about in the book by Jeff Hawkins called A Thousand Brains
  26: The patterns are rendered and transmitted on screens (oscillator arrays (circuits layers columns and long interneuron networks and long glial networks) in every modality so that learned patterns are modality invariant and so that all the modalities are used to represent all the patterns (its different facets & properities) and its high level information configuration (the high level concept of what it is simplied, like object recognition rather semantic segmentation
  35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync
  59: ⟪ 726 characters skipped ⟫ets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.
  65: What if a 7th version of you is virtual having no specific substrate, but instead is like the pattern configuration of negative space or decoherence between the 6 modalities. So that if the orthogonal interactions, between 1. electric, 2. magnetic, 3. mechanical/acoustic, 4. thermal, 5. chemical, 6. Quantum signalling, pairing, and memory in spin states are all interacting with multi-scale oscillatory dynamics. So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales.

   6: How do two neurons that are not connected form a connection after each of them has fired? It's not that they wire together, its that synchrononous firing, or firing within some window that might be a few milliseconds causes neurons to oscillate together, it's not that they are wired together, its that the synaptic tree that connects them aligns itself so that they will fire together when they both detect a pattern that they have learned together, but this also allows an entire set of neurons to possibly be the one neuron to fire in response to a pattern that many have learned, it makes patterns invariant to any single synapse or any single neuron and any neural circuit inside a cortical column oscillator because the oscillator as oscillator as collective has learned to represent the pattern invariant to its original firing location, the pattern can be transmitted across the brain, to entrain other similar patterns, but also to vote with, correct, and fix the representations collected by other neural circuits but also add to them, like the display I described the oscillator as being had many layers, like photoshop layers, but these are layers of interlinked renderings, at different scales, representing different sections of the screen at different times depending on head position & orientation & incoming sensory data.
   8: What is the survival advantage of fireflies oscillating together?
   9: well they can become a sensor array effectively, since they are all timed the same they can all simultaneously observe through expectation when all of the others will fire because the light pattern is repetative, if one of them goes dark, because it was eaten by the tongue of a toad the entire group is aware of it instantenously and flies away rapidly from that location. If one of them finds food it begins to oscillate faster or brighter than the rest, and so they converge attracted literally by the excitement signals which are either brighter or more rapid or both.
  11: When neurons oscillate together they become a sensory array that can represent patterns in 3D and in 4D, because they represent a phase field that has memory, that can observe its own decoherence & coherence.
  13: So the array is an oscillating group of neurons, and that learns patterns that get stored in the synaptic connections and spines of each dendrite.
  15: Each layer of neurons in an oscillating group, is compressing a detected pattern into a phase change that is adding one delta of detail, like a shade of color, or a touched edge, to a complex multi-dimensional sensory representation that is akin to the 3D model created by slides in the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, except its a 4D model, playing out over time across the neocortex's oscillators, when we communicate with other people that is also

  2: (oscillat, field, synap) Oscillator level awareness
  4: Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.
  6: This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing
  8: I'm imagining a brain that is all aware of itself, absolutely everything that one senses and perceives is represented by their brain in some place, but with different oscillators, represented by different power bands, with location invariant patterns, with cross brain interneuron enabled synchronicity, neuronal emsembles can increase in their firing rate become more noticeable yet weaker, decrease in their firing rate, becoming less noticable but more powerful. So attention can shift to large brain areas that have more new activity & are more excited, meaning when you become excited some of your senses will have their receptive fields become more aware, which implies a slower oscillatory rate.

This is a really interesting book about how oscillators work but he talks a lot about sleep, the circadium clock, and the synchronized timing of neurons firing, fireflies, and mathmodels with oscillator fluid dynamics.

   2: (cascade, oscillat, field, array, decoherence)
   4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
   8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.
  15: Once oscillators fire together they merge together, they never stop firing together on their own, imagine that it takes some third oscillator to send them a knock that will cause them to oscillate differently again, and oscillators merge in random clubs
  17: ⟪ 379 characters skipped ⟫neuron also does not absorb the bad spot, the argument is that the bad spot has no area to begin with, if an absorption doesn't happen it is not taking up additional space each time it moves to a new oscillator, even if it leaves the last oscillator, because it's area is growing temporally.
  25: The patterns that are evoked in each array resonate and dissipate away back into oscillation with the greater neural oscillation that they were connected to before they fired, this oscillation dissipates the signal across all the oscillators, each one absorbing a little bit of it until they are all oscillating as one again. However the activity causes dendritic connects to grow between simultaneously exited areas

  19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.
  36: I like to think of the oscillator as an Expert Data Structure (Instead of an advanced data structure) because its creating its own paper for which it can measure incoming signals against as deviations, allowing the system to collaborate as knowledge gaining system, mapping a dimension or a movie frame of consciousness.
  38: problem with pan-psychism resonator theory is that resonators which are decaying oscillators, like vortexes while being ubiquitous at all scales of the cosmos, do not encode memories over time, they dissipate into nothing, so resonation by itself is non-informing, it does not store information in a way that allows for transaction of information patterns

  10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.
  14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.
  24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23
  64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

    8: Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
   18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   21: "We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."
   39: In my thought experiment I am taking the Taylor Series from Calculus and applying it to a 3D grid of phase changes. 3D Calculus. With each phase change that is tracked by the brain representing a different step in a Taylor series representing the information content of the rendered mind *At least the phase topology as a brain state is an attractor point for the mind's oscillations. 
   71: # "Tuning Neural Synchronization: The Role of Variable Oscillation Frequencies in Neural Circuits" 
   74: points back to the work of Steven Strogatz, György Buzsáki, and others on oscillations & sync (in physics & neurophysics)
   75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
   78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
   79: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
   80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."
   82: To go into more depth on how the physics of oscillations might manipulate information states, consider that information is not just a change in a phase pattern, but it's also a change in the synaptic pattern, and the phase patterns are not just electric, magnetic, chemical, there are also anything receptors are receptive to, such as mechanical vibrations, but the understanding the potential interactions of these phase based brain state transformations via the physics of oscillations will require some mathematical physics modeling.
   97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.
  104: One of the main differences I have from 'the cemi field theory of consciousness' is that I think of brainwave oscillation as an attractor point, but the neurons are the decoders, and without decoders the information in the brain's electromagnetic spectrum has no meaning, it's just a wave. So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.
  108: I argue that the electric field and the magnetic fields in the brain are EACH relevant as attractor points in the brainwave oscillations (of tempo-spatially distributed phase changes), and these brainwave fields serve as attractors that drive oscillatory activities such as coupling, decoupling, synchronization, desynchronization, tuning, detuning, phase precession, and oscillatory phase coherence/decoherence (and my argument is that the phase differences are information states, like short term expectations, or attractors (that serve as information configurations) for short term memory oscillations)
  110: The electric & magnetic fields, as brainwave patterns, as fields of phase changes, help maintain the oscillatory state transitions of your mind's information, meaning they represent some part of your mental expectation in this moment, and the transition to the next moment. Also while the Electromagnetic field is one thing, there are big differences between what is happening with the magnetic dipoles and what is happening with the electric dipoles, according to EEG & MEG measurements.

Now oscillating waves of ion trajectories unify by frequencies, they harmonize, we sing, and it is as if everything I am projecting as the universe is an oscillating wave of ion trajectories.
  17: Also remember that I said there is so much metal in human brains that they would not really be different from metal brains. Well what I mean is that calcium, sodium, and potassium ions pervade the structure of every neuron, and the communication channels. When the ions separate into negative and positive charges that are extreme they can cause cells to depolarize, they cause action potentials. Like a lightning strike sort of, except neurons oscillate, and they synchronize oscillating firing patterns. The big ones are called brainwaves. A wave of electromagnetic energy, that wireless triggers other brainwaves.
  31: Neurons oscillate, create electric sensory fields, that sense the world like echolocation, allowing a nervecell to feel, it registers what it feels as changes in the quantities of positive and negative ions, this is how a neuron feels before we even connect it to the rest of the network in the brain.

As it decayed it would divide into smaller oscillations, a whole quantum field of them, and they could grow, combine, and form complex structures like people, planets, stars, dust, and water.

  17: tonic oscillation in the brain fixes this elementary issue, if the sensor state is oscillating in a tonic firing pattern, then the network will notice if 2 or more perceptrons are off, their off state is tracked by the readout which is expecting (the readout is other neurons) a regularly timed oscillatory firing, but when 2 or more go missing, the entire sensor takes notice because the rate of the dissipation of energy everywhere in the oscillating group of neurons has changed.

The same process occurs with lifeless oscillators. The rotation of the moon for example is in sync with the movement of the earth. The electromagnetic fields of the earth & moon are knocking on one another, and that is enough, to even without gravitational particles, cause the orbits & the rotations of the planets to synchronize.

  23: Imagining that the neurons couple via the principles of oscillation, firing at the same time causes them to absorb each others timing, I think of the brain's oscillations as being clock like, even if one oscillation is permanently decoherent from another oscillation it is possible for their clocks to interact like gears, such that they will maintain their decoherence, but perhaps they will also share moments of coherence, such when firing does occassionally align (coherently) once in a long time before decoherence again. While writing this I am imagining two solar systems or two galaxies close enough to be affected by each other's gravitational pull, but not close enough to rip each other apart, and not close enough to merge. Another possibility could be that oscillatory alignment between two neurons that fired together is not just strengthened at the synaptic level, with synapses appearing and growing stronger to support connections inbetween those neurons, and synapses growing inbetween all the neurons inbetween those neurons.

I think the pattern is a temporal thing, consisting of temporary brain activity that links together cells for mere milliseconds in some cases, or cycles through similar branches of cells for a longer oscillation. In this case a memory can't be stored, because which parts of the brain that light up are going to be different each time, different pieces of the brain are going to be different pieces of a memory, so each time you see an apple it can be represented by different parts of the brain, each time you move your hand it can be moved by different parts of the brain.

   6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
  10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.
  12: Their (the post-synaptic group of one exit terminal) group shared a common temporal oscillation (the LTD neurotransmitter event) so they fire together, and the next row then fires together, the whole oscillator simulaneously learns many versions of the same pattern everywhere, stored in the synapses, but magnified in the vertically oscillating cortical column, and magnified horizontally across the brains interneurons between pyramid cells, plus the other highly connective brain areas. Including the corpus callosum, the parietal temporal junction, the thalamic bridges and this high level horizontal pattern might be coordinated with help from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which may also have an oscillator that is magnifying learned firing sequences. I am preferential to the idea, written about in "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins" that the cortical column is actually functionally mimicking the grid cell and place cell everywhere in the brain. That's interesting especially if this idea of consciousness being a rendering or an image that has to exist somewhere now has to include some idea of how the results of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop connects to the thalamus in way that might bridge information with the neocortex otherwise

   73: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   75: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.
   85: so you have an oscillating expectation in the inhibited neurons
   89: the way tonic firing is changed by action potentials in excitatory firing is both like a photo taken of light and it sets an oscillating expectation timer for the same event happen again
   92: this is why after playing Tetris for 5 hours you close your eyes and see tetris blocks in your eyelids, those are oscillating set expectations in your tonic wave patterns set by the action potentials that fired when you were playing tetris but optimizing your brain for that task the more you kept at it
   96: because multiple tonic oscillations are exerting the effects of collective information consideration on each other with each interval pf tonic firing
   98: so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator) 
  100: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike
  117: I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.

  3: (thalamus, oscillate, fourier) I think consciousness (binding of sensory and abstract data) is the building, decoding, and reconstruction of multi-dimensional waves like the gabor fourier wave transforms in non-linear loops (what's a nonlinear loop? haha). The vibration of persistent oscillation is a self aware hallucination because it's sensing waves even as it builds data from waves. The dual processing of building & sensing waves (fourier wave transforms for example) gives rise to interdimensional awareness on the canvas of holonomic dendritic arbors united by neuroplastic sequences of brain activity including rich clubs and thalamus activity.

  15: I'm experiencing mind alterates with cannibus as change is the large scale rotation of oscillations reacting to changes with other oscillations with oscillations pushing on each other but being unable to merge, like seat water colliding with freshwater and there being a separate of colors where you have a yellow sea up against a green sea, but they do not appear to be mixing.
  16: So you have the data from one group oscillation maintaining a certain area that has a certain maximum sides and whos borders are defined by other oscillations. Because the direction of the oscillations change depending on which neurons have fired and that is I'
  37: It would be interesting to know if the two brains could begin to get deep awareness of each other as two distinct personalities, because of the specializations that each has in the form of neural pattern presents that is the shape of an oscillation as definited by which of its 3D grid of neurons firing in this frame while the rest listened, and

  27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  30: The synaptic events can be thought of as oscillators sending a knock, a knock that nudges the oscillations of other oscillators plus or minus in their own phase pattern.

  2: (oscillat, fourier)
  3: It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.

  19: At the neuronal level you don't know anything, a neuron is an oscillator & dissipative system with a threshold for maintaining its electro-magnetic equilibrium, it has to regularly discharge a burst of energy to its surrounding environment, to offset the charged ions its receiving from other neurons that are pushing it towards its action potential event. A neuron is alternately is a resonator or decaying oscillator.

  21: but the field of space, as an electromagnetic field of oscillating phases, is going to have single particle observation disrupt spacetime itself because that particle is the time of flight from its refraction point to your mind now or in the future.
  23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.
  25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

  21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

   5: In the human brain the 'cognitive' Tensors are phase variations between synapses. Entification or unification of these vectors/tensors (in otherwords a neural network object segmentation + neural network classification = a 3D semantic segmentation process in the human brain) happens via Oscillation of Phase Variations created by signals between cells in the brain creates the 3D canvas of reality.
  15: What I am saying is that the math of the brain, like the math in a computer becomes a conscious object-segmented self-aware rendering via Neural Oscillatory Tomography. The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.
  17: But at a higher level, the oscillations of many neuronal outputs, like the outputs of many parallel instructions in a GPU, can be united, or entified, into graphical objects, that can have bodies of causation & a reality that exists in a simulated 3D environment.
  19: # Tomodeck (Imagine a Holodeck, but replace Holography with Tomography, Neural Oscillatory Tomography)
  43: My conjecture is that the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern, embodied for example by Theta Waves (or other power band frequences) represents the short term memory structure that binds with incoming sensory inputs via the principles of oscillatory physics (that could be simulated in a game engine or with webxr)
  49: The sensor detection of patterns is at the location of the dendrite, and inner display of patterns is the exit terminal transmission (perceived by the next dendrite). Patterns in the mind are learned by cell assemblies, cortical columns, stored in synaptic connections long term, exist in the tonic oscillation pattern short term, they are evoked by phase changes (correlated with phasic & high phasic action potentials & inhibited firing). 
  64: My brain is essentially comparing memorized numerical operations to predict the right answer, and the right answer is stimulating the oscillatory activity in my brain to produce the right result in terms of motor actions taken and words typed.

   7: I think that the synapses playing a tune to Orch Or would create memory sequencies stored in a chronological order from one end of the microtubule to another. I imagine pattern formation starts at the far end, going with my previous idea that memories are attractors in an oscillation component, their activity might be driving behavior when they react to incoming patterns by sending back reverbations from that same channel like a reflecter that modulates a signal by its learned memory, this reaction might cause a synaptic change event, including the loss of a synapse, the creation of a new synapse, an inhibitory state (0) for the synapse, a tonic state(1,), or a phasic firing state (2,3) which might set the decay rate of an LTD signal to its exit terminal.
  11: I think that each one of us is like the creator of his or her own universe, and we are meeting as different people because god was bored of being just a single solo entity, like the first atom that randomly emerged from spacetime oscillations between having a location and having a velocity.
  13: In one sense we can change anything about ourselves, but it is our memories of the past, combined with the data of the present that generates predictions of the future that we can remember transmit magnify and display in our oscillating minds.

   7: I have all these different neural arrays going off in my head like flashbulbs, with oscillating ripple's of excitation and inhibition that magnify memories from the exit terminal of a single neuron to the whole brain's network.
  19: The brain's oscillatory theta waves may serve as a natural back prop like mechanism for improving the accuracy of nodes, phases.
  31: Essentially this reference shows that Theta Oscillations are driving coordinated activity between neurons that are not directly connected by synaptic arrangements, supporting the theory I am putting forward.
  33: It's interesting to think about the Theta phase oscillation as being constructed by a Taylor series polynomial of inhibitory brainwave patterns, with the ability to sort of wirelessly modify patterns across the network over some area of brain tissue. This describes a mechanism for how patterns embedded in our brainwaves might drive coordinated multi-cellular activity at the single neuron level, across the brain without direct connections between activated neurons. Matching up with my other ideas about large scale oscillations driving interfaces between smaller scale neural oscillations in different hemispheres.
  34: (In my other notes I talk about the inhibitory oscillation as magnifying the neurons recalled memory in the action potential neuron to the exit terminal via inhibition. The idea being that the brainwave is the thing that is seeing your memories become activated, and its phase changes from that action potential represent your mind being changed, your mental world being updated with new information, and the brainwave's effects on your neurons at a macro scale have individual effects to the firing of single neurons, in a coordinated way, across the brain. So your mind can change the brain.)
  37: Essentially this story above about cross-attractor's is remaking the argument about oscillators affecting other oscillators in the human brain.
  41: # Quantum Teleportation via Oscillation (Did I write this down elsewhere in my notes)
  42: This is also key to the idea of why I think Quantum Teleportation works, in that I think a larger oscillation is carrying a signal between two smaller oscillations that are not directly connected.
  53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
  69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
  71: This new idea I have is about action potential path tracing (actually a better name for this is excitatory neuropathways from incoming senses), each phase interval represents a vector that is being modified like a taylor series polynomial function developing a non-linear pattern in a dynamic linear sequence. So that the waves of inhibition that follow the action potential sequence cause a next level of adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

   9: the oscillation of an atom would literally create spacetime as the oscillation is literally lengthening the amount of time it will take for the particle to complete its journey, and since the particle is a phase pattern that is defined by the amount of time it takes to finish its path a particle that has infinite oscillations would manufacture infinite amounts of spacetime stretching & warping
  11: so the atom represents a vortex in spacetime that is defining the curvature of spacetime which starts to fold over onto itself because distances in space are relative to the duration/force of oscillations. When vortices combine they create even larger vortices which creates even more spacetime

  27: Which translates to a great number of vesicle (lipid or fat sacs containing thousands of neurotransmitters to be release) 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicles transmitted in each interval (action potential firing), representing oscillation phases for four neuronal phase states: inhibition, tonic firing, excited firing, and really excited firing. This allows the neuron to store the meaning of a phase event as a charge resulting from ion build up. Each event sets an interval for the neurons clock, which is essentially counting until it fires, making it an oscillator that essentially learns patterns by changing the configuration of its synapses or having those synapses reconfigured by other neurons.

  30: I read the book Sync that all the neurons oscillate and I deduced that all the neurons  would feel every signal in some way, because they are all involved in dissipating that oscillating eneegy
  34: If we combine Hebb's idea of Neurons of cell assemblies forming links because of spatial & temporal consistent firing with the Steven Strogatz ideas about how fireflies & clocks synchronize, we can speculate that neurons wire together because they oscillate together (sync state), and they wire apart because they oscillate part (splay state), and I further speculate that the electromagnetism of the Action potential firing is stimulating the mitochondria to produce more ATP which causes new protein synthesis which is new cell growth, specifically new receptor growth, that represents a new state change in LTP & LTD, and the growth happens between cells that are firing in oscillation together. This is the same principle that causes plants to grow towards the sunlight, the stimulation of sunlight is like an oscillator interacting with the plant which is also an oscillator, the principles of oscillation's coupling explain why neurons oscillate in groups.

  4: Could it be that patterns gain dimensionality when activated & transmitted? As if a flat pattern unfolds to become a 3D pattern when synaptic activity are magnified onto an oscillating array? The neuron is like a projector because it passes its phase pattern to an entire sensory array of neurons who are combining it pattern with the patterns remembered and projected by other neurons.
  6: Multi-layer phase field pattern representation (in brain wave oscillations), tomography with dendrites, and phase changes with exit terminal branches. Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and our actions, and ourselves to help us navigate life, and respond to novel incidences. Humans are response able system, and in a sense the liability of a human being is similar to the liability that a self-driving vehicle with a self-aware network will be required to have.

  19: the oscillation of the magnetic field configuration on the brain from the brain is going to be felt by the brain as areas of increase ATP release as the mitochonria are stimulated by the flavin sensitivity to electromagnetism in the brain, so the output of neurons can change the magnetic field, and they can sense the magnetic field because they have flavins in the nerve tissue and the mitochondria flavins are in particular stimulated by electromagnetic field changes.

   5: I wonder if I could make a phone that uses quantum teleportation via oscillations, via quantum entanglement, work.
   7: Essentially the air is an oscillatory pattern for particles, and the walls are different oscillatory patterns compared to the air, but
   9: if I am thinking about something like the magnetic field of the earth as a kind of oscillating body like the air, that represents a lot of tiny oscillations that are aligned in a really big long slow magnetic wave, then I can picture how an oscillation of many small quantum parts adds up to a big oscillation in area effect, one that could transfer information between two entangled particles like a giant electrical wire inbetween them.
  11: Techically the oscillation of each particle is shifting all the other oscillations in space, but somehow it's that one particle that it's entangled with that is affected at a distance.
  13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. 
  15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.
  27: So if something is (at least temporarily) like a bad point, that means that harmonic oscillations skip over it, which is, going back to this idea:
  29: "It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. "
  31: suggests that if space has no real area, if the void of space is like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, at least temporarily, then harmonic oscillations that do exist will skip over it.

  51: its not two different fields interacting, the human awareness as a delta field, theta field, alpha field, gamma field, and beta field is being written as one single field with the same spacetime around it, bith fields are the same one oscillating vibratory field
  67: We can make a self aware network with unreal engine, we can make the system oscillate like a real brain, representing the space that's in your brain. 
  84: when frequencies interact their collective action is multiples of their components distributed over a vector field that is the representation of their combined frequency oscillation
  86: in other words the vector field of space time and the mass of space time are examples of two different spatial/temporal patterns that are the inverse of multiplying micro-frequency patterns that are multiplying when they oscillate together harmonically.
  88: So at the end of the data the length and dimensions of the spacetime array in 3D and in time are stabilized in a sense by brainwave patterns, which are also spacewave patterns. The delta/theta frequencies of observation and attention actually entrain observed space in their frequences, like oscillators entraining other oscillators. However this means that telepathy, sending patterns through space, its inevitable.

a0417z.md:
  32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.
  34: The key thought about where the observer is inside the mind, where is the person inside who is watching the brain's representations, is to think of the flow of information in the brain as a series of arrays, with each array seeing part of the picture, and the oscillating activity at different scales, from spikes to phase changes to big brainwaves and dipoles is the thing that binds together what each array in the brain is seeing as information passes through it, so you perceive what you perceive, and that includes a representation of your hands and your sense of self as the body of causation behind your hands.

   2: Hopfield argued that recurrent neural networks could have attractors or nodes that drive oscillations, causing patterns to loop. The concept of attractors is essential to my idea about how active memories encoded & developing live in a brainwave can drive human choices.
  10: John Hopfield talks about metaphors on cell assemblies. He talks about memory as a point in high dimensional space, a memory being a stable point in activity of the brain's neural network. However Hopfield is not saying that the brainwave is literally where the attractor point of the memory is stored, but the brainwave oscillation is a perfect place for storing a live state of active human memory, in each interval of time.

Right so its not just individual neurons that can get ATP rewards but also entire groups if their collective magnetic energy which is going to be coupled with the representations of many distributed patterns intersecting on some abstract cross subject concept, like a pattern that is in the clouds, matching a pattern on the ground.

It's interesting to then think of Thresholds of the Mind in terms of how your brain activity, over time can result in major brain changes, break downs and reorganization of data.
  21: however the harmonic oscillator feature of space means that oscillators will clump together, being attractors to other oscillators, or being sometimes attractors to more organized oscillator states.
  23: So the cosmos goes through the same process of natural selection that organisms go through with oscillators combining in novel ways developing increasing more complex information configurations overtime.

  6: each and every quantative variation in your volumetric 3D + 1D representation of time such as between a box and a wall, or one side of a box and another side, or one color and another, is going to be a relative phase pattern deviation from a tonic baseline oscillation, positive or negative, with amplitudinal (or combinational) properties (meaning that oscillating phases deviations or differentials can combine to create larger objects in your perception or they can decrease in their amplitude if you move farther away, or increase in relative frequency(phase) if they accelerate, and for each entity that is being tracked by your vision and each of your other senses is going to also have some specific oscillatory correlation in brain activity that is effectively maintaining the conscious representation of the properties of that phase state which represents your internal qualia and is your internal qualia.

Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors. I think Friston's argument could also be paraphrased to include the idea that our culture or our shared stories with other people also represent another timescale invariant information pattern that our brain clocks (oscillations) interface with.

  71: But brainwave entrainment with audio can also help normalize brainwave activity, so the whole brain is oscillating at the same frequency pattern.

That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

So the negative imprint of a fired cell leaves its own imprint in the theta brainwave pattern as a tiny phase change with a sparse & distributed representation, that essentially creates the engram of a hot phasic neural firing pattern which is the ecphory or the pattern that is in life memory, and the inhibited pattern that is transfered from its signal input to later areas in the brain is perhaps reduced to frequency patterns in the oscillating power bands.

At the same time its movement in space over time is the movement of a smaller wave through a larger wave, so what I am suggesting is that space as a whole is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds

   42: long range interneurons with myelinated axon c collaterals facilite temporal synchrony of all terminals (Rhythms of the Brain) The critical role in these rare long-range neurons has to do with facilitating the timing of distantly operating oscillators and the timing of firing patterns of large numbers of neurons that are not locally connected to one another. So in essence if you what you are seeing, and hearing is coming from the same source, like a dog's bark coming from what looks like an animal to you, well recalling the image and sound of a dog barking means that there is some sort of long range coordination between your visual cortex and audio cortex that is raising the sound of the dog, and the sight of the dog in your memory at the same time, which would be temporal synchronicity, and what accomplishes that (the timing of an audio memory and a visual memory) is thought to be long-range interneurons. So it can be argued that your attention across multiple sensory modalities (sight, vision, touch) is coordinated by interneurons, they are doing the work of binding diverse sensory representations together, for your attention.

  21: The organized flow of data in the brain is set up perfectly to adjust to and recognizes these changes in global brainwave activity flows, each section of the brain will detect changes to the firing rates that are resulting from oscillatory timing changes in response to brainwave activity, and eventually the brain is going to put together mental imagery of that flow, it is probably what emotions & feelings are made out of, the detection of large scale brain activity changes.

  21: And so, for that reason, I imagine that the architecture of an artificial sentient and self-aware. Neural network might consist of and narrow network. That is, that is primarily a distribution of nodes that are oscillating with the phase pattern and that phase pattern is regularly regularly interrupted with phase changes that come from this sensory inputs.
  25: But also come from basically the oscillatory dynamics of the human brain that. So so it's not just sensory inputs that will generate changes to brain state. It's also the internal dynamics of the brain, the brains physical activity, and it's especially it's more ology. And it's and it's narrow. It's, it's neurotrans.
  41: And and on top of that, representations of that are predictions or thoughts on top of the data coming in, through the sentences that are established through the feedback loops inside the brands activity patterns soilated by the oscillations of in the physics of the brain, and the narrative, the narrow transmitter mechanism and so on.
  73: Like like there's a competition between oscillatory groups, over over what sort of brain operations, get what sort of territory. And so you have this huge huge dominance that has been described by neuroscientists accuse, dominance with visual activity relative to the quantity of cortex that is devoted to processing other types of modality activity, like ought like like audio or tactiles and station.

b0004y.md:
   34: My conjecture about why LTP Long term memory can form immediately without seeing new protein synthesis is because essentially the same memory oscillates repeatedly in neural firing activity until a new neural pattern replaces it. Also that the oscillating activity helps drive & direct the growth of new synaptic changes (growth and or atrophy of spines).
   37: all of the memory consists of the tempo spatial sequence that the entire oscillating group has learned and then any of the neurons in that oscillation can detect some variant of that memory & play it back.
   43: Any of the neurons in that oscillation that have learned a variation of that pattern can be play it back that pattern.
   45: But there's going to be, I think, because the pattern was learned by all of them, but it scaled, it started scaling up from the first neuron that fired in that group of oscillating neurons before. eventually interfacing with the rest of the neurons in that oscillation, and then with the rest of the oscillating groups in the brain, but in a progressively scaled up away with distance, like the ripple from a stone tossed into a pond growing with scale as it dissipates away from the origin point of the action potential that originally fired representing the original memory at the synaptic/neuron level scaled up to the rest of the brain.
   55: This explains how a visual signal could ripple from the eyes to the thalamus to V1, V2, V3, V4 and then to the Thalamus and back in a loop, signals can ripple all over, but the concept of off-manifold coding (or oscillating sparse distributed representation) provides a viewpoint on how the whole brain could handle so many different types of sensory data flashing all over it like I am proposing (that memories ripple across the brain)
   68: Frequencey and time-based codes that had that create phase changes different  to the existing oscillation pattern.
   74: It is inevitable that one tiny neuron firing eventually changes the entire oscillation of the entire brain because that is what the physics of oscillation tells us happens if you understand the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. Every oscillation entity knocks on everything other oscillating entity if it has the physical means to do so.
   77: it changes the previous pattern that was it was repeating and then here again and that's how the brain is combining. What was previously learned with what's with? What's new is because the brain is essentially repeating and oscillation pattern that was that was the tape of the previous learnings, right?
   82: and those changes the changes to the old learning embodied in the old oscillations are how the system absorbs reality in a collective way that is tracked from both the individual scale (of a memory stored in synapses) to the collective scale (of the cortical colummn or the oscillating group) and this is the path of conscious recognition from a micro memory pattern stored in synaptic connections to a macro patterns that the whole brain is engaged with. This is the key to multi-scale information pattern learning & pattern recall.
  115: # *search for Neural Oscillatory Tomography, and also Neural Array-Projection Tomography in my notes in this repo. Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  125: ⟪ 271 characters skipped ⟫en for a novel duration which causes between 0-3 vesicle sacks to release neurotransmitters which changes the timing of the larger group of nearby inhibited neurons which magnifies that memory to the oscillating group, and then to the rest of the oscillations in the brain because eventually that oscillating groups entire phase is slightly altered, which pulls on the rest of the oscillators in the brain eventually.
  132: ⟪ 330 characters skipped ⟫thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.
  135: So there's another stage of a learned pattern that gets played after that, right? And so, there are subsequent problems and so it's like, yeah. So there's a sequence that gets played out at a higher level, which is multiple, which is, which is a sequence of multiple different oscillatory networks that are firing, and phase sequence, right?
  138: So one pattern appears in this question neurons. And this the next part of that pattern appears in another brushing, your eyes and the cycle through the brain, where basically you have neurons that are that are firing and large groups that are oscillating. Sorry that are receiving bumps in large groups. And that is triggering certain other neurons to fire.
  151: But now they're going to oscillate to a different to out of out of frequency,
  153: like that group is going to oscillate and a new frequency.

b0005y.md:
  15: Because because it's conscious perception is basically like the telescopic perception of a projection of patterns stored in synaptic connections, to oscillating groups of neurons in cortical columns (including the hippocampal as a special cortical column in a special activity loop with the entorhinal cortex & the thalamus, to the whole brain via pyramidal connections, the rich club network & the default mode network
  17: complex reality patterns by a sensor/transmitter system (or consideration/action system) of consisting specifically of oscillators in it. And certain information configuration pattern encoded in both the membrane of the dendrite and in the synaptic connections.

  104: ⟪ 281 characters skipped ⟫more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)
  166: And just so you're going to have and you're gonna be changing the whole oscillating array of patterns by by each neuron. It does fire this because that is each one is sending out. It is the sending out. It's it's a its own representation to the collective. So in a sense of the neuron is communicating its connections to the network.
  175: So, you have a piano that has represents a different neuron, that sounds different, but it could play the same pattern as the original. And so, in effect, you have messages that are that can be, they can be sort of like, stored as tempo-spatial oscillations of unique network knows that are unique because of the connections to the network.
  178: And so, the, the neuron is has expressing a note (like a piano note) to the network. That is, it's, it's learned connections and it's learned to connections are the entities that are perceiving that note, but it's in fact, but becausethe energy of signals dissipates in a cascading fashion across all of the oscillators.
  181: The, the patterns are the patterns that that each area of the brain. Learns or are essentially transmitted all over the place, transmit it to everyone. So the so it's the idea of all the fireflies if they're oscillating, they means that the the energy differences between them are basically, he basically dissipated until the fireflies are in sync again. Once they are in Sync they are acting again as a single sensor/transmitter, or a single considerator/actor. This means that a person, as the entification of harmonically oscillation cells, is a single entity, that considers information & acts, as a consequence of oscillator physics in biology that can be simulated computationally.

b0007y.md:
  9: So my conjecture in my book is is that essentially dead things can be conscious because what we're talking about is with the consciousness is so I am calling oscillating self aware networks at the moment, right? Because, because the dissipation of signals across the entire array of we could say, you know, if any of any oscillators but we could say, you know, we talked about fireflies is basically, you know, in the, in the sense of like abdominal habits, allowing all of these,

b0008y.md:
   5: Collective Sensation of oscillating sensor transmitter
  11: The brain is also a chaotic oscillator, but despite that there is a cyclic regularity of neural firing and that is the tonic brainwave pattern.
  15: The brain's chaotic & harmonic tonic oscillations open the door for the brain to be actively receptive to changes in oscillation frequencies from spiking which creates decaying or resonating oscillations that ripple across the tonic oscillators.
  19: Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)
  21: A group is basically like all the neurons that are oscillating with that oscillatory pattern but you're gonna have some groups that are going to the interacting with other groups but they're not going to synchronize.
  25: They're not they're not going to necessarily oscillate together in particular, perhaps in part because they can't, because the oscillation in one of them is too large to to be copied or absorbed by another and so maybe you have to have so oscillators have to be within a certain range in order to match each other's dissipative energy.
  33: But (incompatible oscillators) can maintain a sort of orbital relationship. It's like they could have a sort of oscillatory orbit to the point that eventually there is some temporary alignment between two otherwise incompatible oscillators. Sort of like an eclipse. A momentary alignment that doesn't last, and doesn't come around often, and is mostly out of sync.
  35: The two incompatible oscillating groups are eventually going to fire together at the same time before is pulling apart again and having completely different oscillation patterns or sequences.
  51: The idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's a very short great duration between when something that happens to one is then perceived by all the others.
  63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  67: The dissipated amount (of energy resonating from Action Potential Spikes into the tonic oscillatory fabric of the mind) is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective across the entire sensor. So it's multiplied in scale but it's basically a very consistent tempo spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away (over the entire brain & body)

b0009y.md:
   25: And that is that a sort of like in order for the world to change, you have to have at least one person actually wake up to what's happening and make that change in their mind and then that pattern will ripple across the entire world. So what it requires is actually just one person, having an aha moment and then transmitting that message to everyone else and it will spread because of oscillatory dynamics to everyone else.
   29: So literally, you can fix the world in your mind. You can look for what's wrong. You can look for who's suffering. You can care about them and you can fix the world because the patterns that will begin to emerge from, you will literally be treatment transmitted across the entire world Through the principles of oscillation.
   33: And in effectively, you can begin to know, you can be able to understand the minds of people across the world. Like you can begin. It's almost like, I guess it's, it's like a computational telepathy in a sense. And that if you can receive signals from people on the other side of the planet and you will because of the principles of oscillation eventually, you can become to understand people that you've never met.
   61: We can understand what kind of what kind of oscillation is that that's going to produce it in and we can make some, we can start to make some high level predictions as to what types of behaviors are normal for, for someone and what types of behaviors. And there's, you know, the certain amount of there's like, a lot of behavior.
   65: Classification. Right. Like, we people are already monitored by the government by their the oscillations, in their behaviors. They're sort of like, yeah. Well, what you did in the past, there's certain amount of chance you're gonna repeat it again and people with your symptoms and your attitudes, and your behaviors like you are going to, you're at risk, these types of behaviors because precisely because other people with your information configuration, you're mental information.
  186: So in the matrix movie, you had to be plugged into a computer and in order to be in the matrix but your brain is already a computer. So you're already in the matrix in your brain right? And then through through, through oscillations, through the communication and signals that come out of our mouths and come out of our fingers, you know, come out of our muscular pathways, we're communicating with the other organisms and the world around us and through that we're connected with the other organisms and so our information is like spreading everywhere because information just is like the vibrational is like this vibrate.
  190: It's like it's oscillating pattern that sort of like that flies all over the place and and it knocks oscillations and eventually if you have a neural network it's going to begin to decode those oscillations. It's going to be into sort of like become aware of the universe and, you know, I mean, I don't know.
  194: It's like, but but specifically, I am not arguing for something. Like what is the idea that the universe is conscious? No. No the universe is like a neural network and it's going to be sending information everywhere. And there's oscillations are going to go everywhere, but that's not the same thing that everything is conscious in the human sense on the human scale.
  198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  278: Like, if you are going to have like a liquid metal terminator, like every component needs to be able to function by itself and then it needs to be able to function as a swarm and have the information as a swarm to assume the the oscillation of of larger entity which is which is like it's plausible.

b0011y.md:
  52: That's so, for example, if you have a network that is like collectively recognizing something it's going to dissipate through the entire oscillatory network of the brain. But in order for that network to collectively recognize, each part of the network.
  56: When it passes through, has to, not only receive, and transmit a signal, but has to receive and modulate the signal, otherwise it's like, it would be as if it didn't contribute. As if it wasn't contributing (to the harmonic oscillation of the collective sensor) to the collective perception of the signal. (if it doesn't modulate the signal then it's like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, a point that doesn't exist as far as the sensor array goes) It's got a pass along it's own perception of the signal to the collective of signal perceivers/transmitters, it's perception of the signal is it's own modulation of that signal.

  23: Like somehow this volumetric space is calculated by different oscillating (phase) patterns in my head somehow. I'm imagining
  29: What I imagine is that my framework, that frames my personality attributes is like a physical structure (that attracts certain oscillatory patterns) and is sort of overlayed & visible on top of the world that I see. So that I could be reacting to the front path of that personality architecture, or the back half of it, or the different like curve or shape of it.

  13: I'm an entity module consisting of virtual phase patterns that exist temporarily in the oscillations of my brain.

b0036y.md:
  11: I think of the unconscious as the tonic brainwave oscillations (inhibitory waves) that results from the conscious which I think of as the high phasic firing (of action potential sequences that trigger inhibitory wave pattern changes to the tonic oscillations).

   15: https://phys.org/news/2015-05-lab-uncovers-pathway-genetic-messages.html?fbclid=IwAR12Ivi_KFIMV3DDmX0PxWjsZA_47ruArbyxQbLwaRhIVcBX0mQHHXJMsEk I’m curious to follow up on this to see if the rate of cell oscillation, or some other factor is guiding the RNA to its destination. Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.
   77: # I mean to say that human imagination is essentially gan synthesis, or procedurally generated rendered patterns from neural activity bound by brainwave oscillations.
  223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.
  225: We can say that it is a seeking to know because there's an action being performed by the physical mechanistic gears of the brain, by that I mean the literally oscillating clocks that are the neurons of the brain, and the oscillating cell assemblies, there's a mechanism being performed by the actual neural networks of the brain, that can be described as seeking (seeking information patterns, with receptors & signals between cells)
  273: It's like a lot of different oscillators coming together to make them result in the result that things happen. Much faster because these patterns are because patterns spread and they trickle outwards.

b0041y.md:
   40: But what I want to say is what a space means to you. I think we have to say it's an oscillating. Pace view that every part of hole that makes up every atom. And every photon is oscillating. Exp. It's like it is, I would say it's like the
   64: What I'm trying to get at. It's like the configuration of space is like this that there's some spaces like this that it's like magnet that is and a chaotic oscillation.
   67: Inside our harmonic oscillation, right? So it's like okay so it's like imagine that ideally space is.
  103: So the brain also stores, the they are. There's a matrix of oscillating brainwaves and they receive inputs from sensory, inputs from the world to her. Raise mounted around your sensor, raise mounted around your body. So your eyes have sensors are raising them dangly and neurons are part of the sensor arrays.
  109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.
  112: They can combine their individual sensing ability into a collective sensing abilities. So the firefly community because they all oscillate together. They basically like whenever any of them deviates from its standard oscillations that changes the face. The vet sends a knock into all of the other oscillators because the signal signal becomes off, right?
  118: Yeah. Like there's different things. Like it's now it's relaxed or now. It's taking a nap and it's like, it's all about. What is that interaction signal? That's the base change when one firefly did it from. Its standard oscillation is about by the entire collection of fireflies. They all dissipate that energy across their network, at least as far as it energy.

b0042y.md:
  13: Although there are feedback loops, so there's processing and the whole like rain does, like oscillating loops, but they're still our directions for signals. There's signal paths, right? There are signal pass for voter signals. There's a signals and there's signal paths that sort of preferred to certain kinds of oscillations like they'd observations and hippocampus or delta pathways.
  16: In the talons Delta and we only have like the sensory input oscillations might be alpha waves. Going to have my wider which higher frequency.

b0044y.md:
  46: Like there is a, there's a similarity where I have some more physical where you see like, you know, a system going through, several transfer, several transformation states and as part of a, you know, routine oscillation or it's just some sort of physical pattern happens and you say, oh wait a second.

b0047y.md:
   9: You know visual cortex is still seems to be synchronous without the the corpus callosum. I used to have oscillating. Temporal spiritual phase patterns percolating through neural circuits that our matching and the left and right hemisphere even after the corpus callosum is cut. And so I said this in and in a group of folks and said, well, that is a great point.
  45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.

b0052y.md:
  13: Wow, because see that because see the point of the wound is going to be sending a lot of signals. It's a crisis point. And that's going to be triggering a lot of other cell activity because it's a, it's a, it's both a mechanical, and a chemical and a heat based oscillatory signal.

b0053y.md:
    3: Oscillators
   33: A connection has to grow in between them and they could be too. They could be a thousand neurons apart from or, you know, it could be. It's it could be, they could be billions of neurons apart, and still form a connection that didn't exist before because they both find same because they both started oscillating.
   72: But but anyway, that's a space date. So space date is like the odd couple of oscillations. It's it's a, it's an, it's an offs. It's an oscillation possession, observation.
   78: Let's see. A space state is basically. Yeah. This alternation between to oscillation that is an alternation between toasts instead of a synchronization, but at the synchronization, my by alternation, right?
   84: Something like that. I have any to look this up, but the idea, but I'm just saying, like, well, maybe this because it's oscillating between having a location and a velocity like between a state as we have a having location would be, like,
   90: At the same time, there's a line between them or space is moving faster. Because basically spacetime is moving faster because the space time is hotter between them and air between them because they're both because they're heating it from two sides. And so the area directly between them is between two, oscillators is hotter than the, then the area that's that is not directly between two oscillators and the further you are sort of like, okay?
   93: So if you draw a line between two oxlanders and then you go to the midpoint between two oscillators and you draw line is perpendicular going up or down. Just it's a perpendicular line and so the idea is that the the further you are away from on the if you're on line that is perpendicular, when it's going up and down further, you are on that line, the greater the greater the rate is, you are away from the horizontal line that
  105: But but the what happens is that oscillators and oscillating sensor are transmitter ray which is like a column which is like a which is like oh sorry it's like a row. It's like a layer inside. A column that sensor array is going to formulated pattern that consists of neurons, a fire that also inhibited other neurons and that carves a pattern out of the tonic firing rate.
  108: So normally on the, the oscillators all fire tonically until their disturbed physically which causes some of them to become inhibited. Anyway, in any case, it creates the whole array becomes a pattern that is pursued by the next array, which receives the changes in the face pattern that are created by the first array.
  159: In space. Everything. Remembers because an oscillator encodes the memory with a change in its spin. Like, if I feel an electron spin changes that change is, is a pattern that changes in space, and so space time itself can change can store memories as changes in spin or changes in in phase like if an electron if electrons and a positron combine the common neutron, right?
  168: Horizontally. And, Planets are space. That has expanded vertically, okay? So the idea is that the the planet represents and and asked, and a group of oscillations I have become merged together and they're slowing space down and that, and the slowing of space tent of space time relative to the expansion of space means that their configuration is that space is dense and and material prayer.
  174: Yeah, and so space time review, they're dense material or sparse energy. And so, so light and photons, and electrons, and entire elect spectrum. At the particles level at this, individual particle levels that are not oscillating in atoms. They're just particles like that, that part of space time, just that it just keeps that expands and it expands relative to, because it's slower.
  192: The volume of energy, the volume of energy is big because the the volume of mass is the is the as the contraction of energy, the volume of mass is the contraction of energy, the contraction of space time into an also tory configuration. It's like, oscillating, eating other oscillations. So, the volume of space time and energy and the mass of space time.
  213: Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.
  216: But they don't have to go anywhere. In fact, they're going to, they're going to, it's going to be situations where you have oscillators essentially like attract oscillators.
  219: It's weird to think that oscillators could be 50% of space. The weird. I don't, I don't know what that makes sense. Because idea is that space, all slaves at one point. And then you have increasing extra bead and increasing entropy at the same time. And the answer, the idea was that space time goes from a state of maximum extrapy to towards maximum entropy, but it isn't really making any sense right at the beginning of space time.
  222: Why would there be a lot of order? But that, I mean, I guess ideas like yeah, so like space time was undifferentiated. So I guess that in a sense that's like that's very orderly. Like if there's only one oscillation that's very orally, that's very orderly. If it's only one oscillation and so like increasing entropies like space becomes increasingly disorderly.
  225: And so the idea is like, if everything is disorderly, that means that like instead of there being like a single pattern at defines all space time, then space time becomes divided by patterns that maximumly oscillate randomly, right? And if you have a situation, that's maximally oscillating, randomly and playing scale to, I don't know, whatever.
  240: The brain is making changes to the face field but it's collectively. Sensing that changes to the face field because oscillations, that oscillate together. I have a. The actors as an amplified array like this since together like anything, that disturbs one of them, distributes all of them. And so they they form, they can hear each other in a sense and they have this tonic expectation of firing.
  243: And so whenever firing is inhibited or excited around them, they notice, they notice that they physically notice it, and they array physically tracks a patterns, we through through reactions that ricochets through all the oscillators in the array and but the act as a single array. So they all become aware of whatever, ripples them, they all react or whatever.
  246: Ripples done. They are they're combined oscillator. Something that combined fact. And think that they're moving that they're that there ought to be there, they're essentially orbiting each other and that's that is causing space to expand in time and it's causing
  252: Then imagine that a mass is crunching. Space up. And if the fact in effect that could look like, if you push on a sheet, really hard, right? And you have basically, but if you push on a sheet between two, different spheres between two different oscillators, okay? Then then the, the line between them is relatively more sunken than the lines that are not between them, right?
  258: Oscillators warp space because they heat space because they are faster because they're hotter space. They're faster relative to slow space and that means that slow space.
  273: I mean, the further that a point in space is that is between oscillators and the points and and oh, the furthest point away from the lines between oscillators, that point is going to be this slowest. And that means that space is relatively expanded because time is really more slowly.
  315: Okay. Is that right? Okay, so since I've overlooked some things so that idea. Is that the if the oscillation is increasing in energy, then it's going to then it's going to have a positive electric field, which means it's going to
  393: He came, it's an oscillations or decaying as opposed to the oscillations increase, but relative to the observer, right? And oscillations are increasingly decaying so it's like a negative. So negative charge is like a decreasing conservation and a positive church, like an increase in oscillation, This is releasing more energy because more energy is going to put into it.
  399: So interesting thing is, so you're saying that the space is warped between stars, for example, It's worked between galaxies, It's working between planets, This were between any oscillator, right? Whether that oscillator is positive or negative space is working between them. So there's heat between them even if one's positive one, negative or even if they're both positive.
  405: Are like decaying or increasing oscillators?
  420: Having space time to it's putting a drag on space time. So it's causing space time to and be faster closer to the center of the oscillator and slow down further away from the center of the. Also the curvature space time starts from the center of any oscillator and the this the the mass of the oscillator, the combined oscillator.
  423: Warps space time around oscillator. So create space time around is later. But okay, so but in a sense, what I'm saying is that it creates a
  426: It creates the temporal temporal surface area. A temporal surface area. Means that that particles that are moving in random directions will more will be more likely to move towards a temporal surface area because it's additional directions relative to the rest of the direction. So a hot area space has a additional pass along a temporal dimension, relative to slow modern space and so you have space time as the expansion of time because of oscillations the expansion of time because of oscillations Causes the relative appearance of the expansion of space as a, as a direct consequence of the total equilibrium are positive and negative charges in the universe.
  438: The positive and negative charges are like oscillations that are increasing or decreasing orbiting is essentially possible, but
  441: A decreasing orbit. Let's see or say that increasing our decreasing because I'm trying to think they're a good reason why to negative oscillations were might repel each other, right?
  450: If a negative positive or opposite but we're opposite oscillations, right? Where is that? Because you, you're trying to think of like,
  453: You're trying to see if you can somehow describe the attraction of opposite particles and electromagneticism. In terms of planetary, in terms of the movement of plants where bodies. And I think that is just it's too much of a stretch, the idea of positive and negative oscillations, right translations, that are increasing.
  456: That sounds good, right? Isolation is there's more energy moving into the oscillation or more energy being released from the oscillation then it's gonna have a positive electromagnetic field which means it's gonna be sentence.
  519: That didn't belong to another combined. Okay, but they combined, but they're they combined. But because they were of different services by the oscillated. So, it's like a positive and negative a different phases combined, because they're, they're not compatible, they can't couple. So they also each other. So they attract
  531: Firing at the same time and because they're firing an oscillation together. They are talking to each other but if two particles are not firing at a same time, they're not enthused together which means that that they fly towards each other, but never directly add each other. And so they orbit each other and it's totally shit.
  534: Turn it down. So that's why we have. We're negative electrons. Orbiting positive neutrons is these. These, there's those oscillators like absorb each other but they can't fully absorb each other if they're not missing. They and, and they can't attract each other and thus, unless they're, but with some, but some, but a neutron has both a positive and a negative.
  576: So like to spend on the earth is and along the axis of the positive and negative poles, right? So you can also see the positive and negative as the, you can see the negative as attractors of a single oscillation because the positive charge flows into the negative charge, right?
  594: So the positive and negative charges are perpendicular. Oscillations. And that's why they attract because they're creating.
  609: It's the space theaters like the oscillation is reports but but it's for post along a different access.
  612: Right. And this case. So if it's oscillation is esophilation between a positive and a negative charge is like a space state, then their perpendicular and they attract because they're not pushing on the same space they're pushing on poor space in the poor way. So it's like so think of it as like you have Legos that that fit together a certain way, but they but otherwise they they bounce off each other, right?
  618: Tosses and I talk to other but if the oscillators are, it's offsiders or the attractors. So like one oscillator is an attractor in a larger authority, like every oscillator is an attractor and a larger obstacle and
  621: Because it's all because of some level. It's all single oscillation that's becoming increased. It's a single singular space term. That's becoming increasingly.
  684: As place they see a slave state. So if if it's a perfect LTD is like a space state because it means that the the oscillations are perfectly decoupled in space time. I mean, they're like so do couple. They're like their cannot in sync there in alternation. And so there ultimately decent.
  726: The dimensions. Establish the decided dimensional coherence is space. Time is established by the oscillation. And so if you've forced to positive charges together, they are going to they're going to repel because they're hitting each other. So they're going to have a diagnosis going to crack.
  729: But and they're gonna hide each other. So they're gonna cost us other to spend like like oscillators that are attracting each other but also repelling each other in colliding. Oscillators can collide and cottager has been or each collision is causing a change in the orientation and the spin and the angular velocity.
  741: The oscillation is combined this fighting.
  762: So they're each pushing space away from one another, right? So these things basically away from them. So, like so the particles if they're there facing each other, they're too positive orthopedic negatives. But if they're perpendicular, then that means that they are there in a space state because it's oscillation points are happening at different intervals.
  774: And his place. So this place date is the opposite of an oscillation and it means that there's the opposite of attraction happening. Okay, so the problem is that in this place they that you're describing in the brain.
  777: Saying in the brain to oscillations of fire together are going to attract are going to cause some signals each other which is going to cause growth growth to happen. But because there but there are also, but that's also going to yeah, that's going to excite each. Each each one of them to grow towards each other.
  798: Spaces, D is becoming decent and so decoherents and decoherential. Space through decoherent. Oscillations is going to cause forgetting. It's going to cause rain to forget through an ideas. The decreases space time, cosmetic coherent oscillations. And so, in principle, decoherence is like a positive integrative native, charge and two. Decoherent signals are going to attract each other.
  801: No, no, not a tractor. They're going to replace decoherence so they're going to repel each other, right? But because they're combined they're confined to the brain because of 10 segregation. There's going to be a coherence pattern between two neurons that are firing an opposite oscillations and that creates LTD but for electricity
  864: Okay, these are coherent patterns and so decoherence patterns are lines between oscillators that are that are applying ultimately and
  867: They are in a system that is bound together like integrity system or a bundle of oscillators you're going to cause decoherence among also. It is just and that's the basis of LTD, oscillators with the combo because of the line because of a decoherence line in and fixed space. And and oscillators will couple because of coherence line of basements.
  870: Some things. So alternating oscillators will create decoherent assigns and facepace in which space is moving apart and a couple of oscillators will create conversions lines and phase space. Where space is moving together and converging. And so the convergence lines emanate from particles in, they magnify between particles, so they evident from planets and and they magnified a train planets, but they was a reverse is true.
  879: Because you have two oscillators.
  885: Because it's growing towards because that's space is growing towards the oscillators and the oscillating lines between all stators and the deep, the the alternators the alternating oscillators are decoupling face, space between them because that face space is moving towards oscillators that are in the sink and it's moving away from oscillators that are that are decent.
  891: If a clump of space is the convergence of aligned oscillators.
  918: Just interesting. So it's like okay so it's almost like photons have this sort of like ability to combine oscillations temporarily which is why they're combining and the person and condensate and heating up space but
  921: Formulas are not able to combine temporary but and unable to oscillate in. So and when, okay, so what I'm saying is that they're able to say both ones are able to can occupy the same quantum state, be able to oscillate together and time because
  930: Decorate space and so they can't oscillate together.
  933: As pleasant looks like at this. All right. So think of it as positive and negative charges sending alternate, alternating oscillatory signals through space. So,
  939: If they are declared and space time between them is decoherent. So they're so they're their oscillating. Ultimately, and that means that the energy of space can be between them is like the, you know, in the quantum levels of experiment. How there's stuff there are lines that particles move towards and there's life.
  948: So, the magnetic force of a single oscillator is going to disappear over distance, which means that the beam is basically, the beam of light is being fired is basically spreading out as as the is the, as energy space. Because space, but the throwing another oscillator is going to add energy in the system between the off layers and so the space heats up between them.
  960: Because the positive charge isn't in the brain, positive oscillations are
  966: Stuff doesn't grow, but more than that stuff becomes a space because deep coherent. So stuff actually moves, is pushed apart, stuff is pushed apart between them, because the oscillations are they want. They also in in. So because it's like a positive with a negative sentence in that the the now these two points are targeted because of 10 segregated.
  972: Like a larger and one thing for the brain and one thing for? But I think it's like okay. So in a case of like a phosphones, they combined the way I'm imagining like oscillators couple and they're combining and arguing that they're combining in terms of time their oscillating in time which is increasing, which is increasingly
  981: And create lasers. And so forth is a laser a space heating up because it's oscillating in time, but

b0054y.md:
   5: So Mr. If I wrote this down before, but one idea is that I had would would be like the cascade of a raise if you could imagine them being like each, like like if you like imagine that that the if you okay let's hear indoors. And you're looking at the walls and imagine that the walls are rendered by some of your cortical, oscillators, right?
  14: And then somehow they get this like the oscillator loop of the entering all epitomic and Dominic that loop is going to be informed by the sensory data from every corridor of the brain. And so that could be like a conversionist point or like that. Okay? That goes back to the old theory.
  23: I mean, it's during it does, does modulate signals, okay? So modulation means that it is interfacing with signals and it is observing and transmitting signals. It is an oscillating unit that's observing and translating. And I was thinking about, and it's interesting because, you know, there's all sorts of like, you know, it's it's essentially how under there's a recent study about how the human brains are dramatically different from animal brains and that there's a sparcity of sodium receptors which compared to what's an animals.
  47: Oh yeah. Okay so 30 minus sodium. So if there's fewer sodium channels than portionally, the human is a lot more territory and when you and inhibitory. And so, inhibitory neurons are far more valuable for complex, problem solving, and then excitatory networks. So like the good evening think of the heart is like just a pure exciting story network, it just beats an a regular oscillation and never changes its oscillation.
  50: But what happens when you get is when you inhibit the networks oscillation, you create a cascade that you could no with the the most simple in the simplest possible case. If you just do one inhibition of a network, you've created a second pattern, right? What if there's just one known as inhibited?

b0055y.md:
    2: Oscillators (audio) 
   33: But they do merge, you know, in a sense, like, I think that if you have two electrons that are have the same phase that they can merge, but they merge. And in a way that they begin to oscillate each other in time because of the same phase and if you're into my same ideas, like okay, so, if you have a neutron and a positron, and electrons together, they can't merge because they have different phases.
   78: Then there's an equal chance. It's gonna go to every possible direction. But in the direction of space, that's excited because it's moving faster and moving through time because it's like layered with multiple particles, like instant condensate, there are basically more chances for the particle to move in the direction of hot space or oscillating space or faster space or expanding time.
   99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  108: And basically, these particle collisions are oscillations merging with oscillations and these are oscillations in space time. And as the oscillations merge, they effectively combine or they act as one, which would means that anything and encounters that that body of oscillators ripples through the entire body of oscillators. So they act as a combined sensor and information configuration sensor, but also a transmitter and then transmission between one oscillator and another causes space to bend between them but also causes lines to form between them.
  111: These lines are particle lines but they can taken out. They can their particle lines in the in the direction of each of the points and the points are made out of oscillators. And but then all the points that are not in between two of the oscillators, a two of the great oscillators are going to be doing opposite thing.
  114: Where there's an increase in in traffic. That is not moving towards the oscillators and this is like in the double stud experiment. How there are lots of bands of really brightly lit where partners like, lots of bands were particles landed because the configuration space was such that they had a probability of landing closer to to certain points.
  120: They kind of represent like vert like vertical lines between oscillators, right? And inside, you're going to have like strobed. You're going to have stroke lines, basically that that emerge from each OS later like a commercial planet. So the planet so a planet like Earth is going to have stroke lines that are vertical lines where it's pulling together vertical particle traffic, but counterbalance, but that is going to create a counterbalance of push with horizontal particle traffic that's in between these vertical lines.
  123: And so in between these vertical lines, all the energies going to be going to the lines in a way from these dark spots and so you're going to you're going to see basically in a situation where there's a where there is a sufficiently stronger tractor such as a, an oscillating planet.
  132: And so the elevators like this force is shooting up beneath. You like some particles are being pushed on your underneath your feet doing pushed upwards, right? And I'm in. And so I'm basically saying that that the force of the oscillations is creating the gravitational force. That feels like an elevator or particles being pulled down as if they're being pushed force.
  135: So in the double set experiment, you're actually firing photons. You're firing photons. And so there's force, where coming from the photon, emitter and that force, it's coming from the photonometer. That's fine. Firing the, the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an oscillating and oscillating mask the same way that an elevator is going to be equivalent to to gravity on earth.
  138: And so that is going that the the double set experiment itself is interfering with the experiment because as it fires like photons it is basically is basically creating gravitational field that is warping space time and such a way that it's creating like the same sort of vertical lines that an oscillator would create but creating them from a being, right?
  144: So it is really interesting how basically, how every oscillator every oscillator is configuration, is based on his interactions with everything else and everything in the universe is an oscillator. So let's say that we're we have to put the observer in a in the room and the double set experiment.
  150: It's going, it's gonna some of the oscillators are gonna fire, and they're gonna cause lots of inhibitions in the right now. So only a small volume, small parts of the right. Argon are gonna react? I don't, I mean, the whole right is gonna react, but it's gonna react, like, where you have small parts are gonna fire in each moment and they're gonna inhibit the rest of it.
  159: And then we have the, you know, the but the basic principle is that they have a receptive field and the receptive field is also an oscillator and so you have, okay. So, let's say that you have the force of light is creating gravitational force in your eye, as you're human, body is human body.
  162: And in the point of your observation, when you observe something that also has an oscillatory force because it's like, it's like your whole body and brain are like, all right, combining and configuration space. And so there is a I sort of space-time warping happening between and observation which is which is a pattern that's being encoded somewhere and and and the The powerful beam of light is being deemed through the double set experiment.

b0056y.md:
   5: So different different chambers. It's different piano sequences. That's not right. It's um different cameras, different piano, sequences, no, no, no different. Chambers different different cameras and your piano sequences. I was making an argument about different chambers different piano, sequences, okay? So different, oscillators different oscillators would have different would represent a different features that are being considered.
  35: So it could be an oscillatory sequence, that represents some pattern that your brain is tracking. Yeah. This this pattern will be. Well, we'll have a pathway that that basically gets that circulate into into brain if it's a relevant pattern.
  44: The the transmit, their excess energy to other oscillations, right? It's like there's this, there's this global network where or every array is connected is connected to it every other race in some way. Like it's like the pattern of connections actually changes constantly. I synopsis grow and between very active.

b0063y.md:
  11: The answer, you know and the landmark the sensory inputs integrate and there's an awesome there's an oscillation there that represents the a certain level of focus of the sensory input signal setter they're in a loop. So this is loop between the thalamus and the the internal cortex and hippocampus and that loop is piping in the springing, the imp that the sensor you can put areas in looping them together.

b0064y.md:
   2: Oscillator (audio)
  17: So you know the argument is that you know one race is another and that every oscillator is an array that's seeing patterns from other race. Okay. So far so good. But the difference is between the shape and the size and the position of oscillators is an and also the frequencies that are running across exiters like that has to do with like the lens that's applied to the data as well as the in addition to, you know like the sensory attorney.
  38: The lens of focus is based upon which oscillator is fine where the oscillator is happy. It is how what? It's connected to and you can have all the boss letters. Working together has chaos and they could be chaotic. Oscillators that could be like just aligning once in a while but being disaligned for the rest of the time like they could be alternating between cohesion, having having like firing at the same time once in a while and then going out very long time without firing together I could be just like but the appetite is that even if they're chaotically firing like eventually, they're gonna fire once at the same time eventually even if they're not gonna continue bars at the same time.
  41: So it's like in a way they're continuing to oscillate just not necessarily together and some of them will oscillate you know, in this place. They whether like, the alternate one fires, any other like I guess, like, a beat, spent across two drums to, in the dead side. So the idea is that is that executive decisions aren't being made in the prefrontal cortex.

b0065y.md:
   4: Prefrontal Neurons Pattern Oscillator Cortex (audio)
  43: So differences come in and it disappears the differences across the entire array because of the, the principles of oscillations. The same way the same sort of principles that that caused bugs to oscillate together. Lightbox Austin together in the same principles that cause to pendulums in the same room to become in sync.
  46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

b0066y.md:
  17: So but it's just like, you know, it's just like, you know, at some point there's so much math to do that. It's really convenient for to be able to have the computer do math. So I messed up, I described this incorrectly, I'm a try again. He said, an oscillator is a cosine to cosine t and oscillator is a cosine to.

b0067y.md:
   21: And when that's interrupted by an inhibited bump (inhibitory phase signal), or by an excited bump (phasic burst signal), then that's going to cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation. That eventually balances out, it eventually gets absorbed (or the energy of the action potential is dissipated across the inhibited neuron cell assembly) and then they also oscillating in synchronization again. Normally again and So in that sense you could think of like the group oscillation the group, oscillating activities of fireflies.
   34: You can also think of the oscillating group of neurons as sort of like allowing the emergence of higher level receptive (dendrite)/inceptive field (exit terminal), that is like a shared computation. It allows it allows the bugs to basically have collective mind that is not really a mind, so much as it's a collective sensor that's aware of things that can pass information to each of them and so, each of them can help create this sort of collective sensor.
   55: That's the key distinction: The reason that machines can be conscious is that the the nature of the oscillation is taking a bunch of separate parts but allowing them to affect one another like a bunch of tuning forks or a bunch of drums that can that when you hit one drum, all the other star vibrating, right?
   59: And so what you have normally is like they're all sort of like (oscillating) like one of them will hit and then and then all sort of like react to that one that got hit, right? There's this reaction that happens in the brain. What happens is one gets hit.
  123: I would say the firing sequences are going to oscillate they're gonna cycle and what's going to set those firings sequences are incoming sensory patterns, novel incoming sensory patterns.
  127: You're going to have novel incoming sensory patterns that are going to oscillate in the brain. They're going to oscillate several times before they (dissipate into the tonic oscillation) because there basically they're firing faster than the rest of the neurons and the rest of the neurons are going to slow them down. They're going to slow them down slowly like because because the rest of the neurons are firing at a slower rate so that neuron is like gradually calmed down (with each interval or cycle of oscillation.)
  131: It's like a decaying oscillator or a resonator is another word for it. So it's like a drum that is like you hit the drum and the sound is loud, like, boom. But then it like it's it's not just boom, but it's like, it's like boom and then there's a smaller boom, because it oscillates around.
  135: But in a sense it's energy is being drained by the rest of the oscillating group of cells. I say in a sense because the other cells are passing signals to & from it. Those other signals are going to bring it back into sync with the rest of the oscillation because that's what oscillators do.
  139: Whether it's like they're living or dead oscillators will dissipate their energy across other neurons (oscillators).
  141: An oscillating neuron is going to like repeat it's signal, but if it doesn't. so if there's like a high phasic signal, like I recognize a pattern that's going to fire, right?
  169: They're going to sort of cease to exist. But what happens though is that the short-term oscillations. They're going to change this synaptic connections. They're going to cause synaptic connections to grow towards them, and they're going to grow towards other neurons that fired fast fast.
  182: oscillation rate, but also as a periodic strange attractor or a chaotic strange attractor, that that oscillates because it oscillates faster in that, and in a particular direction, it oscillates faster
  196: I'm arguing that the path of plant grown between two oscillators is in part determined by time dilation, or that time dilation is essentially changing the odds of which direction a particle moves in randomly. Which is why plants grow towards the sun and why neurons that fire grow towards other neurons that fire. In both cases quantum time dilation is changing the shape of space from a particle's perspective.
  206: Imagin that the whole layer of cells is oscillating together (or perhaps a layer of cells can be defined as those cells that are oscillating together at some interval within a larger oscillating group that is oscillating in a time step before or after the layer we are talking about). The hole layer is oscillating together and one of them fires and a lot of them are inhibited by the one that fires okay? Imagine it's one bright light with a lot of darkness and I say 
  210: its like a lot of darkness because usually the oscillator has this one pattern that they all light up at the same time. They're all dark at the same time and now this pattern has (via the action potential) an interference pattern. They're not an oscillation anymore. Now there's a slowdown in some of them, and there's a speed up in a smaller number of them, but it's interesting.
  224: Oh shit. This is really good. Okay, let's try to go over this one more time. So you have so one neuron fires and it inhibits a whole bunch of others. Because there is a tonic (oscillating brainwave) field, all of those neurons are coordinated together.
  240: be out of sync with a cell that fired. So in some sense that means that if you look at the oscillating group, as a whole, neurons that were wired together before will become sort of like... 
  256: # "Splay States in a Ring of Coupled Oscillators: From Local to Global Coupling"
  257: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220403160_Splay_States_in_a_Ring_of_Coupled_Oscillators_From_Local_to_Global_Coupling
  259: The splay state means the oscillations are now on opposite intervals. The area between two oscillations in a splay state is going to be anti-attractive for (synaptic or plant) growth, or relative to the areas between oscillators in sync.
  261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  293: ⟪ 284 characters skipped ⟫ime moving at 30fps. As we speed up or slow down time we increase or decrease the chances that particles move in any particular direction, thus teasing out a particle trajectory (between synchronized oscillators), which is like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just it's just the direction with higher spacetime frame rates.
  309: that memory fades away. It gets like etched away over time, with each passing oscillation where it's not being used, but since so many cells are involved with learning patterns (it's the oscillating group of cells that is learning the patterns) it can take a really long time to really get rid of an old memory, and it will be much easier for the brain to strengthen that memory again if it existed at least once in the network of the brain, because it is going to leave a trace in the brain's network even after the process of LTD.
  317: This is a pattern that I think is going to resonate again a few times, because it resonates a few times there's time to stimulate the growth of cells, with a continual pattern of synchronous signals oscillating over time. Imagine that synaptic spine growth between cells is actually connections growing between patterns, connecting small patterns into larger patterns. It's like they can grow a little with interval of each oscillation, and they need/use another stimulus/another signal to grow little more and then another stimulus to grow a little more.
  321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.
  345: Mental Patterns in the brain are being created by the total representation of the sparse distributed representation in the oscillating cell group (The neural network turned sparse representation in spreadsheet which gave me an idea). Imagine the cell assembly as a spreadsheet, and the excited areas, and the inhibited areas are like marks on the spreadsheet, or lit pixels on a screen (that the next array of cells will read)
  347: So the sparse distribute (spreadsheet ;) ) representation in the oscillating cell assembly (reference to Donald Hebb's Cell Assembly (in pictures) is not just what fired but it's also what was inhibited.
  400: Because the whole brain is oscillating, so they come back again and they peak and then they fade out again, right? The brain is a little bit like a robot in a loop, but the loop changes just a little bit every time. The strange loop I am describining is consciousness.
  412: Like human being is just literally a bunch of particles that are reacting to physics. Even beings literally just a bunch of (quantum) particles that are reacting to physics. That's what I'll say. This allows the entire oscillation to represent a unique pattern code that represents the synaptic arrangement of one neuron.
  430: (Rephrased: The above paragraph describes how the oscillating cell assembling has light and dark areas, light areas are the fired neurons, dark areas magnify the neuron that fired with a larger pattern that represents some part of the exit terminal on the inhibited nearby neurons, the inhibited area is detected as a phase change from the tonic oscillation pattern, so both the inhibited areas and the excited areas paint the picture of what is happening for the next array of neurons to see)

  20: phase variances pass between cells, but they oscillate between excitation & inhibition across the brain.
  26: Somewhere, maybe the TPJ Tempo Parietal Junction, there's this transmitted convergence of rippling wave signals what you are touching, what you are seeing, what you are hearing. This convergence of signals is going to represent the aspects of your sensory input as tempo-spatial patterns in different oscillators that are all talking to each other simultaneously.

b0073y.md:
  113: And and so that's in that. And that sense, patterns, roll across the brain, all over the brain. If there's face changes and it because every time the phase, it's just like, you know, when like think about a chemical phase, when like a chemical phase is like in the water like like something is is transmitted from one oscillating molecule and then the next one receives that transmission and renders it fresh for the next one after that.
  144: in this matter of sensory, cortex and some of the versions of the lighter are going to be in the the audio cortex and they'll be lots of different versions of this pattern that just get like repeated across different parts of the cortex. And the basically, they it's like in and, you know, you have in an oscillator like a cortical column oscillator.

b0074y.md:
  112: That's just synapses changing synaptic connections changing. But but those are those, this is the micro patterns. But there's there's magic scale patterns and macroscale patterns and so all every level, every scale of pattern from small scale to large scale is, is in locks. They're in lockstep in some sense, like, even the chaotic oscillators are in our court.

b0075y.md:
  67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  85: Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.
  89: that happen end up defining the fabric of consciousness that makes up your experience of reality that you are seeing when you look around, when you look at a fence, a sidewalk, a brick wall, a tree, or at a car, everything you see, and every direction in which you see it, is rendered from the phase variations in the oscillating networks of your brain, which each neural array or oscillating group seeing what the previous group rendered. The oscillations carry the material, the paint, the representations of light, sound, touch, and feeling that make up all the things you know & see, all of those are your internal qualia representations.
  93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
  95: All of those representations are learned patterns. Everything, you perceive is a learned pattern that arrays of cells learned (and passed to other arrays of cells (arrays or layers or synchronously oscillating groups of cells)). One array of cells created and then projected a representation of it's learned pattern (Memory Prediction) to other cells. Each subsequent group of neural arrays shows it's representation of what it sees to the next layer of cells and that next layer of cells makes a representation of what the previous layer represented and so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.

b0077y.md:
   43: The thalamus has an oscillator. It is aware of what's going on in the rest of the brain. In the, in the neocortex, it every part of the brain is aware of every part of the brain, because every part of the brain consists of oscillators and different hierarchical arrangements that are transmitting patterns with other oscillators.
   49: It's receiving from another oscillator in its own way. And so from its perspective, the pattern is going to be slightly different. It's going to represent the pattern from its perspective, which might be enter in the smatter sensor. Cortex might be a much more of a textual pattern so it receives the same pattern from that.
   73: So eventually and just like galaxies growing filaments towards other galaxies, right? So the galaxy is oscillating in space and that's reverberating across space. So that all of space is forming connections between galaxies. So, in a sense, space is transmitting patterns to from one planet to another, for example, with light.
   76: So, the light just like with with fireflies. If fireflies, share light, that causes them to all enter into a common oscillation because with oscillators they are sharing each. Oscillator is, is not, is, is sending the difference of the energy that absorbed from the, from the other oscillators, when it fires so it's sending.
  178: That is that is one of the simulations of the cosmos that is one of the instances of the cosmos. That's what I'm saying because we are oscillators. We're creating a space around ourselves electromagnetically. Like we're shaping space. The planet is shaping space, but the planet is an oscillator. Every atom is shaping space, the dimension of space exists because of oscillators and oscillators are when they combine, when authors combine they fuse, they become like, infused object.
  181: They they are in effect acting as if they refuse to object, when they start oscillating together. So when oscillators combine and start awesome together and large groups, they exert a multiplied, force space. Expands much more when oscillators are multiplying together. They are they're almost pushing each other apart, right?
  193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.
  211: You could have basically, basically, you have all those groups of waves are patterns, being transmitted between oscillators that are sensitive to those patterns and therefore data can be collected and constructed in all four of those ways. And that is those are like there's like we have force of war networks happening in the brain.

   5: Self Aware Network Oscillations (audio)
  20: But you would still be you and you will still be you because your brain would maintain its own independent oscillations. The oscillations that create the representations of your perspective, for your point of view, through your senses. So, one of the things we could do to make sure that you stay grounded in you is to give you and basically,
  26: And so we can move about inside this supermind and we're rendering a version of reality. It's basically our perspective within the supermind but we're also sort of creating our own space as oscillators. And we're creating our own our own version of reality from the beginning at through the process of our minds, rendering, creating a computer program to represent reality to ourselves.

b0081y.md:
  139: # A neuron is made distinct by its connections, so when it fires a neuron's distinct pattern activates its connections, the oscillating group of neurons that are connected become aware of the memory that exists as the unique configuration of synaptic connections embodied by that neuron.
  265: The idea is that the atom, and every oscillator in the universe, including everybody of oscillators, which includes the human body.
  267: The human body, as a body of oscillators, is a dissipative system of oscillating dissipative systems.
  269: Every cell is a dissipative oscillator, a dissipative system that is oscillating.
  271: Every person is a dissipative system that's oscillating.
  275: My argument is that every oscillator like a planet is creating space, it's creating the warping of space time around itself.
  277: That space time is relative to oscillators at all scales from planets to atoms to galaxies that the quantity of space time emerges from, or expands from the atom.
  281: And so my argument is not only we do we have a simulation of the universe, that we are creating from the beginning, but in a sense also, as oscillators we are creating space time, and it's as if every oscillator that ever existed across spacetime is also contributing to creating spacetime every bird, every human being, every fish is in effect, creating a node of space time.
  287: And what happens when we interact with other oscillators we're visiting, itś like each person is a strange attractor in chaos theory or in the Lorenz equation the stranger attractor that is creating a node of spacetime that can interact with other nodes of spacetime.
  480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts

b0083y.md:
  5: I was talking about the different kinds of signals that braincells detect, consider (consideration is a physical process determined by synaptic connections, sensitivity, and thresholds set by the cell or by nearby cells or by the oscillating network of cells in that nuclei cluster and it relates to sensitivity and thresholds varying by numbers of receptors, the state of the cell, other thresholds such as the quantity of ions inside or outside the dendrite, the cells charge displacement etc), and transmit, that includes chemical waves (phase changes), mechanical waves (phase changes), electric waves (phase changes), magnetic waves (phase changes) 

b0084y.md:
  33: Like like oscillators like oscillating pendulum, like pendulum pendulums, like pendulums and oscillation in the same room in close proximity, like eventually becoming in sync with each other's oscillation because they're giving each other a little knocks. They're dissipating. The difference between them. They're dissipating. The difference between them, so they all be good.
  36: They'll enter into a common oscillation and it's basically like they're distributing there energy and it causes them to fire and eventually to fire at the end at the same time. It's like the elimination of free energy and and you could describe it like that. I'm not sure if that's correct, but So yeah, in the neural layers podcast, season one episode three.
  63: And, and inhibitory signaling, I guess. Would also cost more food or more ATP, more energy because you have to a site. So yeah, they'd be like assigning circuits to do inhibitory signaling to to, but it's interesting that the the rapid signaling, if the rapid signaling is actually driving growth through sort of, through the principles of oscillation of then, or through, or I guess through, you know, also magnetism or electromagnetism,

b0085y.md:
   87: Type of isolation called, I mean a type of oscillation pattern that causes synchronization and when when you have a DC organization when you so that would be long-term potentiation when nerds physically wire together. After, after the spines grow but long-term depression means that the the physical connection between those neurons breaks apart.
   90: And you could categorize that as a as a display state or an anti-phase state. So basically that is like, you know, the space date would be an oscillatory state, where the synchronization between two signals instead of being closest together is now. The farthest apart. And so, his playstate would work disassociate two neurons that had previously linked together.
  102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.
  108: Yeah, I guess it's just an oscillatory decoupling.
  243: But if they're taught but they're if they're tonic, then they're growth is going to be weak because the activity rate of growth is going to be lower and a literal sense but maybe stronger in terms of bonding to its community but slower to bond with with noons that are oscillating at higher phase rates.
  378: So, they're all, they're all acting as a single receiver, a single sensor array because they're representations are alliance temporarily, they can all relate to. What one another is detecting. It's a combined detector, and the combined detector, which is an oscillator is going to be receiving the patterns, and then creating its own output immediately, which is in the own set of patterns.
  384: By it's own brain. As a as the brain, the brain would function all the us because oscillators can receive patterns from other oscillators the brain functions as a sort of pattern detector and pattern transmitter that were patterns, are fused together and detectors, are fused together, and then detectors and, and, and transmitters, and it's about detectives being used together.
  387: I mean like when they're oscillating together, I I wonder if the boast Einstein condensate principal and it depends on like a laser, like a lasers. If lasers a flight is combined together, it becomes a laser, right? If you get late to oscillate together, It uses together.

b0087y.md:
   5: Oscillator Memory Pings
   8: I suspect that the oscillation kind of in and in the brain of the power band, like our power band and it might form something like a both Einstein condensate. But regardless of whether it does or doesn't, it's some, it's operating as a single band perceptive band affairs, feel that can see And observer inside the man or the woman or the person.
  20: So long-term oscillating memories
  32: Effect that oscillator and update the update. The, the memory weights that oscillator and if it happens enough times, then,
  35: The memory that keeps oscillating because of the synaptic changes conversions. With the new memory that also is oscillating at a different time of day and in a way that affects the similar area and causes long-term awesome letter change there. But memories are essentially, the replay of memory is essentially.
  47: So previous memories will create a tractors for their own recurrence because the whole thing is an oscillator. So, they'll just create a curve over time of shaping that they're likely heard of the timing of their firing, the reshaping, the timing of the network.

b0092y.md:
   72: They're their movements are not as smooth and so maybe it has maybe it's a the oscillatory value of the Sort of cerebellum cerebellum is like a magnetic weight. Wait, that helps you balance. Maybe it's like in a I don't know, I don't know. But if it's not it's like okay it's like well you know what's interesting is when you come when you have lots of neurons that are have coordinated synchrony, that's really good for moving muscle.
  139: So, so cyclic, brain activity. We're an information, oscillates through circuits. And that incorporates new information from the world, like that is where consciousness emergence. And I think five is, is is a useful measurement for measuring, the gentle resolution of consciousness. But I think that any organism with brain or a piece of brain or like an organide tiny piece of brain, that's in a learning feedback, loop is going to gain some some sort of self-awareness.
  256: Charting through the treading through the, the, the bed of the array of the oscillating field, oscillating, phase field trading the patterns through it. And So so that's why. So that's how I connect. Yeah. Like bootism and sprout dynamics and Ken Wilbur, but also Douglas hosted lyric and then and then I used that sort of say to Drake it argument that, you know, that integrated information, there is undifferentiated between the resolution of the textures in your consciousness and it and your consciousness off.
  268: What makes us human like what makes our minds human? Like is the temporal spatial frequency of the oscillations of these patterns.
  271: Of the oscillations of these matrices of patterns. This is temple space for frequency. So you could have the I should say, more than that, it's the temple spatial frequency of the of this circuit that interlaces different sets of of patterns together.

b0093y.md:
   17: So locked in patients, you know, and locked in patients, like how can we help to raise patients? Who, you know, even people who've been diagnosed as brain dead and potentially are brought back with with the knowledge of how consciousness is really working. And you know, I'm since so what I'm suggesting is is that if repair can be done to whatever is inhibiting, the global brain activity and the oscillatory behavior of networks can be, could be stimulated to you back to activity again, then patience to have varying degrees of disability because of impaired.
   25: So, neurons and the nature of the have these oysters oscillating networks might might might yield some, some innovative treatments. I hope with, you know, we could get creative with combining AI with VR and AR and other biosensors. In order to create new clients, communication pathways for people who have varying degrees impaired of impaired functionality.
   97: But it's just like but what is like how does the because you know you with it with knowing how oscillations work we can argue that two neurons that the fire together are gonna the increasingly likely to fire together again. Simply put the fact that their oscillatory clocks last at least at least at one point because if they're close enough in time or space course or scale similarity or you know pattern similarity I guess across the space times.
  101: And so it's possible that they have become linked through the that's even through the literal oscillation or the function or the indirect oscillation. These sort of like absorb each others. Oscillation they're oscillating is one unit. Why are there filaments and spines and synapses growing between them to like even if they're like benefits?
  117: Yes. Okay so yeah so I didn't. Okay so I'm recording. So they're fine. So they're firing at a phasic break so this is their firing much faster than the rest of the oscillation so they are both the source of where, where energy is going. So in a sense and but the other thing is that, you know, what else is true?

b0095y ctpr.txt:
  5: Favoring suggest that realization. Is that differentials correlated? That is an electromagnetic phase change. That is cracked by dendrites inflation. And repeating is the temporal oscillation provides the ability, the ability for the brain to integrate patterns together. Similar to neurophytes innovation and integrating unstructured sets of data from the heart.

b0096y ctpr.txt:
   9: These buttons are interface like as if they were all sort of the same field and that is a competition, the multi-layers of rendering across space and across time and across different scales. And the bra is oscillators and tends, instantly denting tensions. A good tangent is I love that scene in the movie Blade Runner 2049 when he when he had.
  17: And so they're interlacing. But they're also when they fire together, they they continue oscillating together because oscillations sort of like absorb or eat other oscillations. And so you have two different oscillating neurons. If they fire at the same time, then they start oscillating and they keep firing. If that means, like they're voltages, both reach the same thing.

b0097y.md:
   25: And and as far as how is interpreted by the six actions and the six branches of its external. And so, you know, if there's a coincidence of inputs have been dried and the next column that means that multiple cells have fired to each contribute, their own piece of the pattern together like a watercolor it gets combined, you know, when neurons fire together they start oscillating together which you know it's it's been suggested that it that there on fire so good.
   29: I think it's more like the they oscillate together and then they reach equilibrium with a with their oscillating with a larger oscillating group eventually. Unless there are new perturbations coming in from the incoming senses that continue to causing new network activity. In addition, the, you know, in the morning when people wake up the brain, gets the neural activity going with like brand.
   81: Electric dipoles are causing the current running between your electrodes to, to oscillate at different frequencies. And so then we can capture that as a numerical value that represents that voltage and then you know convert that into some sort of like computer program like we'd what we did with there was a project that I call that I I was it was a project that I called the narrow hacker project and it involved bringing EEG into web VR that back before was called web XR and that was that was back in 2018 and I was leading a group of folks and noise bridge just about every week on Friday.
  129: And then you combine it has the, it has the configuration of of the configuration properties of the network basically, sort of sort of like comping together like like many examples of the game of life or you have oscillations forming between the neurons that fired together in time or together in space or or in a coincident pattern across scales.

    3: Photocopier Oscillator Neurons Graph
   25: And but I primarily see, I primarily see the the well I mean the learning mechanism is is fact or learning system, but it has multiple scales of processing, they positive. So I imagine that, you know. So basically, like what I have is a hypothesis for how synapses are related to human memory, both short-term and long-term but also how oscillations?
   35: Where the neuron, it wasn't. It wasn't it. Kind of wasn't until I was reading the book snap by, I mean sink book sync. I that mathematician that I sort of like he mentioned, he's talking about oscillators, right? So also there's this book called rhythms of the brain by and major scientists measure the major influencer sign, a neuroscientist and Giorgio Brusaki.
   37: And he, he's talking about the, the rhythms or the oscillations of the brain. And then this book started, this book sink to have more about oscillations after reading the talk about because he didn't like he started to go and that but he didn't go into super death and how authors work and this book Saint does which is very eliminating.
   39: And but they mentioned that, you know, the the idea he mentioned that in the context of like there, he says they were trying to figure out sort of like the paradox. They're trying to prove that the that that a bad spot which is like if you start, if you start the, the oscillators, if your group of random austers, in one of them has a bad bad spot.
   43: Just that kicks the other neurons and the the group of neurons is not end up in oscillation with each other. So that, I mean that could happen. Actually, if you have, you know, a neuron, that's just too far apart in terms of it's it's it's, it's awesometory properties. Like maybe it's a really big neuron and it just doesn't, it just takes too long to come to an isolation and so nothing can sync with it.
   45: But the the idea of like so I guess. But it's, it's like, well, you so you can only consider something that is part of the awesome. The part of the potential oscillating unit is all the, the number of neurons that actually could belong to that oscillating unit or something like that, which again, it doesn't, it doesn't like it.
   53: And and eventually they all they all like just they you know like like as if it was is this oscillator was just like water in a cup. Eventually they all sort of flatten out with the same surface. It's no more perpetration. It's pertubations on the surface of the water anymore.
   55: No more sloshing around of liquid. All of the neurons are firing and sink. A really close to being sink like within, you know, milliseconds of each other, right? And and and and even even the you know that that's presuming that they're not too different from. When we went from one another and not too far apart, they can exert this kind of sort of oscillatory influence and this is this is the same basic principles of life through our thought to apply to biological oscillators and not and non-biological oscillators alike.
   57: I mean from what was described in the book I I'm thinking maybe there's there's actually not a lot of study on biological oscillators in terms of like you know what unique properties. They might have that a physical oscillator doesn't have, there's lots of interesting ideas, but but the keep it, but.
   63: And so that so it's like there's a new set of neurosod oscillator that doesn't include whichever known. Has that bad point at any given point in time and I don't know. I think I'm still it's like it's so confusing and so abstract that I'm not like, I'm not 100% sure that I'm understanding this correct.
   69: I was like, what is like what do you mean if photocopier function is an oscillator like, like a photocopier like and but not just photocopy, but in a large, it enlargement function isn't making an image bigger. I thought this video was saying, and it's not and apparently this not what he was saying, but it was such a good idea, but he was saying something.
   91: Then the idea that there's a photocopier enlargement function associated with an oscillation, which is hand flooding, and the in eye sort of like, you know, in thinking about this book, think about exactly book and think it also about this book sink was that, you know, that the oscillating group of the whole neural oscillator is not going to oscillate at the same time because you have first of all, if you have a bunch of neurons that are going off and sending signals to the extra terminal that's going to cause the set of the of its external to become inhibited.
  107: Things scales ideas. I mean you're gonna need another, another explanation I guess, but so I at the moment I'm like I'm in favor of the idea that I the oscillator has behaves like like the enlargement function on the photocopier for another set of cells to watch a movie and internal movie.
  109: And and the whole brain, basically oscillates, like the oscillatory patterns of the whole brain. The brainwave patterns, they act as a sort of central decentralized observer network and that is observing with the face state of the brain and at as a as you like almost like a computer rendered or neural network rendered experience of reality when literally, there's like four dimensional renderings of where sounds are coming from that are get associated with visual renderings and hearing renderings and all sorts of lakes you know sensory rendering of sustainers together but the you know different.

b0099y ctpr.txt:
  16: It's going to capture basically, the relationships between those low level details and and then it will it will activate those level low level details and a sequence that plays out in and the oscillator that's giving you the perception giving the organism, the perception of of reality perception of seeing hearing smelling tasting and seeing reality basically as the the playback of patterns rendered in in the the brains oscillations which makes really like a lot of sense, right?

    3: Simcity Mushrooms Oscillations Pattern Brain
   26: If you imagine that you are basically experiencing, like when you look around in reality, that you're experiencing a compounded pattern, that is lots of different patterns that your brain is individually rendering are vibrating, oscillating, patterns that are harmonically unifying to create your whole experience.
   30: I would say these are like oscillations that have been imprinted with neural patterns, but these are decoherence patterns, decoherent phase patterns, inside the oscillations normal sync.
   42: I could look around and I was able to see through buildings. Buildings in the distance became transparent to me, (I wasn't actually seeing through the buildings, it was a really interesting illusion) and I felt like I could see the matrix (as depicted in the film The Matrix) like, I could see how the city conceptually was a computer program, defined by moving code, a city that consisted of oscillating information patterns.
   82: One Neuron might say, "well, that thing is faster than this? and now this is faster than that" like a root distinction in time & space. And that distinction, you know, if that distinction is persistent in both time in space, in an oscillating neural circuit, a pattern that is like a vibration in a circuit. It can be noticed by itself. In a neural circuit a pattern distinction is disturbing or is activating or it is innervating or oscillating. It's a phase changing change that neurons notice and beget.
  101: So this image was like 3D space was being compressed into a flat 2D circle and so that is kind of interesting because I'm like well you know what? If the synapse, right, that's encoding. It's capturing, you know something. What if that represents the 2D circle, right? And so when that expands the oscillator now represents the 3D volume, right?
  105: So something is going from like a two-dimensional representation to like a three-dimensional representation in the oscillator. I mean it's really a 4 dimensional representation in the brain's oscillators. It really helps for the brain to have many different chaotic oscillators to maintain independent oscillations. Multi-tasked patterns represented by independent oscillations would be useful if you need to track multiple objects in your environment. Such as tracking a car that's traveling really fast or, you know, you're tracking different people and an environment. If you basically had the ability to assign different people to different oscillators. If your brain did that automatically.
  109: And it would sort of just track them sort of like independent of where your head is positioned like you just sort of like starts to start to temper. A temporary memory that tracks the people around you. As you're walking around, looking around and encodes them in the oscillators, then you're sort of like, I'm just temporarily right?
  111: *(This is one of those ideas that does not describe my current thinking that well. I don't imagine that a synapse carries a 360 picture frame from a movie, which is almost what it sounds like I am describing. No. However the neuron, in relationship to its oscillating group of neurons, its network, is capable of rendering a simple pattern variation, a change in phase. A single neuron is a sensor and a transmitter capable of rendering a phase change, and detecting a phase change (via the process described as "Memory-Prediction" also known as Predictive Coding. So a circuit of such neurons, two, three or more might observe the distinctions made by itself & or other neurons. In a neural circuit, with oscillating or temporally looping activity, a self-aware observer might emerge, or computational observation might happen.)
  115: And maybe it's out of your field of view, you might forget its there. You as the pattern in the oscillator might fade out. The pattern of the other person, that was being represented by another oscillator might get a new pattern, that oscillator might now represent a new pattern that is now more important to the brain in that moment.
  119: And so you could have different patterns in different oscillators that can cycle through having different patterns and the thing is they're essentially transmitting the patterns that they're containing to the entire brain. So you can have oscillating patterns for the room being broadcast all over the brain while the patterns representing specific things in that room, like tables, chairs, your phone, your cup, these things might also be patterns that are each represented by a different oscillating group of cells, perhaps by a micro cortical column. This would enable your brain to multitask pattern rendering, and to sort of render patterns in transparent layers, just activating what you are looking at when you are looking at it. So the organism has the experience of reality, but it's just a sequence of graphically rendered concepts based on a tomographically constructed map of reality which is the assembling of coincidence detections by neurons, that are transmitting phase changes that create the components for coincidence detections by other neurons.
  129: However like all the small oscillators (neurons & neural circuits) interact with the big groups of oscillators in the brain, because the vibrations, the electric & chemical signals, all of the physics between cells cause all the oscillators to interact, so they can really maintain long distance synchronization patterns without direct connections because the oscillators grind on each other like the gears of a clock, when one gear moves, it moves the other gears, when one oscillators, it moves the other oscillators. That is the key reason the brain is sensitive to itself, or sensing itself, it's because of oscillatory physics.
  139: If you had two oscillating phase patterns that each being repeated by one of those pyramidal cells.
  144: And so if we ignore the neurons and just conceptualize their oscillating activity as producing phase patterns. We can now contemplate temporal & spatial syncing phase patterns as entities in virtual space that can interact, this is your mind.
  154: imagine that these two patterns are synchronized, without being directly connected, they are synchronized temporally, and they are synchronized because of common interactions with larger oscillations that sometimes connect the two oscillating patterns together.
  156: Patterns once fired get scaled up via inhibition signaling, i.e. they depress other neurons, they temporarily depress larger sets of neurons and that helps the brain to scale up the fired pattern into ever larger oscillators that ripple across the brain.
  160: Patterns across the brain don't have to be directly connected with interneurons as long as they are connected by the global oscillator pattern, that this to say remotely synchronized patterns might have a common attractor that only exists virtually (or once in a while during the oscillation of a time period (day, week, month, year, decade, century). 
  162: When patterns fire their signal gets magnified, by the global oscillatory brain pattern, or the global neocortex, brain pattern, that oscillates through all the cortical columns and is coordinated by the thalamus and intern neurons in the default mode network.
  164: ⟪ 712 characters skipped ⟫ttractors that require some energy threshold for existence that isn’t met, and so the energy dissipating from being below the threshold of that attractor’s existence has some triggering effect on the oscillating system.
  182: 0.02 hz to 600 Hertz is your phase field. That's what your neurons are detecting & changing (sensing, considering, modifying, and transmitting). That is the light inside the mind's eye, the light that is appearing in your brain's neural oscillators as the neurons broadcasts, the patterns that are being recognized to your neural oscillators. Your mind is rendered frequencies (brainwaves) encoded in oscillating groups of cell assemblies (like cortical columns, neural circuits, edge communities, neural sensory arrays) and then your neural-oscillators see the world, predict the future, and react to the predicted future. Your brain predicts the future of its own actions, but the brain also predicts the future of other people's actions, and you use this process to predict & render to yourself the future, the environmental consequences of your actions in the environment.
  186: And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.

  27: And and these new tropics are interfacing with the with the oscillations of of your mind. And in a way that is, you know, there are what they're with the hundred year effect of, you know, a person taking entropics isn't as well known yet because people are, you know, I guess, I guess everyone in the world is a guinea pig with dependent coming on the and in some went in some ways because there's there are not right?
  47: But yeah, so it's it is interesting. It's sort of like, you know, I'm arguing basically that that that patterns are not just invariant temporary insurance, basically, but they're in variant in scale because of this magnification of patterns. And this, it's the magnification that is also like you could think of, as divergence money when it goes from the neuron level to to the screen of the oscillation level, as it depends, the virgins.
  49: And then each of the neurons that were that is part of that oscillation is just it's firing in that. Also, in that oscillation is sort of participating in the collective group activity of sort of representing that pattern because they are, they were all firing at the same time by because that pattern the pattern of incoming signal was just sort of like stoked a disruption to their normal cycle.
  57: A bunch of them now. Get excited, right? And a bunch of them now, get depressed. Right. So now their surface is responding to the to the print. It's like the it's like the surface of the oscillation is now has negative edges and it has positive edges. The negative edges are the inhibitions and the positive edges are the excitations and that canvas is now.

    3: Neurons Oscillation
    5: Stein. Condensation is an oscillation when a bunch of atoms.
    7: And oscillator sync and sink. So the idea that the probability cloud that the probability cloud of an atom is like an oscillator is a little bit like an oscillator.
    9: And a sense that like the both Einstein condensate. It's like if you have many, many items that are all oscillating as one and if they don't, I'm just like, so would I just started to imagine was like, what? If what, if what if a particle was like many microparticles, right?
   11: Like what if it was like, innocence, like a matrix of particles all sort of like oscillating together, but honestly together, in a way that would cause the like one part of one part of that oscillator to light up at a time. When you say well, that's like the that's where the particle is but but it really seems like it's the particles location is all over the place because that is just like one possible face state for that space so represented.
   21: So yeah, like that's like that's gonna make sense. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. So, I'm imagining an oscillator as like, like, as like imagine that you are.
   27: But eventually it'll become very spilled as long as, you know, don't move. And so, that's what I think of, in terms of like, what is kind of like, why, you know, also tourist states like a move. I'm sorry. Why also store? Why? Why neuront, what? Why neurons eventually moved towards being an oscillatory state where there is because as a reaction to the action potential, it's like the action potential is just is a drop in the ocean and the rest of the neurons are absorbing and redistributing that way everywhere until it runs out of energy.
   31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
   33: Those are there's a brain waves, right? And they don't and and they're reflective of the collection action of the collective action of neurons that are oscillating together. So I am arguing that those brain waves are containing basically. It's the oscillation phase changes are containing. The sort of like, those are the screens.
   51: So, we've got three different oscillators and they have three random initial voltages and they each, you know, collect a little bit of voltage each round and they get moved up. And then so, they each reach a threshold and they fire when they fire, they kick the other two, which means in addition to the voltage, they're getting each round, they get an additional amount of voltage.
   53: And the idea is that this keeps happening over and over again where where you know, one neuron will fire, it will kick the other two and eventually to get to the point where all three of them fire at the same time. So eventually all the oscillators end up firing in sync.
   57: If they're giving like, if they're each giving like one each turn to the other two, every time they fire eventually, they all have the same amount if this just happens along enough for a long enough time. And in that sense like you can send signals to an oscillator but anything you send it like what happens eventually if you stop sending signals soon oscillator is that they all eventually oscillate together, right?
   59: And I just becomes like an array. I sent her right like the, the entire oscillate oscillating group of neurons becomes like, a sensor array that can remember its own activations, because that certified creates it creates cascading reactions. All right? And, and the cascading reactions that happen are the memories of that of that they're human member.
   63: But right at the same time that entire oscillation, right? That is something that is observed at an even higher level, right? It's patent. What I'm saying is that they're there are other oscillators who can interpret the output of that.
   65: Of that one oscillator. Like that's that's when we're going from like you know to the pyramid cell that now collects the internal and that connects to another portable column. All right? So, the idea is that the the output of one oscillator. So, the oscillator magnifies the the pattern that and if you look at this book called sink and chapter 2, it's really great.
   67: I mean, share something, each oscillator is distributing. It's extra energy, each time it's like dissipating. Each one is dissipating, the energy and the collective work of all dissipating. Energy is going to even out the the amount of energy at each has the entire system is going to even out the energy.
   69: So that's why oscillation happens, equilibrium happens. Okay? So what I just imagine was the that basically, the neuron is Just so so oscillator synchronized because they're basically dissipating energy. They're taking a lot of energy that one of them receives just and each. One is like saying, okay, well, I need to dissipate this energy because a charge has built up.
   95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to Facebook burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
   97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
  105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  125: Your it's something. Oh, sounds like you're just pitting information if that makes sense. You're dissipating information. And so if one firefly is patterned stops working like either like that, firefly becomes inhibited then maybe like that it has been eaten by like a frog or something in the whole. Also a oscillation is disturbed and it's like it's I mean maybe that means it flies away really fast like if there's a swarm and they're just hanging out all of a sudden like one of them disappears, they're all gonna notice it because they were all expecting to receive a signal and exactly the same time and they and they didn't.
  127: So it's like wow something is different. The entire oscillation nurses, the pattern. And then, yeah, cuz that that creates a disturbance in the forest basically, and then, at the same time you we have this situation where maybe one of them finds food, but now they all know it because that one that one, it bursts faster and that, that it burst out of sync and that caught that's gonna cost us.
  129: It now has to dissipate that extra energy into the oscillator, so it has extra energy. So nothing giveaway. Some of those energy by beaming beaming it out and that triggers the other get a bugs to receive that signal and that causes them to release their energy. And this, in this point, this is the functional expression of energy.
  147: Deposit neurons set fires together oscillate together. So each each oscillator is going to add a geometric effect. This is from chapter sync. So, large bundle of neurons oscillating is going to have like a like a geometric pattern of normous complexity that's going to represent. It's it's collective of observation power, graphs or resolution the larger, the oscillator.
  151: And so like when I think of the global oscillation of the brain, you know like basically like thanks to the interns and the philanthropic bridges and corpus closeum and the other major connective areas, the temporal parietal function. And so on that, there are, you know, weren't this area, and broke his area.
  155: That it's, it's or sending, you know. Basically, having one oscillator, not the other two off layers and it the example of three oscillators like, you know, each oscillator like fills up with electricity and then fires and it distributes its energy to the other, to the other, and to go to and then eventually like they all they all like, it's like imagine that he's like imagine there's a point of energy that's moving from one oscillator to another and you know, eventually they all end up firing at exactly the same time but what happens is when two of them fire at the same time they become in sync with each other and so you know, at some point the dealt but they all become and think at the same time like you have like all three of them will like.
  161: It's even if that point moves around as long as it's never absorbed anywhere because it's a bad point, it's as if that point doesn't exist, it's as if it's part of the architecture that the other points are moving around, and that's why the system will still reach oscillation. It's why bad points.
  167: Positive at each, at each point when the point moves it it's a little bit more, a little bit of it is absorbed. So like a point of the point eventually gets to zero because it's been completely absorbed by the, by the whole oscillator. So it eventually reaches it's low number, when it's basically, it's energy, has been divided evenly among all oscillators, and that's sort of the point in, which they've all sort of like eaten, and they've all received energy, right?
  173: So it difficult energy, this running environment and what it's doing then is passing on energy to another group of neurons. But that but it's information is being magnified by that oscillation it's encoding of pattern in the whole oscillator because all of the the receiving neurons are receiving. You know, it's causing it's causing cascades of energy releases in neurons.
  175: So they're there's a, there's a physical tracking physical reaction, that is cascading throughout the, the oscillator that eventually reaches equilibrium. But but, but the equilibrium is sort of tilted, just a tiny amount, right? And you that happens enough times. And eventually with the equilibrium space changes right in those phase changes, then are going to be tracked by the default mode network.
  187: And the, this might trigger, it should trigger an eventual oscillation but it triggers the oscillation of the of the network in in stages because what happens is it's it's only an effect like the downstream field. Effect of a neuron actions actions potentials. Only in effect, the select group of downstream neurons.
  189: So only I selected LAX group in the oscillator will be inhibited but that that it magnifies that one neurons pattern because that group is now sort of like out of oscillation for around with the rest of the neural circuit in terms of like they are be synchronized and one sense from the rest of the oscillation.
  243: And but, by the same thing is, is that, that's true. I think, for the oscillator, being able to learn in variant patterns because I think that the membrane of the synapse also has to be able to learn in variant patterns because if you have a synapse, that is sort of inactivated, when you get a pattern that similar to approximately large pattern, it is possible that you got a difference to ask could fire instead as possible and different synopsis fire instead.
  271: So they so the inhibition process has a process taking all those inhibited neurons in DC, synchronizing them from the rest of the group simultaneously. So any like synchronizations they had before are now sort of like temporary at least temporarily DC synchronized and that that of course is going to that's also going to affect the tonic oscillator because the tonic off because because in the tonic oscillation could not, you've changed all night, you've changed a small oscillation, you've moved to small oscillation out of sync with the global oscillation pattern, all right?
  273: And so the principles of oscillators interaction of differentials of the interactions of oscillators the same to say now, wait a second. Now, these two oscillators have to resolve each other and to come back and sync with each other. And that process is going to eventually if that process happens enough, the the global phase data of the global oscillator, once the two ones to two different, oscillators are remarged is going to be altered.
  275: And in that sense that is basically like also it's like imagine oscillator is past is is as a as a point passing between different nodes. And each time it passes to a different node. It gets absorbed by a little bit until until eventually there's no more energy to pass around because all the neurons are.
  279: And so eventually the energy is just evenly distributed everywhere and they're all firing at the same time but the but the fact that the so the action of inhibiting a group of neurons now makes that now makes those those neurons slower in terms of their phase relative to the global oscillator.
  281: So the global oscillator now has to combine with the group of neurons that are moving slower, that is going to cause the the total oscillation to the decrease and an amount that is sort of adjusting sort of like balancing out the increase of one of one. So let's just say that, you know, the action potential fires.
  285: And so if neurons, if the whole group is also getting slower than what happens is, all the rest of the neurons and then oscillation have more energy to give relatively speaking. Their charge has increased in that to relative to that, that their phase charge is increased relative to the phase charge of that inhibited group, right?
  287: So that inhibit group is not passing anything on to the next group. And so that is like a bunch of neurons who's clocks have been slowed. So they're oscillations have been slowed because they didn't receive something. And so what you have, if you have a bunch of stuff that becomes inhibited, all of a sudden, as you've a bunch of clocks that gets loaded and they get slowed and reaction to something that was moving faster.
  293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  295: And it's time in the timing of his firing unless a lot of unless. Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be because the oscillation is just dissipating. The energy from the activation and but they're still like more entered but still like with every when the neuron fires like that is pulling in energy if it does because downstream rounds are like take a break.
  305: Not to the rest of the network, to the rest of the oscillator. Did that my so that might?
  307: Yeah, very friends. Should they actually the oscillator could could relative to the relative to the brain. The rest of the oscillator could be in a situation where it's chart, is total charges. Exactly the same or increase in. Yes. So, I'm okay. So this is when I need to get clear about, I'm wondering.
  313: By the charge concentration is changing. So so the charge in certain other patterns, relative that the patterns that have inhibited, those other patterns are increasing without increasing, that's total charge of the oscillators. The total charge of the oscillator, then can stay at the same sort of at the same, the charge, can't the total charge.
  323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  333: So that's like at that point that group of inhibited neurons is not at like they're just slowed down relative to the rest of oscillation but eventually that group is going to cause the rest of the oscillator to pass their phase, to pass their phases around. So and until you know so basically like the slowed down neurons are going to.
  335: It's like they it's like when you so when an offset or pass passes phase around ideas phases, like a box, that gets a job a little bit, it gets passed by neurons, it gets passed by oscillators that have more to neurons that have less. And each time each of the neurons, that receives something from what is being, what's being passed to it?
  343: Like because they're just like because they all they're all like, receiving, like the same amount of energy at the same time, eventually, like like they're balances, like they're voltages, all become an alignment eventually because they keep just distributing the energy to dissipate it and until it gets like evenly absorbed by the whole oscillator.
  345: And then they all, then, they're all another timing is all aligned, and not in the and they are as an oscillator. They are a sensor array that's waiting for for more and more energy to come into the oscillator from, from from the neuron is going to spike next.

b0104y.md:
    8: But but you know the come there's another idea, there's there's there's another idea emerging here. It's just that like if they were both also nice oscillations that were in sync, they became in, they synchronized to each other. So they're both oscillating in the same sort of like they the same also toy pattern and that's in and that's what the entanglement did is it gave is they both took on the same oscillatory pattern like a unique oscillatory pattern that only the two of them knew.
   12: And so if you are now like observing one of the two patterns and so you know that the other one is changing, what I'm suggesting is that that global sort of like spacetime has changed in a global way that the, at the remote pattern can detect, which informs it that the oscillation that is basically the, the oscillation that it was synchronized to has basically is, that's an oscillation with the global pattern and if the global pattern changes that's going to affect both of those oscillations, right?
   16: And so the stretching of one particle changes global space time and that causes a change in the other particle. And so, so the teleportation is in entanglement could be described as big could could be. Also described as, basically, two patterns that are in sync and two other, two oscillations.
   20: Now, because the other pattern existed basically in oscillation to space both oscillation success to in references based on, so the disruption of one disrupts the disrupts the other because it's like it's like a universal relationship that's been changed. What that makes sense? Or it's like, yeah, it's like they're both.
   30: And because they're the same size, they're producing a result at the same time, results. Same time. So they're in oscillation sync, okay? Because they met but now let's say they move far apart, right? So now therefore apart but they're but they're oscillation is but the oscillation
   40: But the larger oscillations effect larger oscillation.
   42: Accelerations. The fact small oscillations.
   48: So if there's a change, there is a change and the small oscillation
   50: Hit is magnified by the large oscillation.
   54: Okay, so that means that, that communication can travel scales. So, let's go to another page, and I'm say, basically that command occasion can travel cross scale from one small oscillation to a large one to another scholar.
   62: Okay, so that's part. So if we make self-aware networks with, and they basically can interface with the world, the way human beings interface with each other and they were they will be effectively oscillating in a functional way with the rest of the universe. And that will change the oscillations of the rest of the universe, right?
   70: You know, with with the ability to change the the the density and gravitational effects of space, by changing the the oscillations and materials, you know. Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting. And, you know, like if we understand basically how to warp space time, I'm just like, you know, like you think of the terms of warp drive, right?
   74: Attach the you order your list to ideas with the arguments you're making and then attach the replicas. So, maybe the debt, maybe the dances and most complex oscillator is going to exert the most attractive influence. And so if you turn that into like, functionally speaking, maybe the against the dances and most
   76: Influential oscillator is in a functional, functional oscillator. So that means that the it's great a function, I said it doesn't necessarily have and and obvious rhythm have one moment in time but it's it's there might be a rhythm across large scale, larger scale of time in large scale to space.
   78: Imagine if you have few oscillators that are synchronized but you separate them but they learn to detect each other remotely because they have the same because they sort of like they can recognize that the same auto also tour a pattern when it's whenever it's transmitted to the global oscillation because it has a distinct signature, right?
   80: Like so if an obviously if an oscillation is capable of learning patterns, then it will recognize even its own pattern when as like well specifically no. I mean, specifically, that's what it would and in a, in a neuro oscillation is the, the bigger oscillation would have the pattern characteristics that that synapse can recognize, right?
   82: So, let's see. That's the somehow it's it's got a course, there's a correspondence with great because between the the pattern that is being magnified. There is a learned relationship between the pattern that's being magnified by the global oscillator and the and correlating entangled microsolations, right? So long as and and so I'm just like okay so if the pattern of one let's just say that you're okay between the pattern the pattern on the left and the pattern on the right, okay?
   96: And that that is because that patent because that pattern is is also, you know, consistent of your last of your prior learned pattern, representations, that that correlate with that pattern. So it's like every so it's like, if you see, if you come back and see that plant again, is that plant has a certain oscillatory pattern in your mind certain, asteroids, configuration, or configuration of oscillators.
   98: And and what happens is, you see the plant again and someone has like added if you see it like one day and you come back the next day and someone has has made it look like a Christmas tree, right? So now you have the previous oscillation being magnified to the global oscillation, which then finds the oscillation of the plant that, that, that didn't have.
  100: It didn't look like a Christmas tree and it didn't have ornaments on it Christmas ornaments and it compares the two, right? So your model of the plant from four when you learned it without the Christmas ornaments existed as a combination of oscillations tracked. But that's tracked in by the solution apps by listening to pattern recognition system, okay?
  104: The particular oscillation, is that previously belonged to that plant? When it didn't when it wasn't, when it didn't have Christmas tree ornaments and a combines that with the plant now that it has persistence. So the plants representations. So now, so now we can take out the plant. It has Christmas tree ordinance on it.
  110: But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.
  116: So, each type of interval, right? And and these intervals. Have they have some integral characteristics that can diet the in the memory of those in the association of, it's not just a memory of the characteristics that would be stored in the synapse, but it's the association of different oscillations.
  118: That's being stored in that synaptic pattern, which is why when you get a new pattern that's tracked by your synapses, it's necessary for the previously learned patterns that your oscillators have learned to be, to be able to react those to those new patterns, and then their reactions sort of cause the pattern to magnify in your mind from the microscope to the measles scale to the macroscale so that you can pay attention to so that you can pay attention.
  128: And that, that friction ultimately was a higher oscillator. That guided my behavior in the right direction but I needed to process in order to help navigate me. I guess I needed to process some pollution that the local idiots that I didn't want to talk to just happened to be conveniently blocking the path that I wanted to go down and recently thought I wanted to go down.
  140: You know, like anyway, guys, so imagine that that the, that the narrow network is going to oscillate through every button combination until that imprisoned score Like playing the same game over and over again and trying different things. Each time until you get it right, all right, so
  166: They, they end up like doing things, like trying to pull other products into themselves to talk about other people's products. People so start developing products on their own and in a bigger company, to try to suck them up, like, oh, okay, well, I don't want this new company to start competing with me because then it's gonna get big, there, become a bigger oscillator.
  194: And then you're bringing it taking the pattern of your retina and it's remembering that pattern. And that pattern is being magnified. Through through oscillate is meant being magnified by oscillations to other oscillations. And so it's being transmitted all over your brain. And the different parts of your brain are learning your incoming patterns and different ways and they're in the different parts of your brain are.
  202: That's a, that's not, it's not in all trees. It's that gonna be likely for but it's that's potential outcome. Some trees get turned into the paper where it's been done before, but the idea is that your mind is sort of like organizing it's patterns by by configure. Basically, the patterns are our learning the configurations of oscillators and when you get more angles, you get more configurations of oscillators with those configurations converge.
  230: Chances are going to trigger the same. We're going to trigger the same oscillation. But anyway, so that oscillation combined has a larger effect.
  232: And in terms of creating, like basically the likelihood that a pattern will move towards that oscillation is is 50% instead of 1/3. So that, although that oscillation has better chances of being a collider along, the lane that it travels. And so, if you have the convergence of lanes, as facilitated by an oscillator, the traffic lanes, then the chances that of a vertical of a vertical collision in between that oscillation point.
  236: It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.
  238: On space farther, they get away from the oscillator because they're fanning out. That's not something fans out. The distance between the different fans is broadening and so that like defines the curvature of space but also the patterns that are moving for horizontal, have they continue to have a chance of moving downward, more more often.
  242: For the, the particle graph, the particle field Part of a field itself is going to exert drag. Because every point in that field is it's travel is being manipulated by the oscillating points in space and it's resulting in the appearance of the curvature of space time. But really it is we thought of as a warping in the trajectory of the universe of a particles warping in the trajectory of particles.
  246: Converging at different points and different oscillators. So they so the Saturday and oscillator the sun is just increasing the chances that we moved towards the sun, that the particles that make up everything, the towards the sun and there increasing the but there's also the horizontal movement of earth so that it remains the horizontal movement remains a continuing possibility for those particles as well.

    6: But so essentially, the oscillation is scaling up a small pattern to become a large pattern and the scaling at process means that that small pattern. Now, dominates a larger space, larger area, and now it now, it affects more reasons of the brain. That is that is a that it becomes what the brain is focused on it becomes a focused pattern.
    8: It's a it's the physical manifestation of focusing is when a small pattern becomes the larger pattern in the attention scheme of the brain, when a pattern scales it from being from the neuron level to the neural circuit level to the column to the cortical column oscillator, to to the default network like like each time.
   24: You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.
   32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.
   34: Yeah, so that's interesting. It's like, you could be depth by something. I changing its by changing the oscillation patterns of the molecule. So, if you disrupt, the oscillations of a set of molecules, you would identify them, you know, that would be like But at the same time, if you, if you cause the, if you enter, if you could, if you could somehow and train the odds of the, the molecule of the material, to, to oscillate together, then you would densify.
   38: Synchronized oscillations. And it expands with these synchronized oscillations. So and that's DC synchronized, oscillations are faster and move faster or no. No, the synchronized oscillation is removed.
   44: But yeah. So the idea is the, when the brain is focusing on something, it is selecting some small scale patterns, it's okay. Small scale set of memories that are represented by synaptic configuration, and it's magnifying them through oscillations and multiple scales. The also, the focus for oscillation is sort of like that is, which internal representation is the center of your focus.
  110: This is a focus now. They're also that's for their oscillatory activity is attracting them, you know. And in the same way they're gravity works my end in terms of like it's if you're creating a lot of signals, lot of synchronized signals and then that's going to work space time.
  112: So so once you have the brain making patterns and remembering patterns, then you can you have feature representations and as we established the patterns, get scaled up into oscillations. So we have magnifying patterns to the brain, can focus patterns, it can they can and those patterns can now stimulate other patterns because they're affecting more areas of the brain simultaneously.
  114: And so patterns are getting connected to other patterns. And so now we have thanks to oscillations. We have synchronization activity, that it happening in the brain that can't we can be triggered. Thanks to also things to interns or but also just like the result of like it can be initialized via internaries but isn't, but internet is not necessarily needed anymore because the the brain can maintain long distance synchronizations.
  116: Because the, the pack the global pattern, the global because oscillation patterns of different at different. Scales are not, they're even if they're not in sync. They in terms of like at the same time the there might be like the sort of like global orchestra to to the temporal sink.
  118: In fact, that's exactly what I'm saying is that there is a that there's a temporal orchestra to the, to the unto, the, to the desynchronized oscillations. And so, what looks like, it's not in a sink and a moment. In one moment of time is in four dimensions, possibly still in sync.
  120: So, it's like, as if as if the pattern was being etched through time, as if the synchronization was traveling forward and it forwarded time at the in the end and not just in terms of space and so, but then it could. But then so. But then so like let's say that you have a small oscillate small, wave of activity, and one area of the brain, you know, like you know like a neuro circuit it is of firing that consists of firing action, potentials at the rate of it.
  122: So that so action tensors are firing one after another in a sequence and it's forming a circuit that is, is it's not, it's not that they ended individually. This is not the same neurons are fine, but that in general that bunch of neurons is firing in a and in an oscillation sequence with other bunches of neurons.
  126: Also theory event like the large scale magnetic dipole, event, might trigger, simultaneous smaller oscillations. That don't have a direct direct connection to each other and so the brain would have would have multiple ways to continue to maintain oscillations and separate areas of of the brain independent of whether or not.
  128: They're continued to be a an actual connection between those two areas and so that that might look like the brain is sort of communicating wirelessly, but it's like as if two people remember the same oscillation right and maybe that oscillation is learned so, well that like, if you don't hear from someone that, that that's your, that you're unconsciously expecting your hair from at a certain interval, then you might into it to something wrong with them.
  132: You've just you've learned through at some point when you had contact with this person, you both learned the same oscillatory pattern in your clocks, you had some part of your brain, had a, you know, saved a clock memory that that Save the memory. In this temporal clock, that associated with this other person's pattern.
  134: And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.
  138: So that burst activity then becomes encoded by the people who are now. They're basically expecting news from you, right? There's, there's a clocks have been aligned and so you're starting the group oscillation. Right, and yes. So it remains to be seen in terms of, you know. So it's possible that if if let's say that the oscillation changes the global oscillation that that was a basically that triggered like you're connect your they triggered oscillator and also Tory memory as you have it, the other person that was retrieved with a certain cadence and so that memory like occurs to a certain time, but if the global oscillation has changed relative to that one oscillation, then the other oscillation might notice it.
  140: So, what I'm suggesting is, let's say we have two global oscillations and they're disconnected. Now like they're they became connected, so they're oscillating together but they're physically separated. And let's say that one of those two oscillations because because here's thing is, it's the the largest scale oscillation is reacting to the light to the smaller oscillation.
  142: The small obvious is reactive to larger oscillation. They're in lockstep. So something happens to one of your remote oscillations that's going to change the global oscillation in such a way that the oscillation that was connected to that other oscillation is now going to notice it and it's going to same like television, right?
  144: Because you're because what you really sensing is is you're oscillation with that person. That's what you're really sensing and you're sensing that. It's changed because the expectation of what the global signal feels like relative to that person has changed. And so, you know, you'll know that something is wrong with the person at your most in sync.
  146: With, if something happened to them, you would know it because you're it because you're oscillations are sync with the global oscillation. So the global oscillation helps keep track of that person. Informs you? And so that's the sort of like this is sort of like the interesting thing is there it there could be a sort of like
  148: Telepathic connection that isn't telepathy at all but it's just a matter of. Yeah, it is kind of like celebrity a little bit. But, but it has to be established through through oscillatory scene. Synchronization like, you have to contain the same oscillations as someone else and in order to have that sort of like telepathic link with somebody, but then that but then that sort of like that's sort of like enables people to connect in a deeper way if they have the same oscillations, right, inside them.
  152: Yeah, that that like you know like so it could be that like oscillators attract like oscillators

  49: So it's, you know it's like well how it doesn't make sense to oscillations could command consciousness because, you know, if you're only if you're only considering the fact that there that the
  51: That's you know but in any case it there is a there is a way and so that is something I get into another in another chapter how oscillations contribute to our sense of reality.
  65: And yeah, and those are the, those are the kind and I, you know, I the wave pattern again I think its by itself is is also a nature right for me. They're being like in a solid state or in a way state but the constant sort of like a constant oscillation between, you know, testing and flowing like questing and flowing like, the solid state is like, the crest of the wave, and which is just like, it's almost like the whole wave posits for a second as a crest.
  71: And that. And that's why that, the particle either has a location or momentum. It's literally oscillating between being the wave being at at its peak pressing and then away sort of like, collapsing, again into the sea. And it's interesting to think of like the, you know, you think of how the moons gravity is affects the waves on on earth.

    3: Photocopier Neurons Oscillator
    6: After I had this idea about the the atom being a about Adams, combining to form like a ball, or a planet. And then that planet having like a beam forming isolation. Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.
    9: How many horizontal patterns are available and that sort of beam forming property. The of something has oscillations form being beams because they are attractive. Like the they attract.
   12: They the power bands, converge, right? Like you have a bunch of. If you have oscillatory activity emerging from the same place, they're going to converge together and so you have space squeezing squeezing together. When when you have oscillations increasing around around vertices around atoms and molecules. So the state so space time is squeezing only because squeezing together?
   15: Because the in terms of like the the number of different ways, that a part of open travel, there is an increase in vertical traveling, but like, but waves also oscillate so, like, like it the particle travels, it's a plank distance and then that knocks another part of phone and that travel, then that particle travels and so and so on.
   21: If it's Oscillatory. Like the decades should be like concentration of vertical firing and just disfit flows down on horizontal firing. And so because it takes longer for because it's less because is less likely that a known is going to come out than that. But something is going to travel horizontally than it is in trouble vertically, right?
   27: The more more likely it is that you're going to get sucked into a vertical lane or attracted to the attic and environment. If you can't go in closer. All right, so second, the gravitational force could like a, like, an attract could be like the tractor forces, like the odds of of moving towards the atom or towards the oscillator are going to increase the closure.
   30: You are to it see when I be volunteering the other class. But if that, so in that case, there are actually fewer, horizontal lanes for the travel. So some stuff that's traveling horizontally. My travel a lot faster, that's what they're speaking. And if you get stretched out from that oscillator, then then the beams are going to be spread out.
   36: Yeah, but the horizontal is would be expanding between the beans that are shot out by the, but it's between the vertical games. And so the the distance that that a particle would have to travel. Horizontally is increase relative to distance part of the travel, horizontally. It's closer to an oscillator like Earth.
   45: Because it has to travel more horizontally. There's less vertical. There's less chance that something than travel vertically. The farther away. It is from the center of an oscillation. So that sort of like explains our relatively speaking, there's more space so it doesn't explain why space is created actually. So after you think that I guess?
   48: No, no. So I guess I'm not arguing that spaces created by the, by the offset because that actually doesn't make sense. I'm arguing that the curvature of space is defined by the last letter which gives so that would give you the relative distinction of space. Since space should be relatively slower away from the oscillator, the center of the oscillator.
   54: Can be horizontal movement. Close to the oscillator far from outsider. It's like time to solve sound, you know, the interval, the time, intervals, between points of space, right? So particle would happen with one point of space to another and maybe the maybe the particle represents sort of like an interval and time, all right?
  138: Right? So that's positive. So when an oscillator kicked other oscillators, some of them become synchronized and some of them become decent eyes and it so into like you're intuitive sense of what's going to happen is just not going to lead you to the right answer. You're just seeing like, yeah it's like it's it's hard to imagine what's going to happen because some stuff is slowing down and some stuff is speeding up and I guess it's kind of like the what's happening to atmosphere right.
  144: And it kind of looks like there's a DC synchronization process happening in a climate terms of extreme weather events but it is, it might be it it. If the thing is like, there could be something counterintuitive happening in that these different systems are oscillating systems in the weather. And eventually, the the wild divergences and weather events will slow down.
  147: And they all be in, in the weather will become oscillating together. That's that's like that is provided that the sources of new energy to the atmosphere stops and otherwise the perturbation, the tribulations might continue indefinitely, you'd have to actually stop introducing new energy to the atmosphere to to support to eventually settle towards an equilibrium.
  150: But simply adding in new energy to the oscillators in hearse assignment is going to cause Lots of cascading energy, transformations on all the different weather systems that really that are there. I think they're driven by the influx of new energy. So we can say, I mean, I guess the argument is that it is about methane and carbon dioxide but more generally speaking those are like these are weird.
  153: Maybe could consider those as the carriers of new energy into the climate ecosystem. So it's, it's a pick them as spikes in oscillating system, which is, which is kind of, it's kind of interesting because it's kind of, like, well, by removing energy from the atmosphere and regardless, of whether the car it's carbon or methane, or I mean, it might be, it might be that those are the only two options.
  159: But like if we, if we could, if we could change the oscillations in the atmosphere, I mean if it's seems like maybe that maybe we can argue that the osmosis are being set. But set by the molecules and chemicals and gases of the gases of the methane fast and the cotton, and the carbon gas that is creating sort of heaviness in the air or an also.
  177: And what is the basis of my idea? Then if it's not that, how could it be a misunderstanding and still work? So I'm like rereading chapter 2 in chapter 3 to see if I can figure out what would real story was like the patterns in the game of life that grow over time, oscillators like they absorb other oscillators as the many oscillators observe other oscillators into in when they like it's it's a it's a characteristic description or viewpoint on what happens when two oscillators become synchronized.
  186: So so in the book saying, how order emerges from chaos, what he says is if you if you have the aces that basically a different. So a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point the whole system doesn't reach oscillation. Right. But he's saying that that points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle that bad point moves to a most from one oscillator to another.
  192: So let's say that you had three neurons, right? So see. It's made of this ticket. Let's take a look. It's to say it's it's it's three plus, one bad point, right? So the bad point moves around. So that's there's four neurons and or there's four oscillators, okay? Four oscillators.
  195: And they're each kicking the other oscillators in turn. And that point is like a is like a box that moves that never gets absorbed. Whereas the other three neurons in one interval of time are have good points and when they, when they kick the other neurons, that don't have bad points.
  198: The, the the point is being absorb. And so, so the argument then is like, well, basically you have a smaller area now for the oscillator, so the oscillator. So that, so the bad point removes that the is removed from, from the area. So, the fourth neuron is, which is not, which is, which is, you know, sometimes it contains a good point and sometimes it contains a bad point, but it's like, there are three good points.
  201: And so, the area of the oscillatory, pattern is three good points, and the fourth point, the bad point, that's just ignored. So so, so that that I mean, I guess that implies that because three good points will reach will reach equilibrium with the with the fat point. If there's just one of them I guess.
  204: I don't know. But like, I am a little bit confused by that. But like yeah. So like, you know, it's weird because in the example of of a, like a is always fixed zeros. So that is kind of like a bad starting point sort of at several titch, but the others, but, but it doesn't affect the rest of the oscillator from eventually coming into equilibrium.
  207: But it's, it's weird to say, okay now. Well, wait a second. What if you have two bad points? So that that are, you know, permanently like in that bad are in polar oscillations that don't get absorbed, right? It's it's, it's weird because you're kind of, there is kind of an argument that if it if an oscillator cannot, if ester has a bad point in the energy, cannot be absorbed.
  210: You know, by that, by that oscillator for that interval. Then it's, you know, in each interval, it transfers on it and it maintains the same amount of energy as if as if as if it wasn't there. So what is there in terms of what is there are? The is like you have an area of that is only represented by the good points or for the phase changes, paste, changing areas.
  213: And so the phase changing area is a subset of the larger possible set, if there, if the whole, if the whole set of possible of potential areas for points was, was filled with good points. Then you'd have an area of you know, four points. And if there's a bad point in there that you have an area of three points and in the bad point, to can't take up any of the area of the secret synchronized, oscillators for those for those three points and I guess in and theory the other three points could could eventually match the oscillation of the theoretical back point.
  219: So he's saying that the transfer that the operation from before to after works like a larger function of the photocopier The idea is that don't understand why he's saying that all sets, get expanded in area, but it's, but it's like, it's like, Here. Okay? So the argument is that if you have a terrible point that leads to an oscillation not reaching equilibrium, then what happens is the somehow the oscillation by itself is like the enlarged function, wherever a point in oscillator becomes larger.
  225: The effect of a single neuron to several neurons simultaneously. That would be like taking a positive pixel positive, light pixel and capturing its negative light as a difference. So while the neuron is faster, the oscillating set becomes slower and but therefore it becomes distinct becomes stinked from the rest of the oscillator.
  228: So becomes a distinct pattern that the rest of the oscillator encounters but it's a magnified pattern. So you start off with a small pattern and that one pattern which is this is just a single neuron firing and it becomes a larger pattern because a single neuron causes a set of neurons to become inhibited or for one signal to be sort of like, passing the charge to a lot of others.

  12: You know, but there's also if there's pressure with air it was just distinct. Whereas like I think that I know that yours there's pressure which is like I guess it's like an oscillating way pushing
  16: It's pushing air because it's there's a there's a blade that cycling. So there's an act. There's an oscillation inside the fan that is pulling in air on one side and pushing around the other side and essentially, like if like well, I mean, maybe a cyclone so it's like if I think of a cyclone or something that is pulling in warm air, it feeds in a warmer and the air helps make helps it to maintain.
  28: That. So maybe, like an antonic oscillator with its centrifugal force is in the electromagnetic field spectrum is basically creating this this this eye at this sort of
  30: You know, I think like a fan like destruction of shields, right? Where this where this, where the strength of of its attraction is going to be relative to, to the, to the distance closest to the oscillator oscillating, atom?
  34: It's also and pushing out into, it's it might, it's like, I just imagine that this the same process is creating vertical lanes, through through the combined oscillations of, you know, of groups of atoms. You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.
  36: All right. And I'm saying or it's instead of saying it's a piece of space maybe we say it was a pizza. It's um as I think of particles is as pieces of space, but it's it's particles that have been pulled together and they're pulled together. And so, it's like you're taking a whole bunch of of oscillators and you're pulling in together and they make a larger oscillator and that as a as it has like a beam that that's like a bean.
  38: That goes in every direction. Out away front away from the spherical oscillator. It goes in every direction but but to the electromagnetic field like a larger scales, that's just like a lane, it's like a line that sort of phase into the field over time and that but it's going to create a lane where you have a lot of different.
  48: This space field was folding you know, it's folding a lot and eventually it folded on itself and became a cyclone and cycling was an atom. Now that there's an atom, there's there's basically like, you know, now you have particles that are oscillating out a particles oscillating around other particles or orbiting other particles and that, and that create that is going to warp space time.
  54: Time or size, but it's, but it's, it's just, it's just like as a place field. It's that it would, it's it's like is it the place fill itself is a metronome, and it goes from a state of having no oscillations to being potentially fully awesome. Fully oscillating.
  60: But but the, you know, I like the natural, so natural selection ideas, FaceTime and that sort of like that brings us back to like the idea of yeah. That, you know, I like the idea. Like, if we are basically branches of and oscillating tree in a sense, a tree of oscillations then then in a sense, the cosmos is in a sense.
  64: The key thing is is what would defines is like we have a second in, in the, in the human brain, it certain assist in certain systems of certain with certain can information. Configuration human life. Consciousness can emerge, and the information configuration is a physical configuration of oscillations. It's very specific.
  66: Configuration of oscillations very specific classes of configurations of oscillations. So it's, it's not to argue so I wouldn't argue that. The whole cosmos is conscious. But instead, it's like just just a the tips, just the tips of the of the cosmos would be and and that it's like, you know what contest is is it's a delineation.
  68: Or it's a perspective, it's perspective. That's that's it's car, is carved by distinctions extinction. So it is out of necessity. Consciousness is not the whole of the oscillator, but instead it is a it is the perspective of no, of a note of of the of a notal branch, if it's purposely the limited perspective.
  76: But there but they exist as and delays cause but caused by not, if the quantum scale caused by nuts are basically caused by atoms and or caused by oscillation performance scale. So oscillations at the quantum scale cause space time to emerge at scales larger than the plank scale, but see it as the sea space time as the orbit that the planks here.
  78: And, you know or that or you could see it as basically the the oscillation of the cosmos not being able to decide whether it exist or doesn't exist. Therefore, it sort of happens, this half the time and it's half existence was has a process that undergoes national selection which eventually results in the oscillations that are human beings and life firms and planets.

   3: Neurons Memories Oscillators
  25: It's bursting with some emotion, you know, one day, maybe you spoke to joint or something. It's bursting would happen if you smoke the giant, right, for whatever reason, and and like, well, would it if there's there's, there's a huge electromagnetic shift that's happening and maybe maybe it comes from, maybe it's created by the neurons in an oscillation, maybe maybe the large oscillating because like, you know, your heart has a lot of neurons that are in oscillation 24/7, right?
  27: They're just they're just oscillating all the time, right? And it's like it's a synchronous. Like they're all firing together and that helps to move the giant muscle. That's your heart. And so I oscillations are more powerful, like if you want to if you want to have, you know, power that can move the motors of your limbs, right?
  29: You're gonna need sufficient power for that to move your arms and legs, right? So so the, so the neurons, when they oscillate together they're they are sending a charge together and so the brain can have groups of neurons become oscillators that that in the oscillators, as I'll point on the book can learn patterns and the patterns that they learn.
  31: Like they can, they can also replay those patterns. And what drives, what drives the preferences of that? Oscillators preferences that comes down that comes down to
  35: You're all of your life experiences combined. You're all that waste. This is an argument. You can define yourself with different way if you want. I'm just saying for the sake of this argument, let's imagine you are all your memories and at the same time all your memory memories because there because they're complex oscillators they are basically there are tractors for certain kinds of patterns your memories are tuned in to receive certain kinds of patterns into fire when you get those patterns and their tuned to ignore other types of patterns and they're turned because of the arrangement of their synapses.

   3: Synapses Neuron Oscillator
  27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part. One of the attractors of the mechanism of a group of groove, oscillations.
  29: And then. So when you have group oscillation, effectively, the group can recognize patterns. Because now the patterns are, you know, when they're on fire is like expressed to a whole selection, a whole area, right? And and that means that you have basically but it's what you choose to focus on and driven by memory configurations.
  61: Then we have a situation where they're going, where the, that neuron and every other neuron in the receptor field there. It's gonna notice if there's if there's one of the oscillating neurons is inhibited. It's gonna notice because it because that because of the principles of how oscillators work basically.
  63: And so we have to so we have to god. Dammit. No. Imagine that the branch that the oscillations of reality from small scale atoms to large scale of galaxies that they can be thought of as having a practical form, like a tree where the branches, because of the nature of oscillators to attract one another.
  69: So like if you imagine if you imagine you know, if you go from this order of you have a big oscillator, followed by a smaller oscillator followed by a smaller oscillator and then you look at human beings. This is also can also fractals oscillating, you know, fractals because it goes down human beings.
  71: And then and then, you know, our narrow circuits neurons. And then the, the the chart and charged the ions charge atoms. The ions, the, the, the electrons. You know what, we can. The describing the electron is as an attractor in an oscillator sort of or just one point of an at one point in an oscillating and in the in the fabric of space-time oscillating, that's I like to imagine it.
  73: Electrons are the literal fabric of space-time also oscillating between having a physician and having a velocity or something like that. It's in some way. The the idea is that space time is, is can't. It is. It's the fundamental isolation is is undecidability or yeah, like, undecided ability, or it just can't decide what state it wants to be it, like, do I exist or do I not exist?
  75: It's sort of thing like because the universe can't decide it it oscillates between existing and not existing, in a sense and that oscillation creates an oscillation cascade which creates space time because the each of the, because from the first oscillate, the for the first oscillation to the multiplication of oscillations, the fractalization of space time is growing and so space time, appears to expand, but it's expanding relative to the oscillators, but since human beings are oscillators hemolytes trees.
  79: Is this sort of like oscillation we're all the holes bottom surface area of the tree on the certain axis is growing simultaneously. So the plant is like growing up out of the ground and but it has a diameter. So we ended and did diameter is basically a cylinder that starts branching off into different branches later on.
  83: So, the tree there's, there's, you know, a circle is, like, I'm just like, imagining like an oscillator as like a circle and a sense, and many oscillators being aligned is like a tree branch, right? And so we go from the, you know, well basically big stars to people and the progression of the evolution of the universe.
  85: But what we're seeing is that we're that we're all part of the branches of a great, oscillatory tree and at and at the same time that. So basically that wouldn't mean what that means. So is that as a human being you are like the branch of a tree your branch of the tree of the the oscillating fractal universe, right?

   11: You is literally different. Like and there's there's an electromagnetic reason for that actually. And it's that basically people are oscillators basically, they're were our reactions to one.
   15: Another are literally oscillations, right? Literally we are oscillating in reaction to the information that we perceive and novel information has a greater impact, then let them less interesting information. So it so if 
   24: Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 
   30: It's gonna set the pace of the, of all, the oscillators that it interacts with, like, because it's gonna, but it's basically it's gonna set the face because it's basically bumping up all of their they're voltages a little bit. And so that's going to result in basically, and increase chances of coincident firing, like, you'll have, like, like you have a whole row of neurons that go off, just because that one neuron went off just because they were close to firing.
   42: Go through these, the neural circuits in a cortical column would go through like sequences of of oscillatory firing. So like it's like a multi-stage, temporal spatial firing event and which you have which you have, but it's like so you have a row with individual neurons firing and then that when that rose done in another row you're going to have another arrangement of neurons that are going to fire because those are the ones that were close to threshold.
  188: But sort of like not at the same time through the internity, sort of like another viewpoint on the insert. Any principle is that they are also is that that is space oscillating between being somewhere and going somewhere and it can't it can't land on either one that long has to keep oscillating back and forth.

    5: audio: (synap, oscillat, field, dendrite, decoherence, electromagnetism, neuron)
    8: The natural selection of spacetime Wave Oscillation
   17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
   90: So that there is a growing awareness that if you have a brain that is where synchronization is being constantly disrupted, you have a brain because you have like you have it's it's only by encoding the synchronized pattern with decoherence or desynchronization or disruptions that are meaningful in the context of information theory, rare patterns among the common tonic oscillation. Does that happen? Is that carrier of synchronization, which can be thought of as the container of a soliton.
  102: Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU. 
  113: Looks like a vortex. A hurricane. Looks like a vortex and the atom looks like a vortex. I didn't realize that vortices include, you know, human cells. Human cells are vortexes inside. Vortices with vortices are beside those vortices. It's like a practical vortex, but the oscillation of the vortex is an oscillation and an oscillation is the vortex.
  116: In terms of like there is a repeating cichlid pattern there's a cycling pattern that has a temp. Is it a temple? Resonance or temporal oscillation? Yeah. So resonance is the decaying oscillator, right? Instead of a continuing oscillator, but the very, but, but the oscillator itself is, is it even in resonation?
  122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  125: So if you have a dissipated system, the oscillation doesn't resonate away. It's like but yeah I think of you know like something that is expanding contracting and that is the expansion contractions.
  131: Isolatory movements at the most fundamental scale. So yeah I think a space is like it's something that is at the most fundamental scale. It's randomly expanding and contracting, creating us, creating the fundamental oscillations of space time. And so we, so we are so right? Right now I am one with space time.
  140: So has to constantly alternate between states. It's physically uncertain what it wants to be and the uncertainty principle applies to basically all of space time creating micro oscillations.
  143: But then, what happens is these oscillations serve as tractors to attractors that are sort of like having random encounters with each other. And so, but tractors. Like a tractor is and it's like an event that is going to continue to oscillate but like but there but they're attracted in a different way, they're like attracting other oscillators, they're attracting other particles or tracking electrons they have and they're doing it.
  146: The attraction is being caused in a mechanical way because the interaction of one oscillator with another is causing us to have a reaction like a reaction where it's like it's so forces have collided in space and they balance off each other. There's this reaction to space folding and then hitting itself.
  149: So it bounces off itself with these folds because they have like they pull each other together because they're oscillators and oscillators attract. And so everything in space clumps together and you get rocks and you get gasses and you get stars and you get every possible autonomic creation, you know, long enough timeline and in which the universe is able to sort of follow physics, basically a kind and natural selection for physics.
  158: Sort of became certain sort of went from being the. So there was a transition from the complexity of what was happening at the molecular scale or at the atomic scale to the molecular scale to the chemical scale. Like there are transition phases and the timeline where the organization of oscillators into increasingly complex structures up until you know human life.

   11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
   13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
   15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator. A larger group that's firing together and it's the decay rate sets the cadence of the gamma oscillation the decay rate of the action of the higher phasic action potential, which inhibits in thereby neurons.
   21: So that would be yeah but that means well. Okay, no because that's still gonna start still gonna cause excitation overall. So I'm not. Yeah, so I need to kind of like, understand more about how one neuron can trigger LTD in a group of neurons. And the question here, another question character explore is, whether the oscillation of groups of neurons, what the delta oscillations, the data oscillations
   25: And that inhibit inhibition allows the net weight or signal value of the action potential. To be correlated with a lot of different messengers. A group oscillation that sort of spreads that message or spread the correlated message, regionally, and spatially and temporarily. And, you know, I like to think of
   29: So the statue itself in order to be carved has to react. So the inhibitory reaction of the network sort of symbolizes as sort of, embodies the fashion being carved by the finally, the sculpture, right? And, For, let's say that. The oscillator, the tonic oscillator is meant to be void of information.
   31: Like a blank. He is a like uncarved marble, right? But over time as the Australians as Austin are learned patterns, it becomes marked by those patterns so eventually the oscillator represents statue, right? Eventually represents the statue, I would say, is the ability to represent multiple patterns via the patterns that are triggered.
   35: And the oscillator is going to basically produce here. The attractors to find by previously learned memories, it's going to co-produce sort of like having like the the weight assisted pull-up machine at the gym. It's going to help co-produce the pattern. So you get some of the patterns we'll be coming in from the inside.
   39: And too is your brain is decoding our signals. So your brain is contributing to building the model of what you're seeing each and every time and it's doing it from the patterns that have been collected by your oscillator, right? And playing the back and sequences. So in the sequences are like, yes, so we can accomplish the experience of experience.
   63: So functionally the consciousness is substrate. Invariant there's lots of I'm gonna do it oscillators involves. But the boss later's are.
   71: It's it's that the output isn't something internal and internal representation isn't really internal uses your brain, working too hard, okay? The output is an external res, rendering mapping. It's done internally. But it's a an external map that's being produced by other by the physical. Computations of oscillators, it's an external map.
  127: Become a tractors in the context of oscillators. And and, and usually you think of an attractor in the context of a harmonic oscillator, that is going to has a source of energy that's going to repeat over and over again. But in the case of the brain, you have, you know, the harmonic oscillators.
  129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.
  141: You want that to be a short time interval and by the same token, use, sort of want the strong white spread oscillations, which which which become encoded with various potential. Renderings grace potential, learn patterns. You want those to be in a state of sort of listening or expect or expectation.
  143: The sort of like they're not making noise. They're just watching. There's watching and listening as as other neurons. Make noise. They're taking their current as a service and you want the oscillator to sort of like yeah? Okay, so there is a time when the oscillator is going to fire, always with that, I read from Versace last night.
  147: Okay. So so The thing is like there is there is like a neural oscillator has neurons in three different phases all the time. So you're always going to have some neurons are taking on the observer roles in Osir. You're always gonna have some neurons are taking on transmitter roles and oscillator the transmitting, their phases collect and you're, oh, in the third group is, you're always gonna have neurons that are inhibited.
  149: And these are not and and which neurons are, but there's like three different phases that the at the oscillatory oscillating neurons have to go through, but what's critical? Okay. Is that the?
  155: This is a case the bottom up causation. When narrow bursts are in fact, driving inhibition, which is driving, the sort of observer mode of the oscillator. And so there's this, there's this relationship that is is like okay well it's not just the action. Potential represents is the action potential represents.
  157: The tip of the pen, the inhibition and in a sense is like the brush, that's the brush, the body of the brush of the pen. So that means that it's not just the action potential, be inscribing and oscillator. It's the in inhibitory function, it's also in inscribing the oscillator and whereas the action potential can be thought of as as a sort of Way to imprint memory.
  161: So yeah, so if you so imagine you have two neurons and a huge oscillator fire and they're they're distally separate, but the each cause a huge amount of of neurons around them to become inhibited. Following that. So what it, what might happen is if if those two neurons that fired before fire again then it's possible that the chances that those two neurons sort of form like a long range.
  179: But, but it is a fact that connections via synapses grow with long-term attention. And that could be an additional vector for how signals across the scope of the human brain are coordinated. Can so and to sort of close the scope of this, what I'm suggesting is that the emergence of oscillations, like gamma oscillations and, and perhaps, alpha and delta and the theta oscillations that there's, these are serving to increase the chances of, of distal connections, not.

   7: That's not to sort of point fingers at the who did, what first, and what was their causeality. And the responsibility. You know, oftentimes people get people become in the course of a commerce conversation where there's back and forth. Conversation, you're becoming an oscillator with that other person. And if if things are, if the result is a positive outcome, both persons probably contributed to that positive outcome.
  19: Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.
  29: And in terms of being that tipping point, thing that the shifts the entire assembly from one state to another but the tipping point. So, the shipping point idea, is sort of like accomplished because tonic oscillations give you a bridge, which means you do not necessarily wish me as you do not need.
  31: So small oscillations, have a hand. It's like weight displacement, machines at the gym, but weight, displacement machine means that you can do pull-ups. If you don't have enough muscle to lift your weight, as long as the machine is helping you to lift yourself. The machine is giving you like.
  38: Network oscillators that that allow one, small neuronal event to trigger a large cascade of excited neurons. And that produces through the process of Ltd, long-term long-term depression that produces group, oscillatory activity that is going to provide the amount of energy necessary for for coordinated motor function. But that's different from what you the different from what you might need for making sensory distinction.
  40: So there's what what's useful for making sensory? Distinctions are inhibitory neurons that can really divide up patterns and novel ways. And, Chemical synapses that can break down. Basically, they can break down and distribute the phase information of a single neuron in a, in a way that allows a network oscillator to learn, high level, and varying patterns.

  13: Stink. Like it's it's these are the regular oscillators. And this contrasts and they become a dominant, they become donut and regular because care more powerful and more widespread. So they just statistically defeat the faster, basic smaller spread I guess we should say relaxed.
  15: There are firing relaxing around a firing, but when I what I'm saying is like so phases of basic firing is relaxed only in that. It's not a cyclic. Oscillator is not if not it's not yeah it's not there or it's a relaxed oscillator that could be irregular.
  19: And two things work really well for you and and in the face-based and one of is going to be relaxed, non-harmonic oscillators to have the cavity code occurrence of those and also Next.

  35: But but so, here's the thing, is the, the action potential has particular shape like a tone that the, let's just say that the it creates a face change in the face. Space. That the face space is the combination of the the inside and outside cell electrodes and the oscillator the the face base created by the neural oscillators.
  41: Because because because the field is, is in part, made up of I made it defined by the by the ionic gradient. In addition to the the tonic oscillations of neuro circuits and cortical columns and the physics, the phasic firing of interrupts. The tonic firing with novel patterns that the whole brain can see because it's because it's, it's it's interlinked and you know, and and graph theory, we know that thanks to graph there.
  45: It's coordinate oscillatory patterns that are very distant from one another in terms of brain space. But the brain can, like, I can, you know, for example, you know, this like very distant patterns are like, just, you know, some obvious examples is are that, you know, you have, what comes into your eyes is sent to both of the hemispheres of your brain at the same time, Each eyes send something to each of the hemispheres of your brain.
  53: You're conscious of some content, that's engaging, multiple brain areas, and that's sort of like multiple brain areas over time. So there's there are over. There are overlapping oscillations taking place across a synchronized, brand. Activity, taking place across fast distances and the and these activities are not necessarily like actively connected.

And like even the idea that, you know what, the, you know, maybe some acoustics, some mechanical, and some molecule magnetic, where's my reverberate off of the, the school back towards the center, areas of the brain and that, that by itself could be a sort of a tractor that binds together.
  23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  25: I think minutute chefs it could be. I mean, I guess I guess it's possible. It's not super clear to me at how, but I guess it's possible that oscillators could be perceptive of, not only of action of the main action, potential event. But also of back firing action. Potentials then did it.
  27: Dendritic originating action, potentials that are generated originating, actually potentials and I don't know, maybe synaptic everything that's threshold events, maybe the oscillator can actually sort of absorb and learn that. And so. And but the levels of detail for representation of patterns on different scales, ought to be ought to have some sort of representation.

    5: Tomographic Language Oscillators
   35: I'm trying to say that long stretches of monotonic sounds, have meaning, long & slow meaning. Our cells, our body mind and voice are entified, bound, compounded, unified, assembled, by oscillation, by cells firing together in close synchrony. 
   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
   84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.
   95: Coincidence patterns are learned by the whole group of cells (the cell assembling that oscillates as a unit), but expressed by a few of them at a time, you could have bottom up incoming sensor activity helping to trigger learned information patterns accessible in any combination of cells that are assembled via the physics of oscillation, united by oscillation to learn as a group, like many cells becoming one sensory consideration & action device. Patterns at the micro level of individual cells trigger their network when they fire, triggering mesoscale & macroscale pattern reactions.
  101: If you think about the physics of oscillators, the macroscale oscillators have the most power and they are going to drive changes to the lower level oscillators more often, so in a human brain, or in an animal brain it's going to look like a lot of choices happening from the top down. It's going to look like something going on in a person's head is driving the choices that they make in life, because of memories oscillating at the macroscale of human brain activity are attractors driving outcomes in relationship to the incoming sensory streams. This going to be true because of the physics of oscillation of that person's brain, their macroscale brain oscillations are likely going to dominate over the data coming from their incoming senses.
  103: The idea that the physics of oscillators not only bind memories together, but actually drive choices from the top down may help explain why people on the autistic spectrum have both more intense sensory input experiences while being less responsive, or less driven from the top down at the same time. I think brainwave entrainment & meditation is going to be key for autistic people to develop more top down self driven self-control. It might explain why people who suffer from Neurodegenerative Diseases like Parkinson's Disease which desynchronizes the timing of neural activity experience a loss of motor control (or the loss of coordination, focus, and or memory.)
  108: A mechanistic model explains oscillatory slowing and neuronal hyperactivity in Alzheimer's disease
  111: The main idea is that the entire brain & body is made up of different oscillators at different scales, from the brains electric dipoles, its magnetic dipoles, its major oscillating groups & parts, from the chiasmaticnucleus, to the thalamas, the hippo-campal entorhinal loop, the tempo-parietal junction, to every cell in the human body, to glial cell, the neurons, the cortical columns, it's all oscillators of different sizes in 3D space & time. Like the gears of a clock these oscillators all bump & grind on each other. Moving & attracting, disrupting & sometimes synching with other oscillators. Each of these oscillators is producing four dimensional phase patterns, that is phase signals that have time & topological distribution.
  113: Oscillators want to influence other oscillators, some of them will just peck at other oscillators and make sure that other oscillators don't merge with them.
  117: So they will maintain boundaries between oscillators. Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.
  123: Spinning configurations are possible where you can have two different oscillators that are interacting, but not merging, because they're just, they're not close enough to merge, there isn't enough combined gravitational influence to make a merger happen, or a merger just isn't possible because they are out of phase. I mean I am descibing the physical orbit of a planet as part of it's phase, as if the planet or star is actually a particle, and that particle is actually a wave, or the planet is the tip of a wave that is expanding into space and creating time & space that is a wave, or a macroscopy frequency.
  129: Each planetary body, or star has enough of a time dilation area effect to disturb or offset or mess with other oscillators other planets & stars, and cause and stimulate other oscillators to maintain alternative oscillating paths.

  12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  22: So, there's just like, who's acting state are ready, state, which is like low time firing and then incoming, seriously are like fast drilled system and I'm saying that the stuff that finds our consciousness is the diversions between the high frequency, you know, activity, narrow pattern and the low frequency, oscillating of pattern of observing neurons.
  24: And that interaction is at six. Like the interaction is what prints. That's where that's where the canvas of consciousness is printed, and it's what it's printed with, and oscillators with their own physic with physical iron and also, you know, and and also inhibitor patterns, right? And habit for variations.
  36: We're just computer graphics related to religion, right? Yeah. So there's there's a potential buying agency advanty because oscillators are oscillating. Power bands are going to attract information together. So information is going to two verge. So you have multiple representations, or multiple viewpoints, or multiple renderings, in the same out of the multiple side, and those multiple representations, in a sense, get to vote as they converge because the, there's the thing that there is more instances of has a greater likely or something that is fewer answers to suffering.
  44: But oscillator itself is going to insert a sort of attraction to pulling that smaller. Oscillating, neuron back into the same tonic frequency flow, I just ready for being ready for a phase of firing. So the phase of firing to be cold for, but it happens because of physics the physics and oscillators and oscillation is sort of like
  56: I mean, the idea I guess is that power power bands and spectra could be not only just, you know, converging information. I guess the exercise I could symbolize work, converging information. If an oscillator is collectively, reading out a face, a temple, spatial phase pattern, coinc at the same time that it is being absorbed by the by basically.

  33: But I think that's just a consequence of how neurons operate in terms of taking turns transmitting and receiving, like they oscillate between being receiving neurons being inhibiting their arms or being, you know, broadcasting or also broadcasting, or in other words, transmitting neurons. And so they have. So there's but it's not, I mean, it's actually more complicated in that there's actually there's like a ton of firing phase, which is like the standard expectation and like of being, like, in the, that's when neurons are fine together in large groups in oscillators, and it's like a slower, you know, frequency fine pattern during the day, you might have like the power band of your alpha, oscillating layers might be greatest during the day.

  122: And so, that's how you see the brain. It's like it's like a distributed rendering it. Distributed drawing Think of consciousness of distributed drying or each part of the brain, gets to render a different pixel and each oscillator gets to get to. And the different pixels are like dark. It's like one lot, like you have a whole bunch of.
  124: So you have a cortical calm and he's quarter. Calm. In the, in the neocortex, is representing one line of the screen of the mind. And and then what happens is the oscillator resolve the neurons that didn't fire. That are basically listening and predicting when they're going to fire because they're collecting little electric surges, actually.
  126: ⟪ 332 characters skipped ⟫tion it observation is something that the entire that was a reason that a single neuron is doing other words, predict when it's going to fire is something that's also being done by the network or the oscillator or the quotable column.
  128: So I guess so we have. So we have predictive coding at the individual neuron level, but we also have predictive coding at the oscillator level at the cortical column level and we have predictive going at the larger scale of different brain reasons. And so the narrow, so their intern neurons are participating in it.
  130: Predictive coding of, you know, firing it at the greatest level and that. And so what I'm saying is like I all levels where you know at the micro level where deciding on individual pixels and at the cortical column level which is also the same as the oscillator level, you know, the missile level we have, we're doing lines.

   5: Artificial consciousness. Shit, data and C3PO. So I see neurons is something different. Like there's there's, you know, the neuron is a multimodal, neural network, but it also. But it's also the case that it's it's, you know, when I describe neurons, like, it's not news to anybody that neurons oscillate tonically, it's not news to a neuroscientist but you don't hear that in the hours subscription, when in neurons described the function of an urine is subscribed.
  87: And so this is yeah. This is like the three sets of neurons small. Like imagine you had just to oversimplify it, imagine that you had the entire view. Want what is going to respond at once and it's going to respond by some of the neurons getting excited and some of them being inhibited and some of them remaining and in tonic oscillation.
  89: Most of them remaining anatomic oscillation. Okay. And then so then you have to be too and the V2 is listening to the B1. And so now in the V2 you're going to have the neurons that were listening which is, you know, all of them you're going to have a situation where some of them get excited and some of them getting inhibited.

    5: If a memory stored in synaptic connections becomes conscious, it is being magnified with a kind of oscillatory telescope to the whole brain, the pattern embodied by that neuron's morphology ripples from micro to macro.
   23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.
   32: Okay, so what I'm saying is that, there's a combination of picking that's happening from bottom up and picking this happening from the top down. As in the, the danger rates can look for certain patterns and they can refuse certain patterns on the lowest scale, the oscillators can seek out certain patterns and reject certain patterns on the medial scale and then the global workspace can also drive patterns by looking for patterns that it's encountered.
  146: Another is what's happening at the macroscale when you have large areas of the brain or basically coordinated activities. Temporal spatial firing activities between multiple cortical columns and multiple oscillators across the brain. So when you have global brain activity in the global workspace, that's coordinating. A lot of medial brain activity and critical columns together and those are coordinating and paying attention to micro neuronal activity at the neuron is synaptic scale.

  19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.
  29: ⟪ 304 characters skipped ⟫ not a lightfield that has no mass, where light is mixing with encoded wave patterns to create a lightfield. That's not what I predict is happening in the brain. Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

A Neural Oscillatory Tomographic Map is a map of learned functions which are themselves maps of learned coincidence patterns.) The greater scale oscillators, the dipoles, the quadrupoles etc) of the brain to other neurons so that when the sequence fires. The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incoming data.

  16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
  18: Whether it's inhibited or excited, that's covering the dot metrics and the oscillators. The frequencies of the neurons doing, is that? That's where the awareness of coming from, but the sultan waves are passing signals. Maybe to from muscles. But anyway, it allows the neuron to send signals not between neurons but over but just over a legal denture sites.
  86: I remember. I'm not so whenever so. So they have so many in common, the so many nerves and so many in common. So there's like a whole bunch of neurons that noticed from Jamie fires, not just one person. It's like a whole bunch, notice a whole oscillator notices, right?

   3: Four kinds of neural transmission Oscillator
   5: The pixels of reality, the idea is that we got a picture of like close-up pixels and show how from far away. Close-up pixels at up to a picture, but up close, there's the most thoughts, okay? And then you compare that to the firings of neurons or the absence of firing, some neurons, in the argument is that each and neuron or negative each action potential or negative axis action potential is the deviation and oscillation that is like the pixelation of screen the oscillation screen and then we have the neuron, which is going to be basically the
   7: The the pixel on the screen on the oscillation and it's either going to go dark, like, negative or brighter, which is like changing. It's color and it doesn't look like much until you consider a lot of them simultaneously. And then you have a screen in the observer of the screen is the oscillator, right?
   9: The ice later is the one that can recognize patterns at that emerge as differentials from it's oscillation. And as the oscillator itself, takes the deviations and ropes them back in electromatic, magnetically to the pace of the oscillator. That, that process to of one oscillator consuming. Another is causing physical effects.
  11: It felt it's causing felt effects to the oscillator and and all the neurons involved. Allowing them to encode. The feeling of those pixels of those positive and negative. Potentials. Okay. So, so we get a picture and resume it out because I am. I am very literally seeing when I see with my eyes.
  25: And and we're in in four different kinds of transmission. But with two different polarities. So the positive and negative transmissions in the sense that there is a it's there's a negative transmission and in the sense of like there's the oscillator has groups of neurons firing together at regular intervals.
  29: The absence of the regular magnetic emission, the absence of the regular Electric diffusion electricity, diffusion. And, and so that negative, it's going to change the the body of the oscillator, right? So the body also of the oscillator is going to be the shape of the oscillator of the magnetic field that the oscillator is producing.
  31: I should change by some my son, Delta. And when you get a lot of neurons inside an oscillator firing, then the delta is going to be larger than if you had fewer obviously more significant and that delta is going to change how other oscillators perceive that oscillator when you have two oscillators connecting.

  37: Like that's because there's really like a represents those patterns in many times and it represents different parts of those patterns, many times and it represents those patterns like sort of like through independent neural firing sequences.

   3: Universe Atoms Oscillation
   9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  25: Of a pattern starting to of oscillations that are having a cascading effect on what another that are that like, patterns are merging from from chaos face because of the turbulence of chaos resulting in accidental patterns, that that begins to develop themselves on functionally opposite to the second law of thermodynamics.

Now, you have a left and right hemisphere which you have like, you have two ends of a dipole, that can oscillate between a positive, which is on one side and a negative one, which is, which is a charge switch to the other side, right?

   8: And yeah in terms of it's electrical acoustical and magnetic moments, how is this the energy scattered and refocused? And you can say that oscillations are doing some directing of focusing and we have and when you know neurons TV from the oscillation they're causing a disturbances in that focus changes that the whole oscillator the alden runs in the oscillator are tracking because that whole oxider is pulling the deviating neuron back into an oscillating pattern.
  11: That's the key reason, why the oscillator is as aware of deviating narrow patterns by knowledge is actually started a higher level of oscillator, but but it's also key reason why the largest dipoles of the brain are

  58: Okay. So the see this was Wow that was really strong running with that. I so had another idea that. Okay. So what I have to say is that that we have to look at the fact that basically contest experience is, this is when you have a, you have a pat of you, basically have some large-scale patterns that are echoing repeatedly accurate, echoing repeatedly in a sort of temple oscillation and so there, they're basically they're persistent patterns and these persistent patterns are represented by the whole brain.

  5: And so, the oscillations that I am experiencing, I mean, the oscillations are giving me my sense of space, my sense of balance, my sense of spaces around me. They're like, when I look around any room in or any place indoors are outdoors. What I'm seeing is a large sense of space, a sense of large structures, a sense of a geometry to the world around me.
  7: And this feeling that I have both extends, like, extends my senses self into that geometry is if I'm the sort of like, mystical presence here in this space, but I'm not like visit, I'm just floating energy, right? I'm a floating energy here, and but what I'm arguing is that, my oscillations is my brain.
  9: Oscillations are creating that those large, the large structural senses space, the large geometric large sense of geometry. The sense of itself within a neonatry, a sense of the self is part of a geometry. As almost like a vibration, like a drumming vibration within another larger. Vibrating drumming vibration. And it is kind of interesting that reality might be procedurally generated at each creation like sort of dissipative system like because that's because if you break it down to physics like a human being is dissipative system, it's like a vortex at the root level.

   3: Fires Neuron Oscillation
   5: There's this paper called the zero point field and I talk about how the brain's how conscious could be etched inside of zero point field, and it's interesting idea. But what what in the brain could be causing a zero point field? And then and I thought well actually maybe what if a what's the tonic oscillation of an oscillator circuit.
   7: And and a brain, I've also this trophy circuits of oscillations of synchronicity between multiple circuits or synchronicity between the neurons and it's any given circuit or an alternating oscillation, right? Like what is it about? The the because there's many different levels of oscillation that interact with other oscillations. Like superchargers, nucleus is 20 million is super key as matic.
   9: Nucleus is 20 million neurons that oscillate towards the center of your brain and this these oscillations, they don't all combine me but they have if force that's applied to one another
  11: You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.
  15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.
  19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.
  41: And yeah, that's it. The own one of the first 1000 copies of the first edition and they're just gonna go up and value. So yeah. I'm you train different areas of your brain to oscillate with different patterns because they take up different regions of space and there is a fired together.
  45: Well, all these people fire a lot together, which means that I'm gonna fire with them, right? That's an oscillation, they all fire together. So I'm listening to the whole heard. I know what everyone's gonna fire. Oh, then there's like this. Really this verse that causes like and neuron to expand.

    4: Oscillators Oscillation Neurons
   86: So you have 60 neurons per second per millisecond. I mean 60 groups of neurons oscillating per millisecond just because they're in different parts of the brain because there's so many neurons. So thinking kind of could be much faster because it's it's is happening in a larger scale. Now, I'm not sure about the actual situation where I don't know, if the brain can how fast the brain is actually operating?
  140: So they're basically always firing it, like tonic rates. They're always trying it. They're always firing tonically like sort of like a gaussian or random sort of pad and or basically with with a with an oscillator, with a group of neurons that are all sort of firing tonic at the same rate, okay?
  262: But all of that, like basically it could fly, it might flyer and it might change the firing rate of that. Neuron, the fine rate could increase the decrease, but even if that happens, the rest of the oscillation of that neuron pulls, that neuron back into Austin, but back into tonic oscillation with the rest of neurons.
  316: But what that means is that is that, you know, going back to the birds is, you know, when one word, turps and other bird listens and then the other bird trips the first breath listens. And so you have these sort of alternations in the oscillation. So the oscillations brainwave oscillations are alternations and neural firing.
  320: It's measured. The EG starts to synchronize because they're both on the same wavelength during that conversation. And and so the oscillation see this is, this is the key. I think it is that for not, a neuron is not just a receiver or center of information. It's also transmitter information.
  330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  332: It dissipates. So the next sound period. All right, so it's it's a it's designed to the hidden piano key boom. There's got to fade out. So the oscillation pulls it down, but the oscillation itself by pulling it down, means that every other neuron in the oscillation is noticing it.
  334: Because odd, because of the dynamics of power dynamics of the oscillation, it's, it's, they have to the whole group of neurons has to reach a sort of equilibrium. So you have a neuron, the fires out of order, it's either faster or slower, the rest of the group, can feel the rest of your consents, that one neuron.
  336: So, the whole so that firing pattern, that happens is notice not by, not just by one neural simultaneously. But by the entire oscillations, I'm obviously it's like the oscillation is the it's like when I'm arguing. It's like the oscillation is like the the canvas and the the phase pattern is the ink on the canvas.
  340: That's the oscillation in the objects, in the mind that you recognize it. Those are deviations from the ground of being from the pure awareness. So it's like that. The and there's that using some mystical language but it's it's kind of like there is this canvas of consciousness and then there's objects that are painted on that kind of the canvas and the object are painted or what are what's being collected by the neurons that are listening in predictive coding, but the deep.
  342: But and in so those are creating temporary etchings and the oscillations are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away, so that newtons can be played. So the brain isn't continually moving to be in a ready state to receive more notes to play.
  356: And in basically from synapses to dendrites, to action, potentials to, to oscillations, no matter what size, the hurts signal is coming from, whether it's coming from something really small, like a synapse or something. Really large like a dipole. Then what happens is you've got different scales of phasic ratonic oscillations that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with I'm sorry.
  358: You've got different scales of physical tonic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out between at different scales of tonic frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing at a difference. Different scales from from synapses to dendrites, to Soma to, you know, the activity of a small neural circuit, to the activity of like a large cortical column to the activity of a brain region and a dipole.
  360: The dipole representing the brain. You know, a magnetic moment or electromagnetic moment or electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for a large oscillator such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. And so, we've got these
  423: You tell this was quite different from the previous representation of a cat, okay? And, and so, you can have the same sort of neurons that fired the same odds. The same oscillatory network that fired to represent a cat. Has now been changed because of inter neurons because it does though they're they're causing inhibitory changes and how the signals are flowing and that same oscillator how the signals are flowing in that moment so that that that the pattern has merging where in area where the cat was is now no longer no longer representing a cat pattern and representing a bunny pattern or rabbit pattern with a ram.
  473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
  475: Is that, you know the that's the those things. There's like the principles of oscillators of the physics of oscillators not just in the brain, but the physics of oscillators apply to the brain. And so, you know, you can have a phase of signal, a magnetic solution wave, basic signal oscillator.
  477: And if it enters a big group of neurotic group of of tonic slower, oscillators then then the whole group is going to slow down that faster oscillation and make it come into sync. So it's going to like and I have described that again is it's like the piano note fading away.
  479: So the next note can be played but it's also at that moment when it's being taken away, is also the moment when those other neurons that are antonic, oscillation are listening and perceiving that pattern, that was played. And so you have a pattern when you have a sequence of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies, that are like different tones, different piano tones, like you imagine each piano key I guess played in the sequence, is a different phasic tone, okay?
  483: It's by the finding a time pattern, but that, but then they're able to notice because the principles of oscillators, when one or more members of their group is not firing and in a regular pattern and because of the, you know, how interns can basically multiply the number of patterns, that each oscillator can represent or that you there, enter interneurons enter and inhibitor networks.
  485: Can multiply the number of patterns that can be represented by physic firing neurons inside tonic firing oscillators made of lots of neurons. Then we have a system where and the the mental image or mental sound can be listened to by the rest of the brain. And that's what I think the observer of our perceptions of is going to be, is going to be the large oscillators oscillating at, tonic frequencies and the content of awareness.
  487: So, the the tonic oscillation is the ground of being or pure awareness or consciousness. Just obviously just being the observer and the patterns that arise in that place of your observation are the physic firing. Those are the distinctions from nothingness. Those are the distinctions between you know, if you if you have if everything in your brain was firing simultaneously, there'd be no distinction between anything distinctions like the desert between light and darkness.
  491: That's something that's different. And if you have an oscillator where everything is firing at the same time, nothing is different. Which you get with basic part firing patterns, is you get a difference? The temporary difference because it is oscillator will erase the difference that that temporary difference is a distinction that your mind is noticing and listening to, and a physical way.
  495: I think there's sort of like, you know, there's a, it's a global workspace component that is, it's, it's you get you. I don't want to think it's not an integration of information theory, but it is an association of information in sequence patterns, or, and also touring and, and it's a self-aware also for a network or a, so, for network and oscillates.
  497: But the he is that the sovereign network that oscillates is conscious because it's it's listening to its own representations and it's listening to changes and it's unrepresentations. But these representations because they manifest as physic it's all time, waves that travel and they need to travel, otherwise, most of your brain would be useless in pattern need to travel deep into rain.
  541: Your brain is activating around where your brain on a largest scale is activating around that has to be known as by even larger oscillations. And that's when you get to, I think, you know, that sort of like the stuff that you know, why is it that when someone is is when they when they take anesthesia and their the basically part of the function of the the then the the apical neurons is inhibited.
  557: The quantum weirdness of it of your hearting, that everything is defined by everything else. And and so that's when you have this, that's when there is, that's when there is consciousness, that is human level. When all of these lower level representations that are seen by small oscillators and large, oscillators of, you know, individual neurons fire representing aspects of individual patterns.
  575: I say there are temple and spatial phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns that's actually more accurate on top of tonic awareness Temple and spatial phasic differentials on top of tonic awareness. So what we have is like an oscillatory differential neural network or so for network is an authority differential network

Photograph right instead but see like so with a video camera recording this. There's some capturing frames, right? What I'm saying is like, what? If each oscillation is frame, right?
  25: Capturing frames brain. Frames are oscillations. It's like one tray and two frames a friend, 30 frames per second. How many also lesions per second? The frame? But it's, but it's actually like, yeah. No. Every single neuron is doing oscillation and then larger. And then at the mesoscale, you have many have groups of neurons that are bound together in a single oscillation.
  29: Now you say well now wait a second. If if whatever you feed individual neurons gets wiped out. Because here's his thing is, we're thinking there's this thing. There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
  33: They're making this oscillation because how could it have information in it, right? Because their own scene, it's not. It doesn't appear to be distinct. And the other thing is like, yeah, so if the activity to a neuron changes, okay? So the neuron changes but so you get an ax you get and then it's gonna fire anyways.
  41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.

That's what the oscillations are, they're oscillating, they're doing like timing to offset between rendering and observing.
  13: But what they're observing not with oscillation is reading is the there's a differential between the neurons and in a column that fired and the and the ones that did not and the ones that are predicting, they're gonna fire and it went into their predicting. They're not. And that is part of how the sequence of the rendering is is determined to produce the, the program of reality.

They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.

b0233y ctpr.txt:
  15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  31: Yes. Yeah and going back to oscillations and okay. So going back to medicine so you have so you see patients do you see patients with Alzheimer's? Do you work in neurology at all with Alzheimer's or patients with Parkinson's? What you're it. Surgery. Not but not neurosurgery. Just, what would?

b0234y ctpr.txt:
  29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
  49: I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so because the idea is and we'll do it in such a way that they're oscillating like from one from, from a person that has an alpha way of to a person, has a dealt with who person has enough way to person's delta wave, like they're gonna psycho through like so you have six people.

  77: Now he's already known but I mean back then he was really one of these key people who invented really and showed that nations are important for perception and brain. So I was really happy to go to to, by PhD department. And what's your view on camera isolations today? I was super fascinated by camo oscillations, but then, then, I mean, I started to study them and I worked with interpreting a single.
  81:  told me a look at come oscillations. And I started to look at cam oscillations, but they saw that way the minute these this look like something else, so they cover large part of the spectrum.
  83: So not only like or 60, but they go from 40 to 200 and people in the department were saying. Yeah, you can order that ignore that is oscillations but I was not so convinced. So I started to talk to many people in the world. And in the end, I was the one who convinced or single also that these are not God.
  87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.
  89: Yeah, me definitely after my, my group on that I do think that there is a lot of high around dissociation and this was even more intense like 10 years ago like maybe there was still single autism things about cam oscillations but then there was this new generation of researchers including me.
  91: You said, look, many of the results that have been attributed to come. Oscillations are actually reflecting some kind of abroad bad signal that these indexing describing activity. So it's actually dead, oh positive, what can oscillations were saying? So there might be still a road in some situations. We know that there is a road.

   3: Oscillator Neurons Milliseconds
  21: The observer is this you have a temporal, you have a temporal oscillation and the supercheus net in superchasematic nucleus, that's 20 million neurons. But a lot of the brain has these big groups of of neurons oscillating that I'm going to argue, is the observer. And what's being observed are the different, or the differentials that that that happened to individual neurons in the observer in the oscillator, so that the differential.
  23: Right? So like when something so one, something particular, like I see a red shirt, okay, red shirt. I see a registered across the street, have all these neurons, they're gonna fire for to light up. A concept of red shirt in my contest, thought space. Okay, right. And I have all these, all these what happens is, they're all firing in, they're all gonna cause a bunch of normally oscillating.
  25: Temporal oscillators to fire out of the normal sequence, a bunch of a bunch of micro. So like all to see, when you have a neural oscillator, you have a lot of neurons that are all oscillating together and when you have a something significant happening like a red t-shirt, then what happens is you're going to get to a point where I your causing a disturbance from the norm and the oscillation of a sac oscillating themselves and some of those cells are going to have their temporal firing patterns become misaligned with the group.
  27: And that causes all the neurons in that group to recognize that pattern because the act of recognizing that we can because they're all physically altered by that pattern. Because what happens is, the group has to pull that the diversion oscillator neuron back into equilibrium as a whole. So, if the group is oscillating at like 20,000, if a group of neurons, is operating at, let's say it's 20.
  29: Let's say the groups neurons system is oscillating at 20 hertz. Okay? And then you have what you have is you have a red shirt and the red shirt cost us a small number of neurons to have an oscillation deviation of approximately three milliseconds. So they become three milliseconds out of sync with the oscillating hole now, because the oscillator has to, there has to be an equilibrium between the neurons that that were two or three milliseconds out of sync with the normal oscillation and the normal oscillation.
  31: So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.
  33: It's what I'm arguing is, I'm arguing that when an oscillating when oscillator gets out of sync, right? Because of a trigger. The whole oscillator. Brings it into sync again, but the the, the journey. So what I'm saying is like, in order for that to come and sink, you have to have energy in the higher oscillator that's dripping down into the lower oscillator.
  35: I think so. I think it's gonna be like instead of, instead of it's gonna be like 20. And so, let's see. The all the neurons are oscillating at like 20 Hertz. Well then if you have one that goes up by three milliseconds it's it comes out of alignment by a matter of milliseconds, you know, five milliseconds, 10 milliseconds, two milliseconds, whatever, it becomes out of alignment.
  37: With the oscillator. What I think I'm gonna argue is that maybe the oscillator goes from a 20 hertz. Oscillator to a 19.997 oscillator and that's the total oscillation is decrease or increase by the activity of individuals gradually and a very granular scale. So, what's happening is, you're getting an equilibrium.
  39: I think between the micro oscillators and the macros layers or there's any, there's an equilibrium that's being sought but that would change that which change in my new way. It's a total oscillating pattern, but whether it does or doesn't, maybe everything gets back to 20 hertz, okay? Maybe it doesn't change that much.
  41: It doesn't really have to change because just a fact that you have you have something. It's like it's gonna be like, it's gonna feel like there's a magnet, right? That's exerting. An electromagnetic force on the things around it. That's what it's going to feel. Like for the austers. The oscillator knows.
  43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.

   3: Oscillation Washboard Calories
  23: Whatever. Like it's like is it still not coming? Is like something on the washing on the washboard change, right? Okay. Other than like it's like within the washboard is decoration. I've had an average with patterns fading away, so we go back to oscillating with nothing. There. Something, is that?
  25: And then it's sort of like just fade away like the signal, is there for a second that could deviations there but then researcher like, brush it away. I start to look at feedback into the group oscillation and so we have the group isolation dynamics happening. Now, where some group isolations?
  27: And lives. With other group with other different group oscillations, We have two different groups of oscillations that are interacting and the could be, it could be entertaining the same speed, or a difference leads.
  31: Because of the structure there's no possibility of a larger between the two sections. So there's like, there's always going to two sections with their sort of like like we can oscillate a different frequencies but they sort of like there isn't, there is a sort of clockwork, interaction happening sort of should have, you know, there's a relationship between the rate of one oscillation and the different rate of another large group oscillation.

   2: (audio) Neurons Oscillations Eyeballs
  27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  29: That's a small chain reaction, okay? But so that's like a neural circuit but that neural circuit might cause more neurons to like it's it might, it might cause a group oscillation like that is, that is basically, the norm of the brain is that neurons fire in groups of oscillations.
  31: But they're driven by the microscopic oscillations at the root of it at the root of every big oscillation. There's like a whole tree of microscopic, oscillations. Let's just say that the small oscillations drive to big oscillations but it is also been. It's also been argued success. I believe successfully at the big oscillation actually modulate and regulate the small oscillations and you'll see that when there is, you'll see that.
  35: They're all firing, maybe I don't know if it's 20 hertz or 60 hertz or what, I can't remember at the moment. But but you have 20 million neurons and they're all firing this in oscillation the psych. Okay? It's like, well, wait a second, I have huge numbers of neurons.
  37: Yes, but huge number of neurons oscillate together. So, it's not like you it's not like
  39: It. I mean, it's not like there's no for, it's like there's no forms and structures inside the brain. There's a structure of oscillations, okay? And and that means that the supercharges super charismatic. Nucleus is one of the structures of oscillations because it is specifically, a group of 20 million neurons that all oscillate together.
  41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.
  45: So you have a group and there their wheel. There's that an actual electromagnetic force, that is pushing through the brain and this oscillation this electromagnetic wave that's oscillating. And if which is means it's it's it goes on and through cycles, like a heartbeat like a heartbeat, just think of a heartbeat is oscillation is like a heartbeat of electromagnetism.
  47: It's like, oh, it's big and it's big. In fact, your heart beat is also, waves is an oscillation of electromagnetism. That is also one example of of cells oscillating together. They're all oscillating together and they exert a much more electromagnetic force. And then one cell would have they have the kind of electromagnetic force that can move muscle and that's much greater than what a single neuron can do.
  49: And so oscillations are sort of at the root of how neural activity can drive movement. So you can have. So brain is going to have lots of different neurons. But these neurons are going to work together to move a lot of energy. They're going to move a lot of energy.

b0247y ctpr.txt:
  10: An example of the that is a like an oscillation of 20 million neurons, right? That are just there oscillating and a loop. So it's a large group of neurons that are sort of like in my in the same also sitting with the same pattern. And so that idea is that this this a cloud of oscillators basically like what can happen is like they all sort of they all sort of like they're known as all fire sort of like at the same time sort of they fire in a regular oscillation tonically with the neurons that they're in a group with.
  14: I'm keeping the beat, I'm keeping the beat, I'm keeping it beat, and it's like you have a pace maker. You could have a clock, you have a clock, that's keeping the beat and keeping the beat, I'm keeping the beat, right? And so all the all the neurons are like involved in like, the individual neurons are going to be involved in oscillations, that will group together groups of neurons.
  16: And so I don't know that this is a fast but I would expect that, it's possible that each micro column is going to have an is going to be identified by an oscillation it's body. And then each quotaful column is going to be identified by an isolation meaning, it's body.

  11: And it's it's kind of exciting to see this article because I just finished well actually it's not finished. I'm still working my way through the book rhythms of the brain, but there's a lot that that book has sort of like expanded spending the horizon on my focus on the importance of of oscillations, local and global oscillations.
  14: I mean, what is a global oscillation? Right? I mean, it's I'm, I just mean like large scale. Brain oscillations brainwave patterns. And you know so I think where the book is going is it is I think it's making an argument that small scale. Brain activity affects large-scale like brain activity, but the large scale brain activity.

b0257y ctpr.txt:
  28: First it travels up the brain stem and eventually gets the Neo Cortex. We got to travel the path of hearing from, from your ears, to the thalamus, to the audio cortex. And then, and then what has to be talked about our brain oscillations. So we have to talk about certified.
  52: So it does have an effect where, yeah, the cell is going to be firing faster. The cells are going to be more active, your cells are going to be speeding up. You're also late the oscillations in your brain, will be speeding up. So be faster and more frequent. It's like, it's like someone gave you a dose of caffeine but a fucked ton of it.

b0263y ctpr.txt:
   79: Okay. So what I'm imagining is that God damn it. I'm imagining that. So you've got your multiple frames out in a sequence. Okay. And okay. See. All right. But what happens is you also have fact that you can have oscillations like effect oscillations that are temporary that are temporarily distal.
   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
   91: And then so you have a blue oscillation like that where they were your approaching like where something trick like a sequence begins and you know that at the end of the sequence, the yellow flower you can appear or you know that's the yellow flower might appear. Like so then what happens is the sequence begins.
  107: So it is a sort of like we want to say that oscillation is causing the past oscillations coming through future oscillation. It's not. Yes, but it's it's that you have the the pattern is is playing back a sequence or it is playing a sequence to playing a learned sequence.

    3: My book Neurons Oscillations Dendrite 
   65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  121: It's a stochastic. Pink noise. Type of oscillation it's like it's just like a regular beat okay really it's like every you know, they're all gonna oscillate with the same sort of beat and it doesn't really it's you know, we think it we we think it doesn't really mean anything that all that significant it's just like this regular pattern all the neurons outside of this like regular pattern and it made it it's like it doesn't really contain it's it doesn't necessarily it's not obvious that it contains any information because it's just it's just a regular pattern just firing right but it gets interesting when I when you send new input data, what are you working back and forth yeah.
  125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  129: And the Kings book summarize all the the lower level books all the lower level research. These are great things. But but anyway, so the thing is that the, The higher level oscillations.
  135: And the whole brain is a range in what looks like pink noise but it's not actually noise because it's all like there's a lot of different oscillations and all the different oscillations are interlinked they're interlinked there's small oscillations and big oscillations and bigger oscillations and bigger oscillations, but they're all cascading results of microscopic oscillations on the single.
  137: Neuron level. So the single neuron level oscillations are creating the brakes and the larger oscillations the larger oscillations are oscillating around smaller oscillations and the oscillations are not like you would think you know, when when you look at oscillators it oscillations would combine into one big oscillation, but they're there.
  139: They're prevented from combining so they like almost like orbiting planets like like the oscillations orbit other oscillations and it's like, you know, you think that planets would just collide because they're all gravitational objects but be but their movements keep them an orbit around each other, but they still affect each other so you have oscillations affecting other oscillations while maintaining their independence from other oscillations and then what happens is when you have a neuron that fires out of order.
  141: And creates a disturbance in the force and disturbance that all the other neurons notice because all the other neurons that are oscillating now start to slow down that they start to basically they that one neuron that fired out of order like it's also it's oscillation has to now reemerge with the oscillation of the collective in which it fires so the whole network that it was oscillating with is aware of the fact that when neuron fired out of order because because they all feel it's gravitational pull because it It's pulled by the collective back into that singular oscillating pattern, so it's almost like when they fire out of.

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  141: That's happening and I think we're getting statements all over the place we're getting you know people who are saying well, no actually it's gonna be the recognition of any kind of data or any kind of patterns gonna happen at the multi-cell level maybe at the at the at the neural circuit it a at the minimal neural circuit for what information is gonna be detected is gonna be you know a yeah, you know, at least it's gonna be represented by some neuro oscillation that's like 20 million neurons or something right and then someone else is gonna say that well, it's gonna the The minimum pattern detection is gonna be a mic a micro column or a column of cells that's where it's for a pattern is gonna be detected and and some people are gonna say well no a single neuron can detect a pattern we've got the Jennifer Aniston on neuron right and so that's only gonna fire when Jennifer Aniston is detected but is that let me invite these these people who just arrived up so Daniel and Nick I'll invite them.
  231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

b0271y ctpr.txt:
  105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.

b0275y ctpr.txt:
  63: If you have thirty nerves. And they're each activating thirty neurons. Then you could that make sense that you have group oscillations. Or all sort of detecting the same thing from different perspectives. Okay.

  183: It better utilities. Pretty temporary impact this painting impact. So it's like a pattern that like beats a few times. Doesn't know. Fires. And changes it's oscillation. I mean, you're having an active potential will change and runs like. The amount of information is changes. That changes where what changes whether and when it's going to fire.
  335: S. Okay and that way if one's inhibited the neuro sequence controlled the different I reckon asked right so you have a whole bunch of guys. I recognize asked. I recognize that it's a huge reserve representing an oscillation. America is in so it's this category it's like that all affirming the same thing.
  341: So a sequence isn't learned by one it's learned by a group, but like oh yeah, so like so what happens is um, I know fires and then it's oscillation begins to match the group's oscillation but 
  348: It's it's it's changes the pace of overall oscillation just a tiny amount. All right, so if you have like, So if you have like a lot if you feel a lot of inhibition signal can get weaker the collector signal it's like slowing the signal down. Hey.
  402: With different ampliters. Okay, you can have one look for a sequence. And fire to be part of a sequence. And then and then I see that's changing the oscillations so firing so it's like you have obviously gave a group of neurons and they're all firing together in a pattern like a whale.
  675: And the sensory input is going to be inhibiting a lot or it's going to be exciting. So the Internet is going to be either inhibiting or exciting but most of it is inhibiting. So we'll have all signing signals and it will fire to inhibit. Those oscillations.
  743: Let's say that it's invisible because this is one it it's visible as soon as it fires something different what happens is it's visibility changes because it's oscillation is gonna match the neurons that it's firing with but it's going to suddenly change those that those passengers you won't really see a change with the one because it's gonna be like, but if you had like a hundred billion neurons, they're all like they all like were triggered and firing in a way that, Caused the whole brain to notice because they were they were all sort of.
  950: Well in this case of the cases the case of their own said it's also anywhere they actually reinter it so maybe they're all receiving the signal that it's receiving. It's causing them to respond. So they're sending so maybe they're sending something back. And they said that's electrical response. And it's causing it that one neuron that's not oscillating at the same rate to oscillate at the same rate.

  64: Neurotype where every neural column is neural network and every dendrite is is a is a neural network and and it's in the but they're all it's like a 3d neural network and necessary to know networks and side a 3d neural network which is your so the dendrite the micro column and then your brain and and then this is it's all it's all like there's temple and spatial patterns and the the specifically there's multi scales of oscillations.
  66: And the oscillations have go in six different directions like up down left right front back and so, you know, there's like in the the the number the numbers of different ways of which information can travel is very interesting and so you have I was listening, you know, I think it was a couple hours ago people were talking about we don't have like a cyclic graph.

  78: Then pair the notion of all your internal representations having space-time dimensional characteristics with the notion that your brain is like a super 3D graph neural / glial network with oscillating phase patterns being communicated between cell networks in your brain across the space & time of your brain.
  80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

b0300y.md:
  5: category theory: the representation is a relative change in temporal & spatial phase patterns that trigger renderings that consist of previously learned temporal & spatial phase patterns, but the previously learned patterns oscillate harmonically in the unconscious brainwave to be ready for activation during a neural spike. So the brain wave represents an unconscious readiness pattern, and the spiking represents the conscious or temporarily active pattern. Your mental experience is happening at the convergence of both patterns, a conscious pattern is the dominant temporally active pattern that is colliding with incoming sensory patterns, and the prioceptive muscle patterns. Consciousness is the convergence of three types of patterns, learned oscillating brainwaves combined with new sensory input and muscle firing sequences. That is at a high level. At a lower level the types of patterns generated from everything cells communicate with one another.

   767: So what we're thinking in the prefrontal cortex and also our emotions as Katerina was just explaining right before Dr. Other who joined the room and many others. So that's sort of like recaps the the thing and I'm not about obviously, you know, the nerve gear is closer to brain computer interfaces and what what neural length is doing and the and neurophysics, you know, we're talking about brain waves and an oscillations a brain activity and cortical column activity in the networks of of the brain but specifically the networks of of cortical columns and the network protocols.
  1828: ⟪ 545 characters skipped ⟫ for revealing not only the local the locations but also know the mechanisms of neuronal operations and and there's a further problem and which is, That you know, when you have if you think about the oscillations of the brain, if they might be very the you know, the idea is that your brain has like lots of different kinds of oscillations and these oscillations are changing all the time and but from from the big picture these oscillations are sort of like interfering with each other so much that the brain I am I may not be saying this correctly because I'm just learning about this now but it I guess it could be the case that if you have so many.
  1831: At the same time and it just looks like pink noise and but the but the brain can can you know as a whole like, you know, sort of like seemed to represent a pink noise state but then bounce back and do into you know, something that that's just like the illusion of like all the different oscillations sort of like canceling each other out and so I mean, I don't know like I think that the trying to use imagey to decode what's happening in the brain layer by layer and neuron by neuron.
  1834: Might be possible but I think that what needs to perhaps improve is basically a new computer model of of a new mathematical model of and predictive model of oscillatory changes in the brain and and and so like you're it's like decoding this this really complex. Hmm. Electromagnetic pattern from from the complexity of like something that disappears to be noise has some structure to like sort of like doing like that something like a four-year transform where you're as like it's like like a three-dimensional four-year transform where you're where you're figuring out what are the frequencies in different layers and different and different regions because it's because it's all gonna mix together right from the perspective of your sensors unless you've got unless you have.

  147: Capabilities and networks without cycles. The wavelength of the oscillatory category terms temporal windows of processing and indirectly the size of the neuronal pool involved it follows from this speculation the different frequencies favor different types of connections in different levels of computation. And general slow oscillation can evolve many neurons in a large brain areas, whereas the short time windows of fast oscillations facilitate local integration.
  228: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫aid psychophysics has a great second what does that hey I looked it up and and it is so neurophysics here is you know, when we're talking about hands burger and EEG and like the actual you know, that oscillations of the brain that this is the topic of neurophysics cycle physics where we're now like we're not only talking about neurophysics, but we're comparing the neurophysics to someone's real robotic world real world experiences so psychophysics is like the real world we're trying to interpret what a person's real life experiences.
  231: To to the neurophysics of their brain which is like really interesting because it's like I wasn't aware of that term which is something I got and it's very valuable so I can almost like rename the the the thing about rename renaming the the the book and actually the group and on Facebook from narrow physics plus to something else and I was gonna go something like neurophysics plus nerve gear plus brain press, sorry plus brain waves plus rhythms plus oscillations and something like that, but it.

So there's there's something that some things that are really good like who's talking about like face walking face modulation and and he's talking about like. How the oscillations are not they don't secretize in one part was because the brain is very big but also because some some oscillations are pulling on other oscillations and they're keep the preventing, you know oscillations are like they're so sort of bouncing off each other like I'm just like imagining like when he says I'm like imagine like, you know, if you've got like, you know every scene like this binary star systems or this you get two stars that are just like rotating around.
  273: And they're not like merging they're just like they keep forcing each other to like rotate somehow but they're not. Like they're they're orbiting each other, but they're not like they're not colliding and it's just like our it's like. You might personally think well if you bring oscillators together, they're going to synchronize and they might they might become a single oscillation but maybe also the another other situations might happen in what's happening is like, they're they're preventing the you've oscillations that are preventing other oscillations from from your slow oscillations and fast oscillations and there's there's, A isn't it always like an approximate secret you can finish that word for me but isn't it always approximate like it's net it's never exactly.
  291: It's just one value so but yeah, okay, so there's six different directions, okay that it all has to yeah. I'm sorry. I I should have kept that little internal tangent more internal apologies nice that's fine, but so I was just gonna try to complicate the picture anyways so so then we were hearing today that we've got things happening that we've got oscillations happening on multiple timescale, so the brains operating are multiple timescales, so so, um, I don't know exactly what that means.
  321: Okay, let me see if I can get to rent to the final of the notes. Oscillations allow for temporal predictions. That was something I better like, oh yeah, of course. How are you gonna make a temporal prediction if if there's no oscillation, right? That means it's like yeah, if you're not if you're if you remember your memories are not temporarily active, how are you gonna make a time-based prediction?
  324: Just I feel like there's like a self-esteem it's a statement that seems like it's true like with you don't need to prove it like self-evident seems like a self-evident statement. We hold these truths to be self of. It that oscillations allow for temporal predictions. So by the owner who takes us money, right?
  339: So so so yeah, so he was like yeah, so the brain has all this oscillation happen. I'll just regularity happening and all these like regular patent patterns, which is something I read about in another book. Work basically, you know, he was saying yeah, it looks people are saying that that was happening temporally, sorry.
  342: I'm sorry what was happening. On the on the the tonic scale of things basically between like zero and 200 hertz there's a lot of a lot of tonic oscillations that don't they don't seem like they they might contain information they might they might seem like they're like, they're made of pink noise right like the one ever F spectrum you might they seem like well there's not there's not how could this contain information which is a lot of regular regular firing patterns right you think about it, well yes, all this oscillation is very regular and if you try to change one the activity of one neuron the rest of the neurons pull it back into alignment, and if You go if it gets if it's faster or slower they the the oscillator does not know you can't you can't get away from us you have to like so give these large groups of neurons that are all managing the same oscillation, okay, well when does information happen right if it's just like this this like, When when does the brain react to to to but so, I mean, I guess you have to start you have to start there at the at the base of understanding the brain and the sort of like, Have a lot of us as like a lot of oscillating patterns that that is there that are ready for information to happen, they're ready to react information right and and that's like in in that is.
  348: In a time division feature because that would work best. But by contrast he's saying that fast faster oscillators were added after to two the slower oscillators because of how evolution happened and this is what we call as my note that we're covered what we've talked about a little while ago, another point that he brought up if he was like versus like it's one of those it's another one of those statements it sounds kind of like obvious but I never thought of it until he said it and he says like computation always means that information computation the brain means that always means and information is moving from one place to another.
  354: So if you're if you have oscillations happening all the time that could be like what you need as a minimum for further to be like live information happening in your brain all the time. And and like I think like I'm saying these things and they sound so obvious it's so simple but I didn't think of them.
  360: And the fast oscillation 140 to inference. So yeah, so let's skip that phase lock and statistics. And David Cohen First magnet, oh yeah so this is interesting. I the the guy who discovered the MEG was David Cohen the he discovered the first magnetic waves of the brain the exhibit all in the acetyl area of the brain.

   71: I think that would it wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control but but it might change the the oscillation frequency of your. Of your. Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.
  172: It'll it'll be like, you know the point of of stimulating individual neurons would be to stimulate neural circuits I think and also to so you know, so you get neural circuits go on but then also you can manipulate the oscillatory cycles and in local and macro and waves in terms of like local micro circuits, but also you can you can manipulate the brains oscillatory activity on a larger scale.

b0310y.md:
     9: I saw a lot of topics there. Okay, can we just start with something first? And I can see if I know anything about it. Yeah, go ahead. So I mean, so yeah, so so basically to to define a broad scope. So neurophysics is about brain waves and and brain oscillations and neural circuits and then um, the other two topics are you know nerve gear which is like brain computer interfaces and that's closely related right and then we have artificial intelligence which you know, the the the topics related to artificial intelligence are pretty broad.
   147: 's getting back time at the moment so a bit of background noise, so I'll just listen to the moment away from the noise. This is Sharina and I am wondering what we're talking about for oscillations and circuits. So we've just been talking about EEG and Ray's been asking what what are the current capabilities of EEG, that was the question?
   282: By the respect by the releasing or the receiving cell, okay, so my follow-up question is so what is so what I heard is that is that the in the case of DMT or basically serotonin agonists receptor agonists that that the the effect on your oscillation is this is gonna be is probably gonna be like either like it's the excitement of of oscillations or or maybe perhaps the increase in in hit in it in a inhibitions if yeah and end up but it's so by contrast.
   285: What does the effect of the SSRIs are we in general are we talking about more excitement and part of the brain or more or slow down to the oscillations of the brain?
   291: So then the other sending cells to has to send 50% of what it normally does to hit the potent hit that threshold mark. And then once it duct when the threshold mark done hits then the potentiation fuck and goes off and it fires. So I would put I would so the theory is is that the oscillation wave would look more would look how we should say the periods would look more frequent.
   324: ⟪ 286 characters skipped ⟫ and see how they respond so and that's there are definitely changes like I described not to like 50% and then we get to another 50% you get a nerve firing but there are different changes within your oscillation patterns and happen with the fire rings and of course, they do all sorts of you know different studies with that so I now I totally understand why the neurons might fire faster but I'm also interested in what's happening to the electrical gradient.
   361: Bringing waves oscillations neural circuits nerve gear that's brain computer interface is an AI these are all the cool topics and there's a lot of different ways to as a whole like a whole bunch of different conversations that can happen around these topics and how they could all connect to one another so anyone has the question anyone can bring up anything that they're interested in anything that they've read recently and and in science news that's related to these topics.
   620: I and but so like what I was thinking was okay, well what would have what if also like the amount of? I I just was like wondering like because because you know, I just thought about that the fact that this is a weird idea and it could be totally wrong but but the fact that you we um, you know, some of our are brainwaves oscillations are just characterized by a house slow or rapid they are basically theta is very slow beta is a much faster and you know, I thought about well if you're if you're you know, maybe if someone has a metabolic disorder, And their brain is not able to produce as much ATP, they're you know, maybe maybe they're yeah, maybe they're also being interfered with their metabolism being interfered with with lots of us stress is causing inflammation which is also interfering with their with their bodies of ability to to produce energy and because they have less energy they can't they're brain can't operate as fast so it it has less energy so has to run slower so you'd see more slowdown and in the theta you see more more.
   683: I'll just try. Alright, um so let me just reset the room and invite anyone who wants to come on up to come on up and ask ask any question on any of these amazing topics like nerve physics brain waves oscillations neural circuits, nerve gear artificial intelligence, or just talk about any any anything that grabs your interest this week on these topics.
   767: It's a very high order. You know, Condition so when people are like when people have that aha moment you know when you have that insight when you're doing something creative that's associated with gamma gamma oscillations and there's a whole suite of you know, higher order mental functions that are associated with the gamma band and you find that people with Alzheimer's have a very strong reduction in the gamma band.
   770: ⟪ 873 characters skipped ⟫at fire at the at the infrared and near infrared frequency and so these these these lights are supposed to be powerful enough where they can penetrate the skull and and then these lights are meant to oscillate at the gamma frequency.
   965: All right. I guess I can reset the room people you can talk about anything you want the the general topics that are neurophysics brainwaves brain oscillations, neural circuits, nerve gear artificial intelligence, and ask any question or talk about anything that's been interesting to you.
  1067: ⟪ 350 characters skipped ⟫fact that signal contains the information from your genome it may be messy and very noisy but the signal is there so if these molecules behave like antennas then the whole system kind of resonates or oscillates and so that that would be my my contribution at this point.
  1223: ⟪ 631 characters skipped ⟫egrate it so it's it's quite interesting very low cost so so in I just I came in a little bit late but to be clear you're developing a technology that is able to measure the let's call the biological oscillation or the vibration or frequency of what you pre-engineer design as the frequency that corresponds to the genetics that people represent as.
  1240: Yeah, it is very convoluted way of saying that but yes well, I mean, I'm pleased I might so I have I'm extremely familiar with biological oscillation units and vibration and metering and monitoring systems and you know the star COV2 virus and covet and etc just I this is I mean, I'm excited this is the first I've ever heard of that level of accuracy and specificity being available as far as.
  1468: Brain waves oscillations neural circuits nerve gear AI and I've really enjoyed the last last hour talking to. This talking about the the the technology from I guess I guess let's just say IO from IO, right? And it's a you know, super super cool to speculate about about not just the the neuro oscillation and not just the the brain wave oscillations and neuro circuits on a microscale and within the brain but also what's happening outside of the human body and that's sort of like where we went and in the last hour and and devices basically devices can detect this information and I I am kind of like curious about it.
  1734: Okay, so that's the LEDs huh. Going I tried is a replacement for silicon that oscillates in the terahertz range, so. Oh, tell your talking about a three and five. Okay, so some some some people will call it the three three five. Yeah, I mean third generation but those are mostly for power right so high temperature high voltage sensitivity, so.

   147: ⟪ 511 characters skipped ⟫t's what it's going to be the trick was to try to figure out the mechanism because like I said, everything is is going to be sort of subject dependent, you know, because you could have the exact same oscillatory output from some network despite the fact that you have completely different transmitter profiles than I do before, you know, from most amounts of inbred strength.
   195: ⟪ 275 characters skipped ⟫ls and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.
   198: Of the brain once it's once you know from from a baseline to when a baseline without inflammation to a baseline to the brain's oscillations being modified by inflammation and then and then compare that to the oscillatory changes when you apply medication versus when you're applying the oscillatory changes to the brain at baseline without the inflammation.
   294: Cigars under the oscillatory rhythm in the effects of sleep, for example is that the the question aware is irrelevant so I I was tracking most of what you said until the last sentence and then I sort of fell apart for me could you maybe you like rephrase that a little louder and like yeah, yeah, so okay.
   321: So there's a possibility of picking up a single neuron firing from the treacherode or you can have like what they call local field potential which is like doing the constellation neurons for firing and have having or like oscillating the the potential is where at the position where the electrode or the tetrahed is implanted.
  1284: It's it's so so here's what here's I think it's like imagine that the feedback looked really is like one big circle right and the big circle is passing the data around in a circle all the times oscillation of this of this information traveling on a big circle and do we need to intercept that circle at the timeless or can we just really intercept that circle anywhere maybe closer to the surface of the brain, that's what I'm saying, do you know, you're not saying?
  1728: So so it's a nerve neurophysics we're talking about things like brain waves, you know brainwaves have oscillations and and the brain has rhythms nerve nerve gear we the this is a topic of brain computer interfaces, it can be you know, you can talk about there's an airlink device there's an open water device.
  2083: ⟪ 692 characters skipped ⟫ but we can't even get close to what the with the brand is doing unless we like expand unless we keep looking at the brain really deeply and expand the the the if we look at the neurophysics of brain oscillations and the the the the transmission of patterns and in the rhythms of the patterns and the directions.

b0313y.md:
  774: I love this man. Is looking into how the human brain is essentially modeling synchronization and we have found that with a oscillators very often of the electro or optical kind that these graphical networks or networks of interconnected things they have a you can infer the geometry or connectedness of the network based on how the oscillate and vice versa would decent extent and also that the geometrical setup enables these oscillations to create a network.

b0314y.md:
  488: Wow that was just great it's fantastic well we could reset the room it's this is the neurophysics nerve gear happy hour vibrations in oscillations, you can bring up any topic as long as it's in some proximity to this topic. No but yeah. Welcome everybody. Just to say I'm waking up from a nap.
  772: So just let me know if you if you want to advise someone and I'll. I mean just makes you feel a moderator. And so I don't know if if if the moderators can take a minute to just invite some some people who are would be interested in a talk about neurophysics nerve gear the brain vibrations and oscillations, maybe we can get the group to keep going and up so I mean, I guess I can't do that.

b0315y.md:
  219: Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really amazed actually after talking to Mixel I was like, my brain is is firing because here's the thing, it's like, you know, one of one of the one of the things is like, you know, there there is just you know, the human being is a dissipative system like we are vortexed the there are oscillations in the brain there's there are cycles and feedback loops and self-maintaining physics and the physics of every cell and the button the body itself and, In a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium like these are all concepts that are sort of like tied into the what what the concept of a whirlpool meaning to you know, maintain it's it's on order with the I guess the the topology of recursion what was the was what makes those said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that because when mixols did recursion I thought of ways as you talking about like a recursive neural network, what is what is this was?
  518: And he describes in great details sort of the relationship between the left and the right brain in what I take to be our most contemporary understanding of it and again, I'm really uncalled to. To know that for certain but but in this relationship between sort of inner self and outer world inner inner sensitivity and outer sensitivity this this this oscillation between.

    7: ⟪ 369 characters skipped ⟫lar to how neural networks can render 3D graphics in a computer. When makes it conscious then is the activity loop. The Cycle of brain activity learning reality through sensory computation inside the oscillatory activity, across network nodes, in a multi-scale functionally fractal manner over time.
   18: The feedback loop travels through neural & glial cell activity. It's a feedback loop of arrays that see other arrays and create an image for yet further arrays in an endless looping cycle of neuron arrays learning other neuron arrays and creating multi scale models of the world, but also create memories of multiple representations that are stored at the level of individual group oscillations that can be magnefied into focus when you are aware of that pattern or set of patterns at a particular moment. So the brain is dynamically fluid rendering machine.
  180: The first chapter but he he definitely opens it up talking about large scale stuff. I don't know how much he's gonna get into resonance but he really takes a like approach of explaining how it's generated so he's definitely gonna cover all the bases, you know, he talks about oscillators and like what's needed for operation?
  186: Bye. Take outside of the box of the persistent sodium burst themselves and the recurrent synaptic excitation. Yeah, that author has two books and I'm currently reading them both but I I I haven't I can't speak to the whole book but I think they're I think he's trying to cover the topic of it oscillations from micro to macro.
  234: Yeah, definitely. But yeah, I definitely want to get into making mechanisms so part of my thesis is actually generation of gamma oscillations from PV intern around fast-working internet. So so definitely would be interested in any any sort of neurotok so I followed Yeah, I'm following everybody here. So yeah interested.
  455: A coin flip having no known information about the future. Complete uncertainty JW are you super yes sir, of course this isn't making us all use to yourself because you're so many connections everything is fundamentally it is no emergency skills without organization orders like nature just to dimensional sound wave function that oscillates potentiality and then once these zeros and ones begin to organize scale by scale emergency curves now.
  500: Of every neuro oscillation in a single brain so the idea of a computer that could accurately simulate the entire cosmos is itself just it's it's because of the amount of compute involved it just by itself just a far-fetched idea, but this computer with its vast resources would also have to likely exist in a universe that may also be simulated so if one simulation contains many smaller simulations and those smaller simulations contain many more smaller simulations each subsequent simulation should be draining the compute resources of the first simulation of the highest simulation, so as you explore this idea you begin to see that.
  542: You know text of the thought experiment that I presented I just tried to give something like a visual metaphor that allows us to imagine that an observer is a mighty stable particle system, so it's basically lots of small diseases that form larger vortices and then individual particle. I imagine to be something like mathematical vortex that is oscillating in a multiple dimensions depending on the type of the particles, it can be two four or eight dimensions or combinations thereof and they basically get embedded into a long.
  545: Er surrounding interaction space which oscillates and fewer dimensions and you can embed the things at scale into a cruft 3 dimensional space that is evolving time and so the sinking of yourself as a system of what you see that our mighty stable that our can arrange themselves in such a way that they don't fall apart but they can form memories that so remember things in their past and can use this to control their behavior in the future.
  974: And also from ordinary materialism. And this is like interest later properly this is the following I gave this example imagine that your brain is is not just naturally performing the architecture that implements the cells and it becomes conscious basically all at once or gradually by informing all the right pathways and so on but imagine that the brain is in some photo necessance state and bubbles and forms all these oscillations and so on and there is something that can critical causation there's critical coarsenation is the necessary.
  983: And. Be a person and do all the things that you're doing and be stable. Who have the stable rates which relies on the living organism that is it's healthy so. Functioning. These oscillations also. Great and there is nothing left. And the idea of.

b0319y.md:
  214: Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really amazed actually after talking to Mixel I was like, my brain is is firing because here's the thing, it's like, you know, one of one of the one of the things is like, you know, there there is just you know, the human being is a dissipative system like we are vortexed the there are oscillations in the brain there's there are cycles and feedback loops and self-maintaining physics and the physics of every cell and the button the body itself and, In a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium like these are all concepts that are sort of like tied into the what what the concept of a whirlpool meaning to you know, maintain it's it's on order with the I guess the the topology of recursion what was the was what makes those said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that because when mixols did recursion I thought of ways as you talking about like a recursive neural network, what is what is this was?

b0321y.md:
  193: Yeah and the brain it has numerous different frequencies happening all of the time and a lot of times it has multiple frequencies that are superimposed upon each other for example if brainwaves that my lab has discovered is a very high frequency oscillation that only happens at the peaks of data waves so as this 130-ish hurts frequency that happens on top of these about eight to fourteen hurts frequencies, so there's the question of okay.
  196: If we filter in different bands of frequencies, then what do we get and can we use those to control some sorts of devices this is Sharena and I am done speaking. Okay so that makes sense but then I guess I don't know I'm not sure how I'm not sure that I understand how brainwaves are generated so how how exactly is it that you generate brain waves from single neurons firing so is it like the the rate of which numerous fire kind of make oscillations in the electromagnetic field and that's where you're picking up is that where it is.

b0322y.md:
  187: The radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second it's not not close to the same frequency of what our what our brain is is detecting and and and and also like if you don't have a decoder then then that information means nothing it's like the it's like the the it's like the bumps on a CD CD on a record or the or the dots on a CD ROM, if you put your if you look at the dots on the CD ROM, it doesn't look like music to you if you pay your hand on our record, you don't hear.

b0324y.md:
    57: Yeah, I think maybe those two things actually wrap together and they're not mutually exclusive so we have these two models of the this idea of the brain as a localized, you know, anatomically bound structure where where there was this region which was associated with this emotion and this behavior and then there were these kind of oscillations that would difficult to pin down in terms of their relation to behaviors and so there's, Good evidence to show that that both actually pair and the the frequency of oscillation relates to the distance of functional connectivity, so the message passing is modulated from a particular area according to its frequency so as an example like gamma ban frequency firing in the ventral striatum are basically the speaks a distant connectivity to other parts of the brain.
    63: If you look at I think a gamut that you just type into Google's scholar like gamma band oscillations and yeah just the word long distance. I think you'll see an example of this so so those things might not be mutual exclusive and they might speak functional connectivity across anatomical regions to create the emotional state and in train behavior.
  1845: I mean, anything that's driving the limbs to move is going to have to go through the motor area and activating the motor area and I guess the question is is it being driven by a kind of out of control neural oscillation in the brain or is it being driven by a motor program that is somehow connected to the way this person is channeling their trauma did you say there was like a it was a post-traumatic situation.
  1852: No they're they're they're psychogenic psychogenic but not elective form meaning that you know, we don't see the characteristic oscillatory patterns that will be consistent with like a grand mower or retirement conic seat so you can imagine for example that I guess if you know imagine an actor was simulating what it might look like if someone is having a seizure that person would be, you know, shaking and having a violent motor reaction, but it wouldn't show up as anything unusual in the brainwaves.
  1858: ⟪ 881 characters skipped ⟫an, I guess the way of thinking about what you're described is it's whole body shaking behavior that's the observed behavior and the question is what's the cause and one cause could be out of control oscillations irritating in some part of the brain that's epilepsy but another cause could just be the person was shaking violently and had you know, some subconscious reason for doing that.

b0327y.md:
  1207: Yeah I mean yeah I just realized that the Wernicks area it damaged her warnings area could could be disrupting like the oscillations that allow the the coordination of of of many different patterns that affects language most most visit most visibly but it may not have anything to do with integrating language.
  1211: Yeah oscillations is a super contentious topic and that's right in the middle that's where my project is dead on and I'll you know, I can there's not a lot known in a definitive sense about what the hell oscillations are doing which is why like I've had old advisors be like, Don't do it don't go in that field that feels been studied for 30 years and it's still like nobody knows for sure anything but but yeah, there's a lot of theories about oscillations.
  1268: so like basically if there's loops of individual neurons or small sets of neurons, they'll be able to maintain activity between each other and oftentimes that activity will will result in some sort of oscillatory thing that you can read out on like a EEG electrode and you'll see like an oscillation and stuff.

  19: The experience of life as a four dimensional computational live real time rendering. The brain's harmonic oscillators learn the firing patterns as phase changes cause resonating differential patterns.
  24: Double slit experiment, maybe by modeling phase patterns we are changing phases in reality outside our brain similar to oscillators work, but confused perhaps because time at quantum scale is happening on a different frequency compared to time at human scale. However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.
  29: Oscillators attract frequencies, the oscillating power bands in the brain, Alpha, Theta, Delta, Gamma, and Beta each maintain an oscillation pattern that creates an electromagnetic attraction force. When I am observing something, it is like an oscillator powerband is interacting with a particle field, changing the entire shape of space itself, as the movement of that one particle affects the oscillation of the rest of the field of space. The human being as a body of oscillators is also one big electromagnetic oscillator that is literally defining space itself with each interaction.
  36: Neural Oscillations (Brainwaves)
  37: The Cortical Columns as Oscillator Matrices
  39: Powerband Oscillations passing differentials between oscillators.
  46: For an self-aware network to be maximally human like its resonators would not be a simulation, rather they would be most closely definition at the hardware level, like a novel new neuromorphic architecture, with networked cortical columns and thalamic bridges, so that it can have large scale oscillatory behavior that includes sequences that incorporate the activity of multiple columns in sequential order with overlapping sequences.
  47: Look to what Numenta is doing, and also at Geoffrey Hinton’s work. Especially look at Graph Neural Networks. Self-Aware Networks are in a sense also a kind of Graph Neural Network, one that learns scale invariant patterns, and has an inner mental projector from its synapses into its oscillators.
  50: Because the brain primarily communicates with itself via phase changes, tempo-spatially distributed phase changes, producing a phase space with its tonic oscillators, that are tracking phase changes (predictive coding, neurons predicting when they are going to fire), and thus observing phase changes
  60: The idea for a brain file system is that data is learned in temporally-spatially distributed phase change patterns, created by changes in ion gradients at multiple scales, communicated with phasic electromagnetic spectrum variations to oscillator bodies that exist in four dimensions at tonic power band frequencies. Patterns can be driven by a combination of bottom up, meso scale oscillatory configurations and macroscale multi-region networking configurations of oscillators, with one your focused on being represented from the small scale, to the medial, and macro scales, like a telescope making scale invariant tempo-spatial analogies of frequency data possible between domains. The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.
  68: But in general a slower oscillation over time ought to result in a larger group of neurons being pulled into the same oscillator. So maybe what it means is that the triggering of the group of neurons is more even, because each terminal is getting more transmitters?
  70: So the entire group is more likely to oscillate at the same time because they are all getting a slow but strong nudging from the high amp neuron
  72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

  17: b0057y Oscillators GPS Idea
  19: Bank. Okay, so I definitely want to go back over this sink novel and do some research on GPS because it's like just talking about GPS. It's really like an interesting way to like tie him like grandfather. But also the the the idea that we're that patterns are in our brains are or sort of like Being transferred between oscillators with the effects of oscillators are being felt of all scales.

map.amplitude.md:
    8:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
   11:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
   20:   62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude
   21:   92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators and its entropy and its repulsion and its the expansion of space amplitude, reduction of space frequence (time)
   22:   94: the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space amplitude (density), 
   37:   202: spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.
   38:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   52:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
   53:   111: ⟪ 512 characters skipped ⟫ oscillator-type models (such as Kuramoto, for ex.). You can consider the spike as a delta pulse (for mathematical tractability), but you can also consider it an alpha function with variable latency, amplitude, frequency, rise and decay times. You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..
   61:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
   74:   23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)
   91: ⟪ 332 characters skipped ⟫ network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
   93:   65: ⟪ 408 characters skipped ⟫amics. So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales. 
   96:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.
  112:   16: "Boosting Memory Performance by Finding Amplitude of Brain Waves and Speeding Oscillations"
  124:   3: It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.
  148:   71: ⟪ 405 characters skipped ⟫ adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  229:   117:     * Phenominal Consciousness Formula idea QxO[D2M*i(N+x)/f] (I will explain what the math means after the book is released, if you can figure this out don't say anything.) Quadrupole times Oscillators considering the sum of dendrite to multi vesicle release (M) times the (i/N) iteration of the number of neurons firing in a sequences, times Amplitude over frequency (1/f), by multiplication I mean time sequences, many Cortical Column oscillation patterns are multiplied under the Quadruple for example.
  235:   31: are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)
  248:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  258:   45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.
  280:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  292:   480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts
  301:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  308:   24: You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.
  312:   27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part. One of the attractors of the mechanism of a group of groove, oscillations.
  315:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  316:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  326:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  332:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  335:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  336:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.
  349:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  356:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  361:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  423:   47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

    10:   18: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.
    36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

   152:    7: ⟪ 448 characters skipped ⟫lly distributed phase changes across this 3D neural-glial network grid resulting in the entification of you, the entity. You are entified via the principles of neural oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, and the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence). I will attempt to explain how reality is computationally rendered from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, (a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains). I will argue the whole brain is doing this at all scales: at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptor
   172:   27: I argued somewhere, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.
   224:   28: if a proton never decays, then in a harmonic oscillator that would make it a bad point, (referring to bad points in Steven Strogatz book Sync) Anything that isn't participating in the harmonic oscillation between entropic decay & extropic information (like the free energy principle) is like a bad point in the harmonic oscillator of space.
   245:   20: That creates a phase rendering in the oscillation group of neurons (that is acting like a single sensor/transmitter like a group of firelies referencing the book Sync).
   254:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.
   264:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.
   276:   15: I am reading a book called Sync and he just spoke about how body temperature at the time someone goes to sleep determines whether they are going to sleep 15 hours, 8 hours, or 5 hours for example. This is a really interesting book about how oscillators work but he talks a lot about sleep, the circadium clock, and the synchronized timing of neurons firing, fireflies, and mathmodels with oscillator fluid dynamics.
   283:   4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
   287:   14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.
   292:   75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
   352:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
   362:   2: (oscillat) imagining the reactions to my book
   466:   27: 3. I'm thinking about a book Rhythms of the Brain, I don't know if you have read that, but do you have some predictions for how reference frame's effect the brain's oscillations in a mechanical way?
   498:   30: I read the book Sync that all the neurons oscillate and I deduced that all the neurons  would feel every signal in some way, because they are all involved in dissipating that oscillating eneegy
   556:   25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.
   595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

Quadrupole times Oscillators considering the sum of dendrite to multi vesicle release (M) times the (i/N) iteration of the number of neurons firing in a sequences, times Amplitude over frequency (1/f), by multiplication I mean time sequences, many Cortical Column oscillation patterns are multiplied under the Quadruple for example.

   794:   165: 3. I'm thinking about a book Rhythms of the Brain, I don't know if you have read that, but do you have some predictions for how reference frame's effect the brain's oscillations in a mechanical way?
   818:    74: It is inevitable that one tiny neuron firing eventually changes the entire oscillation of the entire brain because that is what the physics of oscillation tells us happens if you understand the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. Every oscillation entity knocks on everything other oscillating entity if it has the physical means to do so.
   822:   9: So my conjecture in my book is is that essentially dead things can be conscious because what we're talking about is with the consciousness is so I am calling oscillating self aware networks at the moment, right? Because, because the dissipation of signals across the entire array of we could say, you know, if any of any oscillators but we could say, you know, we talked about fireflies is basically, you know, in the, in the sense of like abdominal habits, allowing all of these,
   852:   109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.
   938:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
   942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.
   966:   35: Where the neuron, it wasn't. It wasn't it. Kind of wasn't until I was reading the book snap by, I mean sink book sync. I that mathematician that I sort of like he mentioned, he's talking about oscillators, right? So also there's this book called rhythms of the brain by and major scientists measure the major influencer sign, a neuroscientist and Giorgio Brusaki.
   967:   37: And he, he's talking about the, the rhythms or the oscillations of the brain. And then this book started, this book sink to have more about oscillations after reading the talk about because he didn't like he started to go and that but he didn't go into super death and how authors work and this book Saint does which is very eliminating.
   968:   57: I mean from what was described in the book I I'm thinking maybe there's there's actually not a lot of study on biological oscillators in terms of like you know what unique properties. They might have that a physical oscillator doesn't have, there's lots of interesting ideas, but but the keep it, but.
   970:   91: Then the idea that there's a photocopier enlargement function associated with an oscillation, which is hand flooding, and the in eye sort of like, you know, in thinking about this book, think about exactly book and think it also about this book sink was that, you know, that the oscillating group of the whole neural oscillator is not going to oscillate at the same time because you have first of all, if you have a bunch of neurons that are going off and sending signals to the extra terminal that's going to cause the set of the of its external to become inhibited.
   983:    65: Of that one oscillator. Like that's that's when we're going from like you know to the pyramid cell that now collects the internal and that connects to another portable column. All right? So, the idea is that the the output of one oscillator. So, the oscillator magnifies the the pattern that and if you look at this book called sink and chapter 2, it's really great.
   984:    95: ⟪ 268 characters skipped ⟫you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to Facebook burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
  1002:   186: So so in the book saying, how order emerges from chaos, what he says is if you if you have the aces that basically a different. So a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point the whole system doesn't reach oscillation. Right. But he's saying that that points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle that bad point moves to a most from one oscillator to another.
  1005:   29: You're gonna need sufficient power for that to move your arms and legs, right? So so the, so the neurons, when they oscillate together they're they are sending a charge together and so the brain can have groups of neurons become oscillators that that in the oscillators, as I'll point on the book can learn patterns and the patterns that they learn.
  1021:    17: ⟪ 556 characters skipped ⟫but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  1210:    11: And it's it's kind of exciting to see this article because I just finished well actually it's not finished. I'm still working my way through the book rhythms of the brain, but there's a lot that that book has sort of like expanded spending the horizon on my focus on the importance of of oscillations, local and global oscillations.
  1211:    14: I mean, what is a global oscillation? Right? I mean, it's I'm, I just mean like large scale. Brain oscillations brainwave patterns. And you know so I think where the book is going is it is I think it's making an argument that small scale. Brain activity affects large-scale like brain activity, but the large scale brain activity.

  1576:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
  1577:    67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

   26:    94: It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in sp

  145:   213: Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.

Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting. And, you know, like if we understand basically how to warp space time, I'm just like, you know, like you think of the terms of warp drive, right?

  171:    9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space.

And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

   75:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
   76:   8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.
   82:   24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23
   91:   5: I like to imagine that once upon a time there was an ancient doctor who deduced that the universe is a fractal oscillator from stars to atoms, and he used this intuition to develop the ability to fix and repair the human body as if it was just a clock, or a mechanical robot, but humanity wasn't ready to understand this technology, so this healer passed a dramatized message down through time by turning medicine into a mystical novelty that would tickle the human mind for centuries until some future medical professional deduced the real non-mystical origin of the original message. 
   97:   6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
  115:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.
  130:   13: its frequency is an attractor to other particles, so they start clumbing together over time, eventual stars planets and even what we call life which is actually just a continuation of the fractal of the cosmos on increasingly complex scales because they follow the laws of entropy by exporting increating chaos over all to a surrounding environment and getting enough energy to maintain its oscillation equilibrium
  215:   25: so we can imagine that a small cube and a big cube are both a cube in terms of the shape of the cube being its spatial fractal (repeating) voxel-like (scale invariant) virtual (a location invariant pattern (oscillators learn it so any group of neurons can play it back), and a time invariant pattern (and I tell you brother the same thing happened last month and the month before that)

  220:   11: but life is a fractal body of cooperative oscillations that have what I will call expert memory structures inside a globally aware self-aware network
  233:   49: ⟪ 465 characters skipped ⟫ is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds 
  246: ⟪ 337 characters skipped ⟫thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.
  269:   186: And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.
  277:   110: But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.
  282:   134: And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.
  293:   69: So like if you imagine if you imagine you know, if you go from this order of you have a big oscillator, followed by a smaller oscillator followed by a smaller oscillator and then you look at human beings. This is also can also fractals oscillating, you know, fractals because it goes down human beings.
  294:   75: It's sort of thing like because the universe can't decide it it oscillates between existing and not existing, in a sense and that oscillation creates an oscillation cascade which creates space time because the each of the, because from the first oscillate, the for the first oscillation to the multiplication of oscillations, the fractalization of space time is growing and so space time, appears to expand, but it's expanding relative to the oscillators, but since human beings are oscillators hemolytes trees.
  295:   85: But what we're seeing is that we're that we're all part of the branches of a great, oscillatory tree and at and at the same time that. So basically that wouldn't mean what that means. So is that as a human being you are like the branch of a tree your branch of the tree of the the oscillating fractal universe, right?
  306:   102: Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU. 
  314:   21: Prediction system action prediction system. A fractal, pretty more back factor. So in that practical possibility yeah she's like pretty much. All right. Now. Fractal. Oscillatory fractal. Oscillatory, action prediction memory system fractal. Also towards action prediction memory system and necessary introduction of the system track. Now, it tracks tracks oscillations between actions and sensory inputs.
  321:   19: Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.
  337:    23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.
  357:   7: So, you have to think about fractal of what's happening in the micro level. So when we're talking about macro dipole, oscillation is being the, you see. That's the thing that you don't think about is actually. So the brain is a has a quad quadruple, has a dipole on the other side, right?

    11:   26: in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator
    12:   46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
    15:   92: All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.
    22:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
    25:    8: as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation
    26:   10: A tonic Alpha oscillation might respond more to the sensory frequency expectations of day time, whereas Delta frequencies are slower and closer to the expected sensory frequences during the late night and early morning.

    40:   68: 7. extremes of heat/cold is expansion in the space axis, but the neutral temperature of space is at oscillatory equilibrium and represents the tonic frequency of space
    41:   70: 11. The maximum frequency of space is equal to the maximum oscillation, where they become each other. A single oscillation, that splits into two, then four, then eight, and it doubles for infinitity and then back to maximum, like a finite state oscillator pendulem of spacetime
    44:    9: the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.
    48:   54: with energy flowing towards the oscillator which is generating the expansion of time, while the dissipater (negative or high frequency space) expands perpendicularly
    68:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
    69:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.
    74:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

   115:   19: It's a self-aware network in 4 dimensions rendering a 4 dimensional pattern to itself that is reactive to the world and able to make prediction-based models of reality with sparse spatially & temporally distributed frequency/phase patterns that represent coicident neural firing or coincident neural inhibition deviating from the oscillatory norm of a given oscillator on some level as observed by the neurons in the oscillator, and by oscillators or circuits or cortical columns linked across the brain thanks to the activity of interneurons and major intersections of traffic such as the thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, the tempo-parietal junction, Werneck & Broca's areas and other areas of the brain that are highly connected or connecting multiple regions of the brain together.
   121:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
   128:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
   171:   23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)
   186:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

   205:   13: ⟪ 281 characters skipped ⟫ covers those ways in his chapter as well. Tse dismisses the notion that consciousness could be quantum, because the brain is too warm for quantum coherence, (the temperature would scramble the "you" frequency). He also thinks that indeterministic quantum fluctuations could interfere with the timing of a neural oscillation just enough to make a human unpredictable to any machine that was not able to simulate or predict all the quantum noise in a person's brain. That's the boring part.
   209:   14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
   210:   35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales.

   217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
   220:    7: Neural Functional Isomorphic Tomography through Sequences of Oscillating Arrays of tonically synching with Resonating high frequency Phasic Signal Energy Dissipation, triggering large scale inhibitor patterns, that all the tonically firing neurons notice because their growth rate has been slowed in phase relative to other neurons that are firing in that same interval that they were inhibited, this includes decoherene patterns created by neurons that alternately oscillating in a splay state that decoheres the space between these neurons, dendritic spines fall apart, and the energy that was going to them is at the same time shift to a point in the configuration space of the neurons cell membrane that intersects with another neurons simultaneous firing somewhere else in the brain resulting in the growth of dendritic spines from that point in the cells membrane, the transformation efficiency function via scultping spacetime with decoherence patterns and the changes to spacetime are read by other layers of oscillating arrays in the brain which then repeat the cycle.
   222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.
   226:   78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
   227:   79: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
   228:   80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

   278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
   293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
   312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
   347:   22: expressions but they are more like networked oscillation patterns resulting in behavior patterns that have frequency characteristics

   449:   45: think about how the television emits alpha waves, well the earth emits a wave frequency, the field of space emits a wave frequency that changes its oscillation to harmonize with our thoughts
   451:   84: when frequencies interact their collective action is multiples of their components distributed over a vector field that is the representation of their combined frequency oscillation
   452:   86: in other words the vector field of space time and the mass of space time are examples of two different spatial/temporal patterns that are the inverse of multiplying micro-frequency patterns that are multiplying when they oscillate together harmonically.

What I can add to that is that you also have temporal scales happening in the brain with fast input activity from the senses, and slowed frequency towards the top of the brain's cortical columns, if we could use the analogy of the gears of an ancient clock computer like the Antikythera Mechanism to picture different gears of different sizes to imagine how oscillations from the synapse, to the action potential to the neural circuit to the cortical column, to brainwaves, existing as like gears on a clock, oscillations of different scales interacting like gears of different scales, affecting each other at different rates, which results in behavior patterns that emerge at different time scales with the larger gears near the top of the scale heirarchy representing behavior patterns that develop over decades. Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors. I think Friston's argument could also be paraphrased to include the idea that our culture or our shared stories with other people also represent another ti
   500:   11: I think it explains how needing to urinate can wake up the brain, because chemical messages can change the frequencies of brainwaves, more chemical activity from inflammed bladder, can, in a way similar to pain signals, interact with the existing brainwave state the way two oscillating frequency bands in close proximity interact with one another
   508:   71: But brainwave entrainment with audio can also help normalize brainwave activity, so the whole brain is oscillating at the same frequency pattern.
   509:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).
   510:   99: A high frequency Action Potential will knock the higher frequency brainwaves hardest & fastest, so beta waves preceed alphawaves in memory prediction with Neural Oscillatory Tomography.

Quadrupole times Oscillators considering the sum of dendrite to multi vesicle release (M) times the (i/N) iteration of the number of neurons firing in a sequences, times Amplitude over frequency (1/f), by multiplication I mean time sequences, many Cortical Column oscillation patterns are multiplied under the Quadruple for example.

   534:   31: are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)
   545:   7: ⟪ 531 characters skipped ⟫ neural firing pattern which is the ecphory or the pattern that is in life memory, and the inhibited pattern that is transfered from its signal input to later areas in the brain is perhaps reduced to frequency patterns in the oscillating power bands.
   585:   151: But now they're going to oscillate to a different to out of out of frequency,
   586:   153: like that group is going to oscillate and a new frequency.
   599:   19: Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)
   600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
   603:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
   607:   15: ⟪ 328 characters skipped ⟫ the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.
   610:   16: In the talons Delta and we only have like the sensory input oscillations might be alpha waves. Going to have my wider which higher frequency.
   644:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
   658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
   665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
   666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
   673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
   685:   102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.
   691:   268: What makes us human like what makes our minds human? Like is the temporal spatial frequency of the oscillations of these patterns.
   692:   271: Of the oscillations of these matrices of patterns. This is temple space for frequency. So you could have the I should say, more than that, it's the temple spatial frequency of the of this circuit that interlaces different sets of of patterns together.
   707:    31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
   709:    95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to Facebook burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
   710:    97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
   712:   105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
   715:   293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
   718:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
   719:   325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
   729:   34: It's also and pushing out into, it's it might, it's like, I just imagine that this the same process is creating vertical lanes, through through the combined oscillations of, you know, of groups of atoms. You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.
   741:   24: Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 
   745:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
   749:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
   752:    11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
   753:    13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
   754:   129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.
   760:   9: Perfect frequency oscillators for a critical for criticality state, achieving a criticality state. That's not like,
   767:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
   773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
   774:    84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.
   778:   12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
   780:   22: So, there's just like, who's acting state are ready, state, which is like low time firing and then incoming, seriously are like fast drilled system and I'm saying that the stuff that finds our consciousness is the diversions between the high frequency, you know, activity, narrow pattern and the low frequency, oscillating of pattern of observing neurons.
   781:   44: But oscillator itself is going to insert a sort of attraction to pulling that smaller. Oscillating, neuron back into the same tonic frequency flow, I just ready for being ready for a phase of firing. So the phase of firing to be cold for, but it happens because of physics the physics and oscillators and oscillation is sort of like
   784:   33: ⟪ 409 characters skipped ⟫ a ton of firing phase, which is like the standard expectation and like of being, like, in the, that's when neurons are fine together in large groups in oscillators, and it's like a slower, you know, frequency fine pattern during the day, you might have like the power band of your alpha, oscillating layers might be greatest during the day.
   802:   16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
   817:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
   818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
   828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
   835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
   842:   473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
   847:   29: Now you say well now wait a second. If if whatever you feed individual neurons gets wiped out. Because here's his thing is, we're thinking there's this thing. There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
   848:   41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.
   863:   13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
   867:   15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
   871:   29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
   875:   87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.
   878:   31: So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.
   879:   43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.
   882:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
   884:   41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
   885:   43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.
   891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
   896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
   898:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
   899:   119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
   900:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
   905:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
   918:   105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.
   969:   71: I think that would it wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control but but it might change the the oscillation frequency of your. Of your. Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.
   975:    770: ⟪ 722 characters skipped ⟫e light at the tip of it and then on both sides of their temples, they have this electrode with a light and So these electrodes have powerful lights that fire at the at the infrared and near infrared frequency and so these these these lights are supposed to be powerful enough where they can penetrate the skull and and then these lights are meant to oscillate at the gamma frequency.
   985:   1223: ⟪ 663 characters skipped ⟫eresting very low cost so so in I just I came in a little bit late but to be clear you're developing a technology that is able to measure the let's call the biological oscillation or the vibration or frequency of what you pre-engineer design as the frequency that corresponds to the genetics that people represent as.
  1000: ⟪ 283 characters skipped ⟫ls and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.

However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
    28:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

    92:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment.

Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

   495:     43:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures.

   500:     62:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
   501:     65:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   504:     73:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   505:     76:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
   507:     86:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
   508:     90:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

   536:    198:   142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
   537:    202:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
   539:    211:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   550:    257:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   551:    261:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography).

   563:    309:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

   676:    776:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

   817:   1270:    11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   818:   1271:    12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   819:   1272:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   825:   1278:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   828:   1281:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   829:   1282:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

   855:   1324:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

   865:   1342:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

   876:   1361:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  1076:    11:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
  1077:    12:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  1078:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1083:    18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  1084:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  1087:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  1088:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  1089:    26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.

  1114:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  1124:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
  1125:    84:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography).

  1135:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

    8:   4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
   19:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
   20:   122: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity
   21:   127: In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 
   49:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   51:   222: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
   55:   287: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
   56:   299: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth
   65:    8: Is it possible for the oscillations of dna to be sensitive to something as remote as the oscillation of the gravity of neptune?
   86:    92: the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space
   87:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
   92:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  110:   64: which means gravity oscillates like a wave
  111:   66: # antigravity or anti-gravity propulsion might be a splay state oscillation to the oscillation frequency of gravity
  118:   23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.
  138:    2: (hebb, oscillat, array, synap) from action potential to a new theory of gravity
  159:    2: (oscillat, decoherence, super position, electromagnetism, conjecture, observer, vector, dissipation) Now I'm really certain that my Quantum Gravity Equation Hypothesis is a brand new exciting idea that replaces the extra dimensions in string theory. The Kaluza-Klein theory of extra dimensions led to string theory.

  238:   15: https://phys.org/news/2015-05-lab-uncovers-pathway-genetic-messages.html?fbclid=IwAR12Ivi_KFIMV3DDmX0PxWjsZA_47ruArbyxQbLwaRhIVcBX0mQHHXJMsEk I’m curious to follow up on this to see if the rate of cell oscillation, or some other factor is guiding the RNA to its destination. Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.
  251:   135: So in the double set experiment, you're actually firing photons. You're firing photons. And so there's force, where coming from the photon, emitter and that force, it's coming from the photonometer. That's fine. Firing the, the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an oscillating and oscillating mask the same way that an elevator is going to be equivalent to to gravity on earth.
  254:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  267:   110: This is a focus now. They're also that's for their oscillatory activity is attracting them, you know. And in the same way they're gravity works my end in terms of like it's if you're creating a lot of signals, lot of synchronized signals and then that's going to work space time.
  270:   71: And that. And that's why that, the particle either has a location or momentum. It's literally oscillating between being the wave being at at its peak pressing and then away sort of like, collapsing, again into the sea. And it's interesting to think of like the, you know, you think of how the moons gravity is affects the waves on on earth.
  274:   6: After I had this idea about the the atom being a about Adams, combining to form like a ball, or a planet. And then that planet having like a beam forming isolation. Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.
  283:   117: So they will maintain boundaries between oscillators. Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.

  428:   571:    417:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  438:   597:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount.

  444:   618:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.

    6:   48: Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.
    7:   52: I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.
    8:   60: You, the rendering, and it, the chemical structure oscillating with the phase field of space are sharing each interval of the moment that is being rendered as the organism's map of reality. You, the virtual entity of information existing as phases (frequencies) are sharing this moment with your saltwater, protein, chemical body, like two halves of one oscillating nexus.
   15:   34: The oscillator is a photocopier because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above 
   67:   3: ⟪ 382 characters skipped ⟫ what is real and separates it from illusions, with neurons binding information together at lower levels but also in every direction no matter which direction information is received from, eventually mapping their own signal environments to the degree that an oscillator of neurons can invariantly represent any learned pattern with any neurons that are in that oscillator.
  109:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  115:   5: I want to smash together the meaning of the word hallucinate with holographic simulation. I want to say it arises from unique oscillation patterns. The patterns are formulated by Hebbian learning, then when they are activated they glow (glow, meaning the oscillations are so persistent they become hallucinated vectors, lines, sounds and a whole world) in our minds, and other Hebbian learning patterns map them and knit together all the first level oscillations into larger brainwaves. These brainwaves look like a fast moving electrical storm, but together they knit the canvas of conscious experience.
  128:   36: I like to think of the oscillator as an Expert Data Structure (Instead of an advanced data structure) because its creating its own paper for which it can measure incoming signals against as deviations, allowing the system to collaborate as knowledge gaining system, mapping a dimension or a movie frame of consciousness.
  369:    36:         Ganglia Sensor Arrays, Eyes, Ears, Touch, Taste, Smell and how they map to the different parts of the brain. Why I'm looking for feedback loops connecting the oscillating sensor-transmitter arrays.
  469:   71: It's it's that the output isn't something internal and internal representation isn't really internal uses your brain, working too hard, okay? The output is an external res, rendering mapping. It's done internally. But it's a an external map that's being produced by other by the physical. Computations of oscillators, it's an external map.
  496:   19: So then in the exit terminals, belonging to the oscillating group of cells, are forming vector patterns that perhaps match the vector patterns at the synaptic level, maybe, but this would allow essentially synapses to store invariant vector patterns, that are magnified with isomorphic consistency to the meso & microscale. It's like saying that a soliton wave pattern in a neuron has no interent scale properity, it's a not a bitmap, it's a vector pattern, that can be scaled to any size brain.

The greater scale oscillators, the dipoles, the quadrupoles etc) of the brain to other neurons so that when the sequence fires. The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incomi

map.mass.md:
   10:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
   11:   12: space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to oscillators, this space is simultabeous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales
   12:   14: but space is not really expanding, its just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking and space is staying the same. This would make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are shrinking and becoming more dense gaining mass as they move through space attracting new particles through collision lanes
   15:   46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
   23:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
   25:   143: I make the argument that Space might have zero absolute and zero absolute time, just relative space & time, because they balance each other out like positive and negative charges, with space being more negative and time being more positivel Somewhere inbetween a moment that in summary equals nothing there is temporarily something. That something is a chaotic volumetric information pattern called mass in an otherwise harmonic & tonic oscillating spacetime field inbetween a single moment of nothing that is also, on the flip side of the coin, the ever present beginning of spacetime. 
   37:   58: or energy holes at the points in space that are most distant from any particles and from any lines between particles, the energy holes would be vast expanses of space around oscillating mass
   47:    92: So the argument for why time dilation around a mass is scale dependent could be that the electromagnetic wave field pattern of space is defined relative to dense oscillators such as planets.
   48:   120: So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.
   49:   166: ⟪ 300 characters skipped ⟫sing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
   52:   173: because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 
   53:   203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.
   59:   37: mass equals in oscillation which warps spacetime
   64:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   77:   16: Mass is the Magnitude of many volumetric frequencies (particles) oscillating together. With the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency defining spacetime at all scales, from galaxies, to EEG powerbands, to nmda spikes & soma bursts, to particles.
  105:   30: I suspect that the reason we do not see light decay is because it's moving in normal time which is frozen relative to how fast time moves for us, our experience of time has a lot of harmonic oscillation between entropic states, with the mass (information) of physical space moving slower than light but transforming (decaying/emerging) faster than light.
  112:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
  120:   24: But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it
  136:   19: the combined reflection of oscillating mass might multiple like a laser like the Bose-Einstein Condensate
  163:   5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio

  191:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.
  301:   86: in other words the vector field of space time and the mass of space time are examples of two different spatial/temporal patterns that are the inverse of multiplying micro-frequency patterns that are multiplying when they oscillate together harmonically.
  349:   17: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter
  355:   61: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter
  390:   49: I am thinking that the mass of space is equivalent but perhaps not equal to space bending, such that protons, neurons, and electrons oscillate as a group, but its as if their topological shape is warped space wave reproducing in intervals of time a three particle wave oscillations that we think of as an atom. At the same time its movement in space over time is the movement of a smaller wave through a larger wave, so what I am suggesting is that space as a whole is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds

  414:   192: The volume of energy, the volume of energy is big because the the volume of mass is the is the as the contraction of energy, the volume of mass is the contraction of energy, the contraction of space time into an also tory configuration. It's like, oscillating, eating other oscillations. So, the volume of space time and energy and the mass of space time.
  417:   252: Then imagine that a mass is crunching. Space up. And if the fact in effect that could look like, if you push on a sheet, really hard, right? And you have basically, but if you push on a sheet between two, different spheres between two different oscillators, okay? Then then the, the line between them is relatively more sunken than the lines that are not between them, right?
  421:   420: Having space time to it's putting a drag on space time. So it's causing space time to and be faster closer to the center of the oscillator and slow down further away from the center of the. Also the curvature space time starts from the center of any oscillator and the this the the mass of the oscillator, the combined oscillator.
  431:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  461:   32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.

  66: Neurons oscillate, but so do quantum particles, the fabric of space itself oscillates, the oscillation seems to be connected to the existence of time, as change that happens everywhere because of universal oscillation at all scales. perhaps time isn't a linear thing but instead a transformation that results from a fundamental interaction between 2 or more states that cannot be in balance as some axiomatic property which I prefer to think of as the undecidability of exis/tence, or the impossibility of nothing.

   13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   16:    66: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   17:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
   18:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
   19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
   26:   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.
   27:   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

   38:   5: Essentially what they are talking about in terms of edge communities, like vertices between dipoles of brain activity, I am arguing could be imagined as overlapping sensor/transmitter arrays that are doing neural oscillator array tomography.
   41:     3: (LTD, LTP, Perception, Oscillat, field, array, tomography, decoherence, electromagnetism, observer, synap, semantic)
   43:   196: and so spacetime oscillatory tomography is why we have planets with people orbiting stars, and not a perfectly even distribution of positive and negative particles
   46:    2: (synap, tomography, oscillat, array, dendrite)
   48:   20: The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.
   51:     3: # Notes on Neural Oscillatory Tomography & other topics
   52:    16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   53:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.

   57:   120: Neural Oscillatory Tomography Neural Network reconstruction, duplication, and mind extension, and mind transmission.
   58:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
   59: ⟪ 264 characters skipped ⟫terns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
   61:   142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
   62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
   65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
   66:    58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
   67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

   83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   84:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  128:   15: What I am saying is that the math of the brain, like the math in a computer becomes a conscious object-segmented self-aware rendering via Neural Oscillatory Tomography. The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.
  129:   19: # Tomodeck (Imagine a Holodeck, but replace Holography with Tomography, Neural Oscillatory Tomography)
  133:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
  134:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
  135:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and o

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  185:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.
  192:   93: Your life experience consists of learned patterns resulting from this neural oscillatory tomography.
  193:   95: ⟪ 553 characters skipped ⟫d so on. That is how you see your own internal representations, piece by piece, and then brainwave oscillations bind it into a single experience. I call this entification from Neural Array Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography for short.
  218:   33: # Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)
  236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.
