  13: When a cell gets part of a pattern it updates its synapses, might cause a tiny phase change in its tonic oscillation timing that the rest of the oscillating cell assembly to notice. I am looking at Olfactory bulb research to understand how a cell might instantly update it's sensory input with a partial pattern. Do Potassium receptors get upregulated or down regulated? There was a study on Umami (search my notes, currently in note a0272z) that compared that suggested "taste detection of glutamate (and presumably other amino acids) seems primarily to involve G proteinâ€“coupled receptors."

    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   44: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   46: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   48: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   53: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   62: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   65: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   82: NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography includes communication with Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, T-Cells, Microglia, and basically any type of cell. NAPOT interfaces with all cells via COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, because all cells exchange signals, and have receptors, membranes, and other structures to receive signals & detect information from temporal cascades of coincident activations.
   96: Astrocytes can depolarize, releasing inhibitory glutamate, another way that phase patterns be altered to change the active tonic brainwave oscillation, your memory/awareness/model of reality & your internal qualia or representations, what you see hear taste smell and feel.
  105: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  107: All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.
  119: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  122: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  146: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  149: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
  153: But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote.

    3: (oscillat, field, graph, decoherence, observer, synap, cortex, category, theory) hologram
   21: In a poetic sense our thinking is unites with the fabric of spacetime, we are in a sense oscillating fractal folds of spacetime in an advanced information configuration that is defining space and ourseves at the same time
   25: in otherwords as an oscillation pattern we are literally absorbing and emitting spacetime simultaneously it is moving through us because we are dissipative vortexes
   27: These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth (patterns of cytokine release), and to cellular oscillating tomography.
   35: In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.
   40: Is the Hippocampal Entorhinal loop overstated? or understated? because it looks like brainwide input is interdependent on Hippocampal connections. Also the role that interneuons have on inhibiting dendrites directly impacts memory function in the NAPOT mode. Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography
  134: Perhaps we could imagine, as a thought experiment that entangled particles are like a single particle flattened out, united by synchronized oscillation, in a coherence pattern, its split is from applied force.
  145: Connect with earth oscillating, oscillating earth, and neural network cosmos universe
  146: earth has superficial awareness on super short timescales, the smaller more complex configurations of oscillators in brains have magnified temporal awareness
  165: its the attractive force of a spinning oscillator
  172: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
  174: Ultimately electrical force also stems as a property of the properties of its oscillator flow as well. 
  176: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity
  178: Attractive and Repulsive Forces on Particles in Oscillatory Flow
  181: In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 
  197: I make the argument that Space might have zero absolute and zero absolute time, just relative space & time, because they balance each other out like positive and negative charges, with space being more negative and time being more positivel Somewhere inbetween a moment that in summary equals nothing there is temporarily something. That something is a chaotic volumetric information pattern called mass in an otherwise harmonic & tonic oscillating spacetime field inbetween a single moment of nothing that is also, on the flip side of the coin, the ever present beginning of spacetime. 
  201: the observer viewpoint is essentially a mini hologram inside a hologram (space) we are each the image of the spacetime cosmos and fhe product of spacetime cosmos, and a dissipative system in the spacetime cosmos which is an harmonic oscillator in total, with space and time being resonating oscillators
  203: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  205: in an oscillating field oscillations grow together once they oscillate together
  206: if they oscillate apart they grow apart
  208: its about the idea that your exact location/scale in the universe is determined by your oscillatory pattern
  216: Two objects are composable in phase space if they have the same phase, or same oscillation, they can converge in space, expanding space & time around that convergence relatively speaking
  218: If they have a similar oscillation they can get close to converging in spacetime, so there is a timespace gradient

    6: (oscillation magnitude)
   18: Perhaps the phasic & high phasic signals, at least as soliton waves across the electromagnetic spectrium, might have a longer range, they would travel across longer distances of the network before eventually being dissipated by the rest of the oscillating groups of cells.
   20: The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.
   24: It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits. I think there is research to back this up, if I remember correctly, so search for citations to bolster this.
   26: Recapping the Phasic Tonic Relationship, the high phasic spike, creates a burstlet, that creates an inhibitory wave (a sharp wave ripple across the brain) that starts with it's direct exit terminal array, the phasic spikes are dissipated into the tonic oscillation, so there is a relationship between the tonic brainwave pattern (like the theta brainwave pattern) and the incoming sensory pathways.
   45: A central part of my argument is that a group of oscillating fireflies act as a single sensor, unified via oscillation, so that if one of them is excited by food, or eaten by a frog, that disturbs the oscillating firing pattern of the entire hive or flock of fireflies, in other words they all notice, via oscillation the fireflies are entified,
   47: (Later on I want to expand this concept to atomically homogenous materials, to say something like here is a sheet of graphite because it has an array of atoms that are united by a common oscillatory pattern. What effects part of the sheet sends a signal rippling across the whole sheet, so the sheet of graphine atoms is an entified sensor, something like that)
   49: My argument is that the rendering output that makes up our internal representations, and our mind, is in the phase variations between the normal tonic oscillating pattern, and the phasic bursts that alter that tonic pattern. The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.
   54: A, NMDA (15 Î¼m, in the bath) caused the tonic firing and stable resting potential from time point i to depolarize and switch to high-frequency burst firing with regenerative oscillations of membrane potential (mean: 0.3 Hz Â± 0.02, n = 88) by time point ii. Lower trace: DC injection was slowly ramped to âˆ’100 pA in order to hyperpolarize the cell and induce stronger oscillations starting at time point ii. B, ISI histograms of firing activity for a representative DA neuron. Tonic spiking had a unimodal distribution of ISIs at 250 ms (CV = 0.15). C, NMDA caused strong bursting with a bimodal ISI distribution, with peaks at 150 ms (ISI within a burst) and 2100 ms (ISI between bursts)."
  102: In otherwords Potassium channels are the key to phase variations in the signal transmittion between nerve cells, and phase variations are how the rendering of the mind is tomographically computed & perceived by oscillating networks of neurons that are each computing and each perceiving a small part of the conscious mind (a volumetric tomographic pattern) that is being computationally rendered by the brain (or alternatively by an artificial neural network if you have one of those.)

   3: A thought experiment: Imagine that each node (an oscillating group of cells) was processing the whole of consciousness (or part of it) but at a different scale or represents a different perspective,
  11: The potential consequence of that is that reality inside our heads closely matches actual reality. What I mean is that it's like the volume of your head is filled up volumetrically with representations of the volume of space around you, thanks to your incoming senses, your neural pathways, your neural arrays sensing & transmitting patterns in sequences to other patterns, and all of your mental patterns being bound together by oscillation.
  24: "(...)the timing and spatial patterns of oscillations in the fronto-auditory network of vocalizing bats (Carollia perspicillata) predict the purpose of vocalization: echolocation or communication."
  35: "Consistent with previous reports4,14,16, we show that neural activity in the frontal cortex predicts vocal outputs. Taken together, the data from this and previous work suggest that oscillations in frontal regions may be instrumental for vocal production. From our perspective, the above is further supported by call-type specific, pre-vocal LFP spectral dynamics and information transfer patterns in the FAF-AC network. The relationship between oscillations and vocal production remains, nevertheless, correlational: our results do not allow to rigorously assert a causal role of LFPs for the initiation or planning of vocalizations."
  51: That creates a phase rendering in the oscillation group of neurons (that is acting like a single sensor/transmitter like a group of firelies referencing the book Sync).
  53: So the phase changes are constrastive, and that points to how while there is for example a powerband of alpha oscillations for example, within that power band there are multiple alpha frequencies, and the contrastive differences amount to the rendering that makes up the information of your mind, allowing the self to perceive reality and at the same time to be rendered by reality.
  61: The ground of being as the tonic oscillation of unconscious expectation based awareness
  77: new sensory inputs are contrasted with the tonic oscillations set by past sensory inputs

   6: You are a fractal oscillating node on an oscillating branch of the cosmos which is an fractal oscillating that is actually a single oscillation from the perspective outside time and space.
   8: The perspective outside time and space is seeing the cosmos as the ever present now. One long undivided moment in which the perception of time by the simultaneous increases in extropy and entropy because the two forces are bound in that they always increase together as the oscillators evolve in complexity they dissipate entropy to the surrounding environment, and the perpendicular oscillations of positive and negative electrons (an oscillatory splay state describes the difference between positive and negative charge, fermions are space in a state of decoherence, and bosons are in a state of electrical coherence with W and Z bosons being examples of high phase states that decay quickly by resonator dissipation into the larger group of oscillation, W and Z have too much energy relative to other bosons, which they cannot maintain, its like a top that is spinning too fast, to much angular momentum.
  12: The scale of an oscillating particle such as a W boson is going to dissipate in a vaccum because the signals that it is giving off are bigger than the signals it is receiving off, it is spending its energy over time and eventually it decays because of entropy, entropy because of the math of oscillators, with particles being oscillators Bosons, or attractors for oscillations in the case of Fermions that are splayed in time, but are coherent in space. With the Fermion Condensate responsible for multiscale fermion condesate lines emerging between oscillators, each of them heating up and expanding the space between them resulting in the curvature of spacetime through a combination of multiscale soliton waves in the photonic fields with electricity charge sensation (high frequency/time), magnetism(high amplitude/spatial feel), mechanical vibrational acoustic (sound and inner voice), thermal (hot/cold data for processing hot cold sensation), and chemical (feeling energy state vitality sleep in-the-zone) and the correlations of patterns across all modalities.
  14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  18: but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,
  22: With the higher layers tracking the largest scale patterns and the lower layers tracking the smallest scale patterns, the layers act like the enlarge function on a photocopier taking each sparse firing and magnifying its area by having it inhibit the firing of a select group, which slows their oscillations relative to the larger oscilliating group, each sparse encoding is magnified by each layer of the cortex, and that results in higher level pattern learning at the top, and that is the grid cell place cell reference frame concept talked about in the book by Jeff Hawkins called A Thousand Brains
  26: The patterns are rendered and transmitted on screens (oscillator arrays (circuits layers columns and long interneuron networks and long glial networks) in every modality so that learned patterns are modality invariant and so that all the modalities are used to represent all the patterns (its different facets & properities) and its high level information configuration (the high level concept of what it is simplied, like object recognition rather semantic segmentation
  35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync
  59: âŸª 726 characters skipped âŸ«ets of arrays in bulb under the back of the brain, the cerebellum has a structure that would be great for modelling the very consistent updates from the brains motor system which is a very consistent oscillator network. The cerebellum is perfect for processing dense high frequency large scale signals from large oscillations that are both fast and dense and from the not so novel observation of muscle movements.
  65: What if a 7th version of you is virtual having no specific substrate, but instead is like the pattern configuration of negative space or decoherence between the 6 modalities. So that if the orthogonal interactions, between 1. electric, 2. magnetic, 3. mechanical/acoustic, 4. thermal, 5. chemical, 6. Quantum signalling, pairing, and memory in spin states are all interacting with multi-scale oscillatory dynamics. So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales.

  195: Every cell in the human body is an unconscious "oscillating tomographical memory pattern prediction" machine with "generative behavior or function outputs" and in a multi-cellular system it is analogous to an Entity-Component-System in the context of a game-engine, where the body is the game engine, and the cells are individual entities that have their own set of components for reacting with system level oscillatory binding of learned reactions, learned & novel pattern sensing, and novel behavior/function/response generation.
  202: To over simplify, signals compound on top of prior signals to create feedback loops or oscillations of signal activity that integrate & amplify sensory integration & functional output (signalling output)
  207: Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.
  209: # Cellular Oscillating Tomography re-phrased:
  214: 2. Cellular Oscillating (Pattern) Tomography
  220: The oscillations or emergent behaviors from signal feedback loops and coincident & temporally cascading signal activations (at all scales) is part of how signals unify or entify tomographically to generate or program new biological structures & new behaviors or computed functions.
  222: The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.
  230: Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.
  232: NAPOT Theory suggests that high phasic spiking inhibits the exit terminal array delaying an oscillating group relative to the larger oscillating group. IN other words Delayed Expression of the exit terminal of the activated neuron sets the new timing of the inhibited group by the decay rate of the fired action potential in the previous array. The tonic oscillation absorbs the burstlet, distributes it, and creates a synchronization pattern that dissipates the impact of the signal that group of neurons has received. Resulting in the temporal binding of your learned internal representations that are displayed to subsequent arrays that also embody learned internal representations.
  234: # The Oscillatory "Memory Link"
  240: Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.
  244: ^ ha I just invented a new term Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography CCOT but it is encompassed in the definition of NAPOT.
  247: Notice that NAPOT, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, fits with the existing concepts of Hierarchical Tempo-Spatial Activation Sequences for incoming sensory inputs and outgoing motor sequences.
  251: What NAPOT is adding the picture of tempo-spatial activations is a framework that removes the predominant idea that what is being transmitted between neurons is electrical signals and replaces that with what is being transmitted between neurons & glial cells are phase changes in the oscillating group of cells read by neural arrays & shared & bound by the oscillating group, resulting in long lasting synaptic & dendritic morphological changes.
  253: Whether the neuron is transmitting chemicals such as in a chemical synapse, or electricity in the case of electric synapses, what is really being transmitted is a phase change in the brainwave oscillation pattern for that group of cells.
  255: These phase changes are detected by neural arrays and via neural arrays are observed by oscillating groups of cells, as physical changes to their baseline tonic oscillation activity.

a0272z.md:
   8: Cellular Oscillating Tomography means that the multiple activations of receptors & the subsequent cascading intracellular reactions & the signals that leave cells to affect other cells bind together via oscillation, and the changes in those oscillations create sensory patterns that we taste, hear, smell, see, feel, or sense in any other way.
  10: This article below that makes the case for multiple receptors being useful for Umami detection is a great example of the concept I am describing with Cellular Oscillating Tomography, and also with Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, multiple cell receptors are describe as being involved in the spatial & temporal detection of flavor & texture patterns over time.

  19: the oscillation of the magnetic field configuration on the brain from the brain is going to be felt by the brain as areas of increase ATP release as the mitochonria are stimulated by the flavin sensitivity to electromagnetism in the brain, so the output of neurons can change the magnetic field, and they can sense the magnetic field because they have flavins in the nerve tissue and the mitochondria flavins are in particular stimulated by electromagnetic field changes.

a0417z.md:
  32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by GyÃ¶rgy BuzsÃ¡ki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.
  34: The key thought about where the observer is inside the mind, where is the person inside who is watching the brain's representations, is to think of the flow of information in the brain as a series of arrays, with each array seeing part of the picture, and the oscillating activity at different scales, from spikes to phase changes to big brainwaves and dipoles is the thing that binds together what each array in the brain is seeing as information passes through it, so you perceive what you perceive, and that includes a representation of your hands and your sense of self as the body of causation behind your hands.

a0419z.md:
  5: the hierarchical looping oscillating neural network from inputs to outputs in the human brain can be thought of as having a natural directory structure for semantically seperating concepts into branches, or branches of nodes or branches of neurons, so that learned representations have a home, an area, spatially organized

   4: the brain could be an energy efficient rendering engine where most of the tonic oscillations are like shadows of recent patterns, ready to fire because they represent cyclic stuff you think about daily
   8: but with Theta and other tonic power bands I think observation is sort of always on represented by the theta oscillation developing over the course of the day. It's interesting to then think of Thresholds of the Mind in terms of how your brain activity, over time can result in major brain changes, break downs and reorganization of data.
  21: however the harmonic oscillator feature of space means that oscillators will clump together, being attractors to other oscillators, or being sometimes attractors to more organized oscillator states.
  23: So the cosmos goes through the same process of natural selection that organisms go through with oscillators combining in novel ways developing increasing more complex information configurations overtime.
  25: space that oscillates together stays together until it is forced to oscillate apart, ie quantum entanglement. measuring one gives you the spin of the other because they were oscillating together in a splay state.

  7: âŸª 577 characters skipped âŸ« top of the brain's cortical columns, if we could use the analogy of the gears of an ancient clock computer like the Antikythera Mechanism to picture different gears of different sizes to imagine how oscillations from the synapse, to the action potential to the neural circuit to the cortical column, to brainwaves, existing as like gears on a clock, oscillations of different scales interacting like gears of different scales, affecting each other at different rates, which results in behavior patterns that emerge at different time scales with the larger gears near the top of the scale heirarchy representing behavior patterns that develop over decades. Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors. I think Friston's argument could also be paraphrased to include the idea that our culture or our shared stories with other people also represent another timescale invariant information pattern that our brain clocks (oscillations) interface with.

   39: There in Rhythms of the Brain discussion of how inhibition can change the firing patterns of a neuron, and that really is the point at which a change in the experience or the canvas of consciousness happens, but eventually that change is overridden by the group oscillation pattern and so that change in phenomological experience is overwritten, or in a sense reset so that the network can get ready to represent a different pattern for the next moment in time.
   42: long range interneurons with myelinated axon c collaterals facilite temporal synchrony of all terminals (Rhythms of the Brain) The critical role in these rare long-range neurons has to do with facilitating the timing of distantly operating oscillators and the timing of firing patterns of large numbers of neurons that are not locally connected to one another. So in essence if you what you are seeing, and hearing is coming from the same source, like a dog's bark coming from what looks like an animal to you, well recalling the image and sound of a dog barking means that there is some sort of long range coordination between your visual cortex and audio cortex that is raising the sound of the dog, and the sight of the dog in your memory at the same time, which would be temporal synchronicity, and what accomplishes that (the timing of an audio memory and a visual memory) is thought to be long-range interneurons. So it can be argued that your attention across multiple sensory modalities (sight, vision, touch) is coordinated by interneurons, they are doing the work of binding diverse sensory representations together, for your attention.

  9: So my conjecture in my book is is that essentially dead things can be conscious because what we're talking about is with the consciousness is so I am calling oscillating self aware networks at the moment, right? Because, because the dissipation of signals across the entire array of we could say, you know, if any of any oscillators but we could say, you know, we talked about fireflies is basically, you know, in the, in the sense of like abdominal habits, allowing all of these,

  13: Although there are feedback loops, so there's processing and the whole like rain does, like oscillating loops, but they're still our directions for signals. There's signal paths, right? There are signal pass for voter signals. There's a signals and there's signal paths that sort of preferred to certain kinds of oscillations like they'd observations and hippocampus or delta pathways.
  16: In the talons Delta and we only have like the sensory input oscillations might be alpha waves. Going to have my wider which higher frequency.

  113: And and so that's in that. And that sense, patterns, roll across the brain, all over the brain. If there's face changes and it because every time the phase, it's just like, you know, when like think about a chemical phase, when like a chemical phase is like in the water like like something is is transmitted from one oscillating molecule and then the next one receives that transmission and renders it fresh for the next one after that.
  144: in this matter of sensory, cortex and some of the versions of the lighter are going to be in the the audio cortex and they'll be lots of different versions of this pattern that just get like repeated across different parts of the cortex.

    3: Neurons Oscillation
    5: Stein. Condensation is an oscillation when a bunch of atoms.
    7: And oscillator sync and sink. So the idea that the probability cloud that the probability cloud of an atom is like an oscillator is a little bit like an oscillator.
    9: And a sense that like the both Einstein condensate. It's like if you have many, many items that are all oscillating as one and if they don't, I'm just like, so would I just started to imagine was like, what? If what, if what if a particle was like many microparticles, right?
   11: Like what if it was like, innocence, like a matrix of particles all sort of like oscillating together, but honestly together, in a way that would cause the like one part of one part of that oscillator to light up at a time. When you say well, that's like the that's where the particle is but but it really seems like it's the particles location is all over the place because that is just like one possible face state for that space so represented.
   21: So yeah, like that's like that's gonna make sense. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. So, I'm imagining an oscillator as like, like, as like imagine that you are.
   27: But eventually it'll become very spilled as long as, you know, don't move. And so, that's what I think of, in terms of like, what is kind of like, why, you know, also tourist states like a move. I'm sorry. Why also store? Why? Why neuront, what? Why neurons eventually moved towards being an oscillatory state where there is because as a reaction to the action potential, it's like the action potential is just is a drop in the ocean and the rest of the neurons are absorbing and redistributing that way everywhere until it runs out of energy.
   31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
   33: Those are there's a brain waves, right? And they don't and and they're reflective of the collection action of the collective action of neurons that are oscillating together. So I am arguing that those brain waves are containing basically. It's the oscillation phase changes are containing. The sort of like, those are the screens.
   51: So, we've got three different oscillators and they have three random initial voltages and they each, you know, collect a little bit of voltage each round and they get moved up. And then so, they each reach a threshold and they fire when they fire, they kick the other two, which means in addition to the voltage, they're getting each round, they get an additional amount of voltage.
   53: And the idea is that this keeps happening over and over again where where you know, one neuron will fire, it will kick the other two and eventually to get to the point where all three of them fire at the same time. So eventually all the oscillators end up firing in sync.
   57: If they're giving like, if they're each giving like one each turn to the other two, every time they fire eventually, they all have the same amount if this just happens along enough for a long enough time. And in that sense like you can send signals to an oscillator but anything you send it like what happens eventually if you stop sending signals soon oscillator is that they all eventually oscillate together, right?
   59: And I just becomes like an array. I sent her right like the, the entire oscillate oscillating group of neurons becomes like, a sensor array that can remember its own activations, because that certified creates it creates cascading reactions. All right? And, and the cascading reactions that happen are the memories of that of that they're human member.
   63: But right at the same time that entire oscillation, right? That is something that is observed at an even higher level, right? It's patent. What I'm saying is that they're there are other oscillators who can interpret the output of that.
   65: Of that one oscillator. Like that's that's when we're going from like you know to the pyramid cell that now collects the internal and that connects to another portable column. All right? So, the idea is that the the output of one oscillator. So, the oscillator magnifies the the pattern that and if you look at this book called sink and chapter 2, it's really great.
   67: I mean, share something, each oscillator is distributing. It's extra energy, each time it's like dissipating. Each one is dissipating, the energy and the collective work of all dissipating. Energy is going to even out the the amount of energy at each has the entire system is going to even out the energy.
   69: So that's why oscillation happens, equilibrium happens. Okay? So what I just imagine was the that basically, the neuron is Just so so oscillator synchronized because they're basically dissipating energy. They're taking a lot of energy that one of them receives just and each. One is like saying, okay, well, I need to dissipate this energy because a charge has built up.
   95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to Facebook burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
   97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
  105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  125: Your it's something. Oh, sounds like you're just pitting information if that makes sense. You're dissipating information. And so if one firefly is patterned stops working like either like that, firefly becomes inhibited then maybe like that it has been eaten by like a frog or something in the whole. Also a oscillation is disturbed and it's like it's I mean maybe that means it flies away really fast like if there's a swarm and they're just hanging out all of a sudden like one of them disappears, they're all gonna notice it because they were all expecting to receive a signal and exactly the same time and they and they didn't.
  127: So it's like wow something is different. The entire oscillation nurses, the pattern. And then, yeah, cuz that that creates a disturbance in the forest basically, and then, at the same time you we have this situation where maybe one of them finds food, but now they all know it because that one that one, it bursts faster and that, that it burst out of sync and that caught that's gonna cost us.
  129: It now has to dissipate that extra energy into the oscillator, so it has extra energy. So nothing giveaway. Some of those energy by beaming beaming it out and that triggers the other get a bugs to receive that signal and that causes them to release their energy. And this, in this point, this is the functional expression of energy.
  147: Deposit neurons set fires together oscillate together. So each each oscillator is going to add a geometric effect. This is from chapter sync. So, large bundle of neurons oscillating is going to have like a like a geometric pattern of normous complexity that's going to represent. It's it's collective of observation power, graphs or resolution the larger, the oscillator.
  151: And so like when I think of the global oscillation of the brain, you know like basically like thanks to the interns and the philanthropic bridges and corpus closeum and the other major connective areas, the temporal parietal function. And so on that, there are, you know, weren't this area, and broke his area.
  155: That it's, it's or sending, you know. Basically, having one oscillator, not the other two off layers and it the example of three oscillators like, you know, each oscillator like fills up with electricity and then fires and it distributes its energy to the other, to the other, and to go to and then eventually like they all they all like, it's like imagine that he's like imagine there's a point of energy that's moving from one oscillator to another and you know, eventually they all end up firing at exactly the same time but what happens is when two of them fire at the same time they become in sync with each other and so you know, at some point the dealt but they all become and think at the same time like you have like all three of them will like.
  161: It's even if that point moves around as long as it's never absorbed anywhere because it's a bad point, it's as if that point doesn't exist, it's as if it's part of the architecture that the other points are moving around, and that's why the system will still reach oscillation. It's why bad points.
  167: Positive at each, at each point when the point moves it it's a little bit more, a little bit of it is absorbed. So like a point of the point eventually gets to zero because it's been completely absorbed by the, by the whole oscillator. So it eventually reaches it's low number, when it's basically, it's energy, has been divided evenly among all oscillators, and that's sort of the point in, which they've all sort of like eaten, and they've all received energy, right?
  173: So it difficult energy, this running environment and what it's doing then is passing on energy to another group of neurons. But that but it's information is being magnified by that oscillation it's encoding of pattern in the whole oscillator because all of the the receiving neurons are receiving. You know, it's causing it's causing cascades of energy releases in neurons.
  175: So they're there's a, there's a physical tracking physical reaction, that is cascading throughout the, the oscillator that eventually reaches equilibrium. But but, but the equilibrium is sort of tilted, just a tiny amount, right? And you that happens enough times. And eventually with the equilibrium space changes right in those phase changes, then are going to be tracked by the default mode network.
  187: And the, this might trigger, it should trigger an eventual oscillation but it triggers the oscillation of the of the network in in stages because what happens is it's it's only an effect like the downstream field. Effect of a neuron actions actions potentials. Only in effect, the select group of downstream neurons.
  189: So only I selected LAX group in the oscillator will be inhibited but that that it magnifies that one neurons pattern because that group is now sort of like out of oscillation for around with the rest of the neural circuit in terms of like they are be synchronized and one sense from the rest of the oscillation.
  243: And but, by the same thing is, is that, that's true. I think, for the oscillator, being able to learn in variant patterns because I think that the membrane of the synapse also has to be able to learn in variant patterns because if you have a synapse, that is sort of inactivated, when you get a pattern that similar to approximately large pattern, it is possible that you got a difference to ask could fire instead as possible and different synopsis fire instead.
  271: So they so the inhibition process has a process taking all those inhibited neurons in DC, synchronizing them from the rest of the group simultaneously. So any like synchronizations they had before are now sort of like temporary at least temporarily DC synchronized and that that of course is going to that's also going to affect the tonic oscillator because the tonic off because because in the tonic oscillation could not, you've changed all night, you've changed a small oscillation, you've moved to small oscillation out of sync with the global oscillation pattern, all right?
  273: And so the principles of oscillators interaction of differentials of the interactions of oscillators the same to say now, wait a second. Now, these two oscillators have to resolve each other and to come back and sync with each other. And that process is going to eventually if that process happens enough, the the global phase data of the global oscillator, once the two ones to two different, oscillators are remarged is going to be altered.
  275: And in that sense that is basically like also it's like imagine oscillator is past is is as a as a point passing between different nodes. And each time it passes to a different node. It gets absorbed by a little bit until until eventually there's no more energy to pass around because all the neurons are.
  279: And so eventually the energy is just evenly distributed everywhere and they're all firing at the same time but the but the fact that the so the action of inhibiting a group of neurons now makes that now makes those those neurons slower in terms of their phase relative to the global oscillator.
  281: So the global oscillator now has to combine with the group of neurons that are moving slower, that is going to cause the the total oscillation to the decrease and an amount that is sort of adjusting sort of like balancing out the increase of one of one. So let's just say that, you know, the action potential fires.
  285: And so if neurons, if the whole group is also getting slower than what happens is, all the rest of the neurons and then oscillation have more energy to give relatively speaking. Their charge has increased in that to relative to that, that their phase charge is increased relative to the phase charge of that inhibited group, right?
  287: So that inhibit group is not passing anything on to the next group. And so that is like a bunch of neurons who's clocks have been slowed. So they're oscillations have been slowed because they didn't receive something. And so what you have, if you have a bunch of stuff that becomes inhibited, all of a sudden, as you've a bunch of clocks that gets loaded and they get slowed and reaction to something that was moving faster.
  293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  295: And it's time in the timing of his firing unless a lot of unless. Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be because the oscillation is just dissipating. The energy from the activation and but they're still like more entered but still like with every when the neuron fires like that is pulling in energy if it does because downstream rounds are like take a break.
  305: Not to the rest of the network, to the rest of the oscillator. Did that my so that might?
  307: Yeah, very friends. Should they actually the oscillator could could relative to the relative to the brain. The rest of the oscillator could be in a situation where it's chart, is total charges. Exactly the same or increase in. Yes. So, I'm okay. So this is when I need to get clear about, I'm wondering.
  313: By the charge concentration is changing. So so the charge in certain other patterns, relative that the patterns that have inhibited, those other patterns are increasing without increasing, that's total charge of the oscillators. The total charge of the oscillator, then can stay at the same sort of at the same, the charge, can't the total charge.
  323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  333: So that's like at that point that group of inhibited neurons is not at like they're just slowed down relative to the rest of oscillation but eventually that group is going to cause the rest of the oscillator to pass their phase, to pass their phases around. So and until you know so basically like the slowed down neurons are going to.
  335: It's like they it's like when you so when an offset or pass passes phase around ideas phases, like a box, that gets a job a little bit, it gets passed by neurons, it gets passed by oscillators that have more to neurons that have less. And each time each of the neurons, that receives something from what is being, what's being passed to it?
  343: Like because they're just like because they all they're all like, receiving, like the same amount of energy at the same time, eventually, like like they're balances, like they're voltages, all become an alignment eventually because they keep just distributing the energy to dissipate it and until it gets like evenly absorbed by the whole oscillator.
  345: And then they all, then, they're all another timing is all aligned, and not in the and they are as an oscillator. They are a sensor array that's waiting for for more and more energy to come into the oscillator from, from from the neuron is going to spike next.

   5: Artificial consciousness. Shit, data and C3PO. So I see neurons is something different. Like there's there's, you know, the neuron is a multimodal, neural network, but it also. But it's also the case that it's it's, you know, when I describe neurons, like, it's not news to anybody that neurons oscillate tonically, it's not news to a neuroscientist but you don't hear that in the hours subscription, when in neurons described the function of an urine is subscribed.
  87: And so this is yeah. This is like the three sets of neurons small. Like imagine you had just to oversimplify it, imagine that you had the entire view. Want what is going to respond at once and it's going to respond by some of the neurons getting excited and some of them being inhibited and some of them remaining and in tonic oscillation.
  89: Most of them remaining anatomic oscillation. Okay. And then so then you have to be too and the V2 is listening to the B1. And so now in the V2 you're going to have the neurons that were listening which is, you know, all of them you're going to have a situation where some of them get excited and some of them getting inhibited.

  77: Now he's already known but I mean back then he was really one of these key people who invented really and showed that nations are important for perception and brain. So I was really happy to go to to, by PhD department. And what's your view on camera isolations today? I was super fascinated by camo oscillations, but then, then, I mean, I started to study them and I worked with interpreting a single.
  81:  told me a look at come oscillations. And I started to look at cam oscillations, but they saw that way the minute these this look like something else, so they cover large part of the spectrum.
  83: So not only like or 60, but they go from 40 to 200 and people in the department were saying. Yeah, you can order that ignore that is oscillations but I was not so convinced. So I started to talk to many people in the world. And in the end, I was the one who convinced or single also that these are not God.
  87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.
  89: Yeah, me definitely after my, my group on that I do think that there is a lot of high around dissociation and this was even more intense like 10 years ago like maybe there was still single autism things about cam oscillations but then there was this new generation of researchers including me.
  91: You said, look, many of the results that have been attributed to come. Oscillations are actually reflecting some kind of abroad bad signal that these indexing describing activity. So it's actually dead, oh positive, what can oscillations were saying? So there might be still a road in some situations. We know that there is a road.

So there's like, there's always going to two sections with their sort of like like we can oscillate a different frequencies but they sort of like there isn't, there is a sort of clockwork, interaction happening sort of should have, you know, there's a relationship between the rate of one oscillation and the different rate of another large group oscillation.

  1834: Might be possible but I think that what needs to perhaps improve is basically a new computer model of of a new mathematical model of and predictive model of oscillatory changes in the brain and and and so like you're it's like decoding this this really complex. Hmm. Electromagnetic pattern from from the complexity of like something that disappears to be noise has some structure to like sort of like doing like that something like a four-year transform where you're as like it's like like a three-dimensional four-year transform where you're where you're figuring out what are the frequencies in different layers and different and different regions because it's because it's all gonna mix together right from the perspective of your sensors unless you've got unless you have.

   147: âŸª 511 characters skipped âŸ«t's what it's going to be the trick was to try to figure out the mechanism because like I said, everything is is going to be sort of subject dependent, you know, because you could have the exact same oscillatory output from some network despite the fact that you have completely different transmitter profiles than I do before, you know, from most amounts of inbred strength.
   195: âŸª 275 characters skipped âŸ«ls and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.
   198: Of the brain once it's once you know from from a baseline to when a baseline without inflammation to a baseline to the brain's oscillations being modified by inflammation and then and then compare that to the oscillatory changes when you apply medication versus when you're applying the oscillatory changes to the brain at baseline without the inflammation.
   294: Cigars under the oscillatory rhythm in the effects of sleep, for example is that the the question aware is irrelevant so I I was tracking most of what you said until the last sentence and then I sort of fell apart for me could you maybe you like rephrase that a little louder and like yeah, yeah, so okay.
   321: So there's a possibility of picking up a single neuron firing from the treacherode or you can have like what they call local field potential which is like doing the constellation neurons for firing and have having or like oscillating the the potential is where at the position where the electrode or the tetrahed is implanted.
  1284: It's it's so so here's what here's I think it's like imagine that the feedback looked really is like one big circle right and the big circle is passing the data around in a circle all the times oscillation of this of this information traveling on a big circle and do we need to intercept that circle at the timeless or can we just really intercept that circle anywhere maybe closer to the surface of the brain, that's what I'm saying, do you know, you're not saying?
  1728: So so it's a nerve neurophysics we're talking about things like brain waves, you know brainwaves have oscillations and and the brain has rhythms nerve nerve gear we the this is a topic of brain computer interfaces, it can be you know, you can talk about there's an airlink device there's an open water device.
  2083: âŸª 692 characters skipped âŸ« but we can't even get close to what the with the brand is doing unless we like expand unless we keep looking at the brain really deeply and expand the the the if we look at the neurophysics of brain oscillations and the the the the transmission of patterns and in the rhythms of the patterns and the directions.

The Cycle of brain activity learning reality through sensory computation inside the oscillatory activity, across network nodes, in a multi-scale functionally fractal manner over time.
   18: The feedback loop travels through neural & glial cell activity. It's a feedback loop of arrays that see other arrays and create an image for yet further arrays in an endless looping cycle of neuron arrays learning other neuron arrays and creating multi scale models of the world, but also create memories of multiple representations that are stored at the level of individual group oscillations that can be magnefied into focus when you are aware of that pattern or set of patterns at a particular moment. So the brain is dynamically fluid rendering machine.
  180: The first chapter but he he definitely opens it up talking about large scale stuff. I don't know how much he's gonna get into resonance but he really takes a like approach of explaining how it's generated so he's definitely gonna cover all the bases, you know, he talks about oscillators and like what's needed for operation?
  186: Bye. Take outside of the box of the persistent sodium burst themselves and the recurrent synaptic excitation. Yeah, that author has two books and I'm currently reading them both but I I I haven't I can't speak to the whole book but I think they're I think he's trying to cover the topic of it oscillations from micro to macro.
  234: Yeah, definitely. But yeah, I definitely want to get into making mechanisms so part of my thesis is actually generation of gamma oscillations from PV intern around fast-working internet. So so definitely would be interested in any any sort of neurotok so I followed Yeah, I'm following everybody here. So yeah interested.
  455: A coin flip having no known information about the future. Complete uncertainty JW are you super yes sir, of course this isn't making us all use to yourself because you're so many connections everything is fundamentally it is no emergency skills without organization orders like nature just to dimensional sound wave function that oscillates potentiality and then once these zeros and ones begin to organize scale by scale emergency curves now.
  500: Of every neuro oscillation in a single brain so the idea of a computer that could accurately simulate the entire cosmos is itself just it's it's because of the amount of compute involved it just by itself just a far-fetched idea, but this computer with its vast resources would also have to likely exist in a universe that may also be simulated so if one simulation contains many smaller simulations and those smaller simulations contain many more smaller simulations each subsequent simulation should be draining the compute resources of the first simulation of the highest simulation, so as you explore this idea you begin to see that.
  542: You know text of the thought experiment that I presented I just tried to give something like a visual metaphor that allows us to imagine that an observer is a mighty stable particle system, so it's basically lots of small diseases that form larger vortices and then individual particle. I imagine to be something like mathematical vortex that is oscillating in a multiple dimensions depending on the type of the particles, it can be two four or eight dimensions or combinations thereof and they basically get embedded into a long.
  545: Er surrounding interaction space which oscillates and fewer dimensions and you can embed the things at scale into a cruft 3 dimensional space that is evolving time and so the sinking of yourself as a system of what you see that our mighty stable that our can arrange themselves in such a way that they don't fall apart but they can form memories that so remember things in their past and can use this to control their behavior in the future.
  974: And also from ordinary materialism. And this is like interest later properly this is the following I gave this example imagine that your brain is is not just naturally performing the architecture that implements the cells and it becomes conscious basically all at once or gradually by informing all the right pathways and so on but imagine that the brain is in some photo necessance state and bubbles and forms all these oscillations and so on and there is something that can critical causation there's critical coarsenation is the necessary.
  983: And. Be a person and do all the things that you're doing and be stable. Who have the stable rates which relies on the living organism that is it's healthy so. Functioning. These oscillations also. Great and there is nothing left. And the idea of.

    3: # The simplified version of Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
    4: which can also be called: Neural Array Projection Slice Phase Oscillation Tomography.
   14: I moved the note on Cellular Oscillating Tomography: Bacteria to a0283z
   34: I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T.. Read note a0270z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md Note this note, like all the notes, is still under construction, further changes lay ahead.
   63: The consequence of C.O.T. Cellular Oscillating Tomography, is there is no more concept of development apart from evolution, there is only evolution. There is no more artificial that is separate from natural. There is no more man that is separate from nature. There is only nature.
   67: Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells
   69: People talk about how gasses become water as emergence, but perhaps a better word concept than emergence is oscillation, like the fireflies, when they synchronize, it looks like emergent behavior, but really its the physics of oscillation.
   71: The oscillation of fireflies and the oscillation of cells points to how all the cells in the body can act as a single sensor, entified through the principles of oscillation, entified in time & space, by passing & dissipating signals between cells until the separate cells are in sync as a single sensor, once in sync every part of your cellular body can sense every other part, because touching one part of your body triggers a wave of signals to pass to all the cells of the body.
   75: âŸª 292 characters skipped âŸ«itic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time crystal dilation, and all these new ideas are sync'd together with the physics of oscillation.
   82: 3. My theory of brain function is complete enough to build conscious self aware robots, I have enough theory to make a computer have feelings & emotions & have inner qualia experiences. I haven't written the code for this yet but I have the theory needed that can lead to code development. The name of the theory that will allow us to modify existing neural network architectures into sentient architectures is called NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, in these notes it is also referred to as Neural Oscillatory Tomography and Neural Array Projection Tomography. Search for all 3 terms in this github repo to see the notes connected to this theory.

   95: 9. I coined the phrase Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography which explains the inner eye, or the observer inside the brain as entifiedÂ neural array projections.Â https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/34563a1264edc55836963bf8b49915ff5664ed7b/a0115z.md9. 
  100: 11. I wrote a theory that explains how withÂ oscillationsÂ LTP & LTD work and how that applies to plant growth, Feymen's Path Integral Formulation & more.
  118: 16. I applied BuzsÃ¡ki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.
  320: Neo Mind Cycle, Artificial Neurology, Neural Array-Projection Tomography, Neuro Array Tomography, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, Phase Oscillation Tomography, Conceptual Tomography, Neural Oscillatory Tomography, Neural Oscillating Array-Projection Tomography, Tomodeck, and Cellular Oscillating Tomography are also terms that I invented & defined, that I use, they are Trademarks that I created and use.
