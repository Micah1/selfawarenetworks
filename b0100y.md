Simcity Mushrooms Oscillations Pattern Brain

00:00

There was this one time before I moved to San Francisco that I took mushrooms in Berkeley. I was with a couple of friends. I remember that all three of us were taking mushrooms together and we went walking through Berkeley, downtown Berkeley. This may have been in the year 2010 or 2011.

00:24

We were walking around the city, visiting stores, and we got on the bart train and went to San Francisco. We had the most magical time I think. At one point, I was reading this book called, the holographic universe.

"The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality"
https://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Revolutionary-Theory-Reality/dp/0062014102

00:51

I think it was The Holographic Universe. The first couple chapters of that book are really great. After I began reading that book I began to hallucinate from the mushrooms. I could see multiple versions of the universe overlapping one another like layers in a 3D virtual reality photoshop that was reality. As if reality was a transparent onion with many layers. Each of the layers was slightly different, as if they were distinguished by tempo-spatial distinctions, or slight differences in their scale, their properties, or their position in space.

01:18

The differences were so slight however that I could barely sense their phase shifts, the differences in their phase shifts.

If you imagine that you are basically experiencing, like when you look around in reality, that you're experiencing a compounded pattern, that is lots of different patterns that your brain is individually rendering are vibrating, oscillating, patterns that are harmonically unifying to create your whole experience.

01:51

I would say these are like oscillations that have been imprinted with neural patterns, but these are decoherence patterns, decoherent phase patterns, inside the oscillations normal sync. Right?

So if you had no incoming data, but you just had your oscillations, well I guess you could try a sensory deprivation tank and find out what that is like.

02:46

A sensory deprivation tank is like a drug free way to start to hallucinate and have the experience of seeing things that are not there. Your brain sort of fires without input from sound without input from light. That experience can be incredibly therapeutic & healing. So sensory deprivation can be a good experience for some people.

03:11

I was experiencing reality as being like the layers of an onion, that I could now sense and then and then, so just now I'm like, you know, like there's been lots of different ways to, you know, different sort of ways that I have felt my interpretation of reality shift.

03:47

(lots edited out - skip forward)

05:11

There was this one time that I went to the docks (while hallucinating) and I could see the entire world as like a digital city in the film the Matrix. I could see computer code within the layers of reality, defining the buildings, the docks, the rocks, the sky, everything. I could see like into infinity in the horizon of the San Francisco bay, and this was an experience with five tabs of LSD at once.

05:37

I could look around and I was able to see through buildings. Buildings in the distance became transparent to me, (I wasn't actually seeing through the buildings, it was a really interesting illusion) and I felt like I could see the matrix (as depicted in the film The Matrix) like, I could see how the city conceptually was a computer program, defined by moving code, a city that consisted of oscillating information patterns.

06:17

(Lots of edits. Just skip from the 6:17 mark to the 8:07 mark)

08:07

There was this moment when I started to really think about what consciousness is, what the mind is, what self-awareness is, what perception is, what being very awakened, & self-aware, and feeling what feeling my mind means. 

08:39

There was a moment when I was so deep in thought I don't remember having any sense of what was around me at that moment.

I was deep inside my mind and just being aware of the most primitive possible sensation of reality as a basic 2D pattern distinct from another basic 2D pattern. For me it was the most basic & simplistic visual representation of the root difference that defines conscious reality.

It was a difference between two planes, representing two patterns, that were divided by an edge, the difference between two flat spatial entities felt like a root distinction.

If we could reduce the experience of experience to its most basic concept. Perhaps at the lowest possible distinction experience is the simplest distinction between something & nothing, or a difference between two or more states.

09:13

Like two different squares, and some sort of line or distinction between them, or an edge, like an edge between the two squares. I remember that each of the squares had a slightly different color.

09:32

One was a peach color and the other one was a reddish peach color. I was just sort of thinking of this experience as the experience of what is perception at the absolute root of conscious perception.

09:54

There at the root of sensation is distinction, any distinction between one thing and another thing. Implied in observing this distinction is an observer, or another distinction. A conscious observer who is observing this distinction.

I realized that to represent the observer you need an additional point. So there's actually like three points, or maybe four. There's A which is one pattern, B which is the second pattern that is distinct from A, and there is C which is the observer of the distinction between A & B. The distinction of an observer could be a third point, or a fourth point, perhaps the distinction between A & B is also a distinct point.

10:30

So there's like three points being connected here, right, three or four concepts that exist somewhere in an organism's mind? There's almost like there's a distinction being made and we can almost boil it down to a circuit, right? There's a 3 point circuit between three points, that allows any one of those points to be aware of a distinction between the other two points.

11:06

The circuit is like one thing is two, things are making a distinction and then the third thing is observing and you can almost do it with like. And the thing that's observing could be one of the two things, right? You could almost do that because it's like, if you had a circuit with two things and one thing could detect that it was not the same as the other thing.

11:36

Like, well, that thing is faster than me, right? Then it is basically, that's like, that's like a root distinction. And that distinction, you know, if that distinction is sort of like, is in a circuit like a vibration in a circuit, right? Then it can notice. It's then it's like it's like the distinction is disturbing or is activating or it is innervating or oscillating.

12:17

Distinction is pushing apart non-distinction in a way, it's just this tiny edge of variance, detected & rendered repeatedly to gain a temporal existence inside an inner display inside inner detectors that are also the display. The patterns in the mind are physical distinctions that are being transmitted and received. It's being received by something and even the idea that it's been received by something is being transmitted, right? What we are talking about are multiple detected patterns cycling through multiple pattern detectors, and the links that form as a result of this pattern activity inside the neural network of the brain are the synapses, and the synapses are the learned representations of activity that form long term memories that become activities again thanks to incoming stimulus.

12:55

So one is one pattern, one is another pattern one, one is that there's a distinction and the fourth piece of information would be that there's an there's an observer or there is an observation, right? But the part about the observer is tricky, I'm like well, okay, so the observer is a piece of information also.

13:27

So it's kind of like a rendered perspective, right? As long as there's a rendering of a perspective in the organism for the organism to perceive & compare with incoming sensory signals we don’t actually have to render any observer, it is enough to imply that there is one. The organism can predict itself, the existence of the self, even if there isn’t any self, through the process of deduction, or the process of inference. If there is an observation, then by inference there must be an observer. However, all we need to do is put the observation into the organism, and update it.

So in my mind's rendering of the concept of rendering I would see a 2D pattern, like a flat 360 image, but flattened out, and this 2D pattern was like a circle, but then the circle would unfold into a 3D space.


13:54

So this image was like 3D space was being compressed into a flat 2D circle and so that is kind of interesting because I'm like well you know what? If the synapse, right, that's encoding. It's capturing, you know something. What if that represents the 2D circle, right? And so when that expands the oscillator now represents the 3D volume, right?

14:34

So something is going from like a two-dimensional representation to like a three-dimensional representation in the oscillator. I mean it's really a 4 dimensional representation in the brain's oscillators. It really helps for the brain to have many different chaotic oscillators to maintain independent oscillations. Multi-tasked patterns represented by independent oscillations would be useful if you need to track multiple objects in your environment. Such as tracking a car that's traveling really fast or, you know, you're tracking different people and an environment. If you basically had the ability to assign different people to different oscillators. If your brain did that automatically.

15:29

And it would sort of just track them sort of like independent of where your head is positioned like you just sort of like starts to start to temper. A temporary memory that tracks the people around you. As you're walking around, looking around and encodes them in the oscillators, then you're sort of like, I'm just temporarily right?

*(This is one of those ideas that does not describe my current thinking that well. I don't imagine that a synapse carries a 360 picture frame from a movie, which is almost what it sounds like I am describing. No. However the neuron, in relationship to its oscillating group of neurons, its network, is capable of rendering a simple pattern variation, a change in phase. A single neuron is a sensor and a transmitter capable of rendering a phase change, and detecting a phase change (via the process described as "Memory-Prediction" also known as Predictive Coding. So a circuit of such neurons, two, three or more might observe the distinctions made by itself & or other neurons. In a neural circuit, with oscillating or temporally looping activity, a self-aware observer might emerge, or computational observation might happen.)

15:55

And maybe it's out of your field of view, you might forget its there. You as the pattern in the oscillator might fade out. The pattern of the other person, that was being represented by another oscillator might get a new pattern, that oscillator might now represent a new pattern that is now more important to the brain in that moment.

16:15

And so you could have different patterns in different oscillators that can cycle through having different patterns and the thing is they're essentially transmitting the patterns that they're containing to the entire brain. So you can have oscillating patterns for the room being broadcast all over the brain while the patterns representing specific things in that room, like tables, chairs, your phone, your cup, these things might also be patterns that are each represented by a different oscillating group of cells, perhaps by a micro cortical column. This would enable your brain to multitask pattern rendering, and to sort of render patterns in transparent layers, just activating what you are looking at when you are looking at it. So the organism has the experience of reality, but it's just a sequence of graphically rendered concepts based on a tomographically constructed map of reality which is the assembling of coincidence detections by neurons, that are transmitting phase changes that create the components for coincidence detections by other neurons.

17:00

Lets talk about linking patterns in the brain together, so the neuron detects information as coincidences in frequencies over time. In that sense the neuron is a light sensor, but it also transmits a phase pattern, 0, 1, 2, or 3 Micro-Vesicle sacks might be released from that neuron, along with soliton wave vibrations across the EM Spectrum.

If we imagine a neural circuit as containing many of these phase detecting & phase transmitting neurons (and glial cells) and each cell distributing their phase patterns to many cells via the branching exit terminals, then you can imagine the neuron as having a microphone, and a boom box, it can listen, or it can speak, it can watch, or it can broadcast an image. Imagine that the neuron is like an eyeball with a lightbulb. A neuron is both a camera, and an LED pixel. So imagine a neural circuit as like an array of cameras, and also as an array of LED Pixels. 

So imagine you have the same firing sequence in the right visual cortex and the left visual cortex, but the two areas of the brain are not clearly connected, and perhaps they are not directly connected. Perhaps there is no direct interneuron, yet the same firing sequence might happen in both areas at the same. 

However like all the small oscillators (neurons & neural circuits) interact with the big groups of oscillators in the brain, because the vibrations, the electric & chemical signals, all of the physics between cells cause all the oscillators to interact, so they can really maintain long distance synchronization patterns without direct connections because the oscillators grind on each other like the gears of a clock, when one gear moves, it moves the other gears, when one oscillators, it moves the other oscillators. That is the key reason the brain is sensitive to itself, or sensing itself, it's because of oscillatory physics.

17:20

In this next thought experiment I'm thinking about two pyramidal neurons and connecting those two neurons with an interneuron. I want to imagine the simplest possible version, the lowest resolution version, of a live conscious self-aware observer.

17:42

So imagine one interneuron connecting two pyramidal cells.

If you had two oscillating phase patterns that each being repeated by one of those pyramidal cells.
Each coming from neurons receiving different inputs, and they learned to sync to each other's patterns that the synchronization is almost the same, just slightly off, just a little different, they like absorbed each other's syncing patterns, but something is keeping them from a perfect sync, some interacting neighbor that only one of them has perhaps?

18:20

And so if we ignore the neurons and just conceptualize their oscillating activity as producing phase patterns. We can now contemplate temporal & spatial syncing phase patterns as entities in virtual space that can interact, this is your mind.

With the 3 cells we are imagining we have the beginning of a pattern circuit. Each cell is capable of producing a phase pattern that the other cells can perceive. 

With three cells it's a pattern circuit that consists of multiple neurons firing over space & time. One cell can perceive a difference between two other cells, and over time, it can compare one difference to another difference. The phase of the cell to the right of its observation might increase or decrease relative to the phase of the cell to the left of its observation. This concept is the concept of nervous tissue, or conscious flesh. Each neuron in a three neuron circuit might be aware of a two bit pattern, that there are two phases, a 1 phase where the neuron on the left has a greater pattern, and a 0 phase where the neuron on the left has a lessor pattern (compared to the neuron on the right.) Imagine that this is like having a black & white LED pixel. Now add 5 more neurons and its like giving your neural circuit color perception. The more neurons you add the more complex the patterns can potentially get.

You can extend this idea to 30 cells or 3000 cells, or 30,000 cells, you can see a pattern emerging in the 3D topography of fired & depressed neural activity emerging on both sides of the brain in the same frequency spectrum, and 

18:56

imagine that these two patterns are synchronized, without being directly connected, they are synchronized temporally, and they are synchronized because of common interactions with larger oscillations that sometimes connect the two oscillating patterns together.

Patterns once fired get scaled up via inhibition signaling, i.e. they depress other neurons, they temporarily depress larger sets of neurons and that helps the brain to scale up the fired pattern into ever larger oscillators that ripple across the brain.

Patterns basically ricochet across the brain, affecting the rendering of reality as you see it.

Patterns across the brain don't have to be directly connected with interneurons as long as they are connected by the global oscillator pattern, that this to say remotely synchronized patterns might have a common attractor that only exists virtually (or once in a while during the oscillation of a time period (day, week, month, year, decade, century). 

When patterns fire their signal gets magnified, by the global oscillatory brain pattern, or the global neocortex, brain pattern, that oscillates through all the cortical columns and is coordinated by the thalamus and intern neurons in the default mode network.

If we want to get really abstract we can imagine that in theory a pattern can get magnified to fly across all of spacetime, from my mind, to any other person’s mind. What that pattern means to you when it arrives is up to you, but you can imagine people speculating about telepathy after considering this idea, but also you can imagine patterns from the past affecting the future, and if some quantum physics geeks are correct, you can imagine patterns from the future affecting the past. You can imagine virtual patterns & virtual entities (that either don’t exist yet, or potentially exist in the future, or only exist temporarily in between certain events) exerting force from beyond existence, like virtual attractors that require some energy threshold for existence that isn’t met, and so the energy dissipating from being below the threshold of that attractor’s existence has some triggering effect on the oscillating system.

20:49

Rendered perspectives to not only be transmitted across the brain, but pinged across the entire brain, imagine a blasts of echolocation, imagine your brains cells are like little radar machines, doing little scans that detect & report phase changes to one another, like a local radio broadcast to local radio repeaters that repeat & modify the signal, the parts of the signal each node in the brainwave sequence recognizes,

and so this multi-cell radio station broadcast of varying frequencies blasting outward from one area of the brain to every other part of their brain because

it's sort of like a magnify as across the strip of the brain, right from the micro to the macro and the idea is that whatever you're paying attention to that is that is sort of that consists of these little tiny synaptic patterns that have been amplified and magnified to fly across your entire brain into the largest scale of your of your focus which is rendered like an onion with many layers.

21:47

Imagine that your reality is rendered in your brain with many overlapping layers, synchronized representations of spaces, objects, events, encoded in varying frequency patterns from wall to wall, from floor to ceiling, from sky to ground.

It's like you have an onion or layers of rendered reality, made of phase space and every area of your brain is rendering part of that onion and phase space. The phases are the frequencies of your brain that range from 0.02 hz to 600 Hertz.

22:25

0.02 hz to 600 Hertz is your phase field. That's what your neurons are detecting & changing (sensing, considering, modifying, and transmitting). That is the light inside the mind's eye, the light that is appearing in your brain's neural oscillators as the neurons broadcasts, the patterns that are being recognized to your neural oscillators. Your mind is rendered frequencies (brainwaves) encoded in oscillating groups of cell assemblies (like cortical columns, neural circuits, edge communities, neural sensory arrays) and then your neural-oscillators see the world, predict the future, and react to the predicted future. Your brain predicts the future of its own actions, but the brain also predicts the future of other people's actions, and you use this process to predict & render to yourself the future, the environmental consequences of your actions in the environment.

23:10

And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.
