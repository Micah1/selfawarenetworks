Simcity Mushrooms Oscillations Pattern Brain

00:00

There was this one time before I moved to San Francisco that I took mushrooms in Berkeley. I was with a couple of friends. I remember that all three of us were taking mushrooms together and we went walking through Berkeley, downtown Berkeley. This may have been in the year 2010 or 2011.

00:24

We were walking around the city, visiting stores, and we got on the bart train and went to San Francisco. We had the most magical time I think. At one point, I was reading this book called, the holographic universe.

"The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality"
https://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Revolutionary-Theory-Reality/dp/0062014102

00:51

I think it was The Holographic Universe. The first couple chapters of that book are really great. After I began reading that book I began to hallucinate from the mushrooms I could see multiple versions of the universe overlapping one another like layers in a 3D virtual reality photoshop that was reality. Layers of an onion as if reality was a transparent onion with many layers. Each of the layers was slightly different, as if they were distinguised by tempo-spatial distinctions, or slight differences in their scale, their properties, or their position in space.

01:18

The differences were so slight however that I could barely sense their phase shifts, the differences in their phase shifts.

If you imagine that you are basically experiencing, like when you look around in reality, that you're experiencing a compounded pattern, that is lots of different patterns that your brain is individually rendering are vibrating, oscillating, patterns that are harmonically unifying to create your whole experience.

01:51

I would say these are like oscillations that have been imprinted with neural patterns, but these are decoherence patterns, decoherent phase patterns, inside the oscillations normal sync. Right?

So if you had no incoming data, but you just had your oscillations, well I guess you could try a sensory deprivation tank and find out what that is like.

02:46

A sensory deprivation tank is like a drug free way to start to hallucinate and have the experience of seeing things that are not there. Your brain sort of fires without input from sound without input from light. That experience can be incredibly therapeutic & healing. So sensory deprivation can be a good experience for some people.

03:11

I was experiencing reality as being like the layers of an onion, that I could now sense and then and then, so just now I'm like, you know, like there's been lots of different ways to, you know, different sort of ways that I have felt my interpretation of reality shift.

(lots edited out - skip foward)

There was this one time that I went to the docks (while hallucinating) and I should see the entire world as like a digital city in the film the Matrix, I could see computer code within the layers of reality, defining the buildings, the docks, the rocks, the sky, everything. I could see like into infinity in the horizon of the San Francisco bay, and this was an experience with five tabs of LSD at once.

05:37

I could look around and I was able to see through buildings. Buildings in the distance became transparent to me, (I wasn't actually seeing through the buildings, I was a really interesting illusion) and I felt like I could see the matrix (as depicted in the film The Matrix) like, I could see how the city conceptually was a computer program, defined by moving code, a city that consisted of oscillating information patterns.

(Lots of edits. Just skip from the 6:17 mark to the 8:07 mark)

08:07

There was this moment when I started to really think about what consciousness is, what the mind is, what self-awareness is, what perception is, what being very awakened, & self-aware, and feeling feeling my mind means. 

08:39

There was a moment when I was so deep in thought I don't remember having any sense of what was around me at that moment.

I was deep inside my mind and just being aware of the most primitive possible sensation of reality as a basic 2D pattern distinct from another basic 2D pattern. For me it was the most basic & simplistic visual representation of the root difference that defines conscious reality.

It was a difference between two planes, representing two patterns, that were divided by an edge, the difference between two flat spatial entities felt like a root distinction.

If we could reduce the experience of experience to its most basic concept. Perhaps at the lowest possible distinction experience is the simplist distinction between something & nothing, or a difference between two or more states.

09:13

Like two different squares, and some sort of line or distinction between them, or an edge, like an edge between the two squares. I remember that each of the squares had slightly different color.

09:32

One was peach and the other one was a reddish peach. I was just sort of like thinking this experience as the experience of what is perception at the absolute root of conscious perception.

09:54

There at the root of sensation is distinction, any distinction between one thing and another thing. Implied in observing this distinction is an observer, or another distinction. A conscious observer who is observing this distinction.

I realized that to represent the observer you need an additional point. So there's actually there's like three points, or maybe four. There's A which is one pattern, B which is the second pattern that is distinct from A, and there is C which is the observer of the distinction between A & B. The distinction of an observer could be a third point, or a fourth point, perhaps the distinction between A & B is also a distinct point.

10:30

So there's like three points being connected here, right, three or four concepts that exist somewhere in an organisms mind? There's almost like there's a distinction being made and we can almost boil it down to a circuit, right? There's a 3 point circuit between three points, that allows any one of those points to be aware of a distinction between the other two points.

11:06

The circuit is like one thing is two, things are making a distinction and then the third thing is observing and you can almost do it with like. And the thing that's observing could be one of the two things, right? You could almost do that because it's like, if you had a circuit with two things and one thing could detect that it was not the same as the other thing.

11:36

Like, well, that thing is faster than me, right? Then it is basically, that's like, that's like a root distinction. And that distinction, you know, if that distinction is sort of like, is in a circuit like a vibration in a circuit, right? Then it can notice. It's then it's like it's it's like the distinction is disturbing or is activating or is is innervating or oscillating.

12:17

The distinction that is you go sort of like pushing apart non-distinction in a way, it's just this tiny edge of variance. That is being transmitted and received. It's being received by something and even the idea that it's been received by something is being transmitted, right? Because there's actually there's three pieces of information that are cycling through, right?

12:55

So one is one pattern, one is another pattern one, one is that there's a distinction and the fourth piece of information would be that there's an there's an observer or there is an observation, right? But the part about the observer is tricky, I'm like well, okay, so the observer is a piece of information also.

13:27

So it's kind of like a rendered perspective, right? As long as, as long as there's a rendering of a perspective. Oh and another there's another one where I saw basically, I would see like a 2D pattern. The 2D pattern was like a circle but then the circle would unfold into a 3D space.

13:54

So this image was like 3D space was being compressed into a flat 2D circle and so that is kind of interesting because I'm like well you know what? If the the synapse, right, that's encoding. It's capturing, you know something. What if that represents the, the 2D circle, right? And and so when that expands the oscillator now represents the 3D volume, right?

14:34

So something is going from like a two-dimensional representation to like a three-dimensional representation in the oscillator. I mean it's a really a 4 dimensional representation in the brain's oscillators. It really helps for the brain to have many different chaotic oscillators can maintain independent, oscillations. Multi-tasked patterns represented by independent oscillations would be useful if you need to track multiple objects in your environment. Such as tracking a car that's traveling really fast or, you know, you're tracking different people and an environment. If you basically had the ability to assign different people to different oscillators. If your brain did that automatically.

15:29

And it would like sort of just track them sort of like independent of where your head is positioned like you just sort of like starts to start to temper. A temporary memory that tracks the people around you. As you're walking around, looking around and encodes them in the oscillators, then you're sort of like, I'm just temporarily right?

*(This is one of those ideas that does not describe my current thinking that well. I don't imagine that a synapse carries a 360 picture frame from a movie, which is almost what it sounds like I am describing. No. However the neuron, in relationship to its oscillating group of neurons, its network, is capable of rendering a simple pattern variation, a change in phase. A single neuron is a sensor and a transmitter capable of rendering a phase change, and detecting a phase change (via the process described as "Memory-Prediction" also known as Predictive Coding. So a circuit of such neurons, two three or more might observe the distinctions made by itself & or other neurons. In a neural circuit, with oscillating or temporally looping activity, a self-aware observer might emerge, or computational observation might happen.)

15:55

And maybe it's out of your field of view, you might forget there there. You as the oscillator might  fade out, the pattern of the other person, was being was represented by another oscillator might get a new pattern, a pattern that is now more important to the brain.

16:15

And so you could have different oscillations that can cycle through having different patterns and the thing is they're essentially a transmitting the patterns that they're containing to the entire brain.

There was one point when I diagrammed a link potential link between you know there's there is the intern neurons which can help establish a remote cooperation between hemispheres, right?

17:00

So there could be like an intern neuron link or multi-neuron link to go from a pattern in the right visual cortex that matches pretty close to a left hemisphere of the neocortex, and thos two patterns can be in sync and the same pattern can

17:20

appear in both from a great distance, whether there is a direct interneuron connection or another pathway, a multi-neuron pathway. It would be useful to simplify the model I'm thinking about to imagine two pyramidal neurons and connect those two neurons with an intern neuron, and that is perhaps enough to create the most simple low resolution live conscious observer.

17:42

Maybe there was an internal connection at some point or maybe there an interneuron connection between those two areas. If you had two patterns that were receiving the same stimulus patterns and developing the same patterns from their separate, incoming inputs, and they learned to sync to each other's patterns that the synchronization, they like absorbed each other's sinking patterns.

18:20

And these are like these are like these are temporal & spatial syncing patterns. So it's like, you know, it's like a it's like a pattern, a pattern circuit that consists of multiple neurons through time, that sort of creates a shape that brain researchers can identify with imaging. And they can see that that that sort of shape emerging shape of neural activity emerging on both sides of the brain in the same frequency spectrum.

18:56

And so, they know that these two patterns are synchronized, but they, but the idea is that, that I that I'm thinking about is that patterns that appear in the brain, they get scaled up, they depress other, they temporarily depress a sets of neurons and that helps to scale up the pattern into ever larger oscillators and, and until patterns, basically ricochet across the brain and the thing is like, now the the the the direct link between the patented the synchronized pattern in the left hemisphere and the direct link between the synchronized pattern in the right hemisphere, they don't have to be directly connected with an internar on anymore because the global pattern is our, you know, when they send it when they're signal gets magnified, by the global oscillatory brain pattern, or the global neocortex, brain pattern, that oscillates through all the cortical columns and is that's coordinated by the the thalamus and intern neurons in the default mode network.

20:11

And so on that, that pattern is basically going to enable hey, is called

20:38

That pattern is basically going to enable.

20:49

Rendered perspective to to not only be transmitted across the brain, sort of like, but sort of like imagine like a bat signal like like echolocation like it's like broadcast like a like a radio but like a radio frequency being broadcast out from one area of the brain to every other part of their brain because it's sort of like a magnify as across the strip of the brain, right from the micro to the macro and the idea is that whatever you're paying attention to that is that is sort of that consists of these little tiny synaptic patterns that have been amplified and magnified to fly across your entire brain into the largest scale of your of your focus which is rendered like an onion with many layers.

21:47

Your reality is rendered like an onion by your brain with many layers many phasers. It's like you have an onion that's made of facebase and every area of your brain is rendering part of that onion and face space. And it's a face-based of of phases that are from the, the differences between the, the phases are the frequencies of your brain that range from point zero that the range from zero point zero to Hertz all the way up to 600 Hertz.

22:25

That's your phase field. That's what you're neurons are interfacing with and changing. That is the, that is the light that is appearing in your brains neural oscillators as the neurons broadcasts, the patterns that are being recognized to your neural oscillators. Your whole brains are oscillators and then your neurosculators, see the world and predict the, the future of it's of their own actions, your brain predicts the future of its own actions, but the brain also predicts the future of other people's actions.

23:10

And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you wear your interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that you're your whole body is a fractal oscillations, that is a branch node of a fractal universe.
