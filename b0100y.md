Simcity Mushrooms Oscillations Pattern Brain

00:00

There was this one time before I moved to San Francisco that I took mushrooms in Berkeley. I was with a couple of friends and at least was taking mushrooms as well. Actually I remember that all three of us were taking mushrooms together and we went walking through Berkeley, downtown Berkeley. This may have been in the year 2010 or 2011.

00:24

We were walking around the city, visiting stores, and we got on the bart train and went to San Francisco. We had the most magical time I think. At one point, I was reading this book called, the holographic mind or the holographic universe.

"The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality"
https://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Revolutionary-Theory-Reality/dp/0062014102

00:51

I think it was The Holographic Universe. The first couple chapters of that book are really great. When I started through hallucinate from the mushrooms I could see multiple versions of the universe overlapping one another like layers of 3D virtual reality photoshop, or layers of an onion as if reality was a transparent onion with many layers. Each of the layers was slightly different, as if they were distinguised by tempo-spatial distinctions, or slight differences in their scale, their properties, or their position in space.

01:18

The differences were so slight however that I could barely sense their phase shifts, the differences in their phase shifts.

If you imagine that you are basically experiencing, like when you look around in reality, that you're experiencing a compounded pattern, that is lots of different patterns that your brain is individually rendering are vibrating, oscillating, unifying to create your whole experience.

01:51

I would say these are like oscillations that have been imprinted with neural patterns, but these are decoherents patterns, decoherent space patterns, inside the oscillations normal sync. Right?

So if you had no incoming data, but you just had your oscillations, well I guess you could try a sensory deprivation tank and find out what that is like.

02:46

A sensory deprivation tank is like a drug free way to start to hallucinate and have the experience of seeing things that are not there. Your brain sort of fires without input from sound without input from light. That experience can be incredibly therapeutic & healing. So sensory deprivation can be a good experience for some people.

03:11

I was experiencing reality as being like the layers of an onion, that I could now sense and then and then, so just now I'm like, you know, like there's been lots of different ways to, you know, different sort of ways that I have felt my interpretation of reality shift.

03:47

There was actually with the mushrooms a moment when I felt connected to another another universe. Now the current thing on television is we have these commercials for Marvel's multi-universe. I don't know what it is but they have like there's like one version of Spider-Man.

04:14

And then another verse is another version of Spider-Man and there's all these different versions of Spider-Man, they're all different. Some of them are male or some different female, and one of them is a pig. There's a multiverse thing with Loki, Loki is an interesting character even before Marvel's version of Loki.

Loki in the mythologies,was always very interesting.

05:11

There was this one time that I tried. I went to the docks and I should see the entire world into, like, I can see you layers. I can see like into infinity down by the docks, and this was like with five tabs of LSD happening at the same time.

05:37

I could look around and I was able to see through buildings. They became transparent to me to really interesting illusion and I felt like I could see the matrix, like, I could see how the city conceptually was a computer program, and also like an oscillating network.

06:17

Our SimCity South Sim City, may have have also contributed a little bit to, to the development of the ideas that went into the matrix from like, you know, like William Gibson's novel, I guess, was a major contributor, but I mean, like, like video games like SimCity. Like this, this must have had something influence, I think, right?

06:40

Like we're seeing we've been talking about, you know, since computers began about the prospects of artificial intelligence in the prospects of simulating the world. And and you know, and your concepts like cyber space or internet or metaverse or the virtual reality, right? Like, these are And but there is also point when I start to like get really worried out weirded out.

07:15

By the way, version looking at me like like is it the bird recognized that I was high at that point. It's like the birds like here on LSD, aren't you? It's like I could tell just by looking at you this really able to send telepath, you're able to talk to me now because you're on Ellis and where we have a and a link between myself and a bird and that was really weird.

07:43

Yeah. Like getting stared down by birds. You normally wouldn't? They wouldn't like, really be that curious to a person who is not not high. Like I got extra weird attention converse that they're ready, that I know. Wasn't just my person just it wasn't just my drug perception. They were really.

08:07

Yeah that's that's not normal is different, cool. Definitely fun but weird and but then, there was this moment when I started to really think about what consciousness is what the mind is, but self-awareness is, but perception is what being very awakened self-aware and feeling feeling my mind. And and so I just like, really sort of like lost.

08:39

I sort of like was so deep and thought that I be that I I don't remember having any sense of what was around me at that moment I was like, going in inside my mind and just being aware of the like, the most basic two-dimensional pattern. And like, just like trying to think about how it was like the most, it was like the simplest representation of a distinction between two different patterns, right?

09:13

Like two different squares and some sort of like line between them to. Yeah. So I mean and not really a line but like an edge, like an edge between the two squares, right? So that there's there's very stick the cutest possible distinction and I think one of the square, I think the scores had different colors.

09:32

So that's two dimensions of a possibility, right? Like one was like peach and one of them was like, reddish speech and I was sort of like this was like occupying my consciousness for a an unknown amount of time. And I was just sort of like thinking about what is perception of the absolute root of it.

09:54

And I realized that that at the root of it, it is at the very least it. There is the sensation of a distinction between between one thing and another in that an implied and it apply that implies and observer right there. So there's actually there's like three points. Is one is, there's a, there's a distinction but there's there's there is that implies, it's something as observing that distinction.

10:30

And the the more I I I just like I just tried to say okay. Well, so there's like three points being connected here, right? There's almost like there's a distinction being made and they boil it down really simple, right? So it's almost like a circuit, right? There's a 3 point circuit between this.

11:06

The circuit is like one thing is two, things are making a distinction and then the third thing is observing and you can almost do it with like. And the thing that's observing is one of the two things, right? You could almost do that because it's like, if you had a circuit with two things and one thing could detect that it was not the same as the other thing.

11:36

Like, well, that thing is faster than me, right? Then it is basically, that's like, that's like a root distinction. And that distinction, you know, if that distinction is sort of like, is in a circuit like a vibration in a circuit, right? Then it can notice. It's then it's like it's it's like the distinction is disturbing for is activating or is is innervating oscillating.

12:17

The distinction that that is you go sort of like pushing apart non-distinction in a way, it's just this tiny edge of variance. That is being transmitted and received. It's being received by something and it even the idea that it's been received by something is being transmitted, right? Because there's actually there's three pieces of information that are cycling through, right?

12:55

So one is one pattern, one is another pattern one, is that there's a distinction and the fourth piece of information would be that. There's an there's and observer or there is an observation, right? But the, but the part about the observer is tricky, I'm like well, okay, so the observer is a piece of information also.

13:27

So it's kind of like a rendered perspective, right? As long as, as long as there's a rendering of a perspective. Oh and another there's another one where I saw basically, I would see like a 2D pattern. That was that would the treaty pattern was like a circle but then the circle would unfold into a 3D space.

13:54

So this image was like 3D space was being compressed into a flat 2D circle and so that is kind of interesting because I'm like well you know what? If the the synapse, right, that's encoding. It's capturing, you know something. What if that represents the, the 2D circle, right? And and so when that expands the oscillator now represents the 3D volume, right?

14:34

So something is going from like a two-dimensional representation to like a three-dimensional representation in the oscillator. I mean it's a really afford dimensional representation in the brain's oscillators and in the brains, he knows a brain. It really helps for the brain to have many different chaotic, oscillate, oscillating, oscillators that that are able to, I guess, sort of like maintain independent, oscillations, like, that would be useful if you need to, if you like, if you like look at a car that's traveling really fast or, you know, you're tracking different people and an environment if you basically had the ability to assign different people to different oscillators through brain like sort of that automatically.

15:29

And so it would like sort of just track them sort of like independent of where your head is positioned like you just sort of like starts to start to temper. A temporary memory that just sort of like tracks the people around you. As you're walking around, looking around and encodes them in the oscillators, then you're sort of like, I'm just temporarily right?

15:55

And, and maybe it's out of your field of view. You might forget there there, right? You're the oscillator might might fade out, it's pattern or that the pattern of the outside was being was representing my past to another oscillator or it might get a new pattern, it's more important.

16:15

And so you could have different oscillations that can cycle through having different patterns and but they think is there they're essentially a transmitting, their patterns the patterns that they're containing to the entire brain. And so you know so that you have, you know, situations where you know I there there was one point when I diagrammed a link potential link between you know there's there is the intern neurons which can help establish a remote cooperation between hemispheres, right?

17:00

So there could be like an intern or on length or multinoran link to go from a pattern in the right visual cortex that that matches pretty close to a learned pattern, in the left, hemisphere of the neocortex, and the two patterns can be in sync and the same pattern can be.

17:20

It can appear in both from a great distance, whether there is an address on connection or another pathway or like our multimeter on pathway. It's it's, you know, it it's that that is, it would be useful. If there are two pyramidal neurons, between those two areas with an intern neuron and it would make sense.

17:42

But there's also the possibility that maybe so maybe there was an internal connection or some point there, maybe there was a or maybe there isn't, you know, internal can actually between those two areas. But at the same time, it's like, if you had, if you had two patterns that were, there were receiving the same stimulus patterns and developing the same patterns from the income from their separate, incoming inputs, and they learned to sing to each other's patterns that the synchronization, they like absorbed, each other's sinking patterns.

18:20

And these are like these are like these are temporal antips syncing patterns. So it's like, you know, it's like a it's like a pattern, a pattern circuit that consists of multiple neurons through time, that sort of creates a shape that brain researchers can identify with imaging. And they can see that that that sort of shape emerging shape of neural activity emerging on both sides of the brain in the same frequency spectrum.

18:56

And so, they know that these two patterns are synchronized, but they, but the idea is that, that I that I'm thinking about is that patterns that appear in the brain, they get scaled up, they depress other, they temporarily depress a sets of neurons and that helps to scale up the pattern into ever larger oscillators and, and until patterns, basically ricochet across the brain and the thing is like, now the the the the direct link between the patented the synchronized pattern in the left hemisphere and the direct link between the synchronized pattern in the right hemisphere, they don't have to be directly connected with an internar on anymore because the global pattern is our, you know, when they send it when they're signal gets magnified, by the global oscillatory brain pattern, or the global neocortex, brain pattern, that oscillates through all the cortical columns and is that's coordinated by the the thalamus and intern neurons in the default mode network.

20:11

And so on that, that pattern is basically going to enable hey, is called

20:38

That pattern is basically going to enable.

20:49

Rendered perspective to to not only be transmitted across the brain, sort of like, but sort of like imagine like a bat signal like like echolocation like it's like broadcast like a like a radio but like a radio frequency being broadcast out from one area of the brain to every other part of their brain because it's sort of like a magnify as across the strip of the brain, right from the micro to the macro and the idea is that whatever you're paying attention to that is that is sort of that consists of these little tiny synaptic patterns that have been amplified and magnified to fly across your entire brain into the largest scale of your of your focus which is rendered like an onion with many layers.

21:47

Your reality is rendered like an onion by your brain with many layers many phasers. It's like you have an onion that's made of facebase and every area of your brain is rendering part of that onion and face space. And it's a face-based of of phases that are from the, the differences between the, the phases are the frequencies of your brain that range from point zero that the range from zero point zero to Hertz all the way up to 600 Hertz.

22:25

That's your phase field. That's what you're neurons are interfacing with and changing. That is the, that is the light that is appearing in your brains neural oscillators as the neurons broadcasts, the patterns that are being recognized to your neural oscillators. Your whole brains are oscillators and then your neurosculators, see the world and predict the, the future of it's of their own actions, your brain predicts the future of its own actions, but the brain also predicts the future of other people's actions.

23:10

And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you wear your interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that you're your whole body is a fractal oscillations, that is a branch node of a fractal universe.
