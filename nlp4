Welcome to the Neural Ace Talks with guest Andre Watson post Michael Bloomberg edited by Adam Alonsi. I see myself mostly spending time between the world of engineering biological system, and materials and science material, science, and engineering has relates to making that own particles to deliver genes to different places in the body.
00:34
So when I spend my day to day, really building is my company like handle where we are using logins or things that stick to different markers and things like receptors to guide. These vectors for gene therapy to really specific locations of the body. And I assassinated have spent a lot of time on thinking about synapse physiology.
01:01
I was going to go to the guild for an urine engineering PhD, but I decided to come out here and work on this. So I really love pharmacology and for me understanding consciousness or at least a piece of it is incomplete. Unless we try to look at the molecular picture too.
01:22
Yeah, I agree. So be really fascinating to talk about maybe how that plays a role in the future of the human experience. And also how we're going to build machines, that capture various aspects of human and scholarships got industry. Got me on this training with was a book called on intelligence by Jeff Hawkins or Hawkins and he's he was never a scientist, he said of writing this to, and he was also the made all kinds of different qualifies handspring device then eventually.
02:04
That's really, you know, and then iPhone came along. Sort of, it's okay. So that the home went away, so, which I fucking did instead, was he started the neuroscience research and institute, he wrote about on intelligence. And he, he started this, this computer company called momentum has there. All I do is basically create a computer that's based on the name cortex.
02:34
And so this computer uses what they call hierarchical temporal memory and they say the accordance is a hierarchy and the top of that hierarchies found this. So higher potential memory means that well basically in your sort of describing the structure of a neural network because the deep learning network is specifically structure that hierarchy.
03:04
And so the lower levels of the hierarchy would just focus on the lines and edges, and a little bit and at a higher level, you turn the blinds edges into the computer recognize as a content because it's it's just something wrong, it's bad. And then at a higher level of the network you have the computer begins put together the concept of eyes or, or words or, you know, it's just it's just it's basically a map of the associations of the minds and edges that, but at a higher level it you computer.
03:42
So this is not I because that's what the neuron network represents with its weights problems. So so basically he was describing his book on intelligence. He was subscribing, the corner which was sort of like this. So the neural networks and existed, since since the 80s, a lot of, a lot of great designs for computers came from the 80s.
04:06
And but now that since 2012, we we had some new ideas at the top to make the in our networking people because you going to get about three years ago and now you can eight. Now, in some cases, there are now that works as a receipt I'm curiosity as astrologers evolve is the level of which will really be able to understand and or emulate the human experience.
04:38
And and that's something that would be really interesting to discuss with you. Because I've spent a lot of time, thinking about synapses and sort of how things build from a really bottom of level. Just, you know, molecular pharmacology, how different drugs and ligands and things in your brain. Buy into these different receptors in order to create all those different effects.
05:03
And something that I have learned through studying that is the amount of layers within even a single synapse of the gradients of state that can exist at any given point of time to represent any range of things that are not just a one or zero, or an on or off.
05:23
I feel like that is something that isn't talked about very often or frequently. And I like to at least, think about and sort of forecasts, you know, as we build these technologies. An EG can tell you some basic things and if you have a director in her face or some more advanced technology, you can learn a lot more.
05:44
And certainly, even with existing, FMRIs were able to recreate visual imagery that our brains were seeing based on the FMRI data on its own. And so, as a starting point, there's definitely a possibility for having some interfaces. The question is a lot of people also speak about these technologies, eventually being able to completely function as humans or transcend humans?
06:08
And while I believe that we will have different AIs that will do different things. I really wonder if we're going to see, humanity become obsolete, or kind of the core driver of all of the peripheral, artificial components, that become the future humanity. Sure. And I am a thought about that.
06:30
Because so I remember there was Steven Spielberg made this movie called AI artificial intelligence and in the movie, it was good. It was good. It was, it was, it was a vision of what the future might of, might return the future Definitely. We're taking out of you haven't seen it, but when one thing that in retrospect, the movie was fine, when I saw it in retrospect that there's, I do have one small one, right that they humans, made the distinction between Meccas and Jorge to say that you're a mechanical robot.
07:05
You're a mechanical person and I'm a real person. And so this is like a really interesting. What's interesting is you know you say well what's an organ origin? Organic it's wrong and back. It means made in a factory or something. Artificial nice. Okay, so the thing is, you know, and I heard people describe this this concept in other ways, you know, we're like if we're robots where, you know, like, you know, organic robots are, you know, maybe you know, we're kind of closer being trees and and, and this is like, we're not metal robots, you know, we could have a soil and so it's not possible for machines to have a soul because they don't have the same sort.
07:45
These are things that hurt people say. And I think that VR metal robots, and and so there won't. And I said, because no or mental metal, instruments are metal robots, because are because our nerve cells, for example, are filled with metal filled, with, with any outer, sack of the calcium ions and on the inside filled with potassium ions, you know the calcium ions are, you know, the positivity charge and it's important in the necessary, is the potassium products.
08:21
It's also positively charged, I guess are you if you're saying metal in a sense that is capable of conducting ions in the presence of a variable solution of electoral like concentrations, then, you know, we could read a fine metal for the purposes of this. So from, you know, strictly speaking out.
08:38
That's how the metal casting solution you know, not if they're in solution, not our translation. Okay. And well wait, hold on. Let's talk, let's take a table on the table of elements. There's actually will and yeah. So let's pull this up. I mean, yeah. I mean, they're definitely, you know, industry sounds, they are alkaline metals.
09:03
Yeah, going down from from lithium to sodium to potassium. Yes, the outline earth metals. I, I suppose that is a really interesting way of putting things because by moving around, all these positive charges through active energy. Spending processes were able to control not only the action, potentials, but sort of the, the R of.
09:28
Yeah, the machine was of our firing and magnetic field. Yeah. Yeah. At a really just fine, super level of Alicia physiological weirdness. That's why, you know, I like to say, I believe that consciousness is magnetic because our brains are manipulating a magnetic field. And so interesting. And that we are metal robots.
09:52
And once we solve creating robots, and factory, they'll they'll be no different from students. They'll just be and people will not say, oh, this is surprising. People will say oh of course it makes sense. Universe is a fractal and they'll be like, okay, no big deal. Then the interesting thing to consider is the the basis of the kind of consciousness that we have versus the kind of consciousness that a machine intelligence would have because we've entirely evolved even from the time of being single cellular organisms to feel the world around us in the form of receptors bunnies different molecules.
10:32
And you can think about the electrical part of our biology and our consciousness. But there's also at even the most baseline resolution a physical sensing one and we are built out of these exquisite natto sensors that have the ability to distinguish serotonin from dopamine and a range of thousands of different compounds from each other.
10:58
And this is actually, I would argue one of the core facets of our consciousness. That cannot be adequately modeled through electrophysiology. 11. Okay, we explain I want again. You said, why can't we model it? Well, we're starting from in position of biology by its baseline interacting with its environment to use, an example, of the sort of sensing that a biological self can have you have this family of cells surface markers known as integrands.
11:32
Integrating binds to collagen elastin, these different extracellular, matrix proteins that form the mesh of what comprises your skin and all of your tissues. And through binding to these service, markers is receptors. The receptors are actually mechanism as you pull on the strings so to speak, they engage signaling cascades that are so precise that they can upregulate themselves and produce more of that specific protein or more collagen and things like that.
12:01
As well as things to remodeled the matrix or break it apart and chop it up with these things known as nature's metalloproteins. That's just one. Example on describe that matrix. So you have an extracellular matrix of you know we think of cells and as having you know, we have you know 70 trillion cells in her body and those cells are not just floating around freely.
12:25
They're interacting through series of proteins, like sugar proteins, sugars lipids. And you name it that are all lashed together and a minced. All of that randomness that you perceive. If you boardage naturally things are variable to derive, various specific information where pulling on a single receptor that is bound to by an excess cellular.
12:52
Matrix protein, can trigger very specific signaling cases that cause remodeling of the entire system around it and this is not different with neurons. If you think about a neuron and the axon in the dendrite being last together, people always think of them. As just, there's a sending sign was an interesting city.
13:12
Have you ever wondered why a generic sticks to an axon? Yes, and that's that's the same thing actually. It's an extracellular matrix that holds them together and you have these different circles markers that latch the acts onto the gender, right physically. So you have, for example, this family of proteins known as Netrans that by into nursery and receptors and they're one of the major extracellular matrix components that hold together axons and nutrients.
13:43
Whether they're electrical properties and they want, you don't want to have like because you eat this napped down for the conditions, so whatever is connected to can. You can't have electricity running across that because it always would defeat the snapchat. So there might be properties. Must be inhibiting, electrical signals.
14:02
I think there's still a space there. I think it depends on which protein you're talking about. And I think for the purpose of thinking about how little potentials are propagated it is really hard to envision scale. I wish this is interacting because there are you know, 20,000 proteins and thousands of these proteins exist on the cellular surface and they don't need to be homogeneously tice.
14:31
Junctioned in order for them to be serving their functions, you can have a distribution of an, a lot of things that aren't going to negatively impact the way that cell functions. Okay? So I mean anything that we would say about that would be completely speculative. Yeah, I guess we're going with this.
14:47
Is that? Well some of those saying that. Well, the people who not people do, but they're the guy who's working on the blue brand. Yeah, he was saying that they created a model, a computer program to try to simulate where synapses where he, you know, the where they would connect where cells would connect and they said that it basically what they found out with, it was a computer model was able to, you know, they are basically did it randomly and it was it was like pretty much close to what I actually happens in the brain.
15:22
So they're basically the they're saying that basically in the beginning when people are born and there's synapses or first, you know, growing and connecting that is basically like random. And So what does that mean? Not well yeah I don't well what does it mean for it to be like the brain because it's one thing to have a small centers specifically stimulating.
15:47
Just how near. And there are some form their initial connections with each other. They were, it was basically a, it's a control of the experiment. And so, in reality, there's so many other factors. Yeah. I'll be tilting them. And and so yeah, you can't. When you have a model on the computer, it can't compare to the sorry of.
16:11
Yeah, a real brain. Well, one of the things there that I really wanted to talk about is the nature of kind of, we can call it. The the now brain versus the evolving brain. Yeah. Or if we want to say it, perhaps in terms of pharmacology, the ionic trophy, brain versus the metabolism brain.
16:36
So when you think of an action potential when you think about these metal ions flowing in and out of the cell and being pushed around to change the way the charges work that's ironic. Oh you're talking about the glucose mentality. Yeah, no, I'm talking about every neuron. Every receptor that generates a quote-unquote signal, you can have ion or voltage gated, you can have.
17:03
Basically voltage-gated channels for ions. Yeah, that can either response in or transmitter, or to some voltage changing on the cell surface. Sure, that's all quoted by definition. Okay, it's have a survey is everything else. And so, most serious phone interceptors, every dopamine receptor. If as you go through the thousands of receptors like, you know, 800 receptors that are G protein, coupled receptors.
17:34
They're actually the most common protein in your body. You have about 800 of them. So all joking receptors all but one service 200 receptor, RG protein, couples receptors. They have all these different subclasses. The end of itself is a ton of calculation chemical calculator. Exactly. And so it is like a chemical computer.
17:54
Yeah, versus the micro magnetic energy. Yeah, so think about this right is all the chemicals are doing both at the same time, not all of them are now. You know, a lot of them aren't doing electrical things directly. Some of them are changing the way that receptors. Well, we're saying as an applicant, as a whole, they would be affecting me, the, the inner traffic brain.
18:13
Yeah. Yes. And the interesting part is that if I could capture a perfect snapshot of your brain over 30 seconds of every neuron, every astrocyte firing I would learn a lot about you and I could see that you're having these changes occur in your brain and sure, but that exactly probably never happened twice.
18:38
Exactly. So how do you model someone having more or less testosterone or being on LSD? Or not, just never happy in your neural network, if you only capture the iron or show big parts, how do you predict how use frame will change? Well I mean, okay, so I mean you know I think okay so like I guess in terms of you know, look at this energy diffusion right?
19:11
You're basically enough to tell me more so they blast a radio signal at the watering and and specific frequency and it causes the because the water molecules to release a to release energy which is as a specific frequency of a camera waiting on the other side. So the mat, so the magnet for big giant magnet where it does is, that's, that's, it's getting your molecules aligned, and then they hit it with a radio frequency and when the magnet stops and then the might be that long.
19:54
But anyway, so so you got to just grab it in pink correctly, but what is the? So the magnetic the magnet gets your, your waves aligned and so they blast them pretty sure the last of the radio signal and but they have to stop them out, of course they last with the radio signal which and then the result is, you're admit like lambda waves or something.
20:14
From all the particles that all the water particles of our line. So the water now has to travel. It can't travel. It's once it's released by the magnet, it has to travel along the axonal fibers. You know? I mean it can't, it can't travel freely like it would if it was just the emotion, right?
20:32
And so because it's admitting that specific frequency while it's traveling on a specific line and your caching it from specific angle. You're like you're the camera that does to your next capture and account is doing a why capture and account is doing a z capture at least three and then you can do tensor calculus on and figure out the position and direction of those water molecules to become your tensors or resolution of data, you get from them.
21:04
So with these, the standard MRI our DJI image, I believe is lot of size. You can think of a lot more, so it's really not that detailed. But here is this, it is basically the really helpful. Yes, so the really colorful light brains cans. I'm just gonna just oh, it's MRI base.
21:36
I see, I didn't I didn't follow that is using the MRI. Yes. Okay, as it's just like a two. So this is how you this is, how you kind of, keep track of the tracks. Yeah, right, right. Yeah. There's plenty. I've seen a lot of these. So, my sister's new to if you did like 3,000.
21:53
So you see the only three photos and just getting the basic geometry. I think if you did 3,000 photos, sort of like using like a light field type of camera, you know, like the new electro rig where they, they have, like, 91 cameras, all bringing the same direction if you did that kind of UTI.
22:10
And then so you're kind of like trying to figure out the light field of gray knowledge where those not only like where the watermark is are and which direction they're traveling. But also you know you're figure out the direction of the of the frequencies that are traveling towards the camera, you know, that's in this life more than.
22:33
So you could create like hologram that has potentially a higher resolution. If you're using the bottom or images and you can have these a technology light video camera. She was like photogrammetry on anything so if you so that's not that's the proposal for a new kind of DTI. DTI is that limited to let people confuse it.
22:54
I mean, comment below and actually but they're just diffusion concept is MRI. But but I mean what I mean is that overly really is, it's cancer calculus, it's tracked and you could apply that concept to other types of sensors, whether they're inside with their their private insights. So people put sensors inside, you know, like these like these doctors and you could if you have you know, at least three of them and you could you could calculate.
23:25
I mean you could calculate the the oh whatever you could calculate, you can do some something like tensor confidence on it, you know, just got the map all the ions within a specific field that you decide to focus on with your sensors, which you could also do something like this with EEG or energy.
23:48
Just do this with sensors that are just sort of pointed at your, at your time. Is from the notes, just point them straight up the native account. Yeah or you know shoot the sensor happening. Now, as far as you can get it without, you know, breaking something.
