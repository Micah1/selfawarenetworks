David Eagleman Incognito & Apple & Police. Orchestrato

So it's um, 335 am and I just finished a massive, mushroom psychedelic experience.

06:04:12

Some incredible images on night.

06:04:22

Lot about it was this was really a great night to like organize, all my thinking to mass extent, that's what I love. I really love it when can really like

06:04:48

Organize on my thinking. So yeah, when I was on the previously, I did the other half, I said, okay I'm gonna be on the roof and they don't move. All the funny places. I've done five, I've done five times. And while walking through San Francisco,

06:05:21

Bringing to a movie theater. Going down to the pier sleeping, the same.

06:05:38

Done it on the in the in the bed fast for me psychedelic experiences in the water.

06:05:50

And it. Wow. And what surprised me was that I did a summer call and I had like I could just at one point, I've never done a server song.

06:06:14

And was very important them on their head.

06:06:23

And for in the head stand here, my head with prison, the rate by shoulders in my head and I'm pushing my self forward. And then I also am rolling. And then my my feet at the wall and my glad I didn't break anything. I'm glad that I didn't hurt myself why I didn't punch or kick a hole in the wall.

06:07:01

The spontaneous, it was crazy. I've never ever been somersault. That was the balls is that there's like the bossiest thing. I'm I don't I mean, I That I haven't seen on a fucking room and in the in the Bay Resorts and then examined walking down the street,

06:07:39

Only share, but the craziest thing that made me so happy because the thing is, when I am home and I'm home and I'm safe is made and I don't have to be anywhere and no one needs to talk to me. That is the best time the person In the middle of the night.

06:08:08

When nobody cares. That's the best part. And then you can think about.

06:08:24

And instead of one of the first things I noticed, when I, when I, when I took it was that, um, that I was sure I was able to see amazing graphics and images. I wasn't control that I was the author who was the driver, the arms sort of like I always like Mickey Mouse and Fantasia I was the orchestrator, I was direct a director, right?

06:09:03

I honestly, director of the orchestra sense that that's, that's my, let's go of of the cell to be the orchestrator of the and orchestrate, the, the regularity of certain things or to orchestrate, the oscillatory,

06:09:42

Frequencies. I think that that we want to argue that what's going on with your what I want to argue is what's going on with you are thoughts in terms of what you do.

06:10:10

In your own minds.

06:10:25

That's, that's, that's sacred sacred sort of sacred space, right?

06:10:39

But,

06:10:50

I'm going to say that.

06:11:08

Your own mind is a sacred state in my mind. That's how am I my person each human being your individual right. Is having a mistake your own mind to be able to to let your mind and pulls. So, you can discover,

06:11:33

Until you can become self-aware because you have the freedom in space to, to do that, we have to say. So you can't have any like nothing, nothing scanning. It's just scanning. You're over here. Going to buy something. You can't do that but then there's a question. Okay? All right, so in terms of the there's another topic and topic is how can incorporations protect

06:12:24

There's a different question. You see what? You're, you know, you should kind of like the ability to To grow and awareness and a consciousness. And to be have a free mind to to think about everything, but the

06:13:09

It's kind of like we need to give other people the same. Here's what I'm saying.

06:13:28

You can the

06:13:35

The issue that we have to, we got to fix this because

06:13:53

There are, there needs to be a convergence of the the medical system with the justice system. And I think that's an argument that I have to make it's going back to incognito. That's how the book has to end. I think I'll go back to David England and incognito.
