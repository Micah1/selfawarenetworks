(optogenetics, synap, LTP, LTD)
RNA malfunctions would lead to malformed synapses during LTP based protein synthesis
throughout our lives we are constantly writing over ontop of our old memories

because our long term memories are represented by the active synapses, and form when a new bouton is either added or taken away, while short term memories are expressed by 
buzaki's idea about the brain re-arranging the genetically learned alphabet to make words. because the shape of the synapses (and their properties like how many boutons they start with) are folded proteins that are folded from rna, so if human memory is our synapses, editing the synapses will change long term memory and effect the patterns of short term memory

I would be interested to understand how the history of past memories might continue to exist over time, but perhaps memory formation is like winding a clock that cycles in one direction forever,  in that the complexity of the bouton formation might allow it to contain enough data to last a lifetime without erasing past memories, but I suspect that the brain can only retain traces of long term memories, like the new synaptic arrangement retaining a ghost of some past synaptic dendritic configuration, simply because only some minor changes needed to be made to create a new pattern, the density of patterns stored in synaptic configurations is potentially massive. It would help to understand a bit more about how it actually works from real studies on organoids. You would likely use optogenetics to study LTD and LTP processes at the synapses in much greater detail.
