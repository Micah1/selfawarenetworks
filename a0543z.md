Note created May 8, 2017, it looks like a pitch for my the Neural Lace Podcast that you can find on http://vrma.io

UPDATE: Why Neural Lace is relevant to the Network Society Project

Neural Lace as a technology, and as a direction of research is about where the simultaneous exponential growth of technologies is headed and it will have a massive social impact. My podcast is not only about these technologies but it is about democratizing them. This podcast is a vision of the unstoppable change of technology so that individuals, enterprises, and society at large can deal with what is coming.

Neural lace will mean new things for justice when for example law enforcement can request that a judge grant a warrant to search the a suspects mind to find out whether or not a crime was committed, and to locate additional evidence of that crime.

Neural Lace will allow individuals to upload, download, and simultaneously experience the experiences that humans are having.

Neural Lace and the related technologies leading to neural lace will allow the tools that we use, like computers, phones, ar and vr headsets to predict what we want to create, or access, or achieve faster and better than ever before. This category of tech will make our user interfaces more intuitive, more intelligent, and more useful.

Neural Lace and related tech will make our world a more collaborative place, and a happier place, because it will enable the collection and transfer of useful actionable information at an even faster rate.

Neural Lace is not only about the networks of the mind, but it is fundamentally also about the networks of society.

Have you ever wondered how Neural lace might work? I have some amazing guests talking about it on my podcast, give it a listen if you have time today.
In the 4th episode of the Neural Lace Podcast, I talk to Andre Watson, the CEO of Ligandal, a genetic nano-medicine company developing personalized gene therapies. goo.gl/cgCNwX Watson and I take a deeper dive into the synapse physiology and molecular biological basis of consciousness.
How much do we really need to understand and observe to effectively create neural lace? Andre presents his argument for the biological basis of consciousness.
