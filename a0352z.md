I am the founder of Neo Mind Cycle, 

brain optimization with an audio & visual system, 

sensors on a clients head to measure brainwaves, which then go into a computer to be converted into beats that are then converted into light and sound piped into an onscreen visual as well as see through light goggles and headphones. 

electrodes on a person's head, measure their brainwaves with EEG, convert that data into specific frequencies that stimulate brainwaves from gamma, to beta, to smr, to alpha, to theta, and delta, with both light and sound, and this stimulation is driven by the brainwaves. 

Neo Mind Cycle uses a brain plasticity protocol that is 1. engaging, highly interesting, because your feeling and seeing your own brainwave patterns in this deeply stimulating audio visual experience. 2. because it stimulates the whole mind in an engaging way it results in new brain maps, or regions of the mind that might have been separate now begin to talk to one another, neurons that fire together wire together, and this means the expansion of awareness generally, but also amazingly resourceful great ideas, feeling good because of stimulated brain chemistry, more success, happiness, confidence, it helps people who have ptsd, adhd, addiction, autism, and much more.
