I aim to build sentient robots 

It is possible to safely deploy sentient machines into the real world. That is part of what my book is intended to address.

The key thing is that what I am proposing that we can shape the neurology of the robots that we deploy, 

We already have the evolutionary approach for developing robots, that is like the Isaac Hyperspace program by Nvidia. The idea is you train a lot of different variations of the robot, and that one that succeeds replaces all the rest, and then you make copies of the one that succeeds and run them in competition with each other to see which one helps generate the best results.

Beyond human level neural networks means that the structural complexity of the neurons at the top increases relative to the neurons at the bottom. From blood

In hindsight much that has been written about the Amygdala as the fear center of the brain is just ridiculous. I will have to say more after a certain book gets published.
