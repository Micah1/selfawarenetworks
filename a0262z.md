(synap, oscillat, dendrite)
Thought experiment: What if you saw your brain as like something with a lot of holes NOT like swiss cheese, and also not exactly like a lot of bulbs like christmas lights that rewire themselves to form representations of incoming sensory patterns almost like the game of life.

Like the game of life or a slimemold, what is the most efficient path? and the result is a learned sequence in short term memory so there is a predictable path for signals to follow representing a learned sequence.
Perhaps this learned pattern is converted then into a soliton wave pattern from neurotransmitters moving through exit terminals i to calcium gates across synapses

The wave pattern is a deviation from the tonic beat pattern of a group of neurons oscillating, and the entire group notices because its a novel event outside their tonic expectations, so the pattern that they are oscillating changes, but then the pattern representing phasic/hi freq/ low amp pattern. A new synaptic pathway is formed that represents the new learned pattern, these are new connections between dendrites and the synapses of other cells, interneuron gates and synapses for micro vesicle sacks and neurotransmitters to fly through

A Pre-requisite
Neurons predict when they are going to fire, but they also predict when they are not, and what time.
