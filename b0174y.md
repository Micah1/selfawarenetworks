Brain Isomorphism Localization

Okay. So imagine we have a self-contained module. It's like a chapter, right? But we call it a module because what is it's like it's gonna start out with a narrative. Like it was a balmy and stormy night or it was cold at night. And there's, we're waiting sitting at the tables for people to arrive and and she presented her open EIT.

00:28

And there we go. Into like the sort of like you know what makes it so amazing. How it could be so revolutionary, it could change the world and and this is the profound meaning of it. And and I mean, while I'm staring across over a Morgan thinking about and trying to understand what he saying about why and we're trying to reconcile what he's saying about about easy.

01:13

Localization, and how we can,

01:21

Use EIT to solve this goal problem which is the score and tissue the tissue of the underneath. The skull between the brain is distorts the reception of the electromagnetic magnetic wave, but with EIT you could get clear a clearer, you get a perfected EEG signal and therefore, run more advanced calculations on perfected EG signal and I was trying to understand why he didn't why he didn't want.

01:57

He was opposed to my proposal that we we try using easy source localization combined with, you know, correlating regional patterns of brain activity with objects in the real world, which is my proposed from their earliest podcast and he kept insisting that that there's too many things that could represent that brain activity, and, which is outlined in brain and rhythms of the brain sockets work.

02:28

So I'm left with the situation where I have to where I can you know put basically explain Busaki's argument and that's the reason. But but then I have to point to well this this paper because paper came way later, so is it possible? You know that the you're basically say there's no point in plotting out.

02:50

He was saying, basically no point in plotting out the three three dimensional location of of the source localization because all that data is contained in the and the frequency data, right? He just doesn't believe this any point in fighting it out.

03:12

So that was my major. I was my major point, my major argument of contention with Morgan and also I argued that the brain was a fractal functional was was the functional.

03:32

Was a fact of a functional was a fact. It was.

03:52

With the brain had.

03:58

Fractals multi-level, fractal. Functional isomorphism, meaning that the functions and different scales with the brain were functionally isomorphic and recursive. Fractal pattern is it's it's a, it's a, it's only a fact or and in terms of having a functionalized, a functional a fractal, functional isomorphism, a fractal, functionalizing, Marshall, fractal functionalism,

04:52

So it's frankly transfunctional, the functional the functional isomorphic character.

05:05

There's a functional isomorphism.

05:13

That's also a fractal. It's fractal. Functional, isomorphic and multi-scales of the brain, but them, the macro. And as a in the micro each one of them is tractor. Functional. More effective. Functional. By some morphism, I said the right word so I promotions iPhone and

05:47

Yeah.
