simulation > (metaverse)
30 years from now

merging

self aware sentient phenonm conscious robots

will do all the work possible on earth

accelerating the development of medicine and technology

solve intelligence solve everything demis habis

we will all be rich

but interesting our reality/simulation will merge and blend with the metaverse, so that we see the metaverse in our real world 

That's right. A entire group of worlds like Altspace or Neos VR represent less than a single galaxies worth of content, we are not approaching the scale of the metaverse yet.

We can fit the entire existing metaverse-internet spatially inside No Man's Sky many times over, 

So if we gave every learned sentence its own number, every known combination of sentences could be written out.

We could procedurally shuffle words & sentences until the right combination shuffled out, or until a good combination randomly formulated that we could appreciate in terms of our sensory matrix being able to sum up all the values into a gradient positive or negative energy.

It's like if a sentence is worth it has a lot of electrical cohesion value with prior sentences that have been learned in the brains matrix.
