(field, oscillat) orch-or

I was trying to come up with several additional arguments for why pan-psychism is wrong, and why Orch-Or is unlikely, and that's when I came up with some novel ideas about gravity. spacetime, atoms, particles, and also new novel ideas about the human brain. However I will only dedicate a few pages to these ideas because what is a discussion of the neurophysics of consciousness like without a little speculation about the nature of the cosmos am I right? lol

Today I was crafting new arguments for why pan-psychism is wrong & why Orch OR is unlikely when I came up with novel new ideas about how particles create gravity, and how atoms create space. What is a discussion of neurophysics without speculating on the nature of the cosmos?

Some or all of ideas in this book might not be correct. I will need to consult with other researchers in various fields before improving these ideas for a 2nd edition. However many of these ideas will be novel to the average reader, some people may have heard similar ideas before, but I think at the very least these ideas make for a good story and that is why they were included. I hope you leave this book with some new ideas of your own about the human mind, specially about neural functions that lead to human consciousness, new artificial intelligence ideas, new brain computer interfaces, new ideas about quantum physics, gravity, what life is (a new definition), what a bit of information is to your conscious brain, how the self emerges from the brains networking functions and so on. While the idea that one person could have so many new ideas on so many diverse topics might seem unlikely its just that there are common physical mechanisms connecting all these different things, and really at the core of it its one new idea that has led to all the others.

An idea that begs a question. The idea that we are all oscillators in a phase space that is defined by oscillators. What do oscillators do in a phase space? The answers may or may not help provide some partial but incomplete answers as to why space & time is the way it is, and how the human brains mechanics lead to each persons individual experience of consciousness.

The answer to that question crosses many disciplines, and in a sense it pulls together Ila Prigogine, Einstein, Buszaki and others into a conversation that travels from astrophysics, to neurophysics, to brain computer interfaces, virtual reality, and deep learning. Also this book comes with new ideas about how human decision making works from neurophysics to the human experience of consciousness and self-awareness.
