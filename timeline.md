# Comprehensive All-Inclusive Timeline

Below is a single, unified timeline in chronological order covering major public milestones, earliest known references to your ideas, and relevant activity across GitHub, YouTube, Medium, SVGN.io, and X/Twitter, under the names **Micah Blumberg**, **micahsun**, **worksalt**, **Death Star Robot**, **Self Aware Networks**, **micah1**, **micah8**, **n5ro**, and **v5ma**.

---

## 2011 (Private Notes, Not Publicly Released)
- **Context**: Earliest drafting of concepts for “Self Aware Networks” and “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation” are made in private notebooks.  
- These notes remain private until later published publicly in 2022.

---

## 2017 (Older YouTube Videos Referenced)
- **Pinned Article on SVGN.io** (Date unknown, references older videos):  
  - A pinned article on [SVGN.io](https://www.svgn.io/) contains links to older YouTube videos allegedly recorded around 2017 (and possibly earlier). These focus on AR/VR and early thoughts on neural networks but **do not** explicitly mention “Self Aware Networks” or “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation” by name.

---

## 2017–2018 (Medium AR/VR Content)
- **Assorted Medium Articles** (Dates vary, 2017–2018):  
  - Early writings on AR/VR technology under “micahsun” or “worksalt” appear on Medium, focusing on VR journalism and interviews.  
  - These do *not* mention “Self Aware Networks” or “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”

---

## May 15, 2022 (Medium Bio Article)
- **Medium Bio**:  
  - Published on [Medium](https://medium.com/silicon-valley-globalnews/longer-auto-bio-for-micah-blumberg-3b510d26b803).  
  - Provides background on neuroscience and programming but **does not** specifically mention “Self Aware Networks” or “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”

---

## June 17, 2022 (First Public Mention of Key Ideas)
- **GitHub Repository: `selfawarenetworks`**  
  - Under the username [v5ma (Micah Blumberg)](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks).  
  - The repository is made public on **June 17, 2022**, explicitly referencing “Self Aware Networks” and “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”  
  - README and change logs note that the ideas date back to 2011 privately, but **this is the earliest public release**.  
  - Includes draft chapters, disclaimers, and raw notes on neurophysics, artificial neurology, neuron models, and time-dilation theories.

---

## 2023 (SVGN.io / Substack Articles)
- **SVGN.io Launch & Articles**:  
  - A series of articles and updates posted to [SVGN.io](https://www.svgn.io/) (which also maps to Substack) begin in 2023.  
  - Some articles mention or expand on “Self Aware Networks,” “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation,” and upcoming AR/VR integrations with the Self Aware Networks Institute.

- **Pinned Article with Older Videos**:
  - As noted above, the pinned piece on SVGN.io provides links to older, previously uploaded YouTube videos, but the earliest direct mention of your *key theories* remains the 2022 GitHub release.

---

## October 23, 2023 (YouTube Video)
- **YouTube Upload**:  
  - Titled *“Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind, by Micah Blumberg aka Death Star Robot”*.  
  - Posted on **October 23, 2023**, further discussing “Self Aware Networks” publicly.  
  - The video references your ongoing book notes and ideas from GitHub.

---

## January 4, 2024 (Earliest X/Twitter Mentions)
- **First Tweet (X Post) about “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation”**:  
  - Under the handle [@worksalt](https://x.com/worksalt), a post on **January 4, 2024**, compares Stephen Wolfram’s approaches to your “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation” theory.  
  - Subsequent X threads throughout **2024** expand on your theories, referencing your GitHub notes, SVGN.io articles, and new ARXIV preprints.

---

### 2024–2025 (Ongoing Activity)
- Additional posts on YouTube, X/Twitter, and SVGN.io continue throughout **2024** and **2025**, covering incremental updates, AR/VR demonstrations, and further discussions about uniting relativity and quantum mechanics via “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”  

---

## Notes and Disclaimers
1. **Multiple GitHub Usernames**  
   - You have operated under `micah1`, `micah8`, `n5ro`, `v5ma`, etc., but the first *public* repository explicitly referencing your theories is [v5ma/selfawarenetworks](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks) (June 17, 2022).  
2. **Older Private Materials**  
   - Although private notes date back to 2011, no public evidence emerges until the 2022 GitHub creation date.  
3. **SVGN.io Pinned Article**  
   - References older YouTube videos from ~2017 or earlier, but they do *not* mention “Self Aware Networks” or “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation” specifically by name.  
4. **Earliest Verified Key Mentions**  
   - GitHub on June 17, 2022: “Self Aware Networks” + “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”  
   - YouTube on October 23, 2023: “Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind” video.  
   - X/Twitter on January 4, 2024: Extended mentions of “Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.”
