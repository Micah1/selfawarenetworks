(synap) Serotonin on memory:
If Serotonin stabilizes memory, and my hypothesis is that synapses are the storage place of both short & long term memories then what is the interaction of Serotonin on synapses, what I imagine is that the flood of additional Serotonin molecules is exciting neurons, causing them to fire more often, resulting in an accelerated pace of pattern learning, from the increased rate of signal propagation. In a similar way fast brainwave entrainment also ought to excite the brain and increase pattern development in the brain, meaning more thought developments per time interval. In short I think it is not about memory-stabilization so much as memory-process acceleration.
