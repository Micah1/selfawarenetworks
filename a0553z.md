(LTP, synap, neuron)

"B: I think that’s one of the most haunting implications of neuropsychology: Our personal tastes, memories and feelings are constantly being formed and reformed by interactions between neural pathways - and it’s those pathways, rather than the memories themselves, that are etched in the physical structure of our brains. So memories and feelings aren’t “stored,” like bits of computer memory - they’re acted out anew each time certain neural communication paths interact with certain others. "

Micah: Micah: I think some memories are stored in long term memory in bits on the outside of hexagonal tube like proteins inside the synapse that help regulate the cells, and are activated when the neuron fires. The shorter term conscious stuff on the other hand is much more flexible, so that brain can dynamically change it's internal structure to optimally process whatever seems to be most important in your sensory experience. The greater the important the more of the brain's internal symphony seems to be dedicated it. It may seem fleeting and chaotic because the connections and the wave patterns are ever changing every time you use them. However the movements of a persons body while biking can also seem very chaotic, and yet they are very coordinated. Humans are highly coordinated in their movements and in their brains, and what looks like chaos in the brain isn't as chaotic as it seems if you slow it down to 1/1000th of a second. Each neuron, like a musician in a symphony, is able to play off it's nearby fellow musician, so the coordination of the whole is something accomplished by each cell individually, reacting to the other cells in it's group of connections. It's true that cells that represent one part of your character sometimes inhibit the desires represented by another part of your character represented by other cells, but this is a matter of learning to coordinate one's self, it's analogous to the dancer who has two left feet in the beginning, stepping on his partner, to who he becomes with many years of practice improving his coordination in the way he wants to improve.


Ben Thomas ‎Micah, I've seen that article before, and I do think you make a valid point that there's a distinction to be made between short-term and long-term storage methods. Long-term memories do seem to be stored more stably than short-term ones are - and the formation of amygdala-influenced "fear memory" seems to form new neural pathways almost instantaneously.

Ben: However, I'm still waiting to see biological confirmation of a particular molecular-scale mechanism for long-term memory storage. Craddock's model does appear to make sense - but as far as I know, engrams of any kind are still theoretical, in part because memories themselves are multimodal phenomena. When a team of researchers are able to reconstruct an entire memory (whatever that means) from patterns in microtubules extracted from an actual brain, then I'll be convinced.

Ben: Still, I think you and I may actually be talking around a similar point: it's not any specific set of molecules or cells that contain a component of one's character, but rather the interactions and influences among those cells. Stored information only acquires meaning within an interpretive framework - and in the case of the brain, that framework is provided by coordinated patterns of communication at various scales within a structural or functional network.

Ben: In short, it isn't the cells that represent your character - it's the way they communicate with one another.

Micah: I agree with what your saying Ben! Well said. While I read that I was thinking about the nineties, a time when as a teenager I broke open an old computer hard drive, to look at the components, to try to understand how it worked, or the hours spent looking at the flashing reflections of old cd-roms that were hanging from a ceiling, trying to picture how micro indentations could represent a song, picture, or even a short film. For every experience that we have, bunches of cells fire together, and if they all have their own memory chips guiding the shape of the reflections that are reproduced by other cells, then the microtubule data for that bunch becomes like the seed of a tree. The tree is that whole memory now converted from data into live memory, going from a representation in a small bunch, to a large simulation involving lots of the brain's short term memory. That tree is a hundred million or so cells re-representing the data stored in microtubules of the bunches of cells that fired in the seed, active only as long as it needs to be, before the bulk of cells are representing large versions of data that is imprinted in very simple compressed forms inside other cells. So I've compared the relationship between the seed and the tree, with ltp and short term memory, as well as with stored digital data, and what's live on your computer monitor. The seed, long term memory, digital data, in the expanded form becomes, the tree, the conscious experience, or the media your viewing. I know I've over explained this, but it's so interesting to think about. Now lets tear it apart! What's wrong with it!
