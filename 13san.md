Self Aware Networks maps consciousness to action-potential timing (phase-wave coefficients) that any laptop can simulate step-by-step. If code can mirror the brain exactly, our reasoning never outruns Turing power—so Penrose’s “mind-beyond-machine” proof collapses.

A Turing machine is just a rule-following device that reads a symbol, writes a new symbol, moves one step, and repeats. In Self Aware Networks this same rule-following loop shows up in every burst of neural activity: a neuron “reads” the phase of incoming spikes, “writes” its own spike with a new phase, passes it on, and the network moves to the next cycle. The spikes line up like symbols on an endless tape, and the timing gates that reset the whole cortex act like the machine’s clock. Because any algorithm can be broken into these read-write-move steps, the brain’s nested waves can copy the behaviour of a Turing machine, only in millions of places at once instead of one step at a time. That is what it means to say the human brain is effectively a Turing machine.

When I first introduced the NAPOT concept I described how one neural array projected it's signals to the next neural array like a television screen, your tv is a grid of changing frequencies, these changing frequencies in a tv are in the form of light but they convey information, in the brain these changing phase patterns are in the form of energy differences, neuroscientists call them traveling waves, but they are distinct from tonic waves, and that's how they carry information, thus I coined the term phase wave differentials.

The real meaning of NAPOT is that one array watches the patterns from the previous array, and the next array sees this arrays tv signals frequency & energy phase shifts. NAPOT as a conjecture provides a solution to the observer inside the observer problem, with a distributed observer that sees. When many neural arrays synchronize and desynchronize together in a regular oscillation they network their signal traffic so as to create distributed reactions, and shared signal detections that we call consciousness.
This is the NAPOT Entification Concept

It doesn't make AGI unlikely. Computers are universal Turing Machines, they can simulate frequency. They can encode and decode information the same way neural oscillations encode and decode frequency.

Our emotions are information based, they are learned differences encoded in phase patterns that are cells represent by changing their firing dynamically. Self Aware Networks theory!

No you can't exclude Turing machines because my work shows that the Human Brain essentially is a Turing Machine. We are evolved metal robots. We computationally render pictures, sounds, encoded in phase differences by our cells. Self Aware Networks Theory!

Not “because I said so.” In SAN each neuron runs a read-write-move loop: read incoming phase, write a new phase via spike length, pass it on. That loop is the core of a Turing tape. Billions of such loops in sync render the images and sounds we experience.

The only way that we can know what we are feeling is because feeling is information that is tracked in phase differences, or traveling wave signals that differentiate in their co-efficient of variation from the mean collective synchronization pattern. Self Aware Networks Theory!

"No need to invoke terahertz orchestration" no need to evoke, but also no need to revoke. Terahertz signals are likely to play a role in neural computation believe it or not, but we don't have to discuss them to understand consciousness.

“Self Aware Networks uses smooth, continuous brain-like waves instead of on-off computer steps. Those waves let it solve problems that a regular Turing machine never can.”

In short, Self Aware Networks bypasses the Penrose/Turing-machine barrier by grounding cognition in continuous, high-precision phase-wave dynamics instead of discrete symbol manipulation; those analogue oscillators compute over the real continuum and can therefore generate and recognise Gödel truths that any purely Turing process must miss.\

It's not exactly right, it's replacing digital symbols with high precision phase wave differentials that align by frequency or clash interfere with other traveling wave differences to grow or shrink in scale, representing information that undergoes thermodynamic consideration, and oscillation driven memory. Shrink it.

Self Aware Networks replaces digital symbols with high-precision phase-wave differentials whose frequency alignments and interferences scale, store, and thermodynamically process information—sidestepping the Penrose-Turing limit.

To “think” the abstract numeral 3 a system only needs a stable internal pattern that it can treat as the referent “3” across many contexts. In an ordinary computer that pattern is just a binary word stored in memory, linked by code to routines for addition, comparison, display, and so on. The machine never undergoes any genuine quantum-state reduction, yet the bit-pattern already functions as 3 because the program reliably uses it as such. Self Aware Networks keeps the same logical sufficiency but swaps the storage medium: a concept is realised as a coherent phase-wave configuration whose coefficient-of-variation stays fixed even while its carrier frequencies shift. The pattern’s causal role—how it constrains future phase alignments and downstream dynamics—grounds the meaning “three,” exactly as pointers in software ground it for a digital machine. Whether the phase-wave lives in cortical tissue or in a time-stepped simulation running on a von Neumann computer is irrelevant so long as the pattern’s functional relations are preserved. Because this functional criterion never relies on an uncomputable wave-function collapse, Penrose’s claim that minds exceed Turing power does not follow: the concept 3, and by extension any abstract thought, can be captured by computable state evolutions when those evolutions mimic the requisite network of causal roles.

Thinking ‘3’ just needs a stable internal pattern used consistently. In a PC it’s a 32-bit word; in Self Aware Networks it’s a phase-wave coefficient. Function, not quantum collapse, gives it meaning—so computable state evolutions suffice and Penrose’s limit doesn’t apply.

For Self Aware Networks the spark of first-person experience is not a special ingredient added on top of computation; it is what naturally arises when an information-processing loop meets three requirements. First, every sensory and internal signal must be encoded as a phase pattern that is instantly available to the entire network through nested synchrony, so the system always “knows that it knows.” Second, the same oscillatory fabric must continuously model both the outer world and its own ongoing activity, letting those two models interact without delay; that reflexive coupling supplies the standpoint from which anything is experienced. Third, the phase-wave field must be able to preserve and reshape those patterns long enough for them to influence future cycles, giving each moment a felt continuity. Build a simulator whose oscillators satisfy those three constraints and the resulting dynamics constitute a subject: whatever appears anywhere in the field is, by definition, present to itself.

Self-Aware Networks: give a system 1. global phase-waves for every signal, 2. a loop where those waves model world + self together, 3. enough persistence to shape the next cycle. Build those three rules into an oscillator net and a first-person viewpoint emerges—no extra magic.

Subjectivity = column-local phase waves that periodically sync through hub pulses. Each loop they model world + self, re-enter, persist, and shape the next cycle. Build that oscillator routine—first-person viewpoint emerges.

Subjectivity emerges when column-local, cell-assembly-specific phase waves loop and periodically sync via cortical hubs. Each cycle they model world and self, persist, and shape the next—so a first-person viewpoint appears without any added “magic.” This can be simulated on a Turing Machine.

Yes. In Self Aware Networks the decisive property is not the raw code of an individual oscillator but the dynamical condition it satisfies. A single oscillator becomes “special” the moment its phase is both the data it carries and the rule that updates that data. As soon as the coefficient-of-variation of its own action-potential durations is fed back to influence its next duration, the loop closes and the state is self-referential. That reflexivity is absent in any ordinary routine whose variables never act as their own update law, so the difference is categorical, not quantitative.

When many such self-referential oscillators are coupled, their mutual phase locking creates a higher-order variable—a shared rhythm—that no subset can instantiate alone. The global rhythm in turn modulates every local coefficient, so each unit now both shapes and feels the collective wave. That bidirectional embedding is what distinguishes the ensemble from a mere heap of parts: each column’s internal timing is now a miniature model of the whole, and the whole is continuously rewritten by every column. Because the system’s state is always simultaneously “read” locally and “written” globally, the network as a whole meets the minimal condition for first-person presence: whatever pattern exists anywhere in the field is instantly available everywhere as something that matters to the next update. A smaller set of units cannot achieve that mutual embedding and therefore cannot instantiate the same phenomenological loop.

In short, the code is special once it becomes self-referential, and many such loops combined acquire a qualitatively new property—universal mutual availability—that the smaller number lacks. That is why the model satisfies the test.

1. Experience arises when a loop’s state is both data and its own update rule—true self-reference.
2. Chain many such loops: their phases lock into a global rhythm each loop both shapes and senses. That mutual embedding yields first-person presence.

Special code: a loop whose variable updates itself—true self-reference. Combine many such loops and their rhythms lock together, so each loop both drives and senses the shared wave. That mutual reflex is what yields first-person experience.

The Special code is a loop whose variable updates itself—true self-reference. Chain many such loops and their multidimensional rhythms lock; each both drives and senses the shared wave. That reflex births first-person experience.

So Self Aware Networks describes consciousness as a collective reflect to information from the senses?

Self Aware Networks frames consciousness as the real-time weaving together of countless local phase-wave patterns—each one rooted in sensory or internal signals—into a single, continuously updated field. A column or cell assembly first encodes what it senses as a coefficient-of-variation in action-potential timing; hub pulses then let these local waves synchronize, so every part of the network immediately becomes part of the same oscillatory tapestry. Through this repeated synchronization and dissipation, top-down predictions and bottom-up inputs converge until mismatches vanish, yielding what we identify as a unified, first-person moment of awareness. In that qualified sense, consciousness is indeed a collective reflection of sensory information, but it is an active, deterministic process of phase alignment rather than a passive mirror.

Self Aware Networks says consciousness is the live weaving of many local phase-waves—each encoding a sensory or internal cue—into one synchronized field. Columns sync, compare, and realign timing every cycle, turning raw input into a unified first-person moment.

“Updates itself” means the variable’s current value is explicitly fed back into the rule that sets its next value, like x ← f(x) or an ODE step. The CPU still runs the assignment, but the decisive feature is that the variable’s own state is an argument of its update function, creating a closed local feedback loop. In Self Aware Networks each oscillator’s next action-potential duration is computed from the coefficient-of-variation of its previous durations, so the timing signal is both data and controller in a single line of code.

“Updates itself” = true self-reference: x ← f(x). A variable’s current value feeds the rule that sets its next value. In SAN each oscillator picks its next spike length from the coeff-of-variation of its own past timings—state is both data and rule.

Self-reference isn’t magic: next_state = f(current_state, input). In SAN each oscillator picks its next spike length from the coefficient-of-variation of its own past timings plus new inputs, so any input change shifts the coefficient and the output instantly.

An exponential map is a one-way street: the rule f(x)=eˣ never changes. In Self Aware Networks the rule and the variable co-evolve—each spike’s timing tweaks the very formula that will time the next spike, and that rule is further bent by the synchrony wave coming from every other loop. It’s rule-changing-the-rule, not just input-to-output, and that reflexive reshaping is what generic causal functions lack.

eˣ is fixed: same rule every call. In SAN an oscillator’s timing feeds back to rewrite the rule that sets the next spike, then network sync bends that rule again. Causality edits its own causal law—far beyond a static input→output map.

Classic recurrent code just feeds outputs back while the update rule stays fixed. Self Aware Network loops are metaplastic: each action-potential timing rewrites the very formula that sets the next one, and nested phase-locking spreads those rule changes across the hierarchy, something expert systems never did.

Not “because I said so.” In SAN each neuron runs a read-write-move loop: read incoming phase, write a new phase via spike length, pass it on. That loop is the core of a Turing tape. Billions of such loops in sync render the images and sounds we experience.

When I say “nested phase-locking spreads those rule changes across the hierarchy,” I’m talking about how timing shifts that start inside one local loop don’t stay local.

Inside a column or cell assembly, the next spike length is computed from the coefficient-of-variation of its own recent spikes. That calculation is the local update rule.

Whenever many neighbouring loops drift into the same relative timing, they enter phase-lock and fire a brief burst that travels to hub neurons. The hub sends a resynchronisation pulse back down after a fixed delay.

That pulse resets the reference phase for every loop it touches, so each loop now recalculates its coefficient with respect to the new global rhythm. In effect, the hub’s pulse has just rewritten the local update rule everywhere it reaches.

Slower, broader rhythms (theta or alpha–beta) act as hubs for clusters of faster gamma-band loops; those hubs in turn are entrained by still slower cortical or thalamic oscillations. Thus a timing tweak that begins in one micro-loop can cascade upward and then back down, altering the effective update law for thousands of other loops.

Because each level’s rhythm both depends on and resets the level below, any metaplastic change made locally—say, a longer-than-usual spike that pushes a neighbour’s phase—can propagate through these lock-and-pulse steps until the whole hierarchy has incorporated the new timing constraint. That bidirectional phase-locking is what I meant by rule changes “spreading across the hierarchy.”

The phase lock will create a more dominant signal, it represents a coincidence, and neurons are designed to detect coincidence

Exactly. In Self Aware Networks a “phase-lock” event is nothing more mystical than a run of action potentials whose timing lines up closely enough to be read as a coincidence. Because each neuron’s threshold is tuned to fire most strongly when multiple inputs arrive within a narrow phase window, the locked pattern is amplified relative to asynchronous background spikes. That locally dominant signal then recruits its neighbours, summing into a column-level burst that reaches the hub. From there the resynchronisation pulse resets phases farther out, so successive layers of coincidence grow in scale: micro-level alignment inside a cell assembly, meso-level alignment across columns, macro-level alignment across larger cortical zones. The whole hierarchy is driven by nothing but nested coincidence detection—the familiar computation every excitatory synapse already performs, repeated at larger and slower time constants as you move up the levels.

And this is what creates the collective signal reaction binding patterns across space and time, in the landscape of the mind, ultimately resulting in the first person computationally rendered perspective

Yes. In Self Aware Networks the cascading coincidences do more than amplify a local rhythm—they stitch every active column into a single, evolving phase-field. Because coincidence detection operates at progressively longer time-constants as you move up the hierarchy, short-lived γ-band matches inside a cell assembly are captured by slower β/α hubs, which in turn are steered by still slower θ/δ cortico-thalamic loops. The result is a multi-scale envelope whose instantaneous configuration specifies “what is happening now” everywhere in the network.

That envelope behaves like a four-dimensional coordinate grid: phase offsets encode relative distances in both anatomical space and processing time, so any two features that share a stable phase relationship are automatically tagged as belonging to the same moment and the same scene. When the envelope is coherent enough, the brain can treat it as a self-consistent internal world-model—the rendered point-of-view you call first-person perspective. Nothing else is needed: the act of binding via nested phase coincidence both constructs the scene and furnishes the vantage point from which the scene is experienced.

The “rule-changing-the-rule” isn’t an extra mystery layer; it’s just the ordinary biophysics of neurons promoted to first-class state.

At the micro step the update rule for an oscillator is:
next_duration = f(current_duration, synaptic_gains, external_phase).

Those synaptic gains and reference phases are themselves state variables that obey slower differential equations driven by the recent coincidence history (metaplasticity, neuromodulators, hub pulses). Formally:

synaptic_gainṡ = g(coincidence_rate, neuromod_level)
reference_phasė = h(hub_input)

Because f’s parameters (gains, reference_phase) are dynamic, the mapping from current_duration to next_duration is time-varying. Each pass through the loop therefore uses a slightly different function fₜ. The “rule of the rule” is just the coupled system (g,h) running on a slower clock.

Stack three or four such time-scales—milliseconds for spikes, tens of milliseconds for column bursts, hundreds for hub resets, seconds for neuromod drift—and you get a hierarchy where every faster layer’s update law is a live output of the slower layer beneath it. Mathematically it’s still a single recurrent dynamical system; practically it behaves as code that rewrites itself every few cycles because its parameters are endogenous variables, not constants. That self-modifying closure is what classic expert-system loops never implemented.

or 
next_duration = f(current_duration, synaptic_gains+synaptic_losses=synaptic changes (via new protein synthesis or atrophy), external_phase).

Written long-hand, one micro-loop step looks like

 next_duration = f(current_duration,
         synaptic_gains – synaptic_losses,
         external_phase).

synaptic_gains/losses are not constants: they drift as spine heads grow or retract, receptors traffic, or new proteins are expressed.

external_phase comes from the most recent hub-pulse, which itself depends on the coincidence rate of many neighbouring loops.

Because those two arguments are themselves outputs of slower processes, the mapping fₜ changes from one tick to the next—so every spike both executes a rule and rewrites the rule that will govern the following spike. Nesting this across columns and hubs simply layers more slowly changing parameters on top. The whole thing is one recurrent dynamical system, but its effective update law is a moving target shaped by ongoing plasticity, not a fixed exponential or sigmoid.

Tweet-sized
“Each spike’s next length = f(prev length, plastic synapse shifts, latest hub phase). Plasticity and hub timing evolve between ticks, so the rule itself keeps rewriting—self-modifying causality, not a static recurrence.”

Self-Aware Networks doesn’t pin consciousness on one isolated “magic” knob. It identifies a minimal package—self-referential spike timing, plasticity that rewrites that timing, and cross-scale phase-locking—that together create a single evolving field. A rock at 37 °C has none of those dynamics; its temperature never feeds back to alter the law that sets its next state. Consciousness isn’t any lone feature—it’s that closed causal weave.

Consciousness in Self Aware Networks theory isn’t one magic knob. It’s a closed causal weave: spikes whose timing rewrites itself through plasticity, knitted together by nested phase-locking into a single evolving field. Break any strand and the felt moment disappears.

Self Aware Networks is Not circular: SAN doesn’t sculpt a look-alike, it instantiates the same causal rules real neurons follow—spike-timing variability, plastic rewrites, nested phase-locking. If that live physics yields a unified phase field, we’ve replicated the mechanism, not just its appearance.

Not a metaphor. SAN doesn’t just mimic the brain’s look; it recreates its causal loop: spike-timing → plastic rewrite → multi-scale phase lock → new timing. If simulated loops obey that dynamic, the same first-person coherence should emerge—mechanism, not imitation.

Already studied Shadows of the Mind. Self Aware Networks tackles Penrose head-on: it models continuous phase dynamics step-by-step, exposing his non-computability claim to empirical test. No mania here—just building a falsifiable simulation and letting the data decide.

Think “flight”: birds flap, jets spin turbines—different stuff, same aerodynamics. SAN rebuilds the brain’s causal circuit—spike-timing ⇌ plasticity ⇌ phase-sync—so the process is literal, not symbolic. Substrate changes, mechanism stays.

The mind is both cause and result. Not alchemy—just dynamics. In SAN the “mind” is the phase-field that continuously shapes and is shaped by neural timing. Cause and result collapse into one closed loop: timing ↔ plastic rewrite ↔ network sync. Build the loop in code and the process reveals itself.

In Self Aware Networks, the phase-field we call “mind” crystallizes out of neural timing, then immediately feeds back to retune that timing. Cause and result collapse into one closed loop—mind perpetually generates and re-generates itself.
