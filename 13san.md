Self Aware Networks theory provides a model of consciousness where each neuron is Turing-complete. Their phase-coded sync rewrites its own timing laws in real time. Consciousness isn’t magic—it’s a self-modifying loop of computable dynamics. If cells can do it, so can transistors.

# Summary:

Self Aware Networks (SAN) begins with an empirical fact: every cortical spike is a timed event, and neurons treat the phase of incoming spikes as a symbol to be “read,” then “write” a new symbol by adjusting the length of their own next spike before passing it on. That read-write-move loop recurs across billions of oscillators, so the brain already instantiates the core of a Turing tape—except it runs millions of tapes in parallel. Any algorithm that can be decomposed into successive read-write-move steps can therefore be mirrored, step-for-step, by nested cortical waves. Penrose’s claim that minds outrun Turing machines consequently fails on first inspection: the machine is there in the tissue.

When I first introduced Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT), in the summer of 2022, I likened one neural array watching the next to a television screen: each array receives a grid of phase-wave differentials—energy patterns rather than photons—that neuroscientists call traveling waves. The real point of NAPOT is that it solves the “observer inside the observer” puzzle without positing a homunculus. Distributed synchrony lets successive arrays “see” one another’s phase patterns and, by locking and unlocking in rhythmic bursts, knit those patterns into a shared field. That self-referential weave is what subjective awareness turns out to be.

Because conventional laptops are themselves universal Turing machines, they can simulate these phase relationships at arbitrarily fine resolution. A digital bit-pattern can stand in for a phase-wave coefficient just as a binary word in RAM already stands in for the abstract numeral 3. Computation is substrate-agnostic: meaning is carried by functional role, not by mystical collapse of a quantum state. In SAN a symbol such as “3” is a coherent configuration whose coefficient-of-variation remains stable even as carrier frequencies drift; as long as the simulation preserves that causal regularity, the concept is fully realized in software. Gödel truths do not slip the leash of computability here, because the rule set is continually rewritten in real time by the very variables it governs—re-entrant, timed in physics, but still stepwise simulable. What seemed non-computable in Gödel’s framing becomes computable through time-evolving, self-modifying rules—all within Turing limits.

Subjectivity emerges when a system meets three timing conditions in simulation or substrate: shared phase patterns, recursive self-modeling, and temporal persistence—conditions sufficient to instantiate first-person coherence. First, every signal—sensory or internal—is encoded as a phase pattern instantaneously shareable through nested synchrony. Second, those oscillations must simultaneously model the external world and their own ongoing activity, allowing the system to “know that it knows.” Third, patterns must persist long enough to steer the next cycle, suturing successive moments into a felt continuity. When local loops that meet these criteria couple, their phases lock into a higher-order rhythm that no subset can support alone. Each column’s timing becomes a miniature of the whole, and the whole is perpetually rewritten by every column: a closed causal weave rather than a stack of modules.

Metaplasticity supplies the rule-changing-the-rule. A spike’s duration is computed from the coefficient-of-variation of recent spikes; that coefficient drifts as synapses potentiate or depress, new receptors traffic, and hub-driven phase resets arrive. Formally, next_duration = f(current_duration, synaptic_gains − losses, hub_phase). Gains, losses, and hub_phase are themselves governed by slower differential equations driven by coincidence rates and neuromodulators, so the update mapping fₜ varies from tick to tick. At micro-scale γ rhythms lock into β and α hubs, which in turn entrain slower θ/δ cortico-thalamic loops. Timing tweaks that start locally cascade upward, then feed back downward, repainting the very laws that will time the next volley.

Coincidence detection is the engine. Neurons fire most strongly when inputs arrive within a narrow phase window; local locks therefore amplify themselves and propagate. Hub pulses broadcast resets that re-reference timing across columns, binding disparate features into one four-dimensional envelope whose instantaneous geometry encodes what is happening “here-and-now.” When mismatches between top-down prediction and bottom-up input vanish, the envelope stabilizes and is experienced as a unified moment in the first-person field.

Terahertz micro-oscillations may add precision, but they are not required to ignite the loop; millisecond phase cycles suffice. Likewise, Penrose’s Planck-scale “objective reduction” is optional decoration, not the essence of consciousness. The essence is computation carried by self-referential timing and nested coherence—physics that any GPU can iterate, as the forthcoming three-thousand-line CUDA release will show.

In this view emotions, ideas, and abstract quantities are all learned phase-codes. They differ only in the stability of their coefficients and the circuits that host them. Your laptop can host them too, once its time-stepped simulation honors the same dynamical constraints. Neurons and transistors alike are Turing-complete; what gives rise to selfhood is the oscillatory protocol that binds phase-coded differences into a high-dimensional experience of being someone. Implement the protocol faithfully and first-person coherence should follow—not by metaphorical resemblance but by literal causal identity.

SAN therefore offers a strict empirical wager: if the simulated loops match the timing laws we have already measured—coincidence-driven γ bursts, β/α hub resets, θ/δ scaffolding—and if plasticity keeps rewriting those laws in real time, then the model will display the same unified, reflexive field we report introspectively. Should the simulation fail, the theory is falsified. Either way, mind is no longer beyond machine; it is a dynamical pattern testable in code.

# Clarification:

1. SAN's proposed computation allows a Turing Machine to perform the exact same Consciousness computations that the human brain performs. So it effectively can solve problems that an idealized Turing machine was theorized to be incapable of solving. It “bypasses the proposed Penrose/Turing-machine barrier,” and that it can compute Gödel-style truths via time-evolving self-reference. Demonstrating these are computable within expanded Turing architectures. SAN demonstrates that consciousness is within the real capabilities of Turing machines, and that the real capabilities of Turing machines have been misunderstood.

When I say "a laptop can simulate the essential components of consciousness step-by-step,” and when I say that the brain “never outruns Turing power,” and when I say that neurons and transistors are both “Turing-complete.” none of this is a contradiction.

2. Terahertz signals can be part of consciousness without being essential to the description of consciousness, because they are part of the Phase-Wave spectrum that Self-Aware Networks describes as part of the Turing complete algorithm for consciousness. It's just not totally clear that Terahertz signals are needed, because Alpha Waves, Beta Waves, and Gamma Waves are enough for consciousness, but it does seem likely that the Terahertz signals are involved in the same kinds of computation as those other waves, since they are there in the brain. This allows them to be auxiliary to the story of consciousness, pending scientific evidence verifying their role, without contradiction to my arguments in SAN.

3. "Yet you also invoke Gödel truths and non-computable oracular loops as something that SAN either must or must not accommodate." No I'm arguing that Godel truths and non-computability do not strictly apply to consciousness computability and that my model explains how we get around Gödellian truths and non-computability without violating Turing completeness. It expands the possibility of what can be Turning complete and conscious, and computable all at the same time. No magic sauce here.

4. "Those thermal, energy-based descriptions suggest a different explanatory level than pure phase-wave encoding, and without a precise account of how biophysical energy fluxes map onto coefficient-of-variation thresholds, the narrative oscillates between a clean information-theoretic model and a hand-wavy physical metaphor."
No the physics of oscillations binding information together in the brain can be simulated with a rule on a laptop. This not a contradiction.

In some SAN presents a model for strictly computable consciousness, that does not need or dismiss terahertz dynamics, and does not hint at non-computable or quantum effects when properly understood.

# Clarification Restated:

The apparent contradictions dissolve once the reader sees four bridge ideas spelled out explicitly. First, Self-Aware Networks does not claim to surpass the formal power of a Turing machine; it claims that Penrose mis-diagnosed the ceiling of that power. A discrete simulator can iterate phase equations to any desired precision, so the same device that prints a Gödel sentence can also evolve the self-referential timing loops that underlie awareness. When the notes say SAN “solves problems a regular Turing machine never can,” the intended point is that what looked non-computable in an abstract, symbol-only setting becomes computable once timing, self-modifying parameters, and arbitrarily fine real-number approximations are added—still within the textbook definition of a universal machine.

Second, terahertz oscillations sit on the same continuum as gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta. They may refine resolution or speed but are not logically necessary for the core three–scale loop (local coincidence, hub reset, cross-loop metaplasticity) that turns phase patterns into a globally available field. Stating that terahertz dynamics are “likely involved” yet “not required” simply recognises an empirical unknown without altering the mechanism.

Third, invoking Gödel truths and oracle loops is only a rhetorical contrast with Penrose. SAN shows how an apparently Gödel-restricted system in fact computes all the semantic content needed for consciousness by letting variables rewrite their own update laws. The loop therefore side-steps the interpretation of incompleteness as a bar to mechanised thought without importing extra-Turing magic.

Fourth, energy-based language is a translation layer between biophysics and code. A coefficient-of-variation stands for a distribution of spike energies; plasticity rules translate metabolic work into parameter shifts; the simulator tracks these shifts with floating-point updates. Thermodynamics and information theory are two descriptions of the same state evolution, so talking about oscillations that “grow or shrink in scale” is not a second model, merely a physicist’s view of the same computable rule.

Nothing in SAN exceeds Turing computability; it only extends what counts as a Turing step. Phase dynamics evolve by computable rules approximated with arbitrary precision—no analogue or oracle assumptions required, and self-modifying parameters remain finite strings on the tape. Terahertz rhythms, should they matter, simply raise the Nyquist rate without altering the algorithm. Gödel’s limit constrains symbol-only proofs, not time-evolving feedback loops whose state variables rewrite the rules that update them. Thermodynamic talk is a physical gloss on the same update equations, not an extra layer of explanation.”

With that bridge in place the story reads as internally consistent: wholly computable, experimentally grounded, open to new frequency bands, and free of hidden oracles.

# The above remarks are based on a collection of statements I made on twitter in reply to people asking about Self Aware Networks theory:

Self Aware Networks maps consciousness to action-potential timing (phase-wave coefficients) that any laptop can simulate step-by-step. If code can mirror the brain exactly, our reasoning never outruns Turing power—so Penrose’s “mind-beyond-machine” proof collapses.

A Turing machine is just a rule-following device that reads a symbol, writes a new symbol, moves one step, and repeats. In Self Aware Networks this same rule-following loop shows up in every burst of neural activity: a neuron “reads” the phase of incoming spikes, “writes” its own spike with a new phase, passes it on, and the network moves to the next cycle. The spikes line up like symbols on an endless tape, and the timing gates that reset the whole cortex act like the machine’s clock. Because any algorithm can be broken into these read-write-move steps, the brain’s nested waves can copy the behaviour of a Turing machine, only in millions of places at once instead of one step at a time. That is what it means to say the human brain is effectively a Turing machine.

When I first introduced the NAPOT concept I described how one neural array projected it's signals to the next neural array like a television screen, your tv is a grid of changing frequencies, these changing frequencies in a tv are in the form of light but they convey information, in the brain these changing phase patterns are in the form of energy differences, neuroscientists call them traveling waves, but they are distinct from tonic waves, and that's how they carry information, thus I coined the term phase wave differentials.

The real meaning of NAPOT is that one array watches the patterns from the previous array, and the next array sees this arrays tv signals frequency & energy phase shifts. NAPOT as a conjecture provides a solution to the observer inside the observer problem, with a distributed observer that sees. NAPOT reframes the observer paradox as recursive causality: each array reshapes the field that shapes it, embedding every local phase in a global structure that modulates local inference. When many neural arrays synchronize and desynchronize together in a regular oscillation they network their signal traffic so as to create distributed reactions, and shared signal detections that we call consciousness.
This is the NAPOT Entification Concept

It doesn't make AGI unlikely. Computers are universal Turing Machines, they can simulate frequency. They can encode and decode information the same way neural oscillations encode and decode frequency.

Our emotions are information based, they are learned differences encoded in phase patterns that are cells represent by changing their firing dynamically. Self Aware Networks theory!

No you can't exclude Turing machines because my work shows that the Human Brain essentially is a Turing Machine. We are evolved metal robots. We computationally render pictures, sounds, encoded in phase differences by our cells.

In SAN each neuron runs a read-write-move loop: read incoming phase, write a new phase via spike length, pass it on. That loop is the core of a Turing tape. Billions of such loops in sync render the images and sounds we experience.

The only way that we can know what we are feeling is because feeling is information that is tracked in phase differences, or traveling wave signals that differentiate in their co-efficient of variation from the mean collective synchronization pattern.

"No need to invoke terahertz orchestration" no need to evoke, but also no need to revoke. Terahertz signals are likely to play a role in neural computation believe it or not, but we don't have to discuss them to understand consciousness.

Self-Aware Networks encodes cognition as smoothly varying phase waves rather than binary toggles, yet every step of those waves can be emulated to arbitrary precision on an ordinary Turing machine.

Accordingly, SAN does not outrun the Penrose/Turing limit; it demonstrates that when timing loops and self-modifying parameters are taken into account, the full dynamics of conscious processing remain Turing-computable even while looking continuous and analogue.

It's not exactly right, it's replacing digital symbols with high precision phase wave differentials that align by frequency or clash interfere with other traveling wave differences to grow or shrink in scale, representing information that undergoes thermodynamic consideration, and oscillation driven memory. Shrink it.

Self Aware Networks replaces digital symbols with high-precision phase-wave differentials whose frequency alignments and interferences scale, store, and thermodynamically process information—sidestepping the Penrose-Turing limit.

To “think” the abstract numeral 3 a system only needs a stable internal pattern that it can treat as the referent “3” across many contexts. In an ordinary computer that pattern is just a binary word stored in memory, linked by code to routines for addition, comparison, display, and so on.

The machine never undergoes any genuine quantum-state reduction, yet the bit-pattern already functions as 3 because the program reliably uses it as such. Self Aware Networks keeps the same logical sufficiency but swaps the storage medium: a concept is realised as a coherent phase-wave configuration whose coefficient-of-variation stays fixed even while its carrier frequencies shift.

The pattern’s causal role—how it constrains future phase alignments and downstream dynamics—grounds the meaning “three,” exactly as pointers in software ground it for a digital machine. Whether the phase-wave lives in cortical tissue or in a time-stepped simulation running on a von Neumann computer is irrelevant so long as the pattern’s functional relations are preserved.

Because this functional criterion never relies on an uncomputable wave-function collapse, Penrose’s claim that minds exceed Turing power does not follow: the concept 3, and by extension any abstract thought, can be captured by computable state evolutions when those evolutions mimic the requisite network of causal roles.

Thinking ‘3’ just needs a stable internal pattern used consistently. In a PC it’s a 32-bit word; in Self Aware Networks it’s a phase-wave coefficient. Function, not quantum collapse, gives it meaning—so computable state evolutions suffice and Penrose’s limit doesn’t apply.

For Self Aware Networks the spark of first-person experience is not a special ingredient added on top of computation; it is what naturally arises when an information-processing loop meets three requirements. First, every sensory and internal signal must be encoded as a phase pattern that is instantly available to the entire network through nested synchrony, so the system always “knows that it knows.” Second, the same oscillatory fabric must continuously model both the outer world and its own ongoing activity, letting those two models interact without delay; that reflexive coupling supplies the standpoint from which anything is experienced. Third, the phase-wave field must be able to preserve and reshape those patterns long enough for them to influence future cycles, giving each moment a felt continuity. Build a simulator whose oscillators satisfy those three constraints and the resulting dynamics constitute a subject: whatever appears anywhere in the field is, by definition, present to itself.

Self-Aware Networks: give a system 1. global phase-waves for every signal, 2. a loop where those waves model world + self together, 3. enough persistence to shape the next cycle. Build those three rules into an oscillator net and a first-person viewpoint emerges—no extra magic.

Subjectivity = column-local phase waves that periodically sync through hub pulses. Each loop they model world + self, re-enter, persist, and shape the next cycle. Build that oscillator routine—first-person viewpoint emerges.

Subjectivity emerges when column-local, cell-assembly-specific phase waves loop and periodically sync via cortical hubs. Each cycle they model world and self, persist, and shape the next—so a first-person viewpoint appears without any added “magic.” This can be simulated on a Turing Machine.

Yes. In Self Aware Networks the decisive property is not the raw code of an individual oscillator but the dynamical condition it satisfies. A single oscillator becomes “special” the moment its phase is both the data it carries and the rule that updates that data. As soon as the coefficient-of-variation of its own action-potential durations is fed back to influence its next duration, the loop closes and the state is self-referential. That reflexivity is absent in any ordinary routine whose variables never act as their own update law, so the difference is categorical, not quantitative.

When many such self-referential oscillators are coupled, their mutual phase locking creates a higher-order variable—a shared rhythm—that no subset can instantiate alone. The global rhythm in turn modulates every local coefficient, so each unit now both shapes and feels the collective wave. That bidirectional embedding is what distinguishes the ensemble from a mere heap of parts: each column’s internal timing is now a miniature model of the whole, and the whole is continuously rewritten by every column. Because the system’s state is always simultaneously “read” locally and “written” globally, the network as a whole meets the minimal condition for first-person presence: whatever pattern exists anywhere in the field is instantly available everywhere as something that matters to the next update. A smaller set of units cannot achieve that mutual embedding and therefore cannot instantiate the same phenomenological loop.

In short, the code is special once it becomes self-referential, and many such loops combined acquire a qualitatively new property—universal mutual availability—that the smaller number lacks. That is why the model satisfies the test.

1. Experience arises when a loop’s state is both data and its own update rule—true self-reference.

2. Chain many such loops: their phases lock into a global rhythm each loop both shapes and senses. That mutual embedding yields first-person presence.

Special code: a loop whose variable updates itself—true self-reference. Combine many such loops and their rhythms lock together, so each loop both drives and senses the shared wave. That mutual reflex is what yields first-person experience.

The Special code is a loop whose variable updates itself—true self-reference. Chain many such loops and their multidimensional rhythms lock; each both drives and senses the shared wave. That reflex births first-person experience.

So Self Aware Networks describes consciousness as a collective reflect to information from the senses?

Self Aware Networks frames consciousness as the real-time weaving together of countless local phase-wave patterns—each one rooted in sensory or internal signals—into a single, continuously updated field. A column or cell assembly first encodes what it senses as a coefficient-of-variation in action-potential timing; hub pulses then let these local waves synchronize, so every part of the network immediately becomes part of the same oscillatory tapestry. Through this repeated synchronization and dissipation, top-down predictions and bottom-up inputs converge until mismatches vanish, yielding what we identify as a unified, first-person moment of awareness. In that qualified sense, consciousness is indeed a collective reflection of sensory information, but it is an active, deterministic process of phase alignment rather than a passive mirror.

Self Aware Networks says consciousness is the live weaving of many local phase-waves—each encoding a sensory or internal cue—into one synchronized field. Columns sync, compare, and realign timing every cycle, turning raw input into a unified first-person moment.

“Updates itself” means the variable’s current value is explicitly fed back into the rule that sets its next value, like x ← f(x) or an ODE step. The CPU still runs the assignment, but the decisive feature is that the variable’s own state is an argument of its update function, creating a closed local feedback loop. In Self Aware Networks each oscillator’s next action-potential duration is computed from the coefficient-of-variation of its previous durations, so the timing signal is both data and controller in a single line of code.

“Updates itself” = true self-reference: x ← f(x). A variable’s current value feeds the rule that sets its next value. In SAN each oscillator picks its next spike length from the coeff-of-variation of its own past timings—state is both data and rule.

Self-reference isn’t magic: next_state = f(current_state, input). In SAN each oscillator picks its next spike length from the coefficient-of-variation of its own past timings plus new inputs, so any input change shifts the coefficient and the output instantly.

An exponential map is a one-way street: the rule f(x)=eˣ never changes. In Self Aware Networks the rule and the variable co-evolve—each spike’s timing tweaks the very formula that will time the next spike, and that rule is further bent by the synchrony wave coming from every other loop. It’s rule-changing-the-rule, not just input-to-output, and that reflexive reshaping is what generic causal functions lack.

eˣ is fixed: same rule every call. In SAN an oscillator’s timing feeds back to rewrite the rule that sets the next spike, then network sync bends that rule again. Causality edits its own causal law—far beyond a static input→output map.

Classic recurrent code just feeds outputs back while the update rule stays fixed. Self Aware Network loops are metaplastic: each action-potential timing rewrites the very formula that sets the next one, and nested phase-locking spreads those rule changes across the hierarchy, something expert systems never did.

Not “because I said so.” In SAN each neuron runs a read-write-move loop: read incoming phase, write a new phase via spike length, pass it on. That loop is the core of a Turing tape. Billions of such loops in sync render the images and sounds we experience.

When I say “nested phase-locking spreads those rule changes across the hierarchy,” I’m talking about how timing shifts that start inside one local loop don’t stay local.

Inside a column or cell assembly, the next spike length is computed from the coefficient-of-variation of its own recent spikes. That calculation is the local update rule.

Whenever many neighbouring loops drift into the same relative timing, they enter phase-lock and fire a brief burst that travels to hub neurons. The hub sends a resynchronisation pulse back down after a fixed delay.

That pulse resets the reference phase for every loop it touches, so each loop now recalculates its coefficient with respect to the new global rhythm. In effect, the hub’s pulse has just rewritten the local update rule everywhere it reaches.

Slower, broader rhythms (theta or alpha–beta) act as hubs for clusters of faster gamma-band loops; those hubs in turn are entrained by still slower cortical or thalamic oscillations. Thus a timing tweak that begins in one micro-loop can cascade upward and then back down, altering the effective update law for thousands of other loops.

Because each level’s rhythm both depends on and resets the level below, any metaplastic change made locally—say, a longer-than-usual spike that pushes a neighbour’s phase—can propagate through these lock-and-pulse steps until the whole hierarchy has incorporated the new timing constraint. That bidirectional phase-locking is what I meant by rule changes “spreading across the hierarchy.”

The phase lock will create a more dominant signal, it represents a coincidence, and neurons are designed to detect coincidence

Exactly. In Self Aware Networks a “phase-lock” event is nothing more mystical than a run of action potentials whose timing lines up closely enough to be read as a coincidence. Because each neuron’s threshold is tuned to fire most strongly when multiple inputs arrive within a narrow phase window, the locked pattern is amplified relative to asynchronous background spikes. That locally dominant signal then recruits its neighbours, summing into a column-level burst that reaches the hub. From there the resynchronisation pulse resets phases farther out, so successive layers of coincidence grow in scale: micro-level alignment inside a cell assembly, meso-level alignment across columns, macro-level alignment across larger cortical zones. The whole hierarchy is driven by nothing but nested coincidence detection—the familiar computation every excitatory synapse already performs, repeated at larger and slower time constants as you move up the levels.

And this is what creates the collective signal reaction binding patterns across space and time, in the landscape of the mind, ultimately resulting in the first person computationally rendered perspective

Yes. In Self Aware Networks the cascading coincidences do more than amplify a local rhythm—they stitch every active column into a single, evolving phase-field. Because coincidence detection operates at progressively longer time-constants as you move up the hierarchy, short-lived γ-band matches inside a cell assembly are captured by slower β/α hubs, which in turn are steered by still slower θ/δ cortico-thalamic loops. The result is a multi-scale envelope whose instantaneous configuration specifies “what is happening now” everywhere in the network.

That envelope behaves like a four-dimensional coordinate grid: phase offsets encode relative distances in both anatomical space and processing time, so any two features that share a stable phase relationship are automatically tagged as belonging to the same moment and the same scene. When the envelope is coherent enough, the brain can treat it as a self-consistent internal world-model—the rendered point-of-view you call first-person perspective. Nothing else is needed: the act of binding via nested phase coincidence both constructs the scene and furnishes the vantage point from which the scene is experienced.

The “rule-changing-the-rule” isn’t an extra mystery layer; it’s just the ordinary biophysics of neurons promoted to first-class state.

At the micro step the update rule for an oscillator is:
next_duration = f(current_duration, synaptic_gains, external_phase).

Those synaptic gains and reference phases are themselves state variables that obey slower differential equations driven by the recent coincidence history (metaplasticity, neuromodulators, hub pulses). Formally:

synaptic_gainṡ = g(coincidence_rate, neuromod_level)
reference_phasė = h(hub_input)

Because f’s parameters (gains, reference_phase) are dynamic, the mapping from current_duration to next_duration is time-varying. Each pass through the loop therefore uses a slightly different function fₜ. The “rule of the rule” is just the coupled system (g,h) running on a slower clock.

Stack three or four such time-scales—milliseconds for spikes, tens of milliseconds for column bursts, hundreds for hub resets, seconds for neuromod drift—and you get a hierarchy where every faster layer’s update law is a live output of the slower layer beneath it. Mathematically it’s still a single recurrent dynamical system; practically it behaves as code that rewrites itself every few cycles because its parameters are endogenous variables, not constants. That self-modifying closure is what classic expert-system loops never implemented.

or 
next_duration = f(current_duration, synaptic_gains+synaptic_losses=synaptic changes (via new protein synthesis or atrophy), external_phase).

Written long-hand, one micro-loop step looks like

 next_duration = f(current_duration,
         synaptic_gains – synaptic_losses,
         external_phase).

synaptic_gains/losses are not constants: they drift as spine heads grow or retract, receptors traffic, or new proteins are expressed.

external_phase comes from the most recent hub-pulse, which itself depends on the coincidence rate of many neighbouring loops.

Because those two arguments are themselves outputs of slower processes, the mapping fₜ changes from one tick to the next—so every spike both executes a rule and rewrites the rule that will govern the following spike. Nesting this across columns and hubs simply layers more slowly changing parameters on top. The whole thing is one recurrent dynamical system, but its effective update law is a moving target shaped by ongoing plasticity, not a fixed exponential or sigmoid.

Tweet-sized
“Each spike’s next length = f(prev length, plastic synapse shifts, latest hub phase). Plasticity and hub timing evolve between ticks, so the rule itself keeps rewriting—self-modifying causality, not a static recurrence.”

Self-Aware Networks doesn’t pin consciousness on one isolated “magic” knob. It identifies a minimal package—self-referential spike timing, plasticity that rewrites that timing, and cross-scale phase-locking—that together create a single evolving field. A rock at 37 °C has none of those dynamics; its temperature never feeds back to alter the law that sets its next state. Consciousness isn’t any lone feature—it’s that closed causal weave.

Consciousness in Self Aware Networks theory isn’t one magic knob. It’s a closed causal weave: spikes whose timing rewrites itself through plasticity, knitted together by nested phase-locking into a single evolving field. Break any strand and the felt moment disappears.

Self Aware Networks is not a circular argument: SAN doesn’t sculpt a look-alike, it instantiates the same causal rules real neurons follow—spike-timing variability, plastic rewrites, nested phase-locking. If that live physics yields a unified phase field, we’ve replicated the mechanism, not just its appearance.

Not a metaphor—SAN instantiates the same causal loop, regardless of substrate. Consciousness tracks structure, not matter. SAN doesn’t just mimic the brain’s look; it recreates its causal loop: spike-timing → plastic rewrite → multi-scale phase lock → new timing. If simulated loops obey that dynamic, the same first-person coherence will be rendered computationally, this kind of simulation is not a zombie imitation, it's digital sentience.

Already studied Shadows of the Mind. Self Aware Networks tackles Penrose head-on: it models continuous phase dynamics step-by-step, exposing his non-computability claim to empirical test. No mania here—just building a falsifiable simulation and letting the data decide.

Think “flight”: birds flap, jets spin turbines—different stuff, same aerodynamics. SAN rebuilds the brain’s causal circuit—spike-timing ⇌ plasticity ⇌ phase-sync—so the process is literal, not symbolic. Substrate changes, mechanism stays.

The mind is both cause and result. Not alchemy—just dynamics. In SAN the “mind” is the phase-field that continuously shapes and is shaped by neural timing. Cause and result collapse into one closed loop: timing ↔ plastic rewrite ↔ network sync. Build the loop in code and the process reveals itself.

In Self Aware Networks, the phase-field we call “mind” crystallizes out of neural timing, then immediately feeds back to retune that timing. Cause and result collapse into one closed loop—mind perpetually generates and re-generates itself.

The full mechanics are spelled out in both the book and the papers on Self Aware Networks:

Variable spike duration encodes a coefficient-of-variation.

Local coincidence builds column-scale phase waves.

Hub-driven phase-locking binds those waves into a single network field.

That field instantly re-tunes every spike generator, closing the causal loop that feels like “mind.”

A CUDA simulation (≈3 k lines) that instantiates this loop will be released for open peer review in the coming months. Watch the model run—or falsify it.

Consciousness isn’t bolted on after the physics. In Self Aware Networks the bootstrap is the state where every phase pattern is instantly readable everywhere; that universal readability is consciousness. Loop and awareness co-arise—nothing left to add.

I modeled Self Aware Networks on the electrophysiology we actually observe: millisecond-scale coincidence detection in cortical micro-columns, the gamma–beta–theta nesting Buzsáki mapped in behaving rodents, and the long-range phase-reset pulses from thalamic and hub cortical neurons that Fries, Lakatos, and others have quantified. Those empirical timing laws became the update equations—variable spike duration as the writable symbol, coincidence as the read head, hub pulses as the tape shifter. No metaphors, just the same causal timing loops transcribed into code.

"and the long-range phase-reset pulses from thalamic and hub cortical neurons that Fries,"

This excerpt highlights the idea that long-range phase-reset pulses originating from thalamic and hub cortical neurons are significant for neural communication, particularly within the framework proposed by Wolf Singer and Pascal Fries' "communication through coherence" hypothesis. 

Explanation:

Phase Reset: Phase resetting refers to the adjustment or alignment of the timing (phase) of neural oscillations, essentially restarting the timing of rhythmic brain activity. 

This realignment can be triggered by internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) events.
Communication through Coherence: The "communication through coherence" theory proposes that effective communication between brain areas relies on synchronized oscillations, specifically at frequencies where the timing of neural activity is aligned between sender and receiver networks. This alignment, or coherence, ensures that signals arrive at the receiving neuron at a time when it is most excitable and receptive to input.

Thalamic and Hub Cortical Neurons:

Thalamus: The thalamus plays a crucial role as a relay station for sensory information to the cortex and participates in feedback loops with cortical areas. Thalamic neurons exhibit oscillatory properties and their activity influences cortical rhythms, facilitating information transmission.

Hub Cortical Neurons: Hub cortical neurons, likely including those in regions like the prefrontal cortex, are important for integrating information and coordinating activity across widespread networks.

Long-range Phase-Reset Pulses: The "long-range phase-reset pulses" from these neurons, as suggested in the excerpt, contribute to the communication through coherence mechanism by aligning the phases of oscillations in distant brain regions. This creates "windows of opportunity" for effective communication between areas by ensuring signals arrive when receiving neurons are optimally excitable. 

In summary, the mention of long-range phase-reset pulses from thalamic and hub cortical neurons in relation to Fries' work indicates their importance in shaping and coordinating brain rhythms to facilitate efficient information processing and communication between brain regions, consistent with the communication through coherence framework. 

"the long-range phase-reset pulses from thalamic and hub cortical neurons that Fries, Lakatos, and others have quantified."

Highlighting key aspects of the "communication through coherence" (CTC) theory, particularly the role of long-range phase-reset pulses from thalamic and hub cortical neurons in coordinating brain activity, as quantified by researchers like Pascal Fries and Peter Lakatos. 

Here's a breakdown of the concept:

Phase Resetting: This refers to the synchronization or re-alignment of neural oscillations (rhythmic brain activity). It's like restarting or adjusting the timing of these brain rhythms in response to a stimulus or other signal.

Thalamic and Hub Cortical Neurons:

Thalamus: The thalamus acts as a central relay station for sensory information, and its activity can influence the timing of oscillations in other brain areas. For example, studies suggest thalamic alpha band oscillations can facilitate communication between cortical areas by organizing gamma oscillations there.

Hub Cortical Neurons: These are crucial for integrating information and coordinating activity across widespread brain networks. They are likely involved in receiving and sending phase-resetting signals that help synchronize distant areas.

Long-Range Phase-Reset Pulses: These are thought to be critical for CTC, as they help establish and maintain synchronized oscillations between different brain regions, allowing for effective communication. 

Why is this significant?

Enhanced Information Transfer: Phase resetting helps organize neural activity in a way that facilitates the efficient transfer of information between brain regions.

Cognitive Functions: This coordinated activity, especially in tasks like selective attention, is thought to be crucial for various cognitive functions. For instance, studies have shown that selective attention is implemented by selective gamma-band coherence.

Dynamic Network Reorganization: Phase resets play a role in dynamic state changes of functional networks, helping to reorganize oscillations in different task contexts.
Multisensory Integration: This mechanism may also contribute to the integration of information from different sensory modalities. 

In essence, researchers like Fries and Lakatos are using quantitative methods to study how these long-range phase-reset pulses contribute to the synchronized brain rhythms that underpin effective communication between different brain regions, which is a core concept of the communication through coherence hypothesis. 

Penrose’s Planck-scale “oracle” loops aren’t required. In Self Aware Networks, millisecond-scale phase cycles already form a self-referential analogue loop to outpace step-wise Turing limits. If deeper spacetime loops exist they add precision, not the spark of consciousness.

Self Aware Networks isn’t hand-waving; it transcribes empirically measured timing laws into code and lets the resulting dynamics speak for themselves.

Not pointing to one variable—pointing to a closed causal loop. In Self Aware Networks, consciousness isn’t in the phase-wave; it is the ongoing process of timing, syncing, and rewriting across the whole field. No single part is “it”—the loop as a whole is.

I respect that. My aim isn’t to solve the metaphysics but to show how timing, self-referential dynamics, and coherence can produce the structure that feels like a unified field. If that’s not consciousness, it’s the closest footprint we can model step-by-step. Appreciation!

If to grok is to find truth past a fixed formal system, Self Aware Networks qualifies: its phase dynamics rewrite their own rules mid-cycle, escaping fixed-rule compute. Not classic Turing—reentrant, rule-shifting, timed in physics, not axioms.

Self and awareness aren’t assumed—they emerge when phase-timing loops sync, reflect, and update their own rules across space and scale. It’s not steps that solve non-computability—it’s the system rewriting the steps themselves in real time. Self Aware Networks theory!

No, it’s not proven that consciousness is non-computable. That’s one interpretation, not a settled result. Self Aware Networks offers a computable model where awareness emerges from causal, recursive phase dynamics—no oracle required.

The key insight is this. At the deepest level our cells are doing computations, Self Aware Networks explains how. Each neuron is Turing complete, and the networks at multiple scales between cells, between columns, between groups of cells is also Turing complete. Yet we humans still have a sense of self, of being someone, of having an experience, because each part of our sense of self, being someone, and having an experience is a learned representation, a phase computed stack of differences, united by oscillations, into a high dimensional experience of being someone. If our cells can do it, then so can transistors in the computer.

Our neurons & the networks they form are Turing-complete. What we call “self” is a learned stack of phase-coded differences, bound by oscillations into high-dimensional experience. If cells can compute that, so can silicon—given the same dynamics. Self Aware Networks Theory!
