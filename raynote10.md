This gravitational testing theory might validate Dark Time Theory.
"Testing Whether Gravity Acts as a Quantum Entity When Measured"
"The principal obstacle of the above proposal [20–22] is decoherence. If the decoherence rate Γ>𝑑⁢Δ⁢𝜙/𝑑⁢𝑡, where 𝑑⁢Δ⁢𝜙/𝑑⁢𝑡 is the rate of growth of the phase responsible for gravity induced entanglement, then no entanglement is produced between the masses [37–39] (verifiable using the Peres-Horodecki criterion [40,41]). Moreover, witnessing entanglement requires trusted measurement devices. Although one may use device-independent detection of entanglement through the Bell test [36], that demands an even lower decoherence rate [42], as well as closing all loopholes, which is challenging. Thus the key question is whether some other nonclassical aspect of gravity can be observed in the Γ>𝑑⁢Δ⁢𝜙/𝑑⁢𝑡 regime, which will be detectable much earlier in experiments. Notably, a coherence ∼𝑒−Γ⁢𝑡 is always present in any spatial superposition of a mass evolved for a time 𝑡. Can that be exploited to observe some nonclassicality of gravity? Motivated thus, here we propose to test a different nonclassical aspect of gravity, which is, at the same time, a device-independent test, and works for any finite decoherence rate. While entanglement witnessing [21,22] tests the validity of quantum superposition principle for gravity, our present proposal can test whether a measurement of gravity generically causes disturbance (an irreducible feature of quantum measurement).
"As quantum mechanics is not defined by the superposition principle alone, but also requires the unitarity of evolution and the measurement postulate [45,46], witnessing entanglement in the earlier proposal [21,22] will imply that gravity is described either by quantum mechanics, or by a (unknown) nonclassical theory that obeys superposition principle. To know whether gravity is indeed quantum, we need to test other quantum mechanical postulates for gravity. This is a gap in the literature that we hereby fill by proposing to test a specific aspect of the quantum measurement postulate, namely, quantum measurement-induced disturbance."

Central to the idea of Dark Time Theory is that the relative density of time frames near mass is concentrated, and this creates additional space in time from a particle's perspective those additional time frames are treated as additional space, creating the effect of curved space, and this alters a particles trajectory because it alters the particles random walk, increasing the odds the particle moves towards a gravitational mass with each interval of it's random walk. Time density is inverse to the clock rate, so where time density is increased clock rates move more slowly relative to clock rates in areas where time density is decreased, in other words the frequency of time is inversely proportional to the magnitude of time density, this means that time density probably probably interacts with particles like an additional phase of space coming from the center of a gravitational source, so on the one hand the time interval required for a given phase shift is inversely proportional to the frequency, when gravity and an incoming particle have phase alignment we might expect the quantum particle or classical object to move toward the source of gravity, like a mutual cuing effect in oscillatory synchronization. Interestingly the article suggests that we could detect gravity not through oscillatory coherence, but decoherence, imaging gravity as a decoherence signal that intercepts and disturbs the particle. Which also aligns with the idea that additional time density, producing a different phase pattern at the quantum scale, may change the path of a particle by disturbing it's random walk, changing the odds for which path it follows. This could make calculating Dark Time Theory more granular than just modifying the energy of a particle, we could understand gravitational waves, as not only increased time density, but also as increased phase-wave magnitudes.
