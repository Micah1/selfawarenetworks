# Disclaimer: These are raw unedited notes. If you search hard enough you will find many statements that contradict other statements, and you fill find incorrect statements. There are reasons for that, which I will explain, but also I will be fixing these raw notes.

Some, but not all of these notes are intended to become part of a book titled "Self Aware Networks by Micah Samuel Blumberg"

Some of the notes will be deleted. I do not believe every phrase or every idea written in these notes. Some of the notes are quotes from others and in further revisions I will clarify what I wrote as distinct from quotes.

Not every statement in the notes was written by me, because some of the notes include quotes from others, some include text & ideas written by others, some of the notes include transcribed conversations with others that I Micah Blumberg had with other people, in the final book it is the intention to quote every source accurately. All credit to all sources of the various ideas will be logged & cited everywhere possible. In the event that I forget who a source was I will cite the source as "unknown."

Some of the statements in the notes are written incorrectly, some of the statements are untrue. Untrue and incorrect information were included in my notes in some cases because the information that I saved in my notes had something of value in it that I wished to extract later on.

An example is when you have a musing that you know is not quite write, but there is perhaps something interesting in that musing that might be right but you need to think about it later when you are more awake, so you save it into a note to read later.

There are many statements in my notes that I do not agree with, that I will be fixing as the project moves forward.

Just as there are many things that I've said online on social media that I myself as of today would not be in perfect agreement with. There are many things that a person would say differently with the knowledge learned from years of study following the point from which they made their statements in the first place. No person that I'm aware of is excluded from the need to revise their past statements and past viewpoints on various topics.

Please note that many of the notes date back a decade or more.

Another disclaimer: Not all of the notes are intended to be serious. Some include cultural references to science fiction films, science fiction books, or other popular media content, and none of these cultural references to popular media content are intended for the book, but at some point we can have a dedicated repo to cultural references related to brain computer interfaces, intelligent robots, science fiction, and other content that might be interesting to people who like these topics.
