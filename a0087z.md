Self Aware Networks Institute, Book, Monetization Ideas (Okay to share)
book chapter outline topics list (book, cortex)
Book update: I've been working on the book from April 2021 to June 2022. I'm still not done but I'm working hard to release my notes soon on github because github is the same as publishing & I can start the Institute from Github.

Interesting thought, what if this is evidence for the idea that slowing yourself down with meditation can reduce your inflammation? Reference: Mitochondrial respiratory chain sustains inflammation. If your body & mind is less active, your cells will produce less ATP and use less oxygen. That could add something valuable to the mystery of why people in total darkness, or blind people can lose their sense of time and experience abnormally long sleep cycles without noticing it. I'm suggesting that sleep, because you are less active, is slowing your inflammation down

Macro Scale viewpoint on the book & institute progress.
Titles: The main title and subtitle has been decided upon. (I will share the title and subtitles later on when I put up a link for pre-orders to amazon)
Self Aware Networks, Neo Mind Cycle, Artificial Neurology

The Book's main theory & scope has been defined. The Three Major Sections have been outlined in detail specifying what categories of content are in the book and what categories of content are not in the book.

These major sections are about the human brain, brain computer interfaces, and neural networks respectively, as I have new ideas to share in all three areas.

Beyond titles for the major sections I have already defined what content each of these three sections includes and what it excludes topic wise, although minor changes to the included topics are plausible & likely. This high level outline helps shape the table of contents and topics list at a lower level.

Meso Scale
The Table of Contents: Chapter Names, Topics under each chapter, the list of main Arguments, the list of references, and the list of citations is coming together and it's what I am focusing on the most right now.

I've gone through multiple drafts for the exact table of contents, which continues to grow because I continue to get great new ideas.

The topics list is like a list of things to be added or subtracted from the table of contents,
The multi-level mindmap / outline has gone through several different drafts and continues to develop (and will continue to develop until the publication date.)
I have listed many of the arguments in different notes but they still need to be moved into one place.
Still adding to, removing from, re-ordering from first to last, and using to organize various writings.
This serves triple duty as a high level outline for slotting in things that I have written both recently this year and in past decade.
Status: Ongoing, mostly complete, might be making minor changes up until the publication date.

Micro Scale Viewpoint & Work
Moving & Ordering Various writings:
I have written extensively on many of the topics in the book, my work is spread out across a ton of different apps on several different devices.
I have thousands of pages of notes, some of my written work goes back to 2010. That will need to get reduced to what I think will be around 300 pages.

Moving my collections of work from the many different apps located on many different devices into the outline & table of contents above, and then ordering them from first to last is the main work right now.

In addition there is still content that I need to create, but I am optimistic that once I have the main stuff organized, and outlined the gaps I will be able to fill in the blanks with my handy AI based transcription tool, allowing me to fill in the blanks by talking to the computer. (I will need to fix the auto transcriptions but they are mostly well done.)
Status: I'm not going to be able to absolutely organize everything in the first edition of the book because I have too much content to sort through, so I am in a manner of speaking just going to grab what I can with the time that I have and put this together.

We can solve many of the human rights issues by getting all essential nutrients affordable and available to every human being on this planet. When you raise the threshold of cognitive performance people think of better ways to behave that benefit everyone.

The SAO  going to use your donations to hire programmers to help me create the webxr version of this book with this 3D carousel interface, and the ability to grab items with gravity gloves
and the ability to see your fnirs biofeedback in VR and AR

I'm also going to build a self aware phenomenally conscious artificial neural network in webxr that can interface with your mind, connecting your mind with ar and Vr to ai 

its like your neural correlates are visualized and turned into audio by the computer so you gain new insights into your own thought patterns and that accelerates your mental pattern formation.

As far as monetization I thought of creating a gift shop of virtual items including membership cards. Tokens. Art. Prizes.

My conjecture is that the solution to world peace is 1. To give the world sentient self aware neural network robots and 2. To ask everyone in the universe to forgive everyone else everyday so that we can work together to make the world better for everyone!

I love the idea that the cosmos we experience is literally inside someone elses mind and that they are conscious of all of us. I also think its an interesting that person, and each animal is creating a node of the universe.

2021 commemorative token/coin that will only be issued in the year 2021. This is a collectors item proving that you support the research of this institute that you are part of thanks to your support.
To fuel our research and pay researchers & engineers we make "membership tokens available for members to collect" as a receipt on every donation of the equivalent of $20 dollars or more by prices in 2021. 
You are supporting the foundation-extension for 
You can shape our work depending on what you donate to, and the proof is that you own membership tokens in each of these.
The oldest tokens are worth the most in membership credit because

A more giving humanity,
I want to make it possible for human beings to create the most beautiful virtual presents quickly and easily so giving beautiful presents to everyone you meet is going to be a regular thing.
The people who give you presents are people you like, humans are wired that way.

The membership for a donation in any amount gets you a subscription to our notifications so that we can send you updates on our progress, give you early insight into our research invite you to events to collaborate on writing open source software, access to news about new educational metaverse experiences made with webxr. In essence a membership token means we send our emails to the email address that we have on file for you. Changing to a new email is possible if we can verify both the new and the old email address, via a program, a smart contract will initiate allowing you to sell your membership card, coin or token to another person but keep your email address and replace it with theirs as part of the sale

This technology will be automated once I am able to hire a team of programmers to help me implement all these ideas faster.

The self aware networks institute for the study of neurophysics, artificial neurology, brain computer interfaces, and advanced technologies..

Machine brain to computer interface ha

this describes how ports can be attached to artificial brains to link them into other computing systems and with other artificial brains 

The artificial brain transistor array.


By selling membership tokens, I mean they are memberships distinguished by the date of purchase, linked to an email & a web address via a smart contract. You could in theory resell the membership token or certificate, but these are designed to be collectables, keepsakes. 

With artificial sentient labor the amount of production of goods and services with scale up massively which means your personal purchasing power increases massively, everyone gets richer, but we will all live longer healthier lives,

With the brain computer interfaces we will make the potential to even slow down your experience of time by extending your mind with a connection to an artificial cortex if our institute's mission is successful. This means that the average human lifespan with our technologies can potentially feel exponentially longer than it feels right now because the total amount of calculations per second that your brain can process with our technology will expand your brain. Expanding your brain power means more thoughts per second and that means your experience of spacetime slows down. You become more aware of every moment.

Customers who support the institute with purchases will likely be among the first in the world to learn about the latest advances in our research.

Another path is creating a free annual token membership that is only available for free that year to paid members. In 2024 a token from 2022 is no longer free, it can only be purchased from someone. In that sense the tokens gain value the older they are, but you can get a free token each year as a paid member, and the paid membership could be like $20 a year or $10 a year. Or it could be like a grandfathered price, where if you become a member in 2022 your annual membership is always 10 per year for life, but if you join in 2023 the price per year is more but still fixed at that rate for life. So in 2025 the membership is cheaper renewal price is cheaper for members who joined in 2022 for example. It’s a way to keep up with inflation while providing a locked in senior discount.

As a member you will receive notifications from us via the email address associated with your donation

This will mean that you will be among the first in the world to learn about advances in our work at the institute that will lead to the perception of life extension via an increase in the amount of thoughts you have per time interval with an extended artificial cortex.


Please help me to achieve my life goals of creating nervegear/augma level bci tech, conscious robots, and artificial cortex

I realized in 2012 that these were my life goals and I dedicated my life to solving them.

The problem that I had with getting the layer and the canvas to react the same way with teleportations in worldspace is the same problem I had with exokit web with getting interactions from one canvas to work with another canvas

I thought I would need to send commands over the server
but in essence I need a duplicate camera teleporter in each canvas

then I just send the same signal to each

so I need like a way to duplicate functions and commands from one canvas to another

I need art, an art concept for each topic in the book. Put the word in the middle, like a slide to find pictures.

send your 

with this Special Token you get a first edition lifetime membership for a super low price

you can become a member of the Self Aware Networks Institute before it's built, your membership will help us pay our staff to finish building out the vision of building a webxr based institute dedicated to our research that is intended to benefit all mankind.


Additional details:
So imagine now that I have in section 1 a few new proposals for how the human mind works, including some amazing ideas based on new research that I only recently thought of, and it is likely that some of which may turn out to be incorrect, and it is likely I have misunderstood some of the parts of what I have studied, but this is okay.

The reason its okay is that the main idea I want to share with people is general enough that even if it turns out that some of the details of mechanical operations of the brain that I am describing are incorrect, in terms of the mechanical operations of the brain, the type of hypothesis that I am sharing is a new "outside in" type of hypothesis that may still be valuable to other brain researchers, and is somewhat invariant to some of the details (but not completely, the mechanisms I am describing would have to exist in a different form).

In the other two sections which are not directly about brain function but still touch on the topic I am similarly in the stage of ordering and organizing content that I have already written.

Research for the book:
Anyone can see that on social media I have shared a lot of brain related books, papers, and images, part of it is stuff I want to see later, most of it is stuff that will not be referenced in the book I am writing at all, these past months I have been keeping many of my most important references that I am writing about in the book close to my heart.

So a look at my social media shares will NOT give you any real clues to the contents of the book, which is about stuff that I have not been sharing.

To explain in more detail what I have also been doing is going through a ton of brain research related books, research papers, videos and other media to check and expand upon each area of my hypothesis, and to find the best references for my arguments either for or against.

This is another situation where there is no way for me to get through all the research available before the book comes out. So I am trying hard to canvas a lot of the recent ideas and read a lot of the best books and the best articles and stuff that is especially relevant to what I am writing about but as with my notes I will effectively have to grab what I can for now and include more research in future editions of the book.

Even if the multitude of ideas that I put forth about how human consciousness might work turn out to be incorrect, the arguments that I will make will include citations (peer reviewed research), references to brain research related books & articles, as well as diagrams and art. 

So if it turns out that I am not correct about some of the key components of how the human brain works the book should still have a lot of value to offer the interested reader in terms of the information it brings together, all the references, the links & analogies I make between different topics in different industries, and the mapping of major research efforts, major companies, major articles, major books, major new emerging technologies, and so on with my notes on all of that.

Early in 2021 I wrote the massive article called "WebAR Wearable Digital Fashion NFT, Bio-Sensors, 3D DNN Shape Completion, Animations, Gan Synthesis" and another article called "Digital Fashion, Art, NFT, AR, VR, WebXR, 3D Deep Learning, BCI, and the future native digital economy." I realized that I now had the experiential qualities needed to organize a massive 300 page book. You can find these articles and more at VRMA.io

Like those two articles my book will cross industries, from neuroscience, to virtual reality, to brain computer interfaces, and machine learning. If you look at all the articles on that page you will see that I have written about medical imaging, deep learning, and yes some of that content will be referenced in the book.

I hope to use this book as a reference point for discussions on clubhouse, with the community of brain researchers, both neurologists and medical imagers, as well as with deep learning enthusiasts. The book will add value to my articles because if someone likes an article that I write they will be able to look at who I am and that will tell them that I'm the author of this book, which they can read if they want, to know more about the topics that I pay close attention to.

The concepts in the book will serve as the foundation for the creation of new 2D & 3D virtual reality & augmented reality art, that can be sold, tokenized, as well this content might inspire WebXR based AR & VR experiences, as well as the content for events, merchandise, and for me personally the book will serve as an introduction to people I haven't met yet, so they understand the scope of what I focus on and therefore they will gain insight into what they might collaborate with me on.
