It cited two works, one a paper dated in April 2022 called
# "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology"
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9764721

The 2nd was ""This behavior was first described by American biologist Herbert Spencer Jennings around 1900, but it had been considered non-reproducible.""
An edition of Behavior of the lower organisms (1906)
by H. S. Jennings
https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7150061M/Behavior_of_the_lower_organisms

Quote "American zoologist who was one of the first scientists to study the behaviour of individual microorganisms and to experiment with genetic variations in single-celled organisms. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the morphogenesis of rotiferans (microscopic aquatic organisms), an area of scientific interest he pursued for the next 10 years. The peak of his research and his primary contribution to zoology was his Behaviour of the Lower Organisms (1906). In this study of the reactions of individual organisms and individual response to stimuli, Jennings reported new experimental evidence of the similarity of activity and reactivity in all animals, from protozoans to man. For 40 years of his career Jennings studied the mechanisms of inheritance and variation in single-celled organisms." End Quote (Quote via https://todayinsci.com/4/4_14.htm)

This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!

Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations

"Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 

The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

So this

Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."

Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations

Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).

Note
The imagined focus of future biological research is about understanding the functions encoded in 3D protein structures, tracing connections between gene expressions, 3D receptors, cells, and multicellular structures to behaviors, diseases, and all manner of biological functions that can be identified.

Receptors have coincidence detection mechanisms inside the cell body.

each receptor is a sensor and the more of them that you affect the more the cells behavior changes, that is variable gradient coincidence detection or pattern detection
A soma bursting action potential event isn't necessary for Hebbian learning to take place.

The soma burst is just one type of threshold mechanism, receptors also have thresholds via four levels of conductance.

NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography includes communication with Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, T-Cells, Microglia, and basically any type of cell. NAPOT interfaces with all cells via COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, because all cells exchange signals, and have receptors, membranes, and other structures to receive signals & detect information from temporal cascades of coincident activations.

Astrocytes can compute paper https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.20.465192v3

# "Variation in voltages (or a lack of it) within an astrocyte network can also explain the" Variations in voltages are phase changes.
This fact supports the connection between NAPOT Theory & glial cells.

"Research Reveals Surprising Conversations Between Our Brain Cells"
"Astrocytes operate as a network system that can be compared to a power grid with identical voltages. Variation in voltages (or a lack of it) within an astrocyte network can also explain the basic and advanced levels of brain function."
https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/research-reveals-surprising-conversations-between-our-brain-cells

"astrocytes are electrically active and in constant communication with neurons, as Dulla and colleagues reported in a Nature Neuroscience study." 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01049-x

Astrocytes can depolarize, releasing inhibitory glutamate, another way that phase patterns be altered to change the active tonic brainwave oscillation, your memory/awareness/model of reality & your internal qualia or representations, what you see hear taste smell and feel.

"When astrocytes depolarize, they can activate other proteins. But so far, researchers never really considered that possibility because they didn't think astrocytes could do so in the first place. “So now that we know, it makes us kind of go back and revisit ways that they're affected by electrical activity,” Dulla says. When astrocytes depolarize, they inhibit glutamate transporters and therefore increase  glutamate levels."

Most of the worlds biologists and neuroscientists do not realize what is perfectly obvious, which is that ordinary cells are capable of hebbian learning, receptors are sensors, as receptors can grow to represent a memory as a physical sensor configuration that is responsive to certain criteria

/////////////////////////////////////////////////

# Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.

All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.

Receptors enable a cell to detect patterns, the more receptors that are affected, the greater the cell's reaction, receptors have thresholds for activation, but cells can also detect when multiple receptors have been triggered via inner threshold mechanisms that span between receptors.

Sometimes Potassium channel receptors are bound by Ankyrin Repeats and that makes the receptor surface area larger so the cell becomes sensitive to mechano-scale waves, in other words now the cell can react to touch.

In a sense that Ankyrin Repeat is allowing the cell to detect the coincident features of a mechanical scale wave (acoustic scale wave or sound vibration scale wave)

So any surface area could be part of a sensor, and if the sensor has different thresholds for activating different functions its a coincidence detector, the shape, topology, morphology, and physical configuration of the sensor determine what types of signals it is capable of responding to, and what types of signals it ignores, so the shape of the sensor can act as a learned memory, and this is why the learned receptor configuration on any cell in any organism is effectively a long term memory that exists to react or activate a function (a cell behavior) upon activation.

Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md

# New theory of evolution
in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.

cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.

Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.

Side note: "Crystal study may resolve DNA mystery" 
"When cells reproduce, the internal mechanisms that copy DNA get it right nearly every time. Rice University bioscientists have uncovered a tiny detail that helps understand how the process could go wrong. Their study of enzymes revealed the presence of a central metal ion critical to DNA replication also appears to be implicated in misincorporation, the faulty ordering of nucleotides on new strands. The observation reported in Nature Communications could help find treatments for genetic mutations and the diseases they cause, including cancer."
"time-resolved crystallography to analyze the flexible enzymes called polymerase as they bend and twist to rapidly reassemble complete strands of DNA from a pool of C, G, A and T nucleotides."
"All of the proteins involved in DNA replication rely on metal ions—either magnesium or manganese—to catalyze the transfer of nucleotides to their proper positions along the strand, but whether there were two or three ions involved has long been a topic of debate."
"Only when the first two metal ions are in check can the third one come and drive the reaction home," said Chang, suggesting the process may be universal among polymerases"

(note that since this does not contradict the existing theory of evolution it can be considered an amendment to the existing Theory of Evolution. Essentially it argues that organisms compute their future structure through hebbian learning at the receptor / neuro transmitter signalling (and potentially this can scale up to learning at the multi-cell assembling level, organ scale & whole organism level.)

Computationally computed biological structures are different from random mutation but both are governed by natural selection.

Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)

# "A synthetic protein-level neural network in mammalian cells"
Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

"Artificial neural networks provide a powerful paradigm for information processing that has transformed diverse fields. Within living cells, genetically encoded synthetic molecular networks could, in principle, harness principles of neural computation to classify molecular signals."
"These results demonstrate how engineered protein-based networks can enable programmable signal classification in living cells."
But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote.

There is an interesting study called
# "Neural Population Dynamics of Computing with Synaptic Modulations"
"In this work, we analyze the dynamics of a network that relies solely on synaptic modulations to process short-time scale information, the multi-plasticity network (MPN)"
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497776v1

It's interesting because they are considering the dynamics of cellular communication in the human brain by creating a new type of artificial neural network called a multi-plasticity network (MPN) to explore the concept of short term synaptic plasticity. So the weights are not frozen after training but continue to be plastic, or dynamic, inspired by 'fast weights' in felxible learning, and unlike the HebbFF model they use multiplicative weights instead of additive modulation.
