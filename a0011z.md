Add to Synaptic Unreliability note map

/////////////////////////////////////////////

The relationship between the electron and the magnetic field might be similar to the relationship between earth and its gravity/time dilation field. Explore & research the analogy further, add to the Gravity note map.

Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations

Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
add to the discussion of the granularity of consciousness citing Jon Lieff, M.D.'s work.

Note
The imagined focus of future biological research is about understanding the functions encoded in 3D protein structures, tracing connections between gene expressions, 3D receptors, cells, and multi-cellular structures to behaviors, diseases, and all manner of biological functions that can be identified.
