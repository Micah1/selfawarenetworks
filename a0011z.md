/////////////////////////////////////////////

The relationship between the electron and the magnetic field might be similar to the relationship between earth and its gravity/time dilation field. Explore & research the analogy further, add to the Gravity note map.

Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations

Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
add to the discussion of the granularity of consciousness citing Jon Lieff, M.D.'s work.

Note
The imagined focus of future biological research is about understanding the functions encoded in 3D protein structures, tracing connections between gene expressions, 3D receptors, cells, and multicellular structures to behaviors, diseases, and all manner of biological functions that can be identified.

Receptors have coincidence detection mechanisms inside the cell body.

each receptor is a sensor and the more of them that you affect the more the cells behavior changes, that is variable gradient coincidence detection or pattern detection
A soma bursting action potential event isn't necessary for Hebbian learning to take place.

The soma burst is just one type of threshold mechanism, receptors also have thresholds via four levels of conductance.

Most of the worlds biologists and neuroscientists do not realize what is perfectly obvious, which is that ordinary cells are capable of hebbian learning, receptors are sensors, as receptors can grow to represent a memory as a physical sensor configuration that is responsive to certain criteria

# Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.

All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.

Receptors enable a cell to detect patterns, the more receptors that are affected, the greater the cell's reaction, receptors have thresholds for activation, but cells can also detect when multiple receptors have been triggered via inner threshold mechanisms that span between receptors.

Sometimes Potassium channel receptors are bound by Ankyrin Repeats and that makes the receptor surface area larger so the cell becomes sensitive to mechano-scale waves, in other words now the cell can react to touch.

In a sense that Ankyrin Repeat is allowing the cell to detect the coincident features of a mechanical scale wave (acoustic scale wave or sound vibration scale wave)

So any surface area could be part of a sensor, and if the sensor has different thresholds for activating different functions its a coincidence detector, the shape, topology, morphology, and physical configuration of the sensor determine what types of signals it is capable of responding to, and what types of signals it ignores, so the shape of the sensor can act as a learned memory, and this is why the learned receptor configuration on any cell in any organism is effectively a long term memory that exists to react or activate a function (a cell behavior) upon activation.

Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
