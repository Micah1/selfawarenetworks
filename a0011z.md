Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations

Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
add to the discussion of the granularity of consciousness citing Jon Lieff, M.D.'s work.

Note
The imagined focus of future biological research is about understanding the functions encoded in 3D protein structures, tracing connections between gene expressions, 3D receptors, cells, and multicellular structures to behaviors, diseases, and all manner of biological functions that can be identified.

Receptors have coincidence detection mechanisms inside the cell body.

each receptor is a sensor and the more of them that you affect the more the cells behavior changes, that is variable gradient coincidence detection or pattern detection
A soma bursting action potential event isn't necessary for Hebbian learning to take place.

The soma burst is just one type of threshold mechanism, receptors also have thresholds via four levels of conductance.

Most of the worlds biologists and neuroscientists do not realize what is perfectly obvious, which is that ordinary cells are capable of hebbian learning, receptors are sensors, as receptors can grow to represent a memory as a physical sensor configuration that is responsive to certain criteria

# Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.

All cells oscillate, they are dissipative systems, they have frequency patterns, they are functionally vortices.

Receptors enable a cell to detect patterns, the more receptors that are affected, the greater the cell's reaction, receptors have thresholds for activation, but cells can also detect when multiple receptors have been triggered via inner threshold mechanisms that span between receptors.

Sometimes Potassium channel receptors are bound by Ankyrin Repeats and that makes the receptor surface area larger so the cell becomes sensitive to mechano-scale waves, in other words now the cell can react to touch.

In a sense that Ankyrin Repeat is allowing the cell to detect the coincident features of a mechanical scale wave (acoustic scale wave or sound vibration scale wave)

So any surface area could be part of a sensor, and if the sensor has different thresholds for activating different functions its a coincidence detector, the shape, topology, morphology, and physical configuration of the sensor determine what types of signals it is capable of responding to, and what types of signals it ignores, so the shape of the sensor can act as a learned memory, and this is why the learned receptor configuration on any cell in any organism is effectively a long term memory that exists to react or activate a function (a cell behavior) upon activation.

Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md

# New theory of evolution
in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.

cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.

Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.

(note that since this does not contradict the existing theory of evolution it can be considered an amendment to the existing Theory of Evolution. Essentially it argues that organisms compute their future structure through hebbian learning at the receptor / neuro transmitter signalling (and potentially this can scale up to learning at the multi-cell assembling level, organ scale & whole organism level.)

Computationally computed biological structures are different from random mutation but both are governed by natural selection.

Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)

There is an interesting study called
# Neural Population Dynamics of Computing with Synaptic Modulations
"In this work, we analyze the dynamics of a network that relies solely on synaptic modulations to process short-time scale information, the multi-plasticity network (MPN)"
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497776v1

It's interesting because they are considering the dynamics of cellular communication in the human brain by creating a new type of artificial neural network called a multi-plasticity network (MPN) to explore the concept of short term synaptic plasticity. So the weights are not frozen after training but continue to be plastic, or dynamic, inspired by 'fast weights' in felxible learning, and unlike the HebbFF model they use multiplicative weights instead of additive modulation.
