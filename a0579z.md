(thalamus, cortex, neuron)

The meaning of spacetime and numbers is known only to the mind because it exists only in the context of movement, and the causes of movement, tempo-spatial patterns are tracked by billions of neurons from the hypothalamus to two interconnected mirroring grids in the neocortex, allowing a model of reality to be self aware while tracking all the causes of movement that include itself. There is no meaning outside the context of movement.
