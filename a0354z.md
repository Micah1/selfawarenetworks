opinions? this kind of goes with what i was getting at when discussing accounting for Q-state interactions alongside gamma bandwidth patterns of neural activity regarding consciousness

Micah Blumberg Consider this statement:
"Lanza says that we carry space and time around with us “like turtles with shells.” meaning that when the shell comes off (space and time), we still exist."

If space and time is a shell that a consciousness carries around, then why do people have gaps in their memories, why do people have black outs, why do people fall asleep and lose consciousness? If consciousness was independent of spacetime wouldn't it be conscious all the time even when the body was sleeping?

If you like the idea of a biological soul, I read this compelling book earlier this year or last year, its interesting http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Dust-The-Magic.../dp/0691156379
Soul Dust: The Magic of Consciousness
How is consciousness possible? What biological purpose does it serve? And why do we value it so…

I have also read "The man who mistook his wife for a coat rack" by Oliver Sacks, and "Incognito" by David Eagleman, and I have read numerous papers on split brain patients. The problem is that when a scalpel or a drug, or disease, or prolonged malnutrition, or extreme trauma can change your personality, change who you are, split you into two souls, one in the left hemisphere, one in the right hemisphere, well then it starts to look like the soul is not independent of spacetime.

In ancient times the atomists argued that everything was made out of atoms, not spirits, and the people who believed in spirits murdered the atomists to shut them up. but the collective cognitive trends that are trying to unite the atomic idea with the spiritual idea are forever trying to suppress and not think about certain contrary evidence, that can't be refuted, only ignored, buried, murdered, banished.

Micah Blumberg
I said before I don't believe people exist, rather there are cognitive trends doing this. Trying to capture new mindshare, like memes, like bugs taking over human brains.

thanks for your input, im going to check those out. i mean our bodies and even our brains are tools of our consciousness. without conscious perspective would the objects we associate with the physical reality still appear as they do, with consideration of the effects of an observer in quantum physics, or more so as just a network (considering all energy in the universe and varying densities across space time) of indistinct states of (overlapping?) superpositions of infinite possibilities? which really is what the universe/multiverse really is composed, and assuming such a quantum network existed and our spirits and awareness are resultant of quantum interactions occurring within microtubules in neural cells of the pituitary gland and temporal pituitary junction, with conscious information interpreted as vibrations and quantum interaction between the system of subatomic particles existing inside our neurons and those of the outside physical world as well as the bioelectrical, biochemical etc interactions, encoded as information

Chase
 i do not believe that it is completely independent of spacetime, more like symbiotic, maybe in those periods the consciousness/subconscious is simply not deriving experience from any outside physical stimuli, and any perspective that bases their reality on physical events will be less likely to take information from metaphysical experience, perhaps causing lack of awareness. or perhaps black outs etc are caused by the existing connection between brain body mind and soul, and so any trauma to the body causes trauma to the collective system possibly resulting in temporary loss of consciousness

1. On the observer effect. I don't think it means what some people think it means. It means that measuring quantum events interferes with quantum events. It does not mean people have souls. It does not mean consciousness has primacy over existence. It does mean the observer is creating spacetime.

2. Pineal glands are glands, they do what glands do, nothing else. The evidence that that the pineal gland has magical properties that imbue the brain with consciousness does not exist, even the idea that the pineal secretes dmt does not exist. The evidence that people claim exists for the Pineal Gland's magical properties also does not really exist. I tried to trace it down, to the hard research papers, it's not credible science. It's so awful when people I respect with brilliant minds fall for the whole story that the pineal gland is your third eye crap. If you just study more of the criticism of it, you can find on the web, you can rid yourself of this cognitive waste.

3. the realm of quantum physics can induce random electrical changes at the level of microtubules and synapses, but that's it, it's just random noise. It adds an element of chance, meaning more noise, that your synaptic activity must overcome to adapt and perceive. If the soul is communicating through random quantum fluctuations it's just interfering and being defeated by the brains systems on a regular basis.

I see the brain like a movie that is watching itself. It's a ten thousand frame per second movie, it picks up new frames from the outside world, and adds them to the frames it already has, it does this to plan movements, reactions, patterns that result in nutrient rewards, or neurotransmitter rewards, serving the mechanism of replication via natural selection.

Micah Blumberg
I don't think there is such a thing as quantum soul because I think the quantum realm is just random noise. It's not orderly sounds, it's not messages, it's not doing anything interesting, it's just what it is. So what we think is the soul is just this strange loop (Reference Douglas Hofstadler) of cognitive songs with many layers tempo-spatial expressions. The brain is more like a piano, the neurons more like piano keys.

i actually have more interest in the temporoparietal junction than than the pineal gland
i am also looking at this from a meta-quantum-physical perspective more so than just the physical network processes
i definately see your points though and they are valid, but it just makes sense for our brain to have evolved to incorporate the use of quantum phenomena as well as physical phenomena just as CS is evolving to incorporate the same principles in quantum computing. and our brain is by far more advanced than any computer

Micah Blumberg Have you seen this http://www.ted.com/.../aaron_o_connell_making_sense_of_a...

For me the important point is that quantum mechanics transcends and includes classical mechanics, the quantum physical sometimes behaves in a classical way, so the classical is a set inside the larger quantum set. Inside the larger set we know that everything in the cosmos is just the way it is because of everything else. We are literally defined by everything else.

I feel a cognitive trend, a voice, that wants to argue that meta-physics, or the beyond-physics, is an even larger set, it transcends both the classic and quantum, each of which are sets inside meta-physics.

I do like the idea of a symbiotic relationship between mass, energy and information, or between the chemical (classic physical), electrical (quantum physical), and knowledge (meta-physical). I think with the quantum perspective it seems like everything has a mutual causality. Within the classical perspective there are chains of cause and effect, chains of recognition and transmission, chains of consideration and reaction, chains of criterial deliberation and movement. Within a metaphysical perspective I think it looks like information patterns are driving biology, and that is a cool idea, but perhaps metaphysics is only driving cognition to serve thermodynamics, which is perhaps a larger physical set inside another metaphysical set.

There are those who argue that you can't have anything beyond the physical and that even information is physical, it must be, because it can only be expressed, known, seen, and communicated physically. Information does not have mass, energy, or velocity, it's a structure that sort of exists in time, and sort of outside time, like a sequence, like a causal link, or a temporal association. It isn't a pattern you can touch physically. Yet I think it information is physical in the sense that it is connective, it has distinctions, it is the causal relationships between other physical things. Anyway I think this is sort of far out speculation for me, so I trend onward. What do you think?

^beautifully written, i agree , i sort of see information as quasi-physical. our thoughts alter the physical world despite not necessarily being physical themselves. however there is also the side to the information that considers the correlations between various bandwidths of brainwave patterns and neuro electrochemical interactions

Chase
set mathematics are crucial to understanding this, for everything exists in a set, some overlap, there are subsets of sets and sub-subsets of information

Chase
for example, describing an apple falls into as many sets as are consciously assigned to said object, there could be a set; the apple is red, and a subset of that the apple is red because of light being absorbed, reflected, and interpreted by ....

correlations, relationships, assimilation*

trivia: set theory is a set inside category theory

Chase
well category theory formalizes the concepts of set theory as well as other mathematical abstractions

Chase
categories of sets etc
