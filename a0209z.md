Humans are metal robots in a valid sense.
Mankind via neuroscience, computational biology, computational neuroscience and deep learning neural networks has been and is now awakening to the overwhelming evidence that we are all mechanical robots.
Written by Micah Blumberg, Journalist, Researcher, Neurohacker at http://VRMA.io

Abstract: Your cells contain aqueous cations filled with metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, ie charged ions, that allow your nerve cells to generate and respond to both voltage and electromagnetic waves. Increasingly deep learning neural networks are starting to create patterns, like artificial grid cells, that are surprising researchers with their functional similarities to how the brain is thought to work. Conclusion: if one sits with this research long enough the natural conclusion is that humans are metal robots.

Point 1: Your cells are filled with a metals (in a liquid solution), ie ions, positively charged sodium ions Na+ and negatively charged potassium K+ ions and also calcium Ca++. These metals allow your cells to response to and generate not only voltage but also electromagnetism, example: brainwaves. Life, meaning biology, is computing the mind, and generating models of the world, to coordinate movement.

The self aware neural network of your brain is predicting future video frames, future audio signals, predicting what you might touch, taste, smell, and these predictions resemble the patterns of the original incoming sensory signals.

What you are seeing right now is a video feed, in your brain, but I believe that it’s actual video, that your mind’s neural network is simulating the same kind of signal processing that humans use for actual video, except that in addition to creating video your mind is also learning from the video stream that it is producing. This idea is based on an understanding of how a neural network can emulate a signal processor. Note that I didn’t say anything about how the video would be distributed or assembled in the brain. I’m not suggesting a frame by frame video signal but rather a volumetric 3D video, like a hologram, but one in which any point can change at anytime independent of the concept of a video frame.

Point 2: See this paper: “A neural network trained to predict future video frames mimics critical properties of biological neuronal responses and perception”

Abstract: “While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition, neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can enrich both fields.”

The metal ions in your cells separate over time in part as a result of proteins moving in response to external stimulous, an example would be proteins in your ganglia neurons flipping because they are being hit with photons in your eye, separation of ions occurs in part because of the exchange of ions via neurotransmitters transmitted between cells via synapses, separation occurs in part because of reactions to electro-magnetic brainwaves which may increase or decrease the electrical potential of a given location in the brain, changing the threshold for when a cell or dendrite may fire. When the positive and negative charges separate to a significant amount an action potential is triggered, either in the dendrite, or along the axon. Positive and negative ions are sent between cells, as neurotransmitters, changing the thresholds at which cells further down the line may fire. In addition, the synapses have a variety of other threshold mechanisms, and can for example become configured to only fire when certain conditions are met, such as when two or more signals (signals representing cells that fired their action potential) beneath them in a hierarchy are triggered within a configurable amount of time such as three miliseconds or two miliseconds, or one milisecond. The dynamics of cell firing and neural circuit firing is a much deeper topic than I haven’t even touched the surface of everything involved.

This book by Peter Tse dives deep into how the neurons are coincidence detectors and how they may process signals.

Point 3: The brain is digital, its not analog, it processes discreet information like a computer. A recent paper changes the dominant paradigm of neuroscience for at least the past 50 years.
See this paper: “Is Information in the Brain Represented in Continuous or Discrete Form?”
“James Tee, Desmond P. Taylor

“(Submitted on 4 May 2018)

“The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the brain is a fundamental yet unresolved physiological question. Historically, most analyses assume a continuous representation without considering the alternative possibility of a discrete representation. Our work explores the plausibility of both representations, and answers the question from a communications engineering perspective. Drawing on the well-established Shannon’s communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in a discrete form. Using a computer simulation, we show that information cannot be communicated reliably between neurons using a continuous representation, due to the presence of noise; neural information has to be in a discrete form. In addition, we designed 3 (human) behavioral experiments on probability estimation and analyzed the data using a novel discrete (quantized) model of probability. Under a discrete model of probability, two distinct probabilities (say, 0.57 and 0.58) are treated indifferently. We found that data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. Furthermore, we re-analyzed the data from a published (human) behavioral study on intertemporal choice using a novel discrete (quantized) model of intertemporal choice. Under such a model, two distinct time delays (say, 16 days and 17 days) are treated indifferently. We found corroborating results, showing that data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. In summary, all results reported here support our discrete hypothesis of information representation in the brain, which signifies a major demarcation from the current understanding of the brain’s physiology.”

Point 5: Neural Networks in the Neo Cortex may also mimic grid cells for spatial reasoning

Last winter Jeff Hawkins revealed new research which suggests that columns in the neocortex basically mimic grid cells, but to identify every object in our environment including it’s features, it’s physical properties, including it’s present orientation in space relative to everything else. A single column of neurons is capable of modeling at least millions of patterns.

Choices may also be made at the cellular level, an idea expounded upon in Peter Tse’s book the Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation (linked earlier in the article). I think it’s possible that every cell is making a choice in a sense, it’s firing threshold may represent the information it must collect in order to make a decison, and it may be involved in setting the choice settings (or firing thresholds) for other cells above and below its place in the hierarchy of the cortex.

In closing: Consider the Dendrite as an advanced data structure, and consider that dendritic computation may have vast temporal and spatial memory capabilities for setting, presetting, and holding decision making information criteria based on a vast capability to respond in very complex ways to incoming signals by making very tiny changes to its structure, including changes to the hairs on the dendrite, that have a consequence of changing the ionic properties of the dendrite, with the ability to create it’s own action potentials that can accumulate in cell firings at the axon level. Dendritic computation may be the key to the function of neural circuits. An idea I touched on in the Neural Lace Podcast a few times. Briefly in Episode 2 and to a greater extent in Episode 4

Humans are metal robots in a valid sense. Imagine that its like the tv show Westworld except every human is also a robot. This is partly why one day we can have AR VR plug directly into our brains (wirelessly) skipping the headset. (Like Sword Art Online or The Matrix)

Addressing criticism for my “Humans are metal robots in a valid sense” story:

Addressing criticism for my “Humans are metal robots in a valid sense” story:
I made no claim that an electronic transistor experiences sensations. Going back to Peter Tse, neurons are coincidence detectors. Neurons detect information as coincidence patterns. The bit of the mind is a coincidence.

A bit of information is the basic unit of data https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit

The neural network builds concepts like an artificial neural network but one that is more evolved (by the age of life on this planet.) Perception is a rendered concept. Rendered by the brain to other parts of the brain in a fractal of feedback loops. This part is a reference to deepdream https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream

I understand that neurotransmitters flow between chemical synapses. I am arguing that they cause a change in the placement of charged ions which affects when and where neurons will fire.

Note: Calcium, potassium, and sodium ions are metals regardless of whether they are dissolved in aqueous cations. Look at a periodic table to see for yourself.

Note: I never said it was as simple as a neuron firing or not firing. I said coincidence detection was the basis of a bit, but there is a lot of computation that can happen below the threshold of a neuron firing.

Note: See the article I linked in the original article I referenced where they show how the brain processes information in discreet steps. Relevant to a comment someone made that [time isn’t digital in the brain]. Someone said [Sampling frequency will change the bit-stream] I agree: Exhibit psychedelic medication research and deep-dream.

I didn’t say a neural firing was equal to 1 bit exactly. I said that coincidence detection serves as the basis of a bit. Thats different. I agree with the idea that neural firing could be more or less than 1 bit. Its not a simple summation to 1 bit like they teach in Intro to Computational Neuroscience.

Note: A bitcoin is the basis of a bitcoin but that doesn’t mean all transactions will be in amounts of 1 bitcoin or greater. Folks can trade in amounts like .00034 bitcoin if they want. Also note that there are sub-threshold events that could count as coincidence detection (events that do not cause a neuron to fire). An example might be when a action potential is triggered in the dendrite (that might backpropogate) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_backpropagation

Note: I am not suggesting that a bitcoin is equal to a bit, and I certainly didn’t say that it was. Whether a particular neuron firing at a particular time represents 1 bit, or 1000 bits, .0005 bits my statement that coincidence detection can serve as the basis of a unit of information in the brain is valid.

Note: My central thesis isn’t that the brain is digital. The fact that the brain is discrete verses continuous is a subtopic established by a paper that I linked in the original article.

This address came about because of a post on social media where I said:

“I say that there is nothing that we can teach people that machines cannot also learn. You may ask why do I think machines can learn everything that humanity holds dear including feelings and art? It’s simple really, all knowledge, feelings, emotions, insights and intuitions can be broken down into tempo-spatial patterns that can processed by a brain and thus by a computer.”

Someone said [Machines can also be spoofed easily, as Microsoft’s Tai debacle showed, which is fairly easy to do when large groups of outsiders hack a system. AI can learn fast, but teams much faster and in unexpected ways.]

I replied “that’s a true statement but the fast pace of AI development will soon lead to machines that are much harder to trick or spoof. In less than two decades and maybe sooner it will be easier to fool a community of the smartest humans than it will be to spoof the best AI.”

I was also asked if I was a Functionalist I said

“I’m not a Functionalist exactly but close. The state of knowledge is going be directly related to its function. The parameters of the frequency and spatial mapping of information in a mind are going to effect the functionality of it, and that includes the internal functions of internal representations.”

and

“the difference is that I believe that a certain class of substrate is required to achieve a certain kind of mind, like the human mind, but that class of substrate could be made out of different materials, so I’m not believing that the functionality of the human mind can be achieved without a certain class of substrate that accomplishes certain objectives.”

Someone mention a Max Tegmark paper from 2014 https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1219 and I replied

“I know that paper, I call it special sauce theory, and I side with folks like Jeff Hawkins who think there is no special sauce, no magical “emergence” phenomena (like gas turning to water) ha. Nothing special that hasn’t been detected already. Maybe later on this author will point to electromagnetism in the brain and then say there it is but I think the problem is that information doesn’t have any meaning in it without a decoder to decode that information, otherwise it’s just a bumps on a record player.”

Someone asked if I would try to reduce life to its components such as ones and zeros or particles.

I replied “whether life can be described with one’s and zeros or with particles is just one view point out of many, that one view point would not be the whole story of life, just a small part of the story”

and

“I think from a valid point of view feelings are just patterns in space and time, the pattern could be analyzed and someday replicated in a machine that attempts to mimick the functions of biology. At the same time, I think I can appreciate that some people don’t need those extra details, and the feelings alone are what matters to them.”

In short I believe that if you combine a digital signal processor with a deep learning neural network, a three dimensional point cloud and a fractal of feedback loops you get the human mind or a self aware network.


My central thesis^
I would say that I think there are still some things that people do not know about the brain, but we know a lot more about the brain than most people think. People perceive things differently, emotions don’t follow logical patterns, but they are patterns like sunrises and sunsets, some with highs and lows, beginnings and ends, feelings that have strange shapes in space and time.
