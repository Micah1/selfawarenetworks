(criteria causation, emotion, neuron)
I think there should be some reasonable disassociation between a dna pattern and what  "neural circuits" actually do. It may be very far fetched to blame behavior on genetics when probably behavior is information driven.

Some want to pin down behavior differences on genetics. I think its possible that malformed proteins, and mutations that result from metabolic syndrome could causes diseases and abnormal behaviors. I don't think we are strictly determined by genetic makeup but I suspect some people who haven't heard of criterial causation may believe so. If you can imagine each neuron is collecting information via very specific electrical patterns, and that neurons are working together to do this, so that they are exciting and or inhibiting each other in order to get the pattern right. Then its possible to imagine that these cells are making selections based on information, what they call criterial causation, a kind of biological choice making process that is not determined by genetics http://www.amazon.com/The-Neural-Basis-Free-Will/dp/0262019108

It seems like there is some evidence for a genetic 'likelihood of behavior' I have wondered about the nature of long term memories, that result in new protein structures, structures that define a mental reflex, proteins that can be transmitted from person to person, most likely from mother to child, blood transfusions, or other fluid exchanges. I say this because I like to imagine that the characteristics of a personality may sometimes extend outwards into many people. As if the Maria personality has many bodies but each of them think they are the one Maria, some of them only have pieces of her. We also transmit information, ideas and notions, stories that can effect us emotionally and form long term memories, new proteins that change the structure of our cells, that change the criteria for when neurons fire. I think it might be good 

I will come out in support of the hypothesis that behavior is caused primarily by information?

Here is why: We all know that there is a long history of smartly dressed people saying behavior is driven by complex interactions between genetics and the ecosystem, and other factors, but why not information primarily?

Imagine ideas, notions, stories, beliefs driving the vast majority of behavior far more than genetics or environment.

Imagine that even if the entire earth is your environment, you still have a galaxy's worth of complexity in your brain. So the environment is too simple to define your behavior.

Imagine you have millions of lines of genetic code, but quadrillions of unique connections and directions in your mind. So your genetics are too simple to define your behavior, let alone all the connections your brain makes.

Imagine that the environment + genetics could never be enough to explain behavior and that the big idea missing here is that information drives behavior!

David I do think temperments can be passed in families. For a long term memory to form a cell must make a new protein, this protein inevitably alters the sum physical shape of that cell, changing its electrical firing criteria, there is no reason that this new protein cannot be passed to others through fluid exchanges, blood transfusions, from mother to child, causing the long term memory to take hold in a new mind, like a copied mental reflex. This kind of transferred physical memory or predisposition might effect a dog more than a human because of the size and complexity of the human brain. That idea of genetic predisposition or transferred mental reflexes between family members may not be something that can be ignored. I still support the hypotheses that in humans at least information primarly drives behavior. Perhaps also in dogs I don't know.
