I like contraints. One contraint could be how do we address this with artificial sentient labor? So send the robots out to plant trees, new coral, and to grow clones of endangered species and then incubate their growth, multiplication, and facility their return to environments. This could be done, but also species evolution would stop because process of natural selection, in which new mutations that are more adapted to the changing environment might result in new species, or in more intelligent species. Preventing animals from dying off could stop the evolution of life effectively.

It's also like what happens when we remove all the predators, that eat other animals? Well the ecosystem goes out of balance, too many grazing animals eat all the food, then all the animals starve, and a forest turns into a desert. With Mass Artificial Sentient Labor forces we could in theory clean all the oceans, all the land environments, capture all the carbon, all the methane, and preserve the status quo of life on earth so nothing ever changes. Imagine however that on other planets life does continue to evolve far beyond life on earth. Then life on earth might just food for more evolved life from other planets. On the other hand
