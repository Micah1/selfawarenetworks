v particles timeline past future
Sure yes it's possible. What's even easier then that however is becoming ok with whatever was in that memory. Sometimes deconstructing works, also disassociation works. Either path is about changing the internal metaphor, reshaping it in your mind, separating it from your idea of self, who it belongs to, who was there, what it means, how you feel about it, those things can be changed when you play with it in your mind, like distorting an image in photo shop, making it big or small, shrinking it, stretching it, adding different colors, different meanings, making the voices cartoonish if there were voices. You can say it's just a memory it's not your memory, or the meaning can have some other significance, or you can say it's really all waves of atomic vibration, or all data, and realize you can be ok with waves, you can be ok with vibration, you can be ok with atoms or all data. You can say that what you think it means is a lie, or you can imagine that you have gone back into the past and changed it, created an alternate timeline. Actually this is isn't impossible either. New experiments with quantum entanglement have shown that particles that are going to be entangled in the future will get entangled in the past, in anticipation of their future entanglement. It's as if we now have proof that the future can alter the past, but of course no one is talking about that, it's one of those oddities that people are silent about, because we are all waiting for more information.
