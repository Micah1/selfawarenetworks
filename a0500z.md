(cerebral, cortex)

When you have an experience, that is actually a sequence of sensory moments linked together in time. Each of those sensory moments is correlated in the brain by a group of cells that fire together. If they fire together with some novel frequency they begin to associate with one another, so that when you have a slightly different experience, that is vaguely similar to the experience you had previously a different group of cells fires that may include one of the cells from the other previous group of cells the fired, because one member of the original group of cells fired, it's associated partner cells shift into a ready state, they are now expecting to fire. This is the basis of memory-prediction in the brain. Now it might be that when you have a thought, you are having somewhere between 100 thousand and 100 million memory predictions being triggered in close temporal and spacial proximity. However despite these large complex numbers, the essential mechanism of memory-prediction is the same. Your memory-predictions are your expectations, your beliefs, your bets, your suspicions, and your every thought about everything. The cerebral cortex is a modeling system, the models are predictions, we predict what is there, self awareness is a prediction about the modeling system that is making predictions. Your cortex has a model of the body, and behaviors associated with the cortex, that model is "you" you are a prediction, in the brain tissue. I mean your at least a prediction in the brain tissue, but not only a prediction in the brain tissue
So in an absolute sense you are really seeing you, but that is because brain tissue has created a model of itself, and it's surroundings, in order to coordinate movement.

do you use gps?, Global Positioning Satellite data on your phone or computer, part of your map software? that's pretty cool right? my grandfather led the team that invented that and put the first gps satellites into space, want to know who paid to create this cool gps on your phone? the military paid for it. they also paid for tons of medical research that now saves lives around the world, they have invested big in research that has paid on in revolutionary new technology that helps disabled people walk again, or pick up things again, that's not cool to you because the military paid for it? or is it not cool because tax payers funds went to those projects because of military interests?
