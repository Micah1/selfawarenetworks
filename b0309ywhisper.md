Title: Neurons Stimulation Electrodes

Transcribed with OpenAI's Whisper

The world that the human body cannot, and also kind of explores the idea in a natural way with the Navi who can exchange electrochemical information with one another and achieve a certain connectivity as a group to maintain the balance in the environment.

That's almost an example of a science fiction film where it shows the positive aspect of having a certain kind of neural link.

I'm optimistic about that idea. I'd like to say that I am sometimes, I'll read a book, a current book that I'm getting through, for example, is Rhythms of the Brain.

Also, I'm alternating that with Networks of the Brain by Orlov Sporns.

I'm reading it on a Kindle and I've got the audio going, but it's like every 10 minutes I get distracted by something.

If I could have a neural link that would sort of predict when I'm about to get distracted and pull me back in and help me to focus on the book,

basically by creating a stimulation that countered that distraction before I became aware of it.

I'm sure the neural activity of the distraction is happening before I become conscious of it.

The machine would notice before.

I've had dreams where I realize that when the dream has gone really well, it's because my mind somehow wants me to stay asleep.

When the dream starts to go really bad, it's like my mind wants me to wake up.

If the neural link could watch those dreams, it could figure out strategies to keep me focused or to pull me out of being focused.

Hey, I just wanted to mention, oh, and he just left again.

When we were talking about neurochemistry earlier, I had pinged someone who was quite knowledgeable,

but I see that they kind of popped in and left.

Sorry.

Who was it?

Ramsey.

Oh, no, he's on stage.

Oh, there you are. Sorry.

I'm not looking at the, I only like glanced at it.

I'm sorry. See, there's those cognitive difficulties again.

Let me talk.

Just what about neurochemistry?

We've talked about...

Well, there was an idea that biochemistry could change and how it's going to influence the exchange of information and everything.

And personally, to me, there's a lot of hype about the neural link, but I really don't think that it's very far.

And that maybe in the future, you'll be able to download, maybe 4 gigabytes, maybe now we can download what someone can clear this to me.

Right now it's just reading data, right? Just like signal, you can see where what's happening, we can see positioning, stuff, things.

We can surely influence certain parts of the brain.

The problem is that how the question, I think, was how the biochemistry would react to the outer stimulus.

The device was built with the intention of being capable of doing closed-loop therapy.

So that means also stimulating your brain and watching to study what the stimulation is doing.

I think stimulation, before it's truly effective, is going to be quite a bit longer.

There's been so much research on reading neural activity, so that's come a long way already.

They're kind of on the shoulders of giants, as far as that's concerned.

And all of these old tech has been using 100 or 200 channels to do it.

And so now they just engineered this amazing thing that can just implant tons and tons of probes.

So basically it's like, okay, now that we can increase the numbers, what can the existing tech kind of give us already?

And their accomplishment, I think the things that get most typed are the things that are least impressive,

but the things that get least typed are actually pretty impressive.

So they're actually putting all 2048 channels, they're communicating it through Bluetooth, which is pretty cool.

Bluetooth can't handle that, or at least I think it's Bluetooth 2.0 can't handle that amount of information,

but they're binning the spikes into, I don't know, like five millisecond bins, so that way it can come close to handle it.

So that's never been done before in science, and that's pretty cool.

But yeah, I think stimulating is still quite a while away.

I mean, if they're going to mass distribute this product, they're just going to tell everyone in the world,

but you can't use the stimulating part of this product and everyone's just going to obey them.

Well, the thing with stimulating is you can stimulate a contact, but when you're reading an electrical signal,

the loudest part of the cell is the axon hillock.

It has the most multitagated channels, and so that's like sending out most of the kind of signal that it's picking up.

The problem is if you start stimulating an area, you're not just near a cell body or an axon hillock,

you're near hundreds of axons, and those axons are coming from cells from very near to extremely far away.

So you stimulate one contact, you're not just going to stimulate one cell or five cells around it, or 10 cells around it.

You're going to be stimulating 18 cells around it, 10 cells on the left, 15 cells on the right,

two cells a mile away basically, and you don't have any control when you start stimulating using electrodes.

This is similar to pharmacological manipulation. It's a real blunt instrument.

Absolutely, yeah, that's what I'm saying, and it's even more random because with pharmacology, the drug kind of goes everywhere evenly.

In this regard, we're probably much further along on the pharmacological end than we are from, say, something like the utare.

Obviously, we can do a lot of utare, which one thing I don't think people are pointing out enough is that what it seems that Neuralink has been able to do

is things like neural prosthetic manipulation like we saw with the chimp recently playing pong,

but it's hopefully not having the same types of deleterious effects that the utare has.

For people that aren't familiar, we usually plug the utare, people that are missing limbs,

and say like a quadriplegic able to operate a prosthetic limb.

I've seen videos of monkeys feeding themselves using this, and that's kind of the more impressive thing,

because the utare is this huge machine, you can't just walk around with it,

and that's one of the advancements that I'm seeing with Neuralink that's extraordinarily impressive.

Not the actual Neural Positically Glace, but the fact that it's so small.

Yes, the utare, for the unknown, is also called the Black Rock Array, or I was calling it the BrainGate device earlier,

and that's just a 10 by 10 contacts, the electrodes, I believe, are 400 microns, so like pretty thick,

but they're FDA approved, and that's where a lot of the energy went for those in like the mid-2000s,

so this is like almost 20 year old device, but it can be used in humans, already approved,

and it's effective at reading out signals, and then tons and tons of research have gone into the decoder,

which has made it more effective.

Put one or two implants in, and it's pretty effective, like locked in patients can now control a cursor,

and sort of surf the web.

Well, the real challenge with the Utah Arrays of Material Science is because it almost certainly causes some damage to the brain,

the more you use it.

Oh, absolutely, absolutely, yeah.

Not as, well, it depends, so like I have a bunch of lab, or I guess cohort mates that are in different monkey labs that use it,

and sometimes they work great into like year six or seven or eight,

but yeah, there's always going to be sort of glial scarring and just all the sort of body reactions that occur due to that.

I don't know how thick the neurolink ones are, maybe 25 microns or so, which is pretty thin compared to 400 microns,

and then I think they're using like some sort of, I don't know, they're using interesting technology lasers or something

to sort of combat the typical immune responses, I don't know what they are.

So, what you said about stimulating many different neurons and not having any control over it, and it being a very blunt instrument,

I was just reading the section of the book, Rhythms of the Brain, where they were talking about how,

if the brain had only excitatory neurons, or basically if there was no inhibition, then it would just like excite itself, you know,

endlessly until it became exhausted, and so the way that the brain is able to sort of orchestrate its rhythms,

and basically to have cycles of activity that are not out of control is through the process of inhibition,

and that involves a lot of interneurons, and this is stuff that I'm sort of just learning about,

but it's like there's this interneuron inhibitory system that is helping to sort of regulate brain activity,

so you're not just going into an epileptic seizure every time one part of you gets excited,

you have this sort of controlled sequence, and it's really complex, and I'm probably messing up the description of it,

so I'm just like imagining that if the electrodes in their link really meant that you are creating a lot of excitement in the brain

in a lot of different areas simultaneously, I think that wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control,

but it might change the oscillation frequency of your brain rhythms,

which would be interesting, but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that,

and just ask you if you really know if it's not possible for a neural link specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation

to where you're just stimulating one neuron at a time, because it seems like that ought to be a feature,

and it'd just be a shame if it's actually not.

Okay, so that's kind of two different points you made, not necessarily related,

so yeah, if you over-stimulate the brain, the 20% of neurons that exist are interneurons,

so interneurons are inhibitory, they express GABA, they kind of put the brakes on of excitement,

and so yes, if you over-stimulate an area, you're probably also going to stimulate some of those inhibitory interneurons,

and they're going to over put the brakes on, which is going to even it out.

It's something called EI Excitatory Inhibitory Balance, that's talked about so much in neuroscience papers now.

And so when you say the brain out of control, that's called epilepsy when it's over-excited,

that's not what I meant by lack of control, what I meant by lack of control was lack of spatial control,

so you may want to activate a neuron in the location of space that correlates with the left middle finger,

so that way the person can feel like somebody touched their left middle finger.

However, if you put a very small stimulation there, I think people, I read Papers 80 microvolts,

I think stimulation, which is called the micro-stimulation, you put it in that very small area,

and these are tungsten probes, so usually there's probes that are either good for reading or good for stimulating,

and then when you start getting into probes that can do both, you're going to lose a lot there too.

But anyway, so if you start stimulating in that area, let's say you stimulate,

and what gets activated isn't the cells in that area, what gets activated is the axon of some cell way far away

that was maybe going from the medial forebrain bundle to like an acetylcholine cell,

which is like an arousal, basically something that's completely non-related,

but because it had an axon of passage kind of going through that area, and that's what you stimulated,

kind of getting the result you didn't want in terms of spatial control, that's what I meant by you don't have that,

and because any area has more axons going through it than it has cell bodies,

you're just literally activating, instead of activating the one cell body that you wanted,

you're activating 200 random neurons at random distances away,

and if the probes didn't move around in the brain, then you could just say, okay, it activates 200,

and we figured out when that helps and when it doesn't we use machine learning, and that's fine,

but because it moves kind of was around in the brain, you can't even make use of it,

because the next time it's activating another random set of 200 neurons, or you turn it down,

so it's activating a random set of 20 neurons, but because it's constantly moving around,

you're not getting the same effect, whereas if you were recording, and even if it's constantly moving around,

you're basically recording from either the same cell or the cell right next to it,

so you can get more data out of it that way.

The stimulation problem, I think it needs a new solution, I don't think the solution is going to be with electrical,

but people use electrical stimulation and they have effects for certain things,

I know the idea where Neuralink wants to go and they want to go into some sort of very precise artificial perception thing,

and that's going to require the kind of stuff I'm talking about where you have really precise control,

but if you just want to sort of stimulate in a really rough sense,

as everyone heard of, I lost the name, anyways, if you look at the old stimulation research,

people have reported when you stimulate the hand area, it feels kind of like,

it doesn't feel like somebody touched your hand, it feels like sort of like a buzz or something.

So that's the level of sensory input that you're going to get from just broad electrical stimulation.

So Scott, is it sort of true also in a way, in a very sort of layman's way,

that if you're using the sensors that are more developed, and I'm talking about the electrodes here to sense,

it's the machine system that's doing the bulk of the learning,

because if you're stimulating, if you're reversing that stimulating,

even if you, to some degree, reduce that sort of oversensing or overloading of particular areas,

that it's almost the reverse in a big way, that it's actually the human brain,

it's got to do the rewiring around these new stimuli,

there's even a different biological problem there, is that true or am I just talking out my ass?

No, that's true, but I think it's also true that the brain's always doing learning,

so even if it's reading a signal, your brain is plastic enough to sort of help it fire,

it will become plastic if the decoder was really crappy and it couldn't adjust to how fast you learned,

your brain would just learn to do what the decoder does.

So even a static decoder, like the old 15-year-old decoder,

if you left it in there long enough, your brain would just figure out how to control it too.

I think it's more like learning how to play a difficult instrument or something,

it would learn how to do that, but with the new decoders, it's learning you too,

it's learning your brain as well.

As far as for stimulation, all I meant to say was that the machine learning part

I think will be harder because there's a bigger effect of the electrode moving around in your brain,

so it's not affecting the same thing over and over, so the machine learning part can't really learn that well.

Does that make sense?

It does, it does. We've got quite a few new people in the room, I sort of almost have the sense that

some other rooms end and people have come in because we've got a little bit of an influx.

Welcome, there's a bunch of people that I've shared rooms with before.

This is sort of a general chat room on the question, would you plug your brain into Neuralink?

And I guess at what point you might do that and what ethical and other concerns you might have,

we started to get into some detail, thankfully we've got some people in the room who have some expertise in the area

and no, we've got some other people on stage down the bottom who also do.

We've probably heard some opinions from everyone to about the two-third mark.

We haven't really been going through in PTR order, so if anyone, especially towards the lower end,

who's joined the room, wants to ask any questions, make any comment or just state whether they,

what their level of, where they put themselves in the queue for signing up for Neuralink,

please feel free to just have a chat, that's what this room is about.

It's really evidence gathering for a room that we're going to be running next Monday.

Thanks, I'm David and I'm going to hand back to the people on the stage.

I have a question. This is related to cybersecurity.

I'm not aware of any devices that can't be hacked right now.

If it was controlled by a phone or some other device or plugged into charge,

most of those devices that exist on the Earth today can be hacked.

Is that a concern? And I'll leave that back to somebody that might be able to answer that.

It probably should be. The only descriptions I've heard connecting your brain to what,

from A to B, B is almost certainly going to be something like your iPhone.

And the medium would be something like a Bluetooth connection,

which if you don't want to think about cybersecurity,

you know that all you need to do to hack Bluetooth is proximity. So yes.

Right. And there's plenty of backdoors to every single cell phone that's out there.

So that would be a high concern. So I would say no right now.

I agree. And just a quick comment. Having things stick out of your body is a huge problem for the immune system.

So this only is really going to work if there is something wireless.

So that way something is inside the body communicating wirelessly to something outside the body.

If there's any tech that does that in a safe way, then maybe that is feasible.

What about the risk of cancer?

I'm not sure.

If you're concerned about, specifically what health concerns,

what Neuralink could do is sort of to question mark what Utah array is not a question mark.

So if you just look up something like foreign body response to Utah array,

there's a lot out there with regards to the problems they're having.

But I think I've already said this, but one of the things people are underappreciating about Neuralink is that they're working to overcome this.

Does anybody know if it's done anything to help cure paralysis of individuals yet and how far along they are with that?

Well, that's the stated aim, Bridget, is initially that it is to deal with neurological and physical conditions,

especially things like paraplegia and quadriplegia, but also some other conditions.

And it is stated very clearly in Neuralink's aims that once they develop technologies to assist people who have various conditions that could be assisted,

that they would move into applications where it was for able-bodied and otherwise able people to be augmented.

So they haven't drawn the line at only medical support, but the early ambition of Neuralink is in terms of helping exactly the sort of people that you describe.

And I just want to say, if I may, two really great points were just made. One is that you can look at other devices,

you can read about DBS and look at the risks that patients are dealing with in terms of if you want to know how much DBS has caused cancer.

I'm sure there's been a ton of documentation of that.

Those are areas where you can research, whereas those answers may not exist yet for Neuralink.

They would exist for other brain implants.

And I forgot the second part, but I'll go ahead and pause.

Is DBS graphene? Is that graphene fiber?

No, so deep brain stimulation is not graphene-based yet. It ought to be, because I've heard that graphene is going to prevent your immune system from attacking

if you build the brain implant out of graphene, but it's not being used that way yet, as far as I know.

What about evolution? How do you all see human beings evolving as a result of this technology?

Evolution itself is too slow. You might be thinking of something like neuroplasticity.

Someone said, I think Scott said earlier something about neuroplasticity, but specifically when Elon was asked about this on the Black Spreedman podcast,

he spelled out that they're relying more on the machine side and much less on the neuroplastic side. With respect to making these connections,

he doesn't think that we can rely much on neuroplasticity.

I think the evolution question was supposed to be on a longer time scale.

Yes, thank you. The readout is perfected, the writeout is perfected, so maybe we're not even using electrodes anymore.

Maybe we're using hydrogels with cell-type specificity, some sort of living electrode.

Now that's perfected, so now you have complete input and output. Basically, you could hook up to the AR and have all the sensation or something like that.

How do we start to evolve once we have an extra layer that's directly wired? That's so speculative, I would not want to comment.

I can comment on that. The initial use cases, because they've been emulating with a monkey video, they've been doing what BrainGate did,

in which the initial uses would be to help people to overcome paralysis. That was the second thing that I was thinking about.

Using this device to help people overcome paralysis seems like one of the first things that they want to do so that they can win with investors

and create a product that's going to, basically, so even if the product, if you look at DBS and you look at the Utah Array

and you look at all the health conditions that people who have accepted these devices are dealing with as a result of those implants,

well, the thing is, it'll be like a trade-off. If a person is paralyzed and they know that they can have so much more increased brain function,

then they may want to sign off on some acceptable amount of risk for cancer and other surgical risks as a trade-off,

whereas people who don't need this at all may want to wait until this is really perfected to an ex-level extent.

As far as human evolution, what I wanted to say was that I'm really starting to dive a lot deeper into laser doppler

and I guess when I didn't understand about open water, Mary Lou Jefferson's technology, openwater.cc,

is that it's not just F-nears, it's also a laser-based system.

So what I'm seeing is people are talking about using laser endopler or laser F-nears

because you can combine it with holography and you're basically using really big camera sensors and you're capturing images of the brain

so fast that you're able to basically image the brain as fast as EEG or faster.

That's kind of what we're talking about. If you're going to do holography, then you do want to have the best quality images

with really huge camera sensors and you want to be doing it almost faster than EEG.

And then for stimulation, they're combining that with ultrasound, so I see no chance that within 20 years

anyone's going to be getting brain surgery anymore because we're going to have devices that are cheap and affordable and external

and there'll be laser-based holography with ultrasound and you'll have this wearable that'll do everything the neural link could do

in terms of reading and ultra-precise, basically ultrasound-based stimulation of very precise areas of your brain

to read and write to your brain, like it's a hard drive but without any surgery in a very precise way.

That's for me, in under 20 years, it's not possible that we'll not have this by then.

So what's the cool stuff that we're going to have because of that? Is that the question?

I mean that just replaces neural link completely because it gives you all the functionality that neural link has and promises to have

but basically in a completely wireless system that you can just wear in your head.

Maybe you could delve a little bit deeper into the right part, so certainly we've used a lot of neuroimaging techniques

including EEG, fMRI, ECOG, electrochoreography and things like that, successfully,

but when you say right, so we haven't ever, at least in the way that I understand right, we haven't done that successfully at all with any sort of technology.

So it's maybe an open question of whether that is at all feasible. So can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by right?

Yeah, so every time you're going to do a brain scan, you're going to get like a perfect scan of a person's brain

if you've got exactly where everything is and you're going to be able to dial down to stimulating individual neurons

or making more, you know, you can do like, you'll be able to do like basically, it'll be like, you know,

the point of stimulating individual neurons will be to stimulate neural circuits I think

and also to, you know, so you get neural circuits going, but then also you can manipulate the oscillatory cycles in local and macro ways

in terms of like local microcircuits, but also you can manipulate the brain's oscillatory activity on a larger scale

by targeting inhibitory circuits and sort of, you know, basically the inhibitory and excitatory system

and, you know, you can, you'll be able to target the brainstem, the thalamus,

like there's a whole bunch of, you know, things that we still need to discover about what areas to stimulate

and why we want to stimulate those areas, but we'll be able to make huge leaves forward

in the next 20 years in terms of understanding where and what we want to stimulate

and we'll have the precision to stimulate basically anything, so that's those are my thoughts.

In terms of the long-term evolution question that Olivia was asking.

I'm a little bit more skeptical. I mean, you know, it'll be interesting to see

and certainly things like deep brain stimulation have shown promise for medical function,

but it doesn't seem like there's necessarily an obvious way to stimulate anything to like evoke thoughts

or communicate or, you know, create images or anything like that.

It doesn't seem like we have a good enough understanding of the brain yet to do anything like that.

And we don't even know if it's actually possible, right?

So, I mean, we, you know, hypothesize that, you know, first of all, we're talking single neurons as well

and 20 years seems like a stretch to be able to get to the single neuron level,

but, you know, we, I guess we have this hypothesis that if stimulating a neuron is all that's needed

to like create some sort of subjective experience and we don't even know if that's true.

So, I mean, I don't know why you keep saying we, I'm sorry, but people, you know,

if you look at the neural dust experiment or optogenetics, there's lots of people who are using electrodes

to stimulate single neurons. There's a long history to that.

I think he means we, as in like neuroscience, don't know if stimulating neurons will elicit the percept.

That's what we're talking about here.

So, all I'm saying is that there's a long history to stimulating single neurons.

So, I'm not sure what you're saying that you're skeptical that we can't stimulate single neurons.

This has been happening for hundreds of years.

I mean, I think he's talking about creating consciousness of thoughts, memories,

rather than, you know, movements or other, I guess, lower order mental activity

from reading what you were saying, Mark.

Yeah, yeah, that's kind of what I'm getting at.

In vivo, with a device in our head as well, it's not clear that that's, you know, a short-term thing

that we'll be able to do with something like neural ink.

So, what you're saying, it sounds like you said that it's not going to be possible to stimulate

single neurons to change thoughts.

That sounds like you've ruled out that it's going to be possible to do that.

Just like you know this already.

No, not at all. I'm just saying there hasn't been any evidence for it.

So, it seems like a pretty strong claim to say we'll be doing it in 20 years

when we don't even know if it's feasible, like a proof of concept even.

I see. Well, I mean, you know, I think there is evidence to it.

And in fact, that's the book that I'm writing right now is that there actually is evidence to it.

Maybe there are some things you haven't reviewed yet. That's what I would suggest.

Let me push back a little bit on both sides here.

So, I'll push towards the middle.

So, the most similar thing we have to being able to stimulate individual neurons

in an intact brain of a mouse, of something that we have genetic control,

would be something that's been around for maybe five years.

I think very recent, and that's SLM.

And so, with two-photon imaging and two-photon stimulation,

you can direct light to individual neurons.

Now, that same problem that I mentioned earlier

where you could actually stimulate axons too by stimulating that area

was solved by engineering a optogenetic protein that only lives in the Selma.

So now, in this very mutated mouse,

you have the ability to stimulate individual neurons in an intact, awake mouse

using basically really cool holography.

And that's been around for just a couple years and just a couple of hours of doing it.

And so, the ability to stimulate individual neurons in humans

where you don't have genetic control,

and reasonable people are very resistant to having genes put in them.

So, I don't think that's going to be a probable solution.

But now, as far as can you evoke a percept in a mouse,

I think that's been shown a little bit more than Mark basically sounded.

I mean, a little bit, so it's debatable.

But I think the Tanagawa lab has shown some fear, memory things.

And so, basically, if you stimulate the right neurons,

the mouse supposedly feels like they're in a place that they actually are not in.

They feel like they're in the place when you recorded that activity.

So, I lean a little bit more towards you should be able to evoke a percept.

And there was some research where if you stimulate layer four of certain mice,

they do act or at least behave in a way as if you gave them the whisker stimulus that you trained them on.

So, there's some evidence.

So, to me, I would lean more that that's possible,

but I would lean more away from that we're ever going to get that type of single neuron resolution control

in the next 20 years would be pretty ambitious for that.

So, I have two really great examples that sort of contradict with Scott and Mark were saying,

and they both come from David Ugelman.

And one of those examples is taking, basically, David Ugelman talked about the experiment

where they took the rat's eyeball out of the eye socket and they plugged it into the audio cortex

and the rat began to perceive, began to see through the audio cortex and eyeball was sent.

So, you just basically plugged in the eye and that began to stimulate the audio cortex

and the rat began to see.

That is an example of causing the rat to see in a part of the brain that was never meant to see before.

And then another example is there's basically the example of what it was called when you,

gosh, don't blank now.

It's the example of when you, oh my God, I'm going to remember in like one minute.

Yeah, and I think what, maybe we are sort of coalescing along this idea that certainly with rats

and sort of stimulus response type behavior, you know, we might be making decent progress,

but given how little we understand about the human brain in terms of the relationship

between neural activity and like subjective experience and, you know, even just basic perception,

you know, it seems like maybe 20 years is a reasonable goal to start to have an idea of just,

you know, the neural representation of, you know, of percepts in a more concrete way,

let alone being able to, you know, stimulate them to evoke those percepts.

And, you know, we've been working at it and sorry, I come from a cognitive neuroscientist perspective

and not on the anatomy side or not even, you know, not on the single cell recordings

and animals and things like that, but from the cognitive neuroscience side,

it's, you know, we're still kind of in the dark ages in terms of understanding the relationship

between neural activity and, you know, and thought and like what we're thinking

and what we're seeing and things like that.

So it seems like we need to, you know, solve that much more convincingly to be able to use neural link.

Again, you know, it has a lot of promise for, you know, dealing with, you know, injuries

and, you know, going from the brain out, but going from out to the brain in, I guess,

for the human brain, it seems like, to me it seems a very, very, very far away.

So the hypothesis of my book is that basically this has already been solved

if you looked at the research as a whole and the second thing that was about how

David even talks about how stimulating the tongue, like if you attach a camera to someone's head

and you wire the pixels to an electrode stimulus pack on their tongue or on their back,

they'll begin, that person will begin to see through the camera if they're blind,

they'll begin to see like a crude image, which is basically their brain converting the electrodes

that are on their back or their tongue into an image because those electrodes

stimulus represent the stimulus from the pixels on the camera.

And there's also a case of conjoined twins who they could see through each other's eyes

and they did many experiments where they asked the girl,

what is your sister looking at?

Because their brains were literally connected by the thalamus

and the girls were able to report what the other twin was seeing,

even though they could not at the same time face the same direction.

So these are two examples of basically, well the main example is that with,

by stimulating the tongue or the back, you can cause a person to see.

And so that again points to if we're able to stimulate just someone's skin or their tongue,

then we could cause perceptual changes.

And if you just, if you get into their brain more specifically,

then you're, I mean, there's no reason why you could do it to their tongue

or to their back and cause them to see images,

but you couldn't also just stimulate the thalamus directly and also cause them to see images.

There's just no, so my hypothesis is that all this research that you're saying doesn't exist,

it does exist and that's really the purpose of my book, point all this out.

When we heard a lot from the neuroscience side, which I think is fantastic and I want that to continue,

but to draw an analogy for the computer science and the, I guess, the information architect sort of side of the room,

it sounds like we're playing around if we were to draw an analogy to a computer is in the input and output connections.

We haven't yet got to stimulus that goes directly into the processor or into the memory if we were using that as an analogy.

And that's sort of the question that was raised, whether we'll actually be able to do that or not.

Obviously, you have to pursue something if you're going to achieve it.

If you give up before you try, you won't get there.

But we're talking about that sort of second order level.

And then there's a third order above that, which is one that fills a lot of the rooms on Clubhouse,

which is, are we going to get into consciousness and those even higher orders?

But I think you're making, not an argument, but different points there,

but not necessarily disagreeing that we haven't really got into plugging anything directly into what's the human equivalent of the processor or the memory.

Yeah, no, I just wanted to chime in from the perspective of an affective framework may not necessarily be in terms of trying to stimulate unusual neuron,

depending on whether you're talking about the parasympathetic nervous system versus an entry nervous system.

The ability was demonstrated already by just inducing different kind of prebiotics into your entry nervous system can have an affective change.

I'm just curious in terms of the analog pixels that are required,

are they always necessarily required as an induction into the brain versus any other part of the body?

That's one thought process that I would like to induce to discuss.

The second aspect of it is the analog viscose pixels that we're discussing right now is just in probably 200, 300.

If you really had to come up with an affective framework and also come up with a compute capacity, consciousness is really far away

and even trying to understand the methylation process if you have to actually talk about memory is a bit far away.

But if you're talking just about basic electrical impulses to control,

I do not know whether we really need individual neuron level activities to be controlled,

probably if you just increase the number of analog pixels.

And if we can come up with a better solution to ensure that the data plus goes to a secondary computer for effective computation

and the current inability to go beyond just controlling basic activities or inducing impulses back in terms of controlling the mimic system

is based on the data bus and the computation capacity which is near term for real time.

I think within two or three years, given the neuromorphic chips and also then, I think the current chip is at one,

but given the neuromorphic chips actually doubling in its capacity, probably more complex activities can be controlled externally

and also internally the impulses can go beyond just paraplegic or what do you call this,

paralysis based feedback to something more transhumanistic.

And by that, what I mean is primarily in space of vision or better speech or correcting impediments in terms of something that you inherit from spectrum.

So there's a lot of work that's already happening in terms of the externality of once the analog pixel actually increases,

how can reinforcement learning can come into play, how can we actually use affective and perceptive control theory

and gave theoretical models that can be applied which can circumvent the need for expensive computers.

But again, just from a thought process, I won't ask the neuroscientists and neurobiologists in this room,

can the electrodes be also implemented throughout the nervous system including entry as well as parasympathetic

or is it limited from its perspective for its effectiveness only from a cranium or the current set of neural base inputs?

Just curious, would love some thoughts.

I don't, for sympathetic or sympathetic I think the way that, sorry, neurotransmitters are released from aren't a very volumetric way.

So they're released and then they sort of travel long distance and they have effects that last over long distance.

You need this kind of precision that you do when you're trying to get at a cortical microcircuit copy

where there's tons of cells getting both convergent and divergent inputs,

just a lot of processing is happening in a very small space in the cortex which is why you would want the high density probes.

I think in the, is that you mentioned you don't need that sort of high density so you don't need this sort of new technology.

And your theory is that anyway the fact that there is enough density at the cortex actually takes care of the need

for any kind of impulse as well as person, is that how I need to understand?

Because you were cutting off, maybe it's my network, would that be a fair summary, F?

Yeah, no, sorry, my name's Scott, I just, so...

My apologies, I just...

Sorry, no, I haven't even mentioned that, I can't forget.

So, in the cortex there's just a lot of computation that's going on and that computation's going on through this connectivity

where lots of neurons are converging onto one neuron and then one neuron is converging back onto lots of neurons.

In other parts of the brain you see more of what's, you see more of like some neurons connecting to some neurons

and to sort of propagating in a fashion where it's not so convergent or divergent.

And in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system on top of that you have this sort of neurotransmitter release

where it sort of diffuses over a large space.

So, you kind of don't need the precise control to manipulate their activity

to get the, to increase parasympathetic or de-parasympathetic.

So, basically I'm going to make it, to oversimplify, parasympathetic or sympathetic can be just sort of, you can turn it up, you can turn it down

and you can do that with a very gross signal in terms of doing anything sort of functionally relevant in the cortex.

You sort of need very precise signals and you need them to happen in a very precisely timed pattern.

So, that's where I think you need the high density of the truss.

It doesn't have any implication in terms of the vagus nerve.

So, we make a large assumption that this is, we have a fully functional, I mean nothing's cut.

There's no path of these Olympic pathways that are disrupted.

The vagus nerve is intact and hence we are in phase one or whatever we call it right now, the draft.

You know, we are working on an assumption that the cortex density is reasonably good enough for making any significant impact.

Is that a good summary?

Sorry, you keep saying the cortex density, there's, do you mean density of electrodes?

I mean the density of electrodes, so in terms of the analog pixel that actually comes out.

In terms of, I'm sorry, the analog pixel?

The density of the electrode actually determines the analog pixels that comes out for the computation.

That's the electric bus which actually goes into the N1 chip for doing the computations.

So, I was more curious from that perspective.

The readout, so what's being read out from the neural activity is coming from a, yeah, it's, you're reading out from a space that has lots of neurons and lots of connectivity there.

And so, that's a readout that you were talking about, at least in terms of sympathetic, parasympathetic, you were talking about stimulation and you're comparing it to cortex readout?

So, there are two ways, right?

One is stimulation that goes into your system, whatever that system we call is the brain or the nervous system or the cortex

where the electrodes currently are actually inhibited both from mice or chimps or humans.

And the second one is reading out as against trying to make stimulation into the system.

So, the readout from the system is an output from the system and reading into or the stimulation is the input into the system.

That's how I'm looking at it.

I see, we're just looking at it from the opposite.

Either way, either way.

Yeah, so when I say reading, I just mean recording and then when I say writing, I mean stimulating in terms of cortex.

But yeah, so I think in terms of the, if you're talking about the vagus nerve, I mean, I could be wrong, this isn't my field of study, but I am fairly confident that there's not much to read out in those areas

or I don't think putting a high density probe is really going to get you a lot of additional information that you can make useful.

I could be wrong unless somebody let me know if I am.

But in the cortex, for sure, the more density or that you can get in there, you're probably going to get a more useful signal out of that.

And then be able to convert that into some sort of finer scale motion or whatever you want it to do with the signal.

Yeah, so that's all.

I just wanted to de-market, when you said sympathetic, parasympathetic versus other areas, I just wanted to say like, you don't need new technology, you can use old technology, I guess, to read out activity from sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system.

And I think this is more, the purpose of this is more to get like some sort of fine scale cortical neural activity and get some sort of, you know, really fine detailed control.

So you could control like a cursor arm or something in fine detail because of that.

Yeah.

No, it could also, I mean, there's also a secondary, correct me if I'm wrong, there's also a secondary implication when you're actually looking at incisions and you have to, you know, consider the surface materials of the electrode that will actually be left into a barrier like the brain

if the same amount of impulses can be actually both induced and actually read out from a different part of your system and not necessarily an incisive, you know.
