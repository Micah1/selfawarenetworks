  85: This is all ascribing attributes to an awareness that is in theory empty of attributes, but it is not truly empty, as the book "The Brain from Inside Out by György Buzsáki's illustrates." The mind has built in preferences, evolved synaptic conditioning, and dendritic morphological presets.

You are entified via the principles of neural oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, and the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence). I will attempt to explain how reality is computationally rendered from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, (a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains). I will argue the whole brain is doing this at all scales: at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

  7: Applying a region based map of brain roles to the brain could be what György Buzsáki calls the Brain from Outside In (matching observation to a concept instead of creating a new concept from observation.) György Buzsáki's book "The Brain from Inside Out" contradicts the typical "Outside-In" process of applying our models to the brain, instead of creating models from the brain.

  158: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to György Buzsáki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

  85  The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

  5: When it comes to who you are, in the context of neuroscience, I think György Buzsáki is correct that people are not born as blank slates, the human body has natural preferences. I agree with Yann LeCun that humans have specialized intelligence, not general intelligence.

  69: The same thing with executive function, choices, these are not regional activities as many neuroscientists still believe. Choices are happening everywhere at the cell level (Criterial Causation via Peter Tse), and complex choices are happening at the neural circuit scale in the inhibitory interneurons (the concept of criteria causation again but applied to György Buzsáki 2006 (Book) figure 11.5 the graphic on inhibitory interneurons neurons)

  32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

  103    5: Mapping those roles to large regions of the brain is, I think, an outdated idea in neuroscience. The new thinking is that every part of the brain is doing a little bit of everything, at all scales. The brain is self similar everywhere (Jeff Hawkins talks about the self similarity of the neocortex, and the similarity of the Hippocampus to a cortical column) tiny learned custom variations in each part of the brain will serve to generate a natural VAE Variational Autoencoder effect for comparing learned patterns in one modality to same or similar patterns encoded in a different modality.

  1067    34: The key thought about where the observer is inside the mind, where is the person inside who is watching the brain's representations, is to think of the flow of information in the brain as a series of arrays, with each array seeing part of the picture, and the oscillating activity at different scales, from spikes to phase changes to big brainwaves and dipoles is the thing that binds together what each array in the brain is seeing as information passes through it, so you perceive what you perceive, and that includes a representation of your hands and your sense of self as the body of causation behind your hands.

  2473     172:   27: I argued somewhere, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.

  2486     556:   25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
