(neurotransmitter)
imagine the wholebrain is a series of coordinated reflexes designed to maximise the consumption of neurotransmitters in many different categories of possible circumstances
my awareness is my sanctuary, its the holy temple of the "I am" meme. my sanctuary shall be clean, purified, I will root out all types of negative thoughts, I will keep my temple clean
there has been a conceptual shift about the mind since I posted this, its as if all thoughts including negative thoughts are contingency plans the mind created, codes meant to maximize some value in each situation, the purification process is the new reflex
