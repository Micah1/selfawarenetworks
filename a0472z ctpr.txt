I don't think you are you now Richard, what makes you think that you are more than a mechanical simulation of a person even now?

your brains activity is a reaction, the connections and memories become the predictions of new causes, and the structure that influencies the development of new concepts, it barely works but it effectively simulates a functional person, with massive redundancy, and efficiency, technology by nature that is slightly more advanced than anything humans have built yet. but there isn't any real you, unless you are concepts consisting of connections between cellular memories, I don't think I'm that, I don't think I actually exist at all. Whats your spin on it?

what isn't artificial about intelligence now, the brain is a machine now, I don't exist in that, I'm not in my brain. I'm not a memory, or a branching network of connections between memories, but perhaps consciousness is nothing else except a result of that system of chemicals, and electricity and folded dna protein based brains? perhaps its a product, like a computer, and one day brains will be sold in a 99 cent store, little computer brains that have real consciousness, in a machine, Real not artificial consciousness.

you have a bunch of parts working together creating the illusion of a whole, identity is that illusion http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-thomas/schizophrenic-brains_b_1762933.html

That's a bit reductionist Micah, as 'me' I am more then just the sum of my neuron connections or connectome - I would at least add a few of my key organs and my entire nervous system into the mix. I 'feel', therefore I am. ;)

you can add the whole ecosystem that your apart of to the list. How can you live without air, without food, you have a certain amount of learned dependency on your social contract, not that it can't be unlearned, it would be more difficult to survive if you were the last person on earth, let alone reproduce, so lets just say the sum of you is more than your body. Why not add the entire cosmos, your not separate from spacetime, your made of the same stuff that's made in stars, particles, atoms, you are spacetime, you are the conscious peak of the cosmos, the galaxy is your robe, the sun is the cool chain you wear on your cosmic neck.

You can say that your everything, and because everything is an all inclusive term, you'd be right.

But if you stab a rock, it's not the same feeling as when you prick your finger. So in a sense your finger is more you than a rock. Yet you could lose a limb, and get an artificial replacement, and your plastic brain, with the right neuro-plastic treatment, can remap itself, to treat the artificial limb as if it were it's real limb. The brain is not completely dependent on the body, you could conceivably create an artificial body, the perfect artificial ecosystem for the brain, and the brain would adapt to, to control it, to become that new body, your new mechanical self. The components of the brain itself, the cells, the proteins, the particulars, the myelinated axons, the glial cell waste removal system, the microtubules, the camkii2, the branches of dendrites and synapses, serve as hardware for memory and concept formation, predictions of causes, derived from sequences of patterns, from chains of data, that comes in from the senses, and the brain itself, in any particular part, is just a system of cells, a cooperation of rivals, working together to feed, it's a hungry glucose and nutrient driven system, the hungriest organ in the body, but the result, is the coordination of a body, including your fingers, and your voice muscles, for communication, the same way your brain relates to itself, it relates to everyone else.

So if a rock isn't really me, and if I can lose a finger the finger isn't really me, and I can take any particular cell in my brain out, because my braincells are not really me, then what I am is some emergent property, a macroscopic form that doesn't exist in the detail, a higher level idea, a ghost, and a ghost that doesn't really exist at the microscopic level. My existence is in heaven, in a cloud, in a dream, and it's so not real :)

Yet it's as real as real can be. I like your approach Micah. A monist approach to how we see the world throws up some interesting questions - that the concept of self and the individual, of 'me' or 'you' is an illusion. The existence of mirror neurons appears to back this up somewhat. Being self-aware and conscious is perhaps an absurdity, but it's an evolved one. We can either laugh or cry at knowing this - always better to laugh. :)

"that the concept of self and the individual, of 'me' or 'you' is an illusion." not exactly an illusion. imagine that individual neurons have memories, and then imagine that a concept is the connection pathway between several of these cell memories, the concept isn't in the memory, it's in the connections between memories. So there are memories of your toes, your knees, your body, your hair, your face, your smile, your girlfriends, your guardians/parents, your loved ones, and then the concept of you is the neural connection between all those memories. It's not exactly an illusion, because the concept of you isn't the whole of you, it might be less than 1 percent of you, but you know absolutely nothing outside the 1 percent that is your concept.

what I know about myself, is a concept that is a connection between associated memories, what I know about the world, isn't in the world, it's a concept memory model predicting the causes of motion across all senses in my mind, it's less than what's real, less than 20% of what's really out there, and maybe less than .00001 percent of what's actually real. it's not correct, it's not realistic, it barely works, and thinking that you are "as real as read can be" is only correct in the sense that any tautology is correct, but it leaves out the more likely story that "what we see is not completely real, because our brains are only modeling between .00001 percent and 20 percent of what's really out there."

Agreed. So if we can replicate these connections between memories in a person then we would have another 'me' or 'you' - the only problem then, is replicating just about everything else (including as you say, the relationships with others and with the environment around you). Love it when neuroscience helps shine a light on philosophy.

your concept of you, might already be replicated in millions of other people, you might be a collective entity and have not yet realized it

the moment the "I am" concept map of connections, and memories, is modeled and turned into a shelf product that any kid can buy and add to any robot, effectively making that robot a "Richard Pomfret" bot, what will you think of your consciousness then?
