Neo Mind Cycle is a "brain optimization" program, that involves brainwave entrainment, neurofeedback, mind machines, and basically it allows a person to change light and sound beats with their feelings and thoughts, the result is more internal connections, and more intelligence. Secondary results are numerous including more creativity, more great ideas, more successes, more mental flexibility, more performance under fire, more confidence, more happiness. However it also pushes a person through whatever psychological issues they might have gotten either in their own development, or as subconscious family entanglement patterns inherited at the subconscious level from parents, relatives, and even unknown relatives and unknown influences that might have been a couple generations before you were born, but started this pattern that got to you. So while I have been becoming more intelligent, I've also had a very therapeutic year. Growing as a person, maturing, becoming wiser. This tech helps people with autism, ADHD, PTSD, addiction, and so much more. It's just better to do it in conjunction with a strong supportive therapist. This technology involves sitting, with a unit on the head, that measures brainwaves, sending that data into the computer where isochronic (neural stimulation) beats are added in the form of light and sound patterns that reflect the patterns of your brain waves back to you, so if you change your mood conscious the light and sound changes, if you think of a big prediction in the future, something really happy, the reverb or pitch might increase, and the light might get brighter or beat faster.

Electroencephalogram or EEG is an integral component of the larger process I custom designed. With some versions of EEG you can see graphs representing your brain activity. With other versions you can hear sounds. Some versions let you see regional brain activity as colors. Some versions let you play games. However I do something much different that makes the experience significant, interesting, far more stimulating, and brain optimizing. That is I combine software and hardware dedicated to brainwave entrainment with light and sound, using brain stimulating isochronic beats which are similar to binaural beats. These beats can produce powerful states in a human being even without EEG. Brainwave entrainment is so powerful it can put you in the perfect mental state for creativity, exercise, study, confidence, sleep, headache relief, frustration reduction, relaxation, meditation, and so much more. However unlike any brainwave entrainment you can buy on cd, The brainwave entrainment I use is dynamic, as opposed to static. In Neo Mind Cycle the brainwave entrainment is dynamically changing to match your brainwave frequences as given by the EEG, so you get something highly stimulating, in the form of light and sound, that is driven by your mind. This makes the whole experience better, more effective, more interesting, and more fun. It's more effective because its more interesting, if you are doing brainwave entrainment and you are not enjoying it you should stop, because that means your mind is not engaged. I have read so much about the human brain that I was able to integrate many principles of brain plasticity into the design of my sessions and my over all program. So it is truly more effective than the average EEG treatment because of my knowledge and experience and use of additional technologies and techniques beyond traditional EEG.

Settings are adjustable. It's very high tech, and I studied a lot about the brain on my own time to make sure I understood what was really going on. Lately I've had a breakthrough and perfected my system to the next level.

What I sell is a service people come to my office in San Francisco to use. Its not one piece of equipment, its several pieces of equipment, software, techniques, and carefully put together, tested procedures, costing several thousands of dollars, plus years of education and experience. Thats how I am able to offer the best system for brain optimization in the world. So ideally if you want to do it, get a passport and plane ticket to San Francisco, and let me know when your coming so we can schedule it well in advance.
