I am trying to delete preachy stuff from my notes. I think people ought to have the freedom to make up their own minds on religious topics. Religious or non-religious beliefs are at the individual level concern, not at the Government or Corporate Decisions level of concern. It's not a decision for third-parties, like your parents, guardians, teachers, or local politicians to figure it out for you what religion you ought to believe in. That is subjugation, if you do not have religious freedom in your mall town. A lovely question that comes up sometimes under this topic is whether is choice is real or what is it mean if the cosmos is deterministic despite chaotic quantum scale fluctuations inside our brains?

Determinism & the Brain

Micah Blumberg (July 2011)
‎30 years of neuroscience beats 5000 years of philosophy, I've read Wilber and many more. I've also read many neuroscience books. There is no observable mechanism of choice in the mind, it's a self similar structure through out, it does one thing in summary and that is make predictions, and these predictions are part of one long chain of cause and effect. We automatically gather the best information we can, and we are automatically doing the best we can with the information we have. Choice really is an illusion, it's an illusion that might trick someone into choosing worse choices instead of better choices. Without choice we really do have to believe we are doing the best we can with the information we have, because technically its true there is no other choice.

From the senses electrical signals representing the frequencies of the world around us travel up the neo-cortex to the hypothalamus and back down again toward the senses. Along the way actions get triggered, feelings get triggered, thoughts get triggered, thoughts that may represent billions of neurons firing all at once. Creating a pattern that you suddenly think is a word that popped into your head just now. Maybe you brought your hands together suddenly. It might be unlikely another person can predict your every action, but we are all somewhat predictable. We can predict that at about 2 years old a baby will start behaving in a very terrible way. They call it terrible twos. Your breathing is automatic, your blood flow, your growth. There are so many obvious signs that you are an automatic being. As sure as a tree we reach for light, nutrients, and resources. When were not doing that there is some information we need, it could be nutrition information, or security information, or philosophical information. We gather information automatically. Stop. Are you still thinking or reading? See automatic. Even perfect zen, perfect stillness of thought is automatic.

I understand the issue your raising however your making some terrible assumptions "you cant reduce the inner phenomenological reality" oh can't I? The you that you are isn't really an individual, it's a collective, a collective of cells, singing the song of "I am". Everything you can sense, every feeling, every concept, every experience, and thought is a prediction. What you think is you is actually a network of electro-chemical reactions, it's 100 percent reactive. There is zero control, and the only think your mind does in summary is make predictions. The concepts of choice and freewill lend themselves as predictions, means of explaining the actions of others when they diverge from your own. No balloon can choose to stop rising toward the ceiling. The only reason some balloons rise higher is that their corner of ceiling is higher. In this sense what we mistake for choice is more like altitude. As your awareness expands through life, your prediction-altitude increases, and you automatically make better choices. Literally some people are stuck thinking they are somewhat less than perfect because they are trying to hold onto the illusion of choice. Lose the illusion of choice today, it's the only way to perfection. :)

"Your decisions are strongly prepared by brain activity. By the time consciousness kicks in, most of the work has already been done," said study co-author John-Dylan Haynes, a Max Planck Institute neuroscientist.
If we are not in control of ourselves, since there is no I to be in control me (as sily as it sounds), who is in control? The universe. The whole existence is controlling it.
No wonder people get great results in the AA community when they realize that their lives can be greatly enhanced by realizing a higher power that control everything. But of course it's the higher power that decision to make the body/mind realize that.

Consciousness is the news headline, the summary of a mountain of unconscious thought, the human being is just a tree, a fractal, made of cells, dna, automatically reaching for nutrients, automatically reaching for the light.

Accepting the higher power is the same as letting go of inner conflict, these are metaphors to describe an automatic energy transformation of the conscious being
There are Christian groups who are determinists (the Calvinists) there are Buddhist's who believe in determinism. (I don't know how you can be enlightened without that realization) and there are famous scientists like Einstein who believe in determinism. The majority of people in the neuroscience world believe in determinism.

And the realization that you are the whole process. It's not like you as the whole has a free will, but you're simply spontaneously manifesting everything, free from everything that is happening, infinitely creative.
