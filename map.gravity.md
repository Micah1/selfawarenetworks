   7: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, via Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, this note explores some of the original ideas in Q.G.T.C.D.
   8  

  77  
  78: The center of mass is where the intervals of time are slowed down, but around a particle time is sped up, so what that particle emits is going to create the quantum gradient time dilation effect of increasing the odds of particle movement in the direction of any other nearby particle. If particles have a compatible oscillatory frequency they will clump together, because their quantum gravity time crystal dilation effect allowed a clustering to happen, an an atom forms, then a molecule.
  79  

  85  
  86: To rephrase: Just like the clock in space is iterating faster in space the further it is from mass, so the human experience ought to be iterating faster than what happens at the particle scale unless the particles are moving at a much faster velocity and then special relativity would help us understand that the time dilation effect is reversed to what it might intuitively be with gravity alone.

    7: Neurons are blowing your mind hehe. Thats a neuro-quantum-gravity joke.
    8  My Quantum gradient time dilation notes talk about mass as a time crystal but this connects to neural function, and the notes on the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) and it means the neuron is literally warping spacetime.

   88  
   89: One of the weird perks of having a new unpublished theory of quantum gravity is that I have new quantum gravity jokes that I can't tell you about yet (until after the theory is published), lets just say for now that these jokes are mind blowing.

  157: Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.
  158  

  162  
  163: In short gravity is not the electrical force
  164  

  171  
  172: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
  173  

  175  
  176: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity

    6: New, written on June 16th, 2022, an easier explanation of my Gravity Equation
    7: 'Gravity is time dilation'
    8: "Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale." A mass like the earth heats up space time relative to outer space, expanding the number of directions around a particle temporally in addition to the spatial dimensions, because if a particle or atom moves in a random direction in space with no large masses nearby it has no particular reason to move one way or another, but if it has three times more opportunities to move south, because things in the south move three times faster, then the odds of it randomly moving south increase, thus gravity attracts particles by increasing the relative dimensions of time in the direction of mass and mass is the crunch point of an expanding wave on a macroscale.
    9  

   12  
   13: Someone asked me what is the gist of my Gravity theory: The gist is that mass creates time dilation effects at the quantum scale, and that the aggregate effect of quantum time dilation results in a quantum field where the odds of particle movement are shifted in favor of the direction of dilated time. So particles fall towards mass because the odds of moving in the direction of mass are increased because mass increases the intervals of space in time in its direction.

   89: equation for quantum gravity
   90  everything is relative to everything else, in time space and oscillation phase, including in our brains.

   96  so the densities of the ionic gradients could also be thought of in the sense of fermionic condensates, 
   97: resulting in gravity or spacetime waves in the electric field
   98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.
   99  
  100: electricity is gravity, magnetism is also gravity, magnetic waves, bosons, light, these are also gravity waves

   6: I'm a matrix hacker (math, code, physics, webxr, neural networks). A neurohacker (writing code for brain machine interfaces, I design new brain computer interface technologies, and I write about the quantum physics of neurophysics, quantum gravity, and I design space warping sentient self driving vehicles.) I'm a book author (in progress), a patent creator (in progress), a science institute founder (in progress), a software architect.
   7  

   9  
  10: I am writing a book about the quantum physics of neurophysics, how human phenominal consciousness works, how to hack the human mind with technology, the book includes a new extension of Quantum Gravity.
  11  

a0049z.md:
  211  
  212: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  213  

  225  
  226: It also means that resurrections, astonishing feats of healing, walking on water, and defying gravity are each slightly more plausible.
  227  
  228: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
  229  

  233  
  234: The Pyramid of Giza probably is a gravity defying warp capable spaceship that can cross between galaxies and between solar systems by manipulating spacetime around it.
  235  

  243  
  244: The idea is that, oh shit, the pyramid focuses electromagnetic energy in a way that is perpendicular to earths gravity, its reflection of electromagnetism with its tetrahedronsurface sends a fermion condensate beam through its center down into the earth
  245  
  246: earths gravity is not just sending out lanes from fermion condensates, its sending them out radially
  247  

  292  
  293: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
  294  

  304  
  305: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth
  306  

  316  
  317: so an elevator flying straight up causes gravity in that elevator, but a rotating planet has the same effect without directional thrust because it is shaping or curving space to mimic directional thrust
  318  
  319: so earths rotating dipole or quadrupoles are more accurately the emission lines and lanes of quantum gravity and earths electromagnetic field
  320  

  325  but instead of escape velocity from directional thrust its possible to warp space instead
  326: so that the spaceship is out of phase with the gravity of earth, and that is like its orbiting earth inside of falling to earth, its fall is in a different direction so long as it has positive energy to sustain the direction of its flight
  327  

  337  
  338: this potentially reverses or interferes with the local em field of the earth creating anti gravity

   90: and that the forces of gravity of any object in space are acting on all objects in space, albiet that effect becomes very small at a distance
   91  
   92: the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space
   93  

  127  
  128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles,

   5: Gravity is not electrical force, its a time wave in the electrical force that is the inverse of mass
   6  
   7: So the configuration pattern of the electric field warps and ripples with formations that are gravity waves.
   8  
   9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  10  

  14  
  15: In a lecture called “The Law of Gravitation” Richard Feynman pointed out that people who want to believe that electricity and gravitation are the same thing will find out that electricity is much more powerful than gravity. 
  16  

  25  
  26: ⟪ 267 characters skipped ⟫the greater the chaos the more the force of electricity is diluted, the more the electrons align the greater the electrical force gets, this explains the difference between the electric force and the gravity force that we experience. A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned.
  27  

  39  
  40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.
  41  

a0118z.md:
  8  
  9: I think with category theory we can show that space is graviton invariant, it can behave as if gravitons are present even if they are not present, and this is especially important if we are thinking about gravity from the future affecting the shape of spacetime in the past and visa versa.

  48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  22  
  23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.

While the idea that one person could have so many new ideas on so many diverse topics might seem unlikely its just that there are common physical mechanisms connecting all these different things, and really at the core of it its one new idea that has led to all the others.

  3: as the eye of a hurricane is to a hurricane, so mass curves spacetime, the mass is the eye of the hurricane, and it's spinning is cumulative, the cumulative of tiny hurricanes in the form of atoms, in the particle wind, so that's the reason there is gravity on large dense objects like the earth, the earth itself is isomorphic to a spinning hurricane, the earth would be the eye of the hurricane funneling space itself and everything in it towards the earth.

  18: ⟪ 267 characters skipped ⟫, pre-general relativity and quantum physics. Since general relativity time is known to be a dimensions of space, so events in the past can still change, and events in the future can be effecting the gravity of the present. What makes the present moment the present moment then? Is it some potential difference? Like an particle that averages a past geometry and future geometry together? Quantum physics discoveries this year are demonstrating that an event and its cause can give rise to one another, as if pencil rolling also cause the pushing of the pencil. Its bizarre to think of time as a nonlinear dynamic, which is why most people don't, but if you don't your pre-Heisenberg. the very thing that would cause changes in past and future is the uncertainty principle applied to gravity.

  49: "If human thought comprises non-computational processes,then how is the brain supporting these processes? To answer this question, Penrose appeals to physics, and claims that the theory of quantum gravity is likely to be the kind of physics required to explain a conscious mind. ... Microtubules, according to Penrose, support a substrate for the quantum gravity effects required for consciousness. "(H.Brighton/H.Selima - Artificial Intelligence: A Graphic Guide)
  50  

  68  Penrose's point seems to suggest that in the future some questions will be answered by evolution itself, but there would be a lot to wait (say thousands of generations?) for these changes to appear on the surface, if any. On the other hand, I think that every attempt to investigate consciousness from the way quantum physics interacts will physical brain will reproduce this controversy ad infinitum.
  69: At some moment, there will be need to address consciousness building models, making appropriate hypothesis and previsions and data analysis that may lead to some conclusions that lie on a different perspective than biology and quantum gravity. AI has this potential. But I think there is a lot more to do.

   6  ‎7. so we have now a pattern of increasing lumps in space, because the matter now has to travel around other lumps of matter in order to recombine
   7: 8. and the opposite energies of matter and anti-matter means that they repel each other, resulting in the opposite of gravity, and that same energy is responsible for the gravity of matter on matter, and the gravity of anti-matter on anti-matter
   8  9. The routes take on a sort of spiral pattern, because literally the matter has to travel around other matter, no further and no less, in order to return to it's original state

  33  The reason there is so much "Cosmic Energy" is because Matter and Anti-matter cannot stand each other, they keep splitting apart, but on average they are as one.
  34: ‎26. Gravity (the law of attraction) is matter curling around itself, because it is increasingly fed up with being one with (anti-matter), relative to the the total amount of peaceful space and the raw unbiased possibility of particle location.
  35  yes anti-matter is physical, and as a matter being you would find it repulsive.

   2: (oscillat, decoherence, super position, electromagnetism, conjecture, observer, vector, dissipation) Now I'm really certain that my Quantum Gravity Equation Hypothesis is a brand new exciting idea that replaces the extra dimensions in string theory. The Kaluza-Klein theory of extra dimensions led to string theory.
   3  

  27  
  28: This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.

  31: Can we have a thought experiment where we think of Gravity as a reverse pressure gradient? Why or why not, only instead of pressure we are talking about the effects of spactime warping at the Quantum & Molecular scales, with aggregate effects from dense matter convergence such as with Fermionic Condensates. Lets create a computer simulation to model the shape of space time with a dynamic time gradient at the quantum scale, as mass converges and space expands as a unified process.
  32  
  33: Lets consider how gravity as a quantum gradient time dilation is pressurizing the spacetime field, and imagine how depressuring space might cause lift, or expansion.

  38: Your brain activity is changing all the time because of trillions of factors, criterial causation (information) your specific location, the angle of the light, your whole ecosystem, perhaps including gravity (shrugs) each neuron is weighing ten thousand plus sources of criteria (other braincells) to detect milisecond coincidences to adjust the electric potential firing criteria of other neurons, prepare long term memories, deliberate, calibrate, etc... so many jobs reconfigure the brain and trying to predict it might be like trying to predict the dice roll of a cube that has exabytes of possible configurations per cubic centimeter per milisecond
  39  

  51  2. there is mind boggling complexity to the brain that, well I can't even imagine the amount of harddrive space you would need for a virtual simulation
  52: 3. the brain activity would be immediately radically different because it's in a different location, different light, different gravity, different ecosystem, and the exabytes of possible configurations in a cubic centimenter would radically different the copy before it was done being made.
  53  4. it wouldn't have the same priorities or wishes or memories because it would not be you, all those things are drawn live inside because of contingent criteria causing them, based on stuff that's true for you but not for your copies.

  10: Jan 21, 2018 (electromagnetism, emotion) Wow your thread got a lot of responses. Are you in a dark place or something? The thing is no one needs a reason to live. People live automatically without needing any reason, this because people are dissipative systems, isomorphic to a vortex, a system that needs to maintain its own equilibrium, because of the fundamental interactions, gravity, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and electromagnetism.

  29: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  36  You can take any topography, any three dimensional surface area, and convert it into number sets and functions, a program that is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing. There is no difference between the version that is functions & number sets, and the actual three dimensional structure, it's just a conversation, so for numbers to not exist, is the same as saying that space doesn't exist
  37: or it's to say that space time and gravity is "in your mind"
  38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.
  39  if you subtract all of the descriptions from space, and all of the artifical abstract distinction, you get non-dualism, or space that is not even two things, no distinctions, and no artificial descriptions mean that space is not distinguishable from anything, it's not white, it's not grey, it's not blue, you can't tell the difference between your feet and a cloud in non-dualism, you can't tell the difference between a sharp knife and a butterfly without all the non-existent distinctions in your mind, that are no less and no more non-existent than any number

See note a0130z.md ) similar to the concept of virtual particles emerge to exert forces between particles that increase time in the direction of the earth causing particles & atoms to fall toward the earth.
  100  

  103  
  104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

The current is creating physical force that causes the muscles to cause us to contract. but specifically that force is accelerating time in a way that creates a gravitational effect at the biological scale contracting your muscles with gravity or with time dilation, or with the acceleration of time caused by electron movement that causes your muscles to crunch together.

Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.

So in this model, you would say that like we are very unique specify what it's all made of it with function. Something like this, that time is kind of a mother dimension and that gravity forces space you can form to the shape of time, which is emergent.

  114: So there's like all of these so I look at time is emergent and then gravity beating, you know, kind of forcing space into the shape of time. So that the time would be continuous, the space would be discreet and the fabric would be. So I like what I look at it that when there are a lot of different models that are treated my when I look at it that way, it's just right now at least to make the most estimate of everything is being made of right.

And in the, in the direction of particles is happening and it creates the functional, the increased, the functional appearance of gravity and space time. So we have an effect curving space time where there's no, where we have the effective curving space time, but that effect is the result of particle veins.

Well, if we just imagine that instead of pushing electrons that instead of pushing electromagnetism, which I guess as either electrons or waves, or both we're pushing air, I mean, it's like, it's kind of saying like, well how could air from a fan cause gravity because air is going to be pushing things away from it?
  11  01:39

  13  02:01
  14: But yeah, it's kind of it's kind of like well you know, well what so we. So we see gravity. It's like a reverse almost like a reverse fan where the air is slowing in the other direction, right? So, and and you can almost see like, well, how is that fan pushing air?
  15  02:22

  17  02:53
  18: It's it's, it's structure. It's equilibrium. It's cyclonic power. So it is so like a fan that it's displacing a cyclone as is spacing the the air. And as you can see like within the within the case of like you know jet engines, you know like the more powerful the fan more air is displayed in so you can have a jets can be like the fire gravity but so it's not so I feel like it's not.

  20: It's actually not really controversial to argue that a psych that an atomic scale. Cipher is, is in a sense pushing I'd be like there's like if you could push air towards the center, it's like so imagine. So imagine like an elevator has been compared to grab. Like if like gravity has been compared to an elevator, that is pushing that is accelerating upwards, right?

  719: And this is us right you are interacting with photos everything that we touch the interactive visit with some kind of electromagnetic push against our fingers against our company as or electromagnetic-based hitting our readiness and so we cannot sense any kind of matter that is not interacting via photons except by measuring the gravity occasional effects that it has and they are very subtle because gravity is so weak it's very difficult to make a measurement for changes and gravity or several differences in gravity and by observing the move.

  722: Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.
  723

We are experiencers of emotion and that our emotions play this really big role in how we interpret our world so I guess you know, I was gonna connect that to your question about gravity like for instance gravity what we we do know that gravity is only 9.8 meters per second squared on the surface of the earth and it changes even if you go to the mountains and that that changes depending on the size of the plan that you're on so there's a verifiability there.

That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.

   266:   38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.
   267    39  if you subtract all of the descriptions from space, and all of the artifical abstract distinction, you get non-dualism, or space that is not even two things, no distinctions, and no artificial descriptions mean that space is not distinguishable from anything, it's not white, it's not grey, it's not blue, you can't tell the difference between your feet and a cloud in non-dualism, you can't tell the difference between a sharp knife and a butterfly without all the non-existent distinctions in your mind, that are no less and no more non-existent than any number

   23:   103: Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.

   32:     7: 'Gravity is time dilation'
   33:     8: "Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale." A mass like the earth heats up space time relative to outer space, expanding the number of directions around a particle temporally in addition to the spatial dimensions, because if a particle or atom moves in a random direction in space with no large masses nearby it has no particular reason to move one way or another, but if it has three times more opportunities to move south, because things in the south move three times faster, then the odds of it randomly moving south increase, thus gravity attracts particles by increasing the relative dimensions of time in the direction of mass and mass is the crunch point of an expanding wave on a macroscale.
   34:    13: Someone asked me what is the gist of my Gravity theory: The gist is that mass creates time dilation effects at the quantum scale, and that the aggregate effect of quantum time dilation results in a quantum field where the odds of particle movement are shifted in favor of the direction of dilated time. So particles fall towards mass because the odds of moving in the direction of mass are increased because mass increases the intervals of space in time in its direction.
   35:    89: equation for quantum gravity
   36:    97: resulting in gravity or spacetime waves in the electric field
   37:    98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.

   55:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   56:   220: It also means that resurrections, astonishing feats of healing, walking on water, and defying gravity are each slightly more plausible.
   57:   222: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
   58:   228: The Pyramid of Giza probably is a gravity defying warp capable spaceship that can cross between galaxies and between solar systems by manipulating spacetime around it.
   59:   238: The idea is that, oh shit, the pyramid focuses electromagnetic energy in a way that is perpendicular to earths gravity, its reflection of electromagnetism with its tetrahedronsurface sends a fermion condensate beam through its center down into the earth
   60:   240: earths gravity is not just sending out lanes from fermion condensates, its sending them out radially
   61:   287: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
   62:   299: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth
   63:   311: so an elevator flying straight up causes gravity in that elevator, but a rotating planet has the same effect without directional thrust because it is shaping or curving space to mimic directional thrust
   64:   313: so earths rotating dipole or quadrupoles are more accurately the emission lines and lanes of quantum gravity and earths electromagnetic field
   65:   320: so that the spaceship is out of phase with the gravity of earth, and that is like its orbiting earth inside of falling to earth, its fall is in a different direction so long as it has positive energy to sustain the direction of its flight
   66:   332: this potentially reverses or interferes with the local em field of the earth creating anti gravity

   99:   15: In a lecture called “The Law of Gravitation” Richard Feynman pointed out that people who want to believe that electricity and gravitation are the same thing will find out that electricity is much more powerful than gravity.

A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned.
  101:   40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.

  166:   28: This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.

So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.

  257:   135: So in the double set experiment, you're actually firing photons. You're firing photons. And so there's force, where coming from the photon, emitter and that force, it's coming from the photonometer. That's fine. Firing the, the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an oscillating and oscillating mask the same way that an elevator is going to be equivalent to to gravity on earth.

  263:   102: They're supposed to and then let's say. And you also mentioned that the gravitron favorite fairground. Rides include. Oh, that's a fairground, right? I was like, I, I was like, what is the graviton? And I was, I, it made me. I started to think about the, the idea of a gravity particle.
  264:   105: Do you buy that? There's a gravity particle, or would you say that? There's, there's no gravity particle and it's just like, just the curvature of space somehow. What, what do you think? Yeah, I mean I have a lot of different that's on it. The one that I like the perspective that I'm taking for the last few days, because
  265:   108: It's all made of light some and so we're looking at like the solid time model rights like I'm getting and just because of it and the electron. So in this model, you would say that like we are very unique specify what it's all made of it with function. Something like this, that time is kind of a mother dimension and that gravity forces space you can form to the shape of time, which is emergent.
  266:   114: So there's like all of these so I look at time is emergent and then gravity beating, you know, kind of forcing space into the shape of time. So that the time would be continuous, the space would be discreet and the fabric would be. So I like what I look at it that when there are a lot of different models that are treated my when I look at it that way, it's just right now at least to make the most estimate of everything is being made of right.
  267:   120: Yeah. So, you know, light gravity and time have you ever positioned and supposed to different properties like that? But right now, I think I like, for like, the last 48 hours, I've been really digging now. So, at the, at the, when you think about like the universe that a fundamental, you know, particle level.

  270:   244: And so it's like space time is not in in one sense because it's not curving. But what's happening? Is that changes in the direct? And in the, in the direction of particles is happening and it creates the functional, the increased, the functional appearance of gravity and space time. So we have an effect curving space time where there's no, where we have the effective curving space time, but that effect is the result of particle veins.

It's literally oscillating between being the wave being at at its peak pressing and then away sort of like, collapsing, again into the sea. And it's interesting to think of like the, you know, you think of how the moons gravity is affects the waves on on earth.
  277:   75: All being interact. They're all being interacted with by the gravitational force. Right. There is an intro.

Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.

  283:   10: Like you see? Okay, well here's here's the depiction of how the electromagnetic wave field but but it's like, okay. Well, if we just imagine that instead of pushing electrons that instead of pushing electromagnetism, which I guess as either electrons or waves, or both we're pushing air, I mean, it's like, it's kind of saying like, well how could air from a fan cause gravity because air is going to be pushing things away from it?
  284:   14: But yeah, it's kind of it's kind of like well you know, well what so we. So we see gravity. It's like a reverse almost like a reverse fan where the air is slowing in the other direction, right? So, and and you can almost see like, well, how is that fan pushing air?
  285:   18: It's it's, it's structure. It's equilibrium. It's cyclonic power. So it is so like a fan that it's displacing a cyclone as is spacing the the air. And as you can see like within the within the case of like you know jet engines, you know like the more powerful the fan more air is displayed in so you can have a jets can be like the fire gravity but so it's not so I feel like it's not.
  286:   20: It's actually not really controversial to argue that a psych that an atomic scale. Cipher is, is in a sense pushing I'd be like there's like if you could push air towards the center, it's like so imagine. So imagine like an elevator has been compared to grab. Like if like gravity has been compared to an elevator, that is pushing that is accelerating upwards, right?

Which is sort of when I'm saying, but I'm, but we can, we can say. Okay, well actually there's there are forces of causation that are bigger than humans such as gravity.
  296:   53: The shape of space time that are that, that are imposing their own sort of causation on lower forces that our driving the micro arrangement of that is. And so at a higher, even higher level, there's the, they're the cosmic forces of the galaxy that are sort of very like, I would say that, you know, you we barely feel the effects of gravity is there.
  297:   55: So it's such a large scale think. I mean, I we feel that every day in terms of like your feet, don't leads around. So we do feel gravity of profound way so I just contradicted myself. But but, I mean, what I'm saying is that like As much as we feel gravity like that is the curvature of space.

Here gravity is just the curvature space and space cars around the maps. And the mass is creating an electric field, an election, magnet field That and in, in the electromagnetic field is curving away at the sun's ejection, but it should be, right?
  301:   114: Everything is, and that's, and it's like in it, you know, people have said, well, you know, maybe there's a graviton particle, maybe there's a gravity force, right? You know, that's what people have said, I say, okay, well, there's a strong force. Weak force, strong nuclear force, a weekly nuclear force, and maybe there's a force for gravity.
  302:   116: Some people have said that, so they want to. Okay, well, how do we, where does this other force go, right? And so, there's processes. But but then, you know, other people are like no, it's it's literally the curvature space and maybe there's no, maybe there's no gravity particle. Maybe there's no gravity force at all, right.
  303:   122: As in these particles, are at different sizes and they have different spins. And they have they have you know, or they have different volumes, you know, and they have different There's a, there's a color property.

So is more it it's like gravity it'll suck things into it to help it compute so it's not like there's gonna be a bunch of them because that's it that's that's that's not how it's supposed to that's not how it's gonna go so I I don't agree with that that you know, like so the end there's a bunch of novels like that that the deal with like the future with multiple AIs and and and the thing is like right now the key the situation is like there's like an arms race to be the first to build sentient AI because if you're if someone else, Built the the self-aware network 17 AI first then potentially they could use that to take over the world so you need to build your own so you can defend against the other persons so for a every country needs to build their own self-aware 17 AI to defend against the another country doing the same thing because imagine if um, you know, like we hear a lot of scarce we really hear a lot of scary stories about some of the some of the countries that are very far away and and they you know

  313:    952: -flammatory role, which was a hypothesis being a down regulation of the rest you do know anything about that. Not like I cannot play right now remember maybe it's morning and maybe if I really looking into but of course with MMD did she's very am for me I think crucial role in enthrallial like adiabaska and our modern system what we work is stem cell derived atomicides we extract and we expose them to different microgravity and then we realize the, That the the stress which has been marked and we try to chill with the couple of cross scavenger and with the supplement like vitamin E vitamin D and we really observe that vitamin D also very helpful in the like bringing back the stress down and bring a restoring the contractility functions, so maybe my work area spins around that so I don't really like cannot inside missing something so I cannot answer right now.
  314:    956: I'm just so interested. Okay, so I'm currently used to some in Germany and we're working with German aerospace center. It's similar to NASA where Ms. Research Center people work with different kind of modal system and basically we our team is looking for microgravity and it's and it's usability what does it mean like we have to utilize the ISS or international speciation for some better cause and where we can very quickly as utilize for the production where we cannot.
  315:    958: Skip gravity when we do some science in the lab, so what we do, we simulate gravity by several devices on the ground, we have parabolic flight which goes and simulate. Gravity for couple of second and different other like satellites small satellite rockets, and and of course you have ISS for real and then how does this happens because in stem cells they they've been resource that when you grow stem cells on space basically if you look at the bioreactor it continuously spin, it keeps the the cells in a floating condition, which is free falling a free falling, it's means like you.
  316:    962: Body doesn't act in the in the similar direction of gravity vector so that is the idea like if we consider cells on microgravity condition, so we can produce a lot of cells compared to to ground, so these are the things which mostly me and my. Colleagues here we do so we do basically human biology to understand how we can simulate disease on on gravity condition in the zero, g or moon g or mass g then how it beneficial to to to the to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology being affected by gravity.
  317:    968: So simple a couple of simple questions the first one is. What's your for the gravitational biology that you're studying. How much time of exposure to low gravity do you have by using these methods that you're around that you have at your hand? And then another question that must be it's probably very silly.
  318:    974: And the limits to forty hours the continuous exposure because since they are rotating and they are cells also generate some kind of gases and that's gases over the time accumulate and become very dangerous to the to the since the ones the cells produce the gas and the gas is bubble that bubble heats continuously so that brings another aspect of of physiological challenge than the gravity.
  319:    978: So hyperbarity micro gravity, then hyper gravity is basically crazy flight which goes up and, Perform some maneuver where you generate hyperbarability then micro gravity, but those are very limited like 20 second so which is very tricky to design your essay and perform something which you want to achieve during that time then you have then you have rockets sounding rocket which goes and stays up to 15 seconds to some 15 minute 5 minute to 15 minute and they are also you have to very careful design some experiment and perform and then, You send some satellite which is sometimes come back sometimes and then you design your study accordingly what you want to get out from the experiment or you want to retry sample for some downstream study like gene expression some protein look out or you send it to ISS through the so you mostly so use now specs is ramping up it's a exploit so all the the institute are line up for the species and then it usually comes in sometimes two months three months of.
  320:    980: Our day drop it simply without astronauts traveling back this is how the the experiments goes in a line so ground base and parabolic flight then then rocket science rocket sounding rocket then then satellite and then ISS and also the money also goes in the same proposal for ground-breast study which do not much investment users small instrument and you create moon or marsh gravity and then you expose yourself it's very dominant.
  321:    992: They they they develop a syndrome called chicken leg so that leg become thin because the pressure is no more they are and the blood supply become also no may not because they don't use it they don't use it neither there's something pulling factor and gravity. I have then this is why we have to understand why this and how we can help by understanding the hard physiology how we can if we are planning to.
  322:   1024: Yes, he has that's why I say this and there were exactly we are trying to address at one part at least to boost the heart and, Make it somewhere we can able to address and and exactly their the the neural thing involved which not my area research. Sounds like artificial gravity is going to be really important for long distance travel.
  323:   1026: Yes, they are creating their I think Boeing or Boeing is constructing one circular simulator, which will be continuously rotating and creating a gravity to help with the astronauts health. Yeah, that's the that's the right news you have.

  326:   318: Fitting a very coarse-grained version of string theory using a hundred or so entangled cubits and there's this whole initiative called quantum gravity in the lab and it's actually much more substantive than you would initially guess like they genuinely are stimulating things that look exactly like prototypes of spacetime it's it's becoming more and more parents space-time itself is emerging from some sort of quantum entanglement between some underlying degrees of freedom that we still don't.
  327:   716: Right and these are gravity which is the weakest force of all and gravity describes the curvature of the space in which the photonic interactions take place and there imagine now that there is something that interacts with strategy but for some reason it's not electromagnetic at all, so it does not interact with electrons this protons at all and this is the non-periodic matter 20 percent of the universe is the very idea and this the steps that somehow interacts with.
  328:   719: And this is us right you are interacting with photos everything that we touch the interactive visit with some kind of electromagnetic push against our fingers against our company as or electromagnetic-based hitting our readiness and so we cannot sense any kind of matter that is not interacting via photons except by measuring the gravity occasional effects that it has and they are very subtle because gravity is so weak it's very difficult to make a measurement for changes and gravity or several differences in gravity and by observing the move.
  329:   722: Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.
  330:   725: A mass in this region that is has is not aligned with the supernova that took place so the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter is that that observes this totals but some of the other stuff is still there you cannot just see it we cannot see it but we see that it exerts gravity and so by and large the dark matters seems to be slapped somewhat aligned is what the galaxies are doing but not completely and because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse of the balance itself the problem is dark forces between the dark matter so additional interactions that exist.
  331:   731: Percent of matter and the universe is not interacting because any of the elected dark forces but only this gravity itself, which is.

  335:    397: Two. Call from astronomy.com. Eventually you're going to be pulled apart by gravity right but they were just saying that you know, as you enter the horizon you are not going to like initially notice that your that you entered the the horizon of the black hole from your own perspective we because of the, I'm not I just like I read this and so I'm just actually ever this like years ago and so I'm sort of trying to find the the exact reference is sort of an answer question and maybe I can get I get get back to you.
  336:    418: Enter a king cos the black hole is that because of black hole warp space-time differently a different points what would essentially happen to your body is that it would get pulled they would get stretched, you know, some arbitrarily length long like imagine three miles long but it would be thinner than like a piece of paper or something like that and and the reason that this is happening is because, Gravity is acting differently at different points on your body, so you would experience completely different gravitational pulls and completely different micro densities at your body so but but the observer would not would not necessarily see this because you observing you in one particular inertial frame of reference as you're falling infinitely a closer towards the adventurizing without actually reaching it.
  337:    445: So in terms of dimensionality and physics but we tend to see is that regardless of how many dimensions you you're starting with but you know, there there are types of string theories where you have, you know, eating dimensional or eleven dimensional symmetry m theory, which is probably like the most popular version of this is based on eleven dimensional super gravity, but what tends to happen is that you know, these dimensions are really tiny and they tend to fold up so you iterate to.
  338:    457: And that actions within those spaces project down to a four-dimensional space where gravity is a constant. So Eric's theory is actually the only here I know those so far which argues that spacetime is not a fundamental but rather a projection of a higher dimensional space. So, you know it Eric's theory right now is a work very much a work in progress.
  339:    478: Against. String area and group quantum gravity that space time is not fundamental but I very much wary. Don Huffman's theories about space-time and physics. I do not think he I think he waxed the proper mathematical background and rigor in order to back up his theory. What about his mention of an another friend will be young when to mechanics to do we have to behave that?
  340:    517: ⟪ 492 characters skipped ⟫llapse there is do have the nice aspect that they could be falsifiable, at least the the ones that, It then if you have containment between math like massive things that the streets you know, if it's gravity that's causing the collapse if you're able to create into these entangled states between their containment and these mess massive enough states and you're not seeing collapse then that would refute those of object in the last theories.
  341:    859: ⟪ 280 characters skipped ⟫hat we're living in a simulation my the first thought that comes to mind is a what if there is a reality that we have an experience for can experience because I'll use this as an example, for example gravity and I'm pointing meters per square you're right or Square on earth and so we have a you know, billions and billions and billions of data points to prove that but and some far off universe somewhere or in some other person's experience gravity could we could actually have a repeatable data point that to actually disproves that right this is false about a falsification for science, so my thought is what if instead of you know, the simulation that we're quote unquote talking about is just something that actually exists outside of.
  342:    865: Yeah. I appreciate that question. I'll jump in us to meals wants to I. I keep coming back to the emotional component here that we are. We are experiencers of emotion and that our emotions play this really big role in how we interpret our world so I guess you know, I was gonna connect that to your question about gravity like for instance gravity what we we do know that gravity is only 9.8 meters per second squared on the surface of the earth and it changes even if you go to the mountains and that that changes depending on the size of the plan that you're on so there's a verifiability there.
  343:    868: But it's only verifiable in the under those conditions if you go to different part of the university experience gravity according to general relativity and it would just be whatever is the gravity in that that particular region so I guess you're asking about replicability of. Some kind of measurement of being in the simulation.

  383:     3: These notes that formulate the ground of the Self Aware Networks Institute, and the book Self Aware Networks, present new theory that ties together evolution, gravity, quantum physics, spacetime, cognition, phenomenological consciousness, cells, neural networks, LTD, LTP, dendritic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time dilation, and it's all sync'd together with the concept of oscillation.
  384:    10: Self Aware Networks: A longer explanation of my research, my past work, and what I have built. #Physics #Gravity #Math #Science #Quantum #Brain #ArtificialIntelligence
  385:    24: 6. I also created a new gravity theory, quantum gradient time dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of space in a particular direction with additional time dimensions. (I connected this to biology, explaining how neurons are literally warping space.) 
  386:    84: These notes are not ready for anyone to read them as they still need lots of editing & fixing. The book includes a new gravity equation hypothesis, a new model of a neuron, a new explanation for LTD & LTP, a new explanation for internal representations or qualia, a new explanation for how our bodies & brains are conscious, and much more.
  387:   157: I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on human phenomenological consciousness, memory, gravity, cells & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that it's not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but it's enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.
  388:   208: I bet a lot of people think it's unbelievable that someone would put all this together. Included in the contents is 1. a new theory of gravity, 2. human cognition works (including new ideas on LTP & LTD and how memories scale from synapses to the whole brain). 3. how to make sentient & self aware artificial neural networks (including a theory of neural networks actually work). That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.

map.mass.md:
   22     99: If its obvious that a mass such as the earth has gravitational force then it should be obvious that a mass such as a neuron has gravitational force, when a neuron fires it expands, the soma explodes, and the explosion has a direction which is the axon length. So a neuron is warping space like an exploding star warps space, the mass of the neuron has increased and therefore its gravitational force has increased.
   23:   103: Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.
   24    116: however lets say that in one of the directions space contracts into mass and a time dimension is added in the direction of that mass because space is moving faster there so we get twice as many particles
   25:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
   26    131: so its like condensed slow energy (mass) is pushing through lightweight fast energy, like a magnetic attracting and repulsing space, 

   35  a0033z.md:
   36:    8: "Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale." A mass like the earth heats up space time relative to outer space, expanding the number of directions around a particle temporally in addition to the spatial dimensions, because if a particle or atom moves in a random direction in space with no large masses nearby it has no particular reason to move one way or another, but if it has three times more opportunities to move south, because things in the south move three times faster, then the odds of it randomly moving south increase, thus gravity attracts particles by increasing the relative dimensions of time in the direction of mass and mass is the crunch point of an expanding wave on a macroscale.
   37:   13: Someone asked me what is the gist of my Gravity theory: The gist is that mass creates time dilation effects at the quantum scale, and that the aggregate effect of quantum time dilation results in a quantum field where the odds of particle movement are shifted in favor of the direction of dilated time. So particles fall towards mass because the odds of moving in the direction of mass are increased because mass increases the intervals of space in time in its direction.
   38    56: This would cause massless blackholes
   39    58: or energy holes at the points in space that are most distant from any particles and from any lines between particles, the energy holes would be vast expanses of space around oscillating mass
   40:   98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.
   41  

   65    112: so consciousness itself is a specific information configuration pattern, for processing information within certain bounds, just like how the gravitational energy effect of earth is reduced with the amount of distance from the center of earths mass.
   66:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   67    255: the density of mass is like the contraction of space through the increase in time frequency

   72  a0055z.md:
   73:   2: Note to self: There might be invisible gravity floating in space that is NOT from invisible mass. 
   74

  110:    10: (mass is part of a gravity wave)
  111     41: but not occupy the same space because their phases are not complimentary and the combined mass would dissipate too quickly (unless their combined mass had the right energy configuration)

  113     53: So at one end of space, space has no distinction, no area, no volume, no mass, and no energy.
  114:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
  115    196: The idea that I had was that the fermionic condensate of the mass of the earth was creating a vertical flow from the earth to space in the gradient of the particle field of spacetime,

  120  a0113z.md:
  121:    5: Gravity is not electrical force, its a time wave in the electrical force that is the inverse of mass
  122    24: But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it
  123:   40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.
  124    42: Mass has low frequency high amplitude inversely related to high frequency low amplitude electrons.

  146  a0184z.md:
  147:   48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.
  148  

  191    19: what if the frequency of a particle  is inverted to its amplitude effect on space? a slow particle would have more mass, a fast particle (energy) would have less mass
  192:   23: ⟪ 402 characters skipped ⟫space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.
  193    25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

  208    32: It’s not space that is being warped, well it is, but more precisely it’s time that is being warped in space, there are more dimensions of spacetime where the frequency of mass is higher, and so particles and atoms move towards the areas that have increased frequency of mass.
  209: ⟪ 326 characters skipped ⟫s the extra time dimension as extra space area, and if you roll the dice, the extra spacetime area gets better odds than the areas with less mass that have less spacetime area. It's kinda like saying gravity isn't an attractive force, so much as its a more statistically significant spacetime crystal for the otherwise random movement of particles & atoms & objects)
  210:   40: I might even rephrase this to Gravity is Quantum Probability Distortion from Mass Frequency Theory.
  211    72: Hmm... I wonder if this book linked below reached a similar conclusion about mass being like a time crystal? 

  228    43: mass is inverse to frequency
  229:   44: every mass at every scale (quantum gravity idea) has an inverted relationship to the spacetime around it
  230    46: mass is 1:1 with spacetime increasing in scale

  261  a0356z.md:
  262:   3: as the eye of a hurricane is to a hurricane, so mass curves spacetime, the mass is the eye of the hurricane, and it's spinning is cumulative, the cumulative of tiny hurricanes in the form of atoms, in the particle wind, so that's the reason there is gravity on large dense objects like the earth, the earth itself is isomorphic to a spinning hurricane, the earth would be the eye of the hurricane funneling space itself and everything in it towards the earth.
  263  

  283    14: So an electron is a mass with charge with a spin, and if its spin is removed then its not an electron by definition, but, by the same token if an electron is not really a fundamental particle, it's chargon+an orbiton+a spinon, that kinds says that an electron really actually can lose its spin, so spin is not intrinsic to particles after all. 
  284:   28: This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.
  285    32: In short the potential number of extra dimensions is every possible combination of mass, from the plank scale, the electron scale, the atom scale, and so on. Every particle combination, atom combination, virtual particle & below threshold virtual atom configuration is going to be space warping in a way that creates extra dimensions for particles to travel via time.

  290  a0397z.md:
  291:   31: Can we have a thought experiment where we think of Gravity as a reverse pressure gradient? Why or why not, only instead of pressure we are talking about the effects of spactime warping at the Quantum & Molecular scales, with aggregate effects from dense matter convergence such as with Fermionic Condensates. Lets create a computer simulation to model the shape of space time with a dynamic time gradient at the quantum scale, as mass converges and space expands as a unified process.
  292  

  321  a0464z.md:
  322:   29: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.
  323  

  390    45: so I'm more likely to move towards earth because the time diffusion gradient means that particles closer to the center of mass like earth are accelerating relative to particles further away (such as satellites)
  391:   47: Objects with mass exert gravitational force on each other, but specifically gravity is like a wave of particle concentrations, where particles are moving faster in time, but their experience because they are accelerating is one where spacetime 
  392    49: I am thinking that the mass of space is equivalent but perhaps not equal to space bending, such that protons, neurons, and electrons oscillate as a group, but its as if their topological shape is warped space wave reproducing in intervals of time a three particle wave oscillations that we think of as an atom. At the same time its movement in space over time is the movement of a smaller wave through a larger wave, so what I am suggesting is that space as a whole is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds 

  398  b0006y.md:
  399:   104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)

  532     44: So if you look at transplanting a director, current simulation, it is a a very light shock to the frontal lobes. And and so you, so with electro controls of therapy, a person could get so many, massive shocks to their head that they sort of began to feel sedated but maybe they're their brains were permanently changed and in damage maybe there was damage done that sort of like it's a dated that and in a long term way and maybe sort of inhibited their their brain function going forward and made them almost stable to mentally.
  533:   108: That is sort of keeping this stuff here, which is interesting because it's, it's like it's supposed to be that gravity is keeping your stuff. Here gravity is just the curvature space and space cars around the maps. And the mass is creating an electric field, an election, magnet field That and in, in the electromagnetic field is curving away at the sun's ejection, but it should be, right?
  534    110: So it's it's almost curving space. So solar flares, right? So it seems like the electric magnetic field of earth is curving away. The sun's flares and in into doing things like maybe the magnetic field is curving space and that's just like sitting right in front of us, it's curving space and in the context of pushing, way, solar flares and if it's curving space, in the context of solar flares, and if it's admitted from mass then and maybe the the

  633    820: Macrophages is great, but once you get this cytokine storm which leads to an upper leg regulation both these cytokines and also entrains the massive production of inducible magical site you get something which is yeah extremely basically yeah in trains barrier function comprised of barrier function the point about this is actually more than anything.
  634:   962: Body doesn't act in the in the similar direction of gravity vector so that is the idea like if we consider cells on microgravity condition, so we can produce a lot of cells compared to to ground, so these are the things which mostly me and my. Colleagues here we do so we do basically human biology to understand how we can simulate disease on on gravity condition in the zero, g or moon g or mass g then how it beneficial to to to the to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology being affected by gravity.
  635    994: To explore moon for long time for mass longer time how we can help at the same time how we can model the cardiac biology for the ground, what are the new things we observe and how we can for the aging for one we interesting thing we found that when we simulate with the we use cardio cells for the simulation we found that they are becoming the aged cardiac cells, so which to very good model can be for some some of drugs when people go age.

  644    276: Well, this is not the problem to explain the ages explanation for you talking is that you. Who's talking so. You're not massive to the big problem. You have to explain why in 1950s, we weren't up on Brown writes a novel about a civilization on Mars in their leader is called Eloy Give to Explain why Elon Musk rights sacrifice companies and gets it right every time.
  645:   722: Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.
  646:   725: A mass in this region that is has is not aligned with the supernova that took place so the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter is that that observes this totals but some of the other stuff is still there you cannot just see it we cannot see it but we see that it exerts gravity and so by and large the dark matters seems to be slapped somewhat aligned is what the galaxies are doing but not completely and because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse of the balance itself the problem is dark forces between the dark matter so additional interactions that exist.
  647  

  652     430: And so the idea is so research scientists and Italy were saying that black hopes to be like a hologram all the information is amassed in a two-dimensional surface able to reproduce a three-dimensional image in this way cosmic bodies. Well, so it's um, They they are so basically the black hole could be like a heart sort of like a hard drive that that stores a representation of a three-dimensional reality in in two dimensions and and or at least or perhaps even just the you know, in in in codes a representation of that reality.
  653:    517: ⟪ 442 characters skipped ⟫ically looking at interpretations the objective collapse there is do have the nice aspect that they could be falsifiable, at least the the ones that, It then if you have containment between math like massive things that the streets you know, if it's gravity that's causing the collapse if you're able to create into these entangled states between their containment and these mess massive enough states and you're not seeing collapse then that would refute those of object in the last theories.
  654     934: There's a massive interstellar gas that you can probably measure there are now interstellar objects, but there's a whole bunch of connections between reasons to believe that the property is free space between galaxies, but the principle of saying, hey if this thing was a simulation, how would it? Heat. How would it try and short circuit things?

  690:    29:    98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.
  691:    47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  692:    61:    2: Note to self: There might be invisible gravity floating in space that is NOT from invisible mass. 
  693:    82:    10: (mass is part of a gravity wave)
  694:    85:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
  695:    88:    5: Gravity is not electrical force, its a time wave in the electrical force that is the inverse of mass
  696:    93:   40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.
  697:    99:   48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

It's kinda like saying gravity isn't an attractive force, so much as its a more statistically significant spacetime crystal for the otherwise random movement of particles & atoms & objects)
  700:   121:   40: I might even rephrase this to Gravity is Quantum Probability Distortion from Mass Frequency Theory.
  701:   137:   44: every mass at every scale (quantum gravity idea) has an inverted relationship to the spacetime around it
  702:   140:   3: as the eye of a hurricane is to a hurricane, so mass curves spacetime, the mass is the eye of the hurricane, and it's spinning is cumulative, the cumulative of tiny hurricanes in the form of atoms, in the particle wind, so that's the reason there is gravity on large dense objects like the earth, the earth itself is isomorphic to a spinning hurricane, the earth would be the eye of the hurricane funneling space itself and everything in it towards the earth.
  703:   158:   28: This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.
  704:   164:   31: Can we have a thought experiment where we think of Gravity as a reverse pressure gradient? Why or why not, only instead of pressure we are talking about the effects of spactime warping at the Quantum & Molecular scales, with aggregate effects from dense matter convergence such as with Fermionic Condensates. Lets create a computer simulation to model the shape of space time with a dynamic time gradient at the quantum scale, as mass converges and space expands as a unified process.
  705:   182:   29: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.
  706:   214:   47: Objects with mass exert gravitational force on each other, but specifically gravity is like a wave of particle concentrations, where particles are moving faster in time, but their experience because they are accelerating is one where spacetime 
  707:   225:   104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)
  708:   292:   108: That is sort of keeping this stuff here, which is interesting because it's, it's like it's supposed to be that gravity is keeping your stuff. Here gravity is just the curvature space and space cars around the maps. And the mass is creating an electric field, an election, magnet field That and in, in the electromagnetic field is curving away at the sun's ejection, but it should be, right?
  709:   308:    962: Body doesn't act in the in the similar direction of gravity vector so that is the idea like if we consider cells on microgravity condition, so we can produce a lot of cells compared to to ground, so these are the things which mostly me and my. Colleagues here we do so we do basically human biology to understand how we can simulate disease on on gravity condition in the zero, g or moon g or mass g then how it beneficial to to to the to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology being affected by gravity.
  710:   321:   722: Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.
  711:   322:   725: A mass in this region that is has is not aligned with the supernova that took place so the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter is that that observes this totals but some of the other stuff is still there you cannot just see it we cannot see it but we see that it exerts gravity and so by and large the dark matters seems to be slapped somewhat aligned is what the galaxies are doing but not completely and because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse of the balance itself the problem is dark forces between the dark matter so additional interactions that exist.

    32     3: oscillating functional fractal isomorphism
    33:    4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
    34    10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

    87    111: its the attractive force of a spinning oscillator
    88:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
    89    120: Ultimately electrical force also stems as a property of the properties of its oscillator flow as well. 
    90:   122: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity
    91    124: Attractive and Repulsive Forces on Particles in Oscillatory Flow
    92:   127: In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 
    93    143: I make the argument that Space might have zero absolute and zero absolute time, just relative space & time, because they balance each other out like positive and negative charges, with space being more negative and time being more positivel Somewhere inbetween a moment that in summary equals nothing there is temporarily something. That something is a chaotic volumetric information pattern called mass in an otherwise harmonic & tonic oscillating spacetime field inbetween a single moment of nothing that is also, on the flip side of the coin, the ever present beginning of spacetime. 

   274    206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
   275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   276    212: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets
   277    220: This is leading to longevity as being about renewing, protecting, and preserving the coherence mechanisms perpetuating the bodies oscillatory continuation.
   278:   224: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
   279    248: a repelling oscillation
   280    285: oscillators that are dipoles that are driven by electricity and focused into fermionic condensates are going to increase temporal oscillation in their center like a planet,
   281:   289: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
   282    295: the space between two oscillators was mutually repulsive, as long as both were positive or both were negative
   283:   301: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth

   416:    92: the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space
   417:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles,

   445:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
   446    24: But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it

   720    48: (Relevant to the argument that we can create conscious living beings inside computer hardware, via simulated oscillations) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.25.497598v1

   833    21: but the field of space, as an electromagnetic field of oscillating phases, is going to have single particle observation disrupt spacetime itself because that particle is the time of flight from its refraction point to your mind now or in the future.
   834:   23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.
   835    25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.
  1321     77: # I mean to say that human imagination is essentially gan synthesis, or procedurally generated rendered patterns from neural activity bound by brainwave oscillations.

  1438    132: And so the elevators like this force is shooting up beneath. You like some particles are being pushed on your underneath your feet doing pushed upwards, right? And I'm in. And so I'm basically saying that that the force of the oscillations is creating the gravitational force. That feels like an elevator or particles being pulled down as if they're being pushed force.
  1439:   135: So in the double set experiment, you're actually firing photons. You're firing photons. And so there's force, where coming from the photon, emitter and that force, it's coming from the photonometer. That's fine. Firing the, the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an oscillating and oscillating mask the same way that an elevator is going to be equivalent to to gravity on earth.
  1440    138: And so that is going that the the double set experiment itself is interfering with the experiment because as it fires like photons it is basically is basically creating gravitational field that is warping space time and such a way that it's creating like the same sort of vertical lines that an oscillator would create but creating them from a being, right?

  1489    259: The splay state means the oscillations are now on opposite intervals. The area between two oscillations in a splay state is going to be anti-attractive for (synaptic or plant) growth, or relative to the areas between oscillators in sync.
  1490:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  1491    293: ⟪ 284 characters skipped ⟫ime moving at 30fps. As we speed up or slow down time we increase or decrease the chances that particles move in any particular direction, thus teasing out a particle trajectory (between synchronized oscillators), which is like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just it's just the direction with higher spacetime frame rates.

  1747     44: But yeah. So the idea is the, when the brain is focusing on something, it is selecting some small scale patterns, it's okay. Small scale set of memories that are represented by synaptic configuration, and it's magnifying them through oscillations and multiple scales. The also, the focus for oscillation is sort of like that is, which internal representation is the center of your focus.
  1748:   110: This is a focus now. They're also that's for their oscillatory activity is attracting them, you know. And in the same way they're gravity works my end in terms of like it's if you're creating a lot of signals, lot of synchronized signals and then that's going to work space time.
  1749    112: So so once you have the brain making patterns and remembering patterns, then you can you have feature representations and as we established the patterns, get scaled up into oscillations. So we have magnifying patterns to the brain, can focus patterns, it can they can and those patterns can now stimulate other patterns because they're affecting more areas of the brain simultaneously.

  1770    65: And yeah, and those are the, those are the kind and I, you know, I the wave pattern again I think its by itself is is also a nature right for me. They're being like in a solid state or in a way state but the constant sort of like a constant oscillation between, you know, testing and flowing like questing and flowing like, the solid state is like, the crest of the wave, and which is just like, it's almost like the whole wave posits for a second as a crest.
  1771:   71: And that. And that's why that, the particle either has a location or momentum. It's literally oscillating between being the wave being at at its peak pressing and then away sort of like, collapsing, again into the sea. And it's interesting to think of like the, you know, you think of how the moons gravity is affects the waves on on earth.

Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.

  1936    113: Oscillators want to influence other oscillators, some of them will just peck at other oscillators and make sure that other oscillators don't merge with them.
  1937:   117: So they will maintain boundaries between oscillators. Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.
  1938    123: Spinning configurations are possible where you can have two different oscillators that are interacting, but not merging, because they're just, they're not close enough to merge, there isn't enough combined gravitational influence to make a merger happen, or a merger just isn't possible because they are out of phase. I mean I am descibing the physical orbit of a planet as part of it's phase, as if the planet or star is actually a particle, and that particle is actually a wave, or the planet is the tip of a wave that is expanding into space and creating time & space that is a wave, or a macroscopy frequency.

  2432     37:   202: spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.
  2433:    38:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2434     52:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.

  2463    361:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.

   41: In particular, with a0010z, I was a little bit confused about why my theory of Quantum Gravity Time Dilation was predicting that time would be slower at the particle scale vs at the scale of human experience stretched across the scale of the cells in the human body, but then I remembered that because of the higher velocity of particles the effect of time dilation is reversed in actual effect. Thinking about this helped me fix some of the ideas in note a0010z, a couple of fixes added to note a0008z which was rewritten yesterday, it is surprisingly more interesting to me now than it was for many years, I had disregarded it, but I am fascinated by that note now. Note a0001z has a new 10 point intro for newbies since it sits near the top of the repo most of the time. In note a0002z I took that old poem and really expanded it to make it more interesting, it does not seem destined for the book. a0003z was a really old note from 2012 that contemplated the base level of awareness from an esoteric eastern religious perspective and I updated it to make it more interesting and more

   75: These notes, that formulate the ground of the Self Aware Networks Institute, and the book Self Aware Networks, present new theory that ties together new ideas on evolution, gravity, quantum physics, spacetime, cognition, phenomenological consciousness, cells, neural networks, LTD, LTP, dendritic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time crystal dilation, and all these new ideas are sync'd together with the physics of oscillation.

   88: 6. I also created a new gravity theory, quantum gradient time dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of space in a particular direction with additional time dimensions. (I connected this to biology, explaining how neurons are literally warping space.)

  150: These notes are not ready for anyone to read them as they still need lots of editing & fixing. The book includes a new gravity equation hypothesis, a new model of a neuron, a new explanation for LTD & LTP, a new explanation for internal representations or qualia, a new explanation for how our bodies & brains are conscious, and much more.

  223: I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on human phenomenological consciousness, memory, gravity, cells & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that it's not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but it's enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.

  274: I bet a lot of people think it's unbelievable that someone would put all this together. Included in the contents is 1. a new theory of gravity, 2. human cognition works (including new ideas on LTP & LTD and how memories scale from synapses to the whole brain). 3. how to make sentient & self aware artificial neural networks (including a theory of neural networks actually work). That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.
