  4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's

    7: Neurons are blowing your mind hehe. Thats a neuro-quantum-gravity joke.
   51: One of the weird perks of having a new unpublished theory of quantum gravity is that I have new quantum gravity jokes that I can't tell you about yet (until after the theory is published), lets just say for now that these jokes are mind blowing.
   76: Theoretical Neurophysics: Self-Aware Neural Networks (Real & Artificial), Quantum Gravity, & Brain Computer Interfaces.
  103: Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.
  109: In short gravity is not the electrical force
  118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 
  122: This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity
  127: In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 
  133: suppose repulsive force was like gravity assist

a0033z.md:
    6: New, written on June 16th, 2022, an easier explanation of my Gravity Equation
    7: 'Gravity is time dilation'
    8: "Gravity is gradient time dilation at the particle & atomic scale." A mass like the earth heats up space time relative to outer space, expanding the number of directions around a particle temporally in addition to the spatial dimensions, because if a particle or atom moves in a random direction in space with no large masses nearby it has no particular reason to move one way or another, but if it has three times more opportunities to move south, because things in the south move three times faster, then the odds of it randomly moving south increase, thus gravity attracts particles by increasing the relative dimensions of time in the direction of mass and mass is the crunch point of an expanding wave on a macroscale.
   13: Someone asked me what is the gist of my Gravity theory: The gist is that mass creates time dilation effects at the quantum scale, and that the aggregate effect of quantum time dilation results in a quantum field where the odds of particle movement are shifted in favor of the direction of dilated time. So particles fall towards mass because the odds of moving in the direction of mass are increased because mass increases the intervals of space in time in its direction.
   89: equation for quantum gravity
   97: resulting in gravity or spacetime waves in the electric field
   98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.
  100: electricity is gravity, magnetism is also gravity, magnetic waves, bosons, light, these are also gravity waves
  102: the whole em spectrum consists of gravity waves

  32: oh my goodness I just found all the missing anti-matter in the universe! I found it! I could not stay off twitter I had to come and say that. I have a new theory of quantum gravity folks! Just refined it tonight, and it connects to neuroscience.

a0047z.md:
   6: I'm a matrix hacker (math, code, physics, webxr, neural networks). A neurohacker (writing code for brain machine interfaces, I design new brain computer interface technologies, and I write about the quantum physics of neurophysics, quantum gravity, and I design space warping sentient self driving vehicles.) I'm a book author (in progress), a patent creator (in progress), a science institute founder (in progress), a software architect.
  10: I am writing a book about the quantum physics of neurophysics, how human phenominal consciousness works, how to hack the human mind with technology, the book includes a new extension of Quantum Gravity.

a0049z.md:
  206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  220: It also means that resurrections, astonishing feats of healing, walking on water, and defying gravity are each slightly more plausible.
  222: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 
  228: The Pyramid of Giza probably is a gravity defying warp capable spaceship that can cross between galaxies and between solar systems by manipulating spacetime around it.
  238: The idea is that, oh shit, the pyramid focuses electromagnetic energy in a way that is perpendicular to earths gravity, its reflection of electromagnetism with its tetrahedronsurface sends a fermion condensate beam through its center down into the earth
  240: earths gravity is not just sending out lanes from fermion condensates, its sending them out radially
  287: so in my hypothesis gravity on earthy is like a positively charged oscillation emitting hot waves into space that expand space time temporally causing gravity right?
  299: So the direction of the oscillatory flow of the whole machine is going to cause reverse gravity or the expansion of space between them, pushing the two objects apart OR changing the axis, so that the pyramid is in effect orbiting earth
  311: so an elevator flying straight up causes gravity in that elevator, but a rotating planet has the same effect without directional thrust because it is shaping or curving space to mimic directional thrust
  313: so earths rotating dipole or quadrupoles are more accurately the emission lines and lanes of quantum gravity and earths electromagnetic field
  320: so that the spaceship is out of phase with the gravity of earth, and that is like its orbiting earth inside of falling to earth, its fall is in a different direction so long as it has positive energy to sustain the direction of its flight
  332: this potentially reverses or interferes with the local em field of the earth creating anti gravity

a0055z.md:
   2: Note to self: There might be invisible gravity floating in space that is NOT from invisible mass. 
   4: I'm sure I wrote down what I was thinking about when I wrote this in another note. Note to self to look up all the notes on gravity later to connect all these ideas together.
   8: Is it possible for the oscillations of dna to be sensitive to something as remote as the oscillation of the gravity of neptune?

   10: (mass is part of a gravity wave)
   90: and that the forces of gravity of any object in space are acting on all objects in space, albiet that effect becomes very small at a distance
   92: the gravity of everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else, the dense oscillations of planets & galaxies grow hot particle lanes between them that also have a gravitational effect. So the area directly between earth and the moon should be hotter and faster than regular space
  128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 

a0113z.md:
   5: Gravity is not electrical force, its a time wave in the electrical force that is the inverse of mass
   7: So the configuration pattern of the electric field warps and ripples with formations that are gravity waves.
   9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  15: In a lecture called “The Law of Gravitation” Richard Feynman pointed out that people who want to believe that electricity and gravitation are the same thing will find out that electricity is much more powerful than gravity. 
  26: ⟪ 267 characters skipped ⟫the greater the chaos the more the force of electricity is diluted, the more the electrons align the greater the electrical force gets, this explains the difference between the electric force and the gravity force that we experience. A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned.
  40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.

a0118z.md:
  9: I think with category theory we can show that space is graviton invariant, it can behave as if gravitons are present even if they are not present, and this is especially important if we are thinking about gravity from the future affecting the shape of spacetime in the past and visa versa.

a0184z.md:
  48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

a0189z.md:
  13: The good thing about new quantum gravity physics equations is that they don't take up a lot pf space in a book. They are very small and efficient equations. This is just humor I am still trying to wrap my mind around what the real scale of this new 4th section to my book is going to be.

  23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.

However I will only dedicate a few pages to these ideas because what is a discussion of the neurophysics of consciousness like without a little speculation about the nature of the cosmos am I right? lol

While the idea that one person could have so many new ideas on so many diverse topics might seem unlikely its just that there are common physical mechanisms connecting all these different things, and really at the core of it its one new idea that has led to all the others.

  3: as the eye of a hurricane is to a hurricane, so mass curves spacetime, the mass is the eye of the hurricane, and it's spinning is cumulative, the cumulative of tiny hurricanes in the form of atoms, in the particle wind, so that's the reason there is gravity on large dense objects like the earth, the earth itself is isomorphic to a spinning hurricane, the earth would be the eye of the hurricane funneling space itself and everything in it towards the earth.

a0381z.md:
  18: ⟪ 267 characters skipped ⟫, pre-general relativity and quantum physics. Since general relativity time is known to be a dimensions of space, so events in the past can still change, and events in the future can be effecting the gravity of the present. What makes the present moment the present moment then? Is it some potential difference? Like an particle that averages a past geometry and future geometry together? Quantum physics discoveries this year are demonstrating that an event and its cause can give rise to one another, as if pencil rolling also cause the pushing of the pencil. Its bizarre to think of time as a nonlinear dynamic, which is why most people don't, but if you don't your pre-Heisenberg. the very thing that would cause changes in past and future is the uncertainty principle applied to gravity.

a0384z.md:
  49: "If human thought comprises non-computational processes,then how is the brain supporting these processes? To answer this question, Penrose appeals to physics, and claims that the theory of quantum gravity is likely to be the kind of physics required to explain a conscious mind. ... Microtubules, according to Penrose, support a substrate for the quantum gravity effects required for consciousness. "(H.Brighton/H.Selima - Artificial Intelligence: A Graphic Guide)
  69: At some moment, there will be need to address consciousness building models, making appropriate hypothesis and previsions and data analysis that may lead to some conclusions that lie on a different perspective than biology and quantum gravity. AI has this potential. But I think there is a lot more to do.

   7: 8. and the opposite energies of matter and anti-matter means that they repel each other, resulting in the opposite of gravity, and that same energy is responsible for the gravity of matter on matter, and the gravity of anti-matter on anti-matter
  34: ‎26. Gravity (the law of attraction) is matter curling around itself, because it is increasingly fed up with being one with (anti-matter), relative to the the total amount of peaceful space and the raw unbiased possibility of particle location.

a0387z.md:
   2: (oscillat, decoherence, super position, electromagnetism, conjecture, observer, vector, dissipation) Now I'm really certain that my Quantum Gravity Equation Hypothesis is a brand new exciting idea that replaces the extra dimensions in string theory. The Kaluza-Klein theory of extra dimensions led to string theory.
  28: This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.

a0391z.md:
  11: The geometry of spacetime is enough, and there is no need for anymore explanation because the geometry of spacetime is enough. Just as the geometry of water explains the ocean, and how the geometry of gravity explains why there are planets and stars and galaxies?

a0397z.md:
  31: Can we have a thought experiment where we think of Gravity as a reverse pressure gradient? Why or why not, only instead of pressure we are talking about the effects of spactime warping at the Quantum & Molecular scales, with aggregate effects from dense matter convergence such as with Fermionic Condensates. Lets create a computer simulation to model the shape of space time with a dynamic time gradient at the quantum scale, as mass converges and space expands as a unified process.
  33: Lets consider how gravity as a quantum gradient time dilation is pressurizing the spacetime field, and imagine how depressuring space might cause lift, or expansion.
  35: photons gain energy as they move toward gravity

a0404z.md:
  38: Your brain activity is changing all the time because of trillions of factors, criterial causation (information) your specific location, the angle of the light, your whole ecosystem, perhaps including gravity (shrugs) each neuron is weighing ten thousand plus sources of criteria (other braincells) to detect milisecond coincidences to adjust the electric potential firing criteria of other neurons, prepare long term memories, deliberate, calibrate, etc... so many jobs reconfigure the brain and trying to predict it might be like trying to predict the dice roll of a cube that has exabytes of possible configurations per cubic centimeter per milisecond
  52: 3. the brain activity would be immediately radically different because it's in a different location, different light, different gravity, different ecosystem, and the exabytes of possible configurations in a cubic centimenter would radically different the copy before it was done being made.

  10: Jan 21, 2018 (electromagnetism, emotion) Wow your thread got a lot of responses. Are you in a dark place or something? The thing is no one needs a reason to live. People live automatically without needing any reason, this because people are dissipative systems, isomorphic to a vortex, a system that needs to maintain its own equilibrium, because of the fundamental interactions, gravity, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and electromagnetism.

  37: or it's to say that space time and gravity is "in your mind"
  38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.

    4: # GRAVITY
   21: I hypothesize in my gravity equation that there's going to be like, there's going to be like a lot of particle collisions that will be going vertical between like directly to the planet and directly to space.
   64: But I think my height. My my hunch is that that it can is it's totally different. Depending on like the you know, what's going on in the quantum gravity field. So what I'm thinking is that the closure you are to plan it to earth to or to the center of the earth then they have more.
   99: # *These Gravity effects between particle lanes emerging from planetary bodies would be places where virtual entities (see my note mentioning virtual entities. See note a0130z.md ) similar to the concept of virtual particles emerge to exert forces between particles that increase time in the direction of the earth causing particles & atoms to fall toward the earth.
  104: (note here, but the principle of gravity is that the intervals of time from the direction of the earth are increased, because of the increased particle activity coming from the direction of the earth which dissipates from the center of the earth with distance. So because there is more particle activity below the atom, if the atom was doing a random walk in the middle of space with no nearby mass, near a planet it is preferentially going to move towards the planet, (the larger oscillator) because the relative intervals of time are increased in the direction of the planet which from the atoms perspective means that the chances of moving in any possible direction are increased in the direction of the earth because each new interval of time is like more space for a chance movement, changing the odds of which direction the atom will move)
  116: *So that's essentially it's happening in muscles, the electric field. Is causing the and the it's causing it's a force that is causing something to walk across the muscles that are contracting & tighting the muscles. The current is creating physical force that causes the muscles to cause us to contract. but specifically that force is accelerating time in a way that creates a gravitational effect at the biological scale contracting your muscles with gravity or with time dilation, or with the acceleration of time caused by electron movement that causes your muscles to crunch together.
  118: This is a new hypothesis about the effects of gravity at the biological scale! LOL! Is it correct? IDK. It's AWESOME IDEA though LOL! #Gravity #Biology Your cells manipulate gravity! #Science #Physics

Or if the destinations are random chance. Essentially the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.

Firing the, the light in a certain direction is going to be equivalent to like an oscillating and oscillating mask the same way that an elevator is going to be equivalent to to gravity on earth.

  102: They're supposed to and then let's say. And you also mentioned that the gravitron favorite fairground. Rides include. Oh, that's a fairground, right? I was like, I, I was like, what is the graviton? And I was, I, it made me. I started to think about the, the idea of a gravity particle.
  105: Do you buy that? There's a gravity particle, or would you say that? There's, there's no gravity particle and it's just like, just the curvature of space somehow. What, what do you think? Yeah, I mean I have a lot of different that's on it. The one that I like the perspective that I'm taking for the last few days, because
  108: It's all made of light some and so we're looking at like the solid time model rights like I'm getting and just because of it and the electron. So in this model, you would say that like we are very unique specify what it's all made of it with function. Something like this, that time is kind of a mother dimension and that gravity forces space you can form to the shape of time, which is emergent.
  114: So there's like all of these so I look at time is emergent and then gravity beating, you know, kind of forcing space into the shape of time. So that the time would be continuous, the space would be discreet and the fabric would be. So I like what I look at it that when there are a lot of different models that are treated my when I look at it that way, it's just right now at least to make the most estimate of everything is being made of right.
  120: Yeah. So, you know, light gravity and time have you ever positioned and supposed to different properties like that? But right now, I think I like, for like, the last 48 hours, I've been really digging now. So, at the, at the, when you think about like the universe that a fundamental, you know, particle level.

  244: And so it's like space time is not in in one sense because it's not curving. But what's happening? Is that changes in the direct? And in the, in the direction of particles is happening and it creates the functional, the increased, the functional appearance of gravity and space time. So we have an effect curving space time where there's no, where we have the effective curving space time, but that effect is the result of particle veins.

  110: This is a focus now. They're also that's for their oscillatory activity is attracting them, you know. And in the same way they're gravity works my end in terms of like it's if you're creating a lot of signals, lot of synchronized signals and then that's going to work space time.

b0106y ctpr.txt:
  71: And that. And that's why that, the particle either has a location or momentum. It's literally oscillating between being the wave being at at its peak pressing and then away sort of like, collapsing, again into the sea. And it's interesting to think of like the, you know, you think of how the moons gravity is affects the waves on on earth.
  75: All being interact. They're all being interacted with by the gravitational force. Right. There is an intro. There is interactivity between gravity and the electromagnetic fields because because, you know, we like gravity is sort of described at the at the classical scale or the the the molecule scale, right? But mechanical waves are really just fractals.

  6: After I had this idea about the the atom being a about Adams, combining to form like a ball, or a planet. And then that planet having like a beam forming isolation. Like if like if the if that entire like if the gravity of a planet is, if you consider it's going to create a lot of up and down traffic, so that vertically is going to create a vertical lane of oscillating, oscillating patterns in the face field that are it's going to that's going to disrupt.

b0108y ctpr.txt:
  10: Like you see? Okay, well here's here's the depiction of how the electromagnetic wave field but but it's like, okay. Well, if we just imagine that instead of pushing electrons that instead of pushing electromagnetism, which I guess as either electrons or waves, or both we're pushing air, I mean, it's like, it's kind of saying like, well how could air from a fan cause gravity because air is going to be pushing things away from it?
  14: But yeah, it's kind of it's kind of like well you know, well what so we. So we see gravity. It's like a reverse almost like a reverse fan where the air is slowing in the other direction, right? So, and and you can almost see like, well, how is that fan pushing air?
  18: It's it's, it's structure. It's equilibrium. It's cyclonic power. So it is so like a fan that it's displacing a cyclone as is spacing the the air. And as you can see like within the within the case of like you know jet engines, you know like the more powerful the fan more air is displayed in so you can have a jets can be like the fire gravity but so it's not so I feel like it's not.
  20: It's actually not really controversial to argue that a psych that an atomic scale. Cipher is, is in a sense pushing I'd be like there's like if you could push air towards the center, it's like so imagine. So imagine like an elevator has been compared to grab. Like if like gravity has been compared to an elevator, that is pushing that is accelerating upwards, right?

Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.

  51: I mean, at some point you could say, well, the macro scale of causation is the whole human being, and in the micro scale of causation is the protein. Which is sort of when I'm saying, but I'm, but we can, we can say. Okay, well actually there's there are forces of causation that are bigger than humans such as gravity.
  53: The shape of space time that are that, that are imposing their own sort of causation on lower forces that our driving the micro arrangement of that is. And so at a higher, even higher level, there's the, they're the cosmic forces of the galaxy that are sort of very like, I would say that, you know, you we barely feel the effects of gravity is there.
  55: So it's such a large scale think. I mean, I we feel that every day in terms of like your feet, don't leads around. So we do feel gravity of profound way so I just contradicted myself. But but, I mean, what I'm saying is that like As much as we feel gravity like that is the curvature of space.

  108: That is sort of keeping this stuff here, which is interesting because it's, it's like it's supposed to be that gravity is keeping your stuff. Here gravity is just the curvature space and space cars around the maps. And the mass is creating an electric field, an election, magnet field That and in, in the electromagnetic field is curving away at the sun's ejection, but it should be, right?
  114: Everything is, and that's, and it's like in it, you know, people have said, well, you know, maybe there's a graviton particle, maybe there's a gravity force, right? You know, that's what people have said, I say, okay, well, there's a strong force. Weak force, strong nuclear force, a weekly nuclear force, and maybe there's a force for gravity.
  116: Some people have said that, so they want to. Okay, well, how do we, where does this other force go, right? And so, there's processes. But but then, you know, other people are like no, it's it's literally the curvature space and maybe there's no, maybe there's no gravity particle. Maybe there's no gravity force at all, right.
  122: As in these particles, are at different sizes and they have different spins. And they have they have you know, or they have different volumes, you know, and they have different There's a, there's a color property. There's different in different ways that the different properties that basically, if gravity, if a gravity particle, can curves space to some degree.

It's really ridiculous let's say that but it's just rippling my mind and so you know, I'm just really curious if dark energy dark dark energy if there's just something that explains these these things that happen, right?
  2009: Because it helps us and it's a symbiotic relationship and it also like. So is more it it's like gravity it'll suck things into it to help it compute so it's not like there's gonna be a bunch of them because that's it that's that's that's not how it's supposed to that's not how it's gonna go so I I don't agree with that that you know, like so the end there's a bunch of novels like that that the deal with like the future with multiple AIs and and and the thing is like right now the key the situation is like there's like an arms race to be the first to build sentient AI because if you're if someone else, Built the the self-aware network 17 AI first then potentially they could use that to take over the world so you need to build your own so you can defend against the other persons so for a every country needs to build their own self-aware 17 AI to defend against the another country doing the same thing because imagine if um, you know, like we hear a lot of scarce we really hear a lot of scary stories about some of the some of the countries that are very far away and and they you know

   952: -flammatory role, which was a hypothesis being a down regulation of the rest you do know anything about that. Not like I cannot play right now remember maybe it's morning and maybe if I really looking into but of course with MMD did she's very am for me I think crucial role in enthrallial like adiabaska and our modern system what we work is stem cell derived atomicides we extract and we expose them to different microgravity and then we realize the, That the the stress which has been marked and we try to chill with the couple of cross scavenger and with the supplement like vitamin E vitamin D and we really observe that vitamin D also very helpful in the like bringing back the stress down and bring a restoring the contractility functions, so maybe my work area spins around that so I don't really like cannot inside missing something so I cannot answer right now.
   956: I'm just so interested. Okay, so I'm currently used to some in Germany and we're working with German aerospace center. It's similar to NASA where Ms. Research Center people work with different kind of modal system and basically we our team is looking for microgravity and it's and it's usability what does it mean like we have to utilize the ISS or international speciation for some better cause and where we can very quickly as utilize for the production where we cannot.
   958: Skip gravity when we do some science in the lab, so what we do, we simulate gravity by several devices on the ground, we have parabolic flight which goes and simulate. Gravity for couple of second and different other like satellites small satellite rockets, and and of course you have ISS for real and then how does this happens because in stem cells they they've been resource that when you grow stem cells on space basically if you look at the bioreactor it continuously spin, it keeps the the cells in a floating condition, which is free falling a free falling, it's means like you.
   962: Body doesn't act in the in the similar direction of gravity vector so that is the idea like if we consider cells on microgravity condition, so we can produce a lot of cells compared to to ground, so these are the things which mostly me and my. Colleagues here we do so we do basically human biology to understand how we can simulate disease on on gravity condition in the zero, g or moon g or mass g then how it beneficial to to to the to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology being affected by gravity.
   968: So simple a couple of simple questions the first one is. What's your for the gravitational biology that you're studying. How much time of exposure to low gravity do you have by using these methods that you're around that you have at your hand? And then another question that must be it's probably very silly.
   974: And the limits to forty hours the continuous exposure because since they are rotating and they are cells also generate some kind of gases and that's gases over the time accumulate and become very dangerous to the to the since the ones the cells produce the gas and the gas is bubble that bubble heats continuously so that brings another aspect of of physiological challenge than the gravity.
   978: So hyperbarity micro gravity, then hyper gravity is basically crazy flight which goes up and, Perform some maneuver where you generate hyperbarability then micro gravity, but those are very limited like 20 second so which is very tricky to design your essay and perform something which you want to achieve during that time then you have then you have rockets sounding rocket which goes and stays up to 15 seconds to some 15 minute 5 minute to 15 minute and they are also you have to very careful design some experiment and perform and then, You send some satellite which is sometimes come back sometimes and then you design your study accordingly what you want to get out from the experiment or you want to retry sample for some downstream study like gene expression some protein look out or you send it to ISS through the so you mostly so use now specs is ramping up it's a exploit so all the the institute are line up for the species and then it usually comes in sometimes two months three months of.
   980: Our day drop it simply without astronauts traveling back this is how the the experiments goes in a line so ground base and parabolic flight then then rocket science rocket sounding rocket then then satellite and then ISS and also the money also goes in the same proposal for ground-breast study which do not much investment users small instrument and you create moon or marsh gravity and then you expose yourself it's very dominant.
   992: They they they develop a syndrome called chicken leg so that leg become thin because the pressure is no more they are and the blood supply become also no may not because they don't use it they don't use it neither there's something pulling factor and gravity. I have then this is why we have to understand why this and how we can help by understanding the hard physiology how we can if we are planning to.
  1024: Yes, he has that's why I say this and there were exactly we are trying to address at one part at least to boost the heart and, Make it somewhere we can able to address and and exactly their the the neural thing involved which not my area research. Sounds like artificial gravity is going to be really important for long distance travel.
  1026: Yes, they are creating their I think Boeing or Boeing is constructing one circular simulator, which will be continuously rotating and creating a gravity to help with the astronauts health. Yeah, that's the that's the right news you have.

  318: Fitting a very coarse-grained version of string theory using a hundred or so entangled cubits and there's this whole initiative called quantum gravity in the lab and it's actually much more substantive than you would initially guess like they genuinely are stimulating things that look exactly like prototypes of spacetime it's it's becoming more and more parents space-time itself is emerging from some sort of quantum entanglement between some underlying degrees of freedom that we still don't.
  716: Right and these are gravity which is the weakest force of all and gravity describes the curvature of the space in which the photonic interactions take place and there imagine now that there is something that interacts with strategy but for some reason it's not electromagnetic at all, so it does not interact with electrons this protons at all and this is the non-periodic matter 20 percent of the universe is the very idea and this the steps that somehow interacts with.
  719: And this is us right you are interacting with photos everything that we touch the interactive visit with some kind of electromagnetic push against our fingers against our company as or electromagnetic-based hitting our readiness and so we cannot sense any kind of matter that is not interacting via photons except by measuring the gravity occasional effects that it has and they are very subtle because gravity is so weak it's very difficult to make a measurement for changes and gravity or several differences in gravity and by observing the move.
  722: Ment of the stars and filter earth that's allowed in space we notice that there must be additional mass and the universe to explain the curvature that you observing and being know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on but the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected which means that there is.
  725: A mass in this region that is has is not aligned with the supernova that took place so the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter is that that observes this totals but some of the other stuff is still there you cannot just see it we cannot see it but we see that it exerts gravity and so by and large the dark matters seems to be slapped somewhat aligned is what the galaxies are doing but not completely and because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse of the balance itself the problem is dark forces between the dark matter so additional interactions that exist.
  731: Percent of matter and the universe is not interacting because any of the elected dark forces but only this gravity itself, which is.

   397: Two. Call from astronomy.com. Eventually you're going to be pulled apart by gravity right but they were just saying that you know, as you enter the horizon you are not going to like initially notice that your that you entered the the horizon of the black hole from your own perspective we because of the, I'm not I just like I read this and so I'm just actually ever this like years ago and so I'm sort of trying to find the the exact reference is sort of an answer question and maybe I can get I get get back to you.
   418: Enter a king cos the black hole is that because of black hole warp space-time differently a different points what would essentially happen to your body is that it would get pulled they would get stretched, you know, some arbitrarily length long like imagine three miles long but it would be thinner than like a piece of paper or something like that and and the reason that this is happening is because, Gravity is acting differently at different points on your body, so you would experience completely different gravitational pulls and completely different micro densities at your body so but but the observer would not would not necessarily see this because you observing you in one particular inertial frame of reference as you're falling infinitely a closer towards the adventurizing without actually reaching it.
   445: So in terms of dimensionality and physics but we tend to see is that regardless of how many dimensions you you're starting with but you know, there there are types of string theories where you have, you know, eating dimensional or eleven dimensional symmetry m theory, which is probably like the most popular version of this is based on eleven dimensional super gravity, but what tends to happen is that you know, these dimensions are really tiny and they tend to fold up so you iterate to.
   457: And that actions within those spaces project down to a four-dimensional space where gravity is a constant. So Eric's theory is actually the only here I know those so far which argues that spacetime is not a fundamental but rather a projection of a higher dimensional space. So, you know it Eric's theory right now is a work very much a work in progress.
   478: Against. String area and group quantum gravity that space time is not fundamental but I very much wary. Don Huffman's theories about space-time and physics. I do not think he I think he waxed the proper mathematical background and rigor in order to back up his theory. What about his mention of an another friend will be young when to mechanics to do we have to behave that?
   517: ⟪ 492 characters skipped ⟫llapse there is do have the nice aspect that they could be falsifiable, at least the the ones that, It then if you have containment between math like massive things that the streets you know, if it's gravity that's causing the collapse if you're able to create into these entangled states between their containment and these mess massive enough states and you're not seeing collapse then that would refute those of object in the last theories.
   859: ⟪ 280 characters skipped ⟫hat we're living in a simulation my the first thought that comes to mind is a what if there is a reality that we have an experience for can experience because I'll use this as an example, for example gravity and I'm pointing meters per square you're right or Square on earth and so we have a you know, billions and billions and billions of data points to prove that but and some far off universe somewhere or in some other person's experience gravity could we could actually have a repeatable data point that to actually disproves that right this is false about a falsification for science, so my thought is what if instead of you know, the simulation that we're quote unquote talking about is just something that actually exists outside of.
   865: Yeah. I appreciate that question. I'll jump in us to meals wants to I. I keep coming back to the emotional component here that we are. We are experiencers of emotion and that our emotions play this really big role in how we interpret our world so I guess you know, I was gonna connect that to your question about gravity like for instance gravity what we we do know that gravity is only 9.8 meters per second squared on the surface of the earth and it changes even if you go to the mountains and that that changes depending on the size of the plan that you're on so there's a verifiability there.
   868: But it's only verifiable in the under those conditions if you go to different part of the university experience gravity according to general relativity and it would just be whatever is the gravity in that that particular region so I guess you're asking about replicability of. Some kind of measurement of being in the simulation.

    3: These notes that formulate the ground of the Self Aware Networks Institute, and the book Self Aware Networks, present new theory that ties together evolution, gravity, quantum physics, spacetime, cognition, phenomenological consciousness, cells, neural networks, LTD, LTP, dendritic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time dilation, and it's all sync'd together with the concept of oscillation.
   10: Self Aware Networks: A longer explanation of my research, my past work, and what I have built. #Physics #Gravity #Math #Science #Quantum #Brain #ArtificialIntelligence
   24: 6. I also created a new gravity theory, quantum gradient time dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of space in a particular direction with additional time dimensions. (I connected this to biology, explaining how neurons are literally warping space.) 
   84: These notes are not ready for anyone to read them as they still need lots of editing & fixing. The book includes a new gravity equation hypothesis, a new model of a neuron, a new explanation for LTD & LTP, a new explanation for internal representations or qualia, a new explanation for how our bodies & brains are conscious, and much more.
  157: I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on human phenomenological consciousness, memory, gravity, cells & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that it's not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but it's enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.
  208: I bet a lot of people think it's unbelievable that someone would put all this together. Included in the contents is 1. a new theory of gravity, 2. human cognition works (including new ideas on LTP & LTD and how memories scale from synapses to the whole brain). 3. how to make sentient & self aware artificial neural networks (including a theory of neural networks actually work). That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.
