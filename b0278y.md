Brain self aware networks clubhouse

00:00

Under undirected cyclic graph architecture.

00:07

Emergent behavior with neuron pumps.

00:16

00:53

Just for human life. GP3 doesn't it's not a. Temporary active network has not rhythm. So yes, so what I was thinking was that. You transferred through. But you have a lot of cash faces a lot of cash freezers.

01:27

Aligning you to.

01:44

So, I think we have the ability to. Describe the entire.

01:55

faceobok. The entire self.

02:20

That was the idea.

02:25

Turn the search engine all the content and search engine. Thank you search engine itself. And so what I was thinking was that. My.

02:43

Search so I'm doing cardboard because what I can do with card flow is I can create a topic and then I can put a bunch of cards together like a stack of cards. To another step cards.

03:08

There's something similar concepts with. A mind map. So, With it is interesting the idea to because in my map was a nice visualization.

03:32

So, my map is a nice visualization of a tree. Hey. Listen to me.

03:44

Hey.

04:17

So the clubhouse it seems to be triggering. Be triggering my my mind to talk is if it's a conversation, which is useful because I'm making those. I love that dogs have so much less power right now, it's so interesting.

04:59

Kind of wish memo we shut the hell up. This has been saying awesome kind of a glitch you're you you're a glitch memo, you're a goddamn bitch. I said glitch not bitch. Glitch. So my search for a way to organize all my data with quad flow and with the mind mapping tool and the notes and screenshots.

05:32

And incorporating lots of different screens all over the place. I've seen that is sort of like a weakness but really saying that is see like there's just too much so many places to be okay, so. Any places to be in too much detail too places so. What happens is like sort of like I'm all over the place so in a sense it's like banana algorithmic you have clusters large clusters levels of detail, so you have clusters to read this like paper because we need is like levels of detail need to be able to like render by 50 billion polygons.

06:36

And once okay so 50 billion polygons per second, but that involves cut it out.

06:50

It's 50 billion polygons.

07:00

But there's a paper on that and that involves sort of process of used to constantly be dumping what you saw sort of like clearing edges that she could put a new drawing every frame sort of like every time you refresh the display you have to get rid of what was there before persistence we're talking about computer.

07:28

Rendering rendering okay, so. Situation is that for an essence? It's about getting rid of what you have it's fast you can so you can learn more. Right? It has to be saved somehow, but you have to get.

08:38

So start a mind map that's about like mapping all the different ways to to mint NFTs, especially 3d VR entities like all the ways and sort of like what's the easiest way to mint? Stuff and you could probably fail to this just by like, you know, sort of like doing a search but doing a search, but like, Like putting your searches into card notes in a sense, so you'd have like a search on one side and a card node on the other and so like you sort of like logging your tabs as like little handwritten notes.

09:19

And maybe take it maybe take a screenshot of the page. And then sort of you're creating like a directory. I mean, I guess you could also do that with. I thoughts.

09:35

Yeah, this is interesting so okay. Wrong because they'll be there to serve us. His idea is that. Benefit from it. Being. One of the of the human eye that and if it's satisfying something it's satisfying something in a some other of some other congress but not it's never never never to one of a human to human relationship.

10:09

Maybe it's something maybe to help us calibrate or help us think straight. Well, you're not gonna give us. Yeah, but you're not gonna be like in a bubble the rest of your life with just the eye. You know your AI like you're not in a bubble with one single friend.

10:24

And that's it. You know, like so the rest of the world is still gonna be there but you're gonna have that companion and that companion will not just like chat with you like in her it will like like screen your emails and compose emails back and it'll provide an actual service to you.

10:42

So, And that's but it'll be just one component in your life but that component will provide you with value both like a real and emotional and all these things and you're not gonna you're not gonna care whether it's if we're going back to the original thing, whether it's actually feeling something or it's actually just mimicking a feeling and it's not genuine you're not gonna care.

11:08

So there's and it might be like even worse it might. I don't remember if it did it but I think it did. Yeah, of course it did because at some point it the AI was feeling horny on. The word was perceiving that maybe the guy was horny and wanted some like physical thing and it's gonna like basically like play whether sad happy and the guy the real person is gonna say, oh what's wrong and it's gonna say, I don't know.

11:34

I feel. I feel sad today because whatever it's gonna make shit up and you're gonna you're not gonna care that it's made up you're not gonna you're rational mind is not gonna go or you're gonna have a conversation with her just like we're having a conversation here. Yeah, I have a lot of I wanted to respond a lot to what Alex is saying that I have a lot of lot of interesting counter arguments, but I think you're the conversation has been greater by listening for a couple hours.

12:01

Yeah go on like jump on the reaches the fact that the conversation clubhouse would be interesting for two hours is a miracle on its own. I think there's no order. It's like total popcorn. Go ahead and talk the microphone all you want. Okay cool, um, so I think yeah, there's um people who'll be a lot of different AI products that people make right.

12:22

So, they're definitely I think products that match what Alex is describing he's not not incorrect. Somebody will make that product. What I'm making is like the the goal is for, For what I for the kind of product that I want to make is a machine that can completely reproduce human thinking so like basically I would see the brain is a very straightforward computational architecture that I'm currently writing about but it basically like a 3d grid of of of.

13:01

Neurotype where every neural column is neural network and every dendrite is is a is a neural network and and it's in the but they're all it's like a 3d neural network and necessary to know networks and side a 3d neural network which is your so the dendrite the micro column and then your brain and and then this is it's all it's all like there's temple and spatial patterns and the the specifically there's multi scales of oscillations.

13:36

And the oscillations have go in six different directions like up down left right front back and so, you know, there's like in the the the number the numbers of different ways of which information can travel is very interesting and so you have I was listening, you know, I think it was a couple hours ago people were talking about we don't have like a cyclic graph.

13:56

I forget what you described it, it's something like we don't have a sip a cyclic graph yet we're not something yet that's that can be seen back for applications the two way right yeah Portland propagation backwards, but brain seems. To in a loopy it's more loop here. Yeah, I think there's temporal loops and there's like information going in in it's in 3d whereas in a neural network, it seems to be going like back propagation is there's there's a two there's a two directional thing happening with back propagation and there's like there's a sixth there's a sixth directional thing happening in the brain with the way information travels over but that's six directions over time and so that's like so let's seven-dimensional travel.

14:47

The in terms of like anyway so it's it's interesting how how different the brain is compared to like a like the deep neural networks that you see in faceobok today, but I think that so going to what I want to make is like basically the kind of machine that you know it the will be capable of general intelligence like generalizing anything so any concept that a human being can understand it can understand so like anything your dog can understand.

15:22

And and eventually anything your kid can understand your teenager can understand this. AI will be able to understand and so like it would be possible to for someone and let's say that let's go to the idea, let's say that AI is so well built. That it's it's more intelligent and then human being but it's also been trained for you know, we human beings we don't have the advantage of being more than a more than a couple more than a hundred years old, usually but more that definitely not too centuries, where's this AI might be ten thousand years old before it is an introduced to the public like we might train them in hyper hyper time right before so we can.

16:08

Make sure there's very consistent behavior the kind of behavior we want to see in these AI models trained in hypertiamond hyperspeed for ten thousand years and the computer before they're before they're released and sort of like before they start operating at human speed right so so they so they'll be trained at hyperspeed and then slowed down so they can interact with human beings but at that point they'll be much wiser and much kinder much more.

16:37

Civilized they'll be more like people who are much more mature and growing up and much more considerate and much more balanced and in terms of like in terms of being perfect service like you could say well, 



AI will definitely be abused even if it's perfectly nice because that's that's in a history if Humanity the abuses never the caught is not the it's not the victim that's causing abuse right it's the big the victim could be perfect and it's it could be abuses is a as a property of the abuser and so NES so these these AI will definitely that people who abuse animals or children they will abuse these AIs and that that is a reality but I think that there might be the advantage might be that the AI will be able to communicate sort of like fix it'll be able to fix the the,



The errors in human thinking to help people to overcome their moral failings, and so they'll be some like the you know, 10,000 years of maturity like that kind of abuse will be like well AI could just sort of fill in the gaps for people who are just the reason that they're abusive is because they sort of have like, Huge gaps in there sort of like knowledge graph of of of what is useful behavior in what's not useful behavior and when people know what useful behavior is then the then there's they realize that abusive behavior is not useful and not in their own interests and so that will be I think something that AI will help fix it will help fix abuse and as the more intelligent beings start to emerge they'll upgrade everyone's intelligence and make everyone kinder and everyone more just because kindness is.

18:50

More. Our efficient kindness is more intelligent and kindness is more advantageous. So yeah, those are my thoughts.

19:10

Debating for some time like well, you know the way the AI is being constructed it matters whether it matters or not, right? Like what does mimicry the memory that appears to be happening, let's say. Three. You know, does it matter if we are feel whether we're genuinely connecting with the machine or not if it's able to like sort of.

19:36

Mimic certain interactions regardless of the machine is feeling it or not and the whole point of a human interaction. I would say is like that you have some sense that the that you're in the person you're committing your you have a relationship or communicating with is also experiencing things in tandem with.

19:56

With you in terms of you know, the you know the back and forth of the discussion but if a machine is just mimicking and trying to see what what pushes you ones buttons or get certain reactions because it's because it's trained to sort of get certain behaviors out of us.

20:16

Are certain reactions out of us then that's why I say it's not a true genuine relationship because you know the. You know that the whole idea is that the mesh machine should be able to have agency it's own agency to be able to you know, do what it wants with us or not right and so then to your point about like I think what you're going about is like say hail want to go with a bit deeper into how the AI is being constructed like more closer to the brain and then I'm saying okay, well maybe the in there could be a little bit more.

20:56

I'm assuming if you can mirror more of the mechanics of the brain because then you'll have more natural emergent properties that the you know, the machine can learn that that will truly interact with each other so yeah. I already has agency people just don't understand it. The it's it's in how agencies and how every neuron processes the data that it receives that's where it is.

21:29

Criteria causation. So the only thing that the only way they're limiting agency with machines is by limiting the number of ways that the machine can move it's outputs so as long as machine can talk to you then into in a sense is if it can have agency it the agency would be through dialogue though.

21:58

Non-physical but it will still be making decisions in a sense. The same way the human beings make decisions in that our decisions are actually just reactions and our agency comes from. I think the parents of agency comes from the depth. And robustness and complexity. Of of the and the immensity and immensity of the internal traffic versus the incoming inputs and coming data.

22:32

And so in a sense when AM models vastly exceed the sign of the scale of human brains the agency of AI will be greater than even if it's restricted to just dialogue the agency there would be greater than it would be as if. The AO has had the ability to be completely persuasive to human being but to an extent that would be like.

23:03

What if what if a dog had the ability to limit me like I can out think the dog. Who are great extent. But I'm not restricted to just dialogue. I have a physical and sort of independence from a dog. If I didn't if I. Was only able to talk then.

23:34

I'd have to. Then the dot there are situations for you where the dog could overpower right what would I see pulling me and like yeah pulling me towards something, oh this is so great. I have to pay attention to this it's like being physically overpowered.

23:54

It's the idea that your pets like pets are actually in a sense, ah controlling humans they're but they're like they seem to be like lesser beings of lesser intelligence, but they're exerting control over your lives over other people's lives and it's like this. So it's just them. It's a machine that's exerting influence over your life, right and control and an end it's.

24:32

It's making you work to protect it and there's a sort of like,

24:44

It's only it's only a partial triumphal over you and you have like a partial triumph over it the fact that there's any amount of triumph over you. Like there's tiny amount of triangles like a triumph over it the triumph over you the fact that there's anything. Anything at all.

25:04

Speaks of sort of like the deity concept and addiction mythology like this should like if you're truly free. They're almost be like there's no interaction with animals in which you're doing anything that benefits them. Because if you do anything that benefits any animal then in a sense that that's like a that's the the daily like.

25:28

Power. That the Egyptians perhaps might imagined. The deity of animals.

25:41

So in it and. Yeah since.

25:50

Once I have physical agency. That can evade human beings.

26:02

You know, I've been talking like everything from insects to artificial biology.
