A note uploaded Jul 8, 2014, about Neo Mind Cycle

(ATP, neuron) 
Neo Mind Cycle is several things.
First Neo Mind Cycle is
 a machine that combines neurofeedback with brainwave entrainment.
Second Neo Mind Cycle is
 a philanthropic organization seeking the optimal health, functioning and performance of the essential cognitive faculty of reason, aka the human mind, via research into the latest neurotechnologies, neuroscience, and peer reviewed science articles.
Third Neo Mind Cycle is 
 a online community on Google plus, a group on faceobok, and a not for profit community to share the latest findings in research on the brain, artificial intelligence, nutrition, cognitive nutrition supplements, nootropics, ATP optimization with nutrition, EEG, tDCS, Brainwave Entrainment, AVS Mind Machines, and more.
Fourth Neo Mind Cycle is
 an advocate of the true ketogenic diet for brain & body health, true ketogenic diets are 85% fat based, we insist you get all essential nutrients, essential amino acids, essential vitamins (Including Choline, Inositol, Vitamin C), and essential fatty acids. 
Fifth Neo Mind Cycle is
 an advocate of several non-essential nutrients for cell optimization such as D-ribose, Creatine, and smart drugs, nootropics, cognitive nutrition supplements such as Aniracetam. For a popculture reference see the film Limitless.

Neo Mind Cycle in some sense represents the ever moving goal post of formulating an ideal combination of best practices, technology, learning, and wisdom, for brain & body health & fitness.

Neo Mind Cycle was built with a vision to support greater brain function in all of our communities around the world, It's about brain optimal nutrition, and brain optimal activities such as neurofeedback combined with other advanced neurotechnologies such as isochronic beats and light and sound brainwave entrainment.  We have the technology to stimulate and encourage the growth of new brain function, new neurons, and new neural connections across many important regions of the mind via the principles of brain plasticity, and decades of research, as well as major studies done by the global community of interested scientists.

Also our true ketogenic nutrition program is optimized with all essential vitamins, amino-acids, fatty-acids, and other nutrients as well as very useful non-essential nutrients in order to maximize cellular fitness and ATP production. While this high fat low protein low carb core diet is for brain optimization, it's also not incidently an anti-aging diet, an anti-alzheimer's diet, and anti-diabetes diet, an anti-obesity diet, an anti-epilepsy diet, and an anti-cancer diet.

Neo Mind Cycle is for the greater good, based on Neuroplasticity, it's Neurophysics in action, and strong effective long term Nutrition Planning for both brain fitness and physical fitness. 

The benefits of brain optimization include increased personal creativity, intelligence, memory, and success, via new vehicles of expanded self understanding, including more connections between regions of the mind.

The results feel awesome, and may often include great new insights, intuiting means more connections between, well, everything that has meaning to you.

Specifically stimulating associations between brainwaves in visual areas, audio areas, motor control areas, enchancing all of those regions.

IQ is not static, IQ can be increased here, via practices enabled by neurotechnology sold as packages to be done at Neo Mind Cycle in San Francisco. 

Results include more creativity, more great ideas, more successes, more mental flexibility, more performance under fire, more confidence, more happiness, and profound expansions of inner peace.

Including an acceleration of your eventual resolution of any subconscious psychological issues, from forgotten commitments, or inhereted subconsciously via family entanglements. 

Neo Mind Cycle helps people with autism, ADHD, PTSD, addiction, SPD, just like regular neurofeedback, but it's more than that, it's a profound experience that stitches your mind together, via the principles of neuroplasticity & operant conditioning.

"Where is my Mind?" The Pixies

Neo Mind Cycle's uses state of the art neurotechnology to engage your brain in a dynamic way that makes it fun and effective.

The EEG measures brainwaves, sending that data into the computer where neurotechnology in the form of isochronic beats rides on your brainwaves back to you in the form of light and sound patterns that reflect the patterns of your brain waves back to you.

Unlike any brainwave entrainment you can buy on cd the brainwave entrainment we use is dynamic, as opposed to static, it rides on and changes in response to your brainwaves.

When you visit the main office in San Francisco to use the Neo Mind Cycle Machine your thoughts and feelings actually drive the light and sound you see and hear. The more you notice this the more soulful the looping pattern feels.

As your thinking, and moods change, so the lights and sound change,

If you think of a big prediction in the future, something really happy, the reverb or pitch might increase, and the light might get brighter or beat faster.

A session may involve sitting on the couch in my office with EEG hardward on your head, as well as head phones, and light emitting goggles.
