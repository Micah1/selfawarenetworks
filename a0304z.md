(cortex, layers) Artificial Cortex (Neo Mind Cycle 2)
It would be neat if future Augmented Reality allowed me to illuminate the world around me. Like colored in night vision. I imagine this is what extra layers of cortex are doing for me, adding color spectrum and light spectrum as needed to amplify my awareness of my surroundings.

In this way Augmented Reality glasses could be the most natural way to sort of merge our minds with Artificial Intelligence in a natural way. Such glasses and headsets could be equiped with a varity of bio sensing brain computer interface sensors but we could make full use of the entire library of work in the topic of biology to non-invasively link the human being with intelligence enhancing artificial intelligence, it would in theory extend you, your mind, with a sentient external cortex.
