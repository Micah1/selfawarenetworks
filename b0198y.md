Puzzle Pieces Causation Consciousness

00:00

So, what I want to talk about here is the idea of the book being about puzzle pieces. The argument is that we've all that. So, okay, so and I recap, so I want to talk about my journey to sort of in the first third of the book to sort of give a contact for when I encountered certain ideas and and and how they affected me.

00:33

And, and how I came to recently, think of some of the amazing concepts that I found is puzzle pieces. And so the argument of the book essentially is to to change because I I've often heard in arguments about neuroscience that bridge neuroscience and how to build artificial general intelligence or where AI super sentient AI or just conscious AI over self-aware AI that's conscious and sentient and able to learn any type of knowledge.

01:15

So as a general at the same time as being conscious and self-aware and able to make internal representations. And so what I'm what I'm gonna argue is that basically all the puzzle pieces. Add up to, we do know what consciousness is that there's just a bunch of public pieces all over the place.

01:43

And so that is the book. The books narrative basically is to pull up all of the puzzle pieces. Across, you know, different discoveries and neuroscientists from different professors different authors, different teachers and different. You know you know researchers and but also to tie it but to tie together some concepts from from technology, not not that.

02:21

I believe that you know with technology we have lots of interesting analogies but this book intends also to get precise like me. So, like you've seen many neuroscience, there are many neuroscience talks and about consciousness that that it's sort of dance around that they sort of like say, oh well we're just gonna like throw up our hands with the idea that we're going to be able to tell you today, how what your brain is doing is pretty is producing phenomenal.

03:00

The the phenomenology of of life experience, we're going to just like handwave that is okay like if we're realistic like how the brain does that is not the discussion. Today we're going to talk about what we do now and the pieces that are that will put in together. And there's been a large been a lot of talks sort of like that where everyone's saying, we don't know how consciousness works, or even how to define consciousness, or what self-awareness is and do you have to have consciousness to and self-awareness?

03:38

Or can you have one without the other? Can you be can you have the phenomenology of experience without itself? I and I like that. That question is like well you know, what is this? What is the self if not at the very least, some sort of If the brain at the root is, is sort of.

04:07

So I like the, the, there's a talk, I had to talk where a neuroscientist talks about the brain is for movement because animals have highly coordinated movement, they walk around and they they get food and then get shelter. And they reproduce trees have movement, plants have movement, but it's not highly coordinated, and that's the distinction we'll make from between.

04:33

Trees can grow toward plants can grow towards the sunlight, for example, but for a tree to be able to get up and walk around, it's going to need it's going to need a nervous, a nervous system and a brain. And but it's, I mean, that's there's different degrees. It's gonna need it's gonna need something more than what it has.

04:59

It's gonna need at least the most primitive type of brain and so we can look at evolution and everything. See. Well what is what is the you know, there's that there's a spinal cord. The brainstem the brain is this, there's a good book. That's great books, bad evolution. But but really, what?

05:25

What I want to just sort of focus on is at this moment, is that in the context of the brain is for highly coordinated movements? Then at the minimum, the self could be thought of as a is a directional concept. As in you can you can move forward. And that's forward, you can move backwards or you can stand still where the self is and the self, is that directional concept, but this is this sort of point.

06:04

That's always there. It's always consistent. It's always the observer point, right? That's the the observer point is where it's the one thing it's like, okay. So you can change rooms but you're always there and every room because the self is this direction of concept that is separate from the environment.

06:31

It's the direction of you in the context of movement and that's why I use actually the term direction. It's a direction that's not any other direction. It's not the it's not left to, right? It's not rotating, it's not, it's that one sort of direction that doesn't change and that's this.

06:57

That is the most primitive I think version of this off. And then when then we get more complex stuff, it's like, okay, what are what are the properties of this direction object? This directional concept directional concept of an object. That is a direction in space. It's based on relative to other things.

07:23

And so what are the properties of that? Well, there could be well, this self comes with arms, a self-consent legs. And at some point at some point, you know, maybe an organism becomes becomes aware of its reflection in the water and it becomes in or maybe it's hint in the hands go up and they touch and they touch the face.

07:48

And, and maybe the organism is, is becoming aware of the similarities between itself and other and other entities or animals or beings that are also moving around in the environment. So there's there's definitely distinctions being made between okay there's there's self which is a direction and then there's the the space around the south which is the contacts that changes and then but the self is selfish you know.

08:21

I don't want to say this helps it's not changing. The stuff is is also impermanent, it's also change it, but it's changing in a different rate. It's changing, you know, at the cellular level in ways that are very slow. But also like there's a lot of but also they they can it's there's a lot of simultaneous changes happening.

08:54

That that can cause like you know eventually like there's these major shifts in the creatures lifespan and that can be noticed that brain contract and so there's definitely like all of the the biology of cells that are talking to one another are it's this massive massively parallel computation balances and and the bottom in the the I think the computation at the root even though we have DNA even we have like DNA is its chain of nucleotides that encode how proteins are folded if it's the DNA bicep, doesn't do anything.

09:49

It's the proteins that are the first actors of the body and then, and then the cells. And and then and then beyond the cells, we have Oregons. And and then we have major, major parts. We have our our arms working in coordination, with our brains, working coordination, with our feet.

10:16

And we have our whole being. So there's multiple scales of actions happening. There's multiple skin. This is an important concept because, you know, people like to say, well the physics of atoms is really, you know, it was we can reduce the causality of human decision to basically, you know, the physical forces of atoms.

10:39

Well, that's that that's there's that there's then within what in argument has been, what is twice then if the physics of Adam is really determined and everything that's happened, but it's not, it's not. I think that I think that you have to say, well, new functionality is emerging with a higher hardware structures that have causative patterns that don't exist at the atomic scale at natives and and that they've but they're given to that they're given once you have the higher structure emerging.

11:16

So there's the, you know, the or the organization and function of the foot or heart heart beating that has causal functions and in space at a higher level, that can that it's, it's interdependent with the atomic processes. But there is a level of causality at a higher level at every level.

11:46

So we're nested in different levels of cost causality from micro to to macro and and meso between and and and maybe there's a hundred billion different mesos in between all that wouldn't want to have to be the person to maybe future generations. Can outline all the the mesos and in between the macron and micro scales of causation.

12:15

I mean, at some point you could say, well, the macro scale of causation is the whole human being, and in the micro scale of causation is the protein. Which is sort of when I'm saying, but I'm, but we can, we can say. Okay, well actually there's there are forces of causation that are bigger than humans such as gravity.

12:41

The shape of space time that are that, that are imposing their own sort of causation on lower forces that our driving the micro arrangement of that is. And so at a higher, even higher level, there's the, they're the cosmic forces of the galaxy that are sort of very like, I would say that, you know, you we barely feel the effects of gravity is there.

13:13

So it's such a large scale think. I mean, I we feel that every day in terms of like your feet, don't leads around. So we do feel gravity of profound way so I just contradicted myself. But but, I mean, what I'm saying is that like As much as we feel gravity like that is the curvature of space.

13:40

I think that I'm sorry, I'm actually more curious because that, because that's for physics is not mine. After physics is really interesting. It's not mine first emphasis. Okay, so I'm just I had to get back. I I really think that maybe a good analogy for the spokes. Okay. Here's are the puzzle pieces that when you add up all the puzzle pieces is I'm going to sort of walk through.

14:14

I want to walk through a journey of my life, sort of like, describe all the puzzle pieces and then I want to begin to connect how these publications fit together. And so in a way, one of the things that I need to do has to actually make a collection of puzzle pieces and I collected a ton of other pieces and I shared them and my faceobok pages and faceobok groups, these are articles and links to books and and videos.

14:52

Such as the Ted Talks about consciousness, about neuroscience. And so the sort of like references to my journey are sort of like all over the internet in terms of what I shared online and social media. Yeah.
