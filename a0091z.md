Back in early 2014 I had a series of interesting conversations with someone named Chase. I don’t know what happened to that guy but this note was created from a conversation between Chase and myself. I deleted huge sections of it just to share some highlights. Although my memory of the time is somewhat limited it appears to me that this conversation took place over months via text exchanges on Facebook.

The flow of the conversation is broken up from deletions of what I considered to be extra pointless material.

There is a transcranial direct current stimulation device called foc.us
link to foc.us
http://www.foc.us/
$250 cost and you can use the machine without that headset pictured, you can do experiments with it.

**brain stimulation without brain surgery **

According to what I’ve heard, which could be incorrect, you can imprecisely aim to stimulate the brainstem with Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation or Alpha Stim It does not unlock your third eye, but you feel a bit saucy, like you had a beer or a glass of wine or two http://store.alpha-stim.com/

Have you heard of mind workstation? http://www.transparentcorp.com/
**mind workstation**

Have you heard of mindspa?
http://avstim.com/
**Mindspa**

Originators of the MindSpa Personal Development System
avstim.com

heard of this? http://www.mindplace.com/Mindplace-Procyon-System-Meditation-Machine/dp/B000X2BSJM
**Mindplace Procyon**
Mindplace Procyon AVS System Light and Sound Meditation Mind Machine
www.mindplace.com

well I combine the mindspa with the CES and it works great for meditation

they are similar products, because they are both mind machines, they both do brainwave entrainment, like you said you use isochronic beats yes?

I used the mind spa with CES, but I could easily use the Procyon instead.
or use the CES alone
I've also tried nootropics with my machines. Smart drugs, that alter the mindstate a little bit.

powerful differences


Micah Blumberg
I'm in San Francisco here so I decided to try psychedelics as a brain therapy, with the EEG and isochronic beats at the same time. I saw fractals, and I saw the beginning of the cosmos happen.
**I saw the beginning of the cosmos happen.**

"in coherence or decoherence between the two waveforms, when the first neuron in a network emits a signal, whether the next neuron is "excitatory or inhibitory" depends on whether its input, output. and structural resonance variables. "

this particular quote would require some defense, because
"in coherence or decoherence between the two waveforms, when the first neuron in a network emits a signal, whether the next neuron is "excitatory or inhibitory" depends on whether its input, output. and structural resonance variables. " 
because there are different ideas out there

Do you know about ipsp and epsp?

Do you know about hierarchical temporal memory?

have you heard of Content Addressable Memory
**Content Addressable Memory**
Content Addressable Memory

Hierarchical Temporal Memory was this idea that the neocortex was a hierarchy that gave it the advantage of instant associations, just like Content Addressable Memory
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory

Hierarchical temporal memory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
En.wikipedia.org
**Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM)**
Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM)
Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) is an online machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George of Numenta, Inc. that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. HTM is a biomimetic model based on the memory-prediction theory of brain function descri...

As for visualizing that quote, imagine a series of tesla coil pitch forks which resonate according to the acoustic density function. as the electromagnetic wave travels from one coil (pitch fork electrodes essentially) to the other, they will either resonate with the next fork in the network depending on the factors that determine wave resonance, or they will not. if they do the next fork electrode can carry that signal to the next and so on, even amplify it. Now think of each fork representing a "transistor" which if the fork vibrates due the prior in the series it represents an on, or excitatory. if it doesn't, the signal traveling doesn't resonate the full network of forks, so the ones that dont are inhibitory to the signal coherence of the information, whether encoded by the on/off analogy or the actual frequency variations

yes that's what I mean by complementary
see I was in a discussion the other day, talking about how the synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable amplitude and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.
but the amplitude of the wave matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and amplitude also.
so I have been focusing on how synapses use spikes to program other synapses,
and you are focusing on how spikes cause other spikes
but you are also focusing on spike resonance, relationships between spikes, and decoherence between spikes, it's all very interesting and important.

Micah Blumberg
I was at a place. I was imagining the place was made up of spikes, some firing alternately, and some firing in coincidence. Where there was nothing, that was a coincidence of synergistic firing, resulting in the inhibition or absence of information in my visual field. Where there were alternating decoherent firing patterns resulting in the excitation or appearance of visual patterns such as lines, edges, colors, people, shapes, and details in my visual field. The only problem with this idea is that electric spikes do not see, something has to read them. They are messages sent through neurons from one synapse to the next.

2/22/2014, 12:52am
Micah Blumberg
do you know about ANN artificial neural networks? or hidden markov models?


Chase
read this when you have the time man, its awesome ive been doing a lot of research into such. its pretty crazy shit and changed how i perceive things
http://www.redicecreations.com/specialreports/2006/01jan/holographic.html


Micah Blumberg
watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY
Leonard Susskind on The World As Hologram
www.youtube.com
Leonard Susskind of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics discusses the indestructability of information and the nature of black holes in a lecture ...


does it by chance expand on the concept of dealing with sequences of partially
collapsed holographic infinities

Chase
hey man what do you study? neuro computation? software programming? biophysics?

Micah Blumberg
all of that

Micah Blumberg
okay
so EEG sensors have a number indicator

Chase
so that they only "train" the brain so that thoughts with particular eeg patterns activate the computer command?
okay
based on placement right?
like 1-64?

Micah Blumberg
imagine 16 eeg sensors all over the brain, with specific placement
something like 1-160 for each sensor
they are just measuring activity, if it goes up or down, on a scale of 1-160

Micah Blumberg
and there is a computer chip that cancels out readings from the heart, the heart also broadcasts electromagnetic activity

Chase
ok so would that chip analyze the interference from the heart and compensate to negate it
Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:21am

Micah Blumberg
So what some software developers do is write in code, that causes software to do something when the eeg sensor is at 1-25 , and something when the eeg sensor is at 26-50 and something when the eeg sensor is at 51-75 or 75-150

Chase
dont they need a coherent beam with a predetermined frequency before being sent through the other wave source in order to properly extrapolate the change the coherent hz experiences
ah okay so how do they "map" each thought to a set of values picked up by the eeg sensor
or are we only able to choose a function

Micah Blumberg
brain activity is thought to be regional, this means that if you have brain activity in the f1 region it might be about decision making, if you have in some other region it might be about attention, in another region it might be about frustration, in another region it might be about excitement

Chase
okay so they kinda go with like say electrode number 4 is placed above the frontal lobe, when it detects a value is it viewed as the intensity of the activity in the area of critical thinking etx


3/21, 11:26am
Micah Blumberg
but in practice it isn't so precise

Chase
3/21, 11:27am

Chase
right bc everyone's brain activity is different and the same network pathways could have different functions
so what if you were to measure the frequency from the electrodes and group them into categories like
frontal lobe electrode: 7hz detected =alpha range=alpha state properties
to get an idea as to which type of activity the region responsible for say perceptual dimensional analysis
is experiences
experiencing*

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:30am

Micah Blumberg
also consider that at two o'clock a group of cells will make your hand move in a specific motion, we will call it motion A, and at three o'clock a different group of cells will make your hand move in a specific motion, the exact same motion A, except done by a different group of cells.
What's worse is they use less brainwave activity the second time, and so it registers differently in a brain scan

Chase
**3/21/2014, 11:31am**

Chase
hmm! why is that? wouldn't that make the amount of bioelectric energy put into the first execution of the movement excessive when compared to the second execution performing the same action with less energy

3/21, 11:32am
Micah Blumberg
yes, but your brain gets more energy efficient over time
that's why the first day of a new job somewhere could be exhausting, but eventually you get used to it

Chase
ah okay that makes sense. im going to send you some pictures of a few pages of my notes to show you what im trying to do. but first
consider an isochronic tone
it has a carrier wave and then the bw signal

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:33am

Micah Blumberg
but what I mentioned is only one of a few ways to do bci

Chase
3/21, 11:34am

so what if you made a tone with the carrier wave equaling a brainwave value (alpha etc) and the other be a musical tone
would the brain be affected by the music as if it were being exposed to isochronic tones

Chase
3/21, 11:36am
for example i am taking the sacred solfeggio tones which have effects like this

Micah Blumberg
"would the brain be affected by the music " yes
2. you could have a machine learning algorithm watch and learn the eeg sensor activity so it could notice the similarity between 
3. you could have the eeg sensors change light and sound effects and then feed that back to a person so they could interpret their own brainwave activity

3/21, 11:37am
Micah Blumberg
4. you could have the EEG brainwave activity drive isochronic beats in both light and sound patterns and feed that back into a person's brain which would further affect their brainwaves, and further drive the EEG pattern
I've already done #3 and #4
that's what Neo Mind Cycle is

Chase
hah so if you played a tone with say 8hz as the signal tone to induce an alpha state (increased focus, awareness etc) and then have the carrier wave be say 417hz which has the effects listed in the pic i sent
would their effects "synchronize?" in a sense

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:41am

Micah Blumberg
well tones synchronize better if they are closer together in frequency, like 10hz apart
Chase
3/21, 11:41am
Chase
i am grouping these sacred tones and representing them like amino acids which bind when they mathematically add to make a perfect circle of sound
the orher idea i had
was to use carrier wave anagrams so the frequencies reverberate against each other
but
the intervals of time between the tones are represented by double helix segments of brainwave levels
Chase
3/21, 11:43am
Chase

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:44am

Micah Blumberg
I ate this medicinal cactus once right, and I could hear my consciousness as a song, it was weird but profound, the human mind is like a symphony orchestra


Chase
peyote??
or san pedro
ive had a similar experience man

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:44am

Micah Blumberg
san pedro
Chase
3/21, 11:45am
Chase
my soul was like a guitar almost in the sense that my thoughts etc would flow out of me as colorful music
it was on psilocetin
i dont give a fuck about the stigmas around psychedelics, if used responsibly as a tool for self exploration etc they are an amazing tool

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:46am

Micah Blumberg
I wish I could find a peyote cactus that I could grow, because it's such a treasure for any gardener

Chase
yeah man the buttons take 20 years to grow

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:46am

Micah Blumberg
wow
the san pedro tastes so gross that I would only eat it once every 20 years
Chase
3/21, 11:47am
Chase
native americans will go and cut out the center and leave the rest so that itll grow back and then go back o reharvest a few decades later
haha ive never tried it but its way less potent than peyote in terms of mescaline per plant matter volume

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 11:48am

Micah Blumberg
but in San Francisco its easy to find psychedelics
Chase
3/21, 11:48am
Chase
i really want to experience mescaline though i might do an extraction on san pedro someday
yeah man i bet haha

Micah Blumberg

Chase
how would you say that brainwave patterns are actually related to the thoughts or conscious states associated with them and how are they associated?
like representations of your conscious perspective of logical activity? emotional activity? both?

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 6:45pm

Micah Blumberg
my hypothesis is that brainwaves are the residual after effects of the thought process, electromagnetic brainwave activity is perhaps like blood activity in the brain, dissipating energy and heat. It gives us a window into what was being thought, it serves as an indicator, as it can be read by EEG (and blood can be read by FMRI)

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 6:45pm

Micah Blumberg
good question btw
Chase
3/21, 7:29pm
Chase
so what do you suppose the thought itself is made out of? energy in an unknown state? virtual energy?

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 7:35pm

Micah Blumberg
well I think thought as information as criteria, as tempo-spatial patterns is sensed and communicated by brain cells, temporal cell circuits, and the brain as a whole.
I think that these thought patterns ie information criteria are driving brain activity, producing electromagnetic energy dissipation and heat, which brainwaves, and blood carry away, dissipate, and distribute.

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 7:37pm

Micah Blumberg
so, thought is like the wave in the ocean, if a wave is a bit of information, this wave isn't really the underlying material, because as the wave moves new water molecules flow into it, and old water molecules flow out of it.

Micah Blumberg
3/21, 7:40pm


Micah Blumberg
its like saying there isn't a material of thought, thought is in the material of the brain, but it isn't any of the material in the brain, it's like a temporal wave pattern that has no substance, it's not electricity, no electromagnetism, not chemicals, not blood or biology, but it surfs through all these things sort of. It's like the space in the brain is informed.
March 22
Chase
3/22, 2:14am

Chase
ah cool that goes along with theories on thoughts being holographic information lensed by awareness. based a lot of it on the concept that memories are stored non-locally and their likeness to holographic data isolated by a quantum lens
April 2
Chase
4/2, 6:38pm

Chase
so in theory, any frequency with additive syncronized//harmonic resonance
or rather any two frequencies
like stacking isochronic tones
or binaural, i run 5 apps at once

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 9:42pm

Micah Blumberg
5 apps at once?
Chase
4/2, 9:42pm
Chase
yeah
each with a different iso tone
but in particular patterns
like i wont put an energizing freq with a theta wave dominant sequence

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 9:44pm

Micah Blumberg
the brain is firing in all frequency patterns all the time, awake, asleep, it's all there, feel free to combine them.
I've experience some amazing combinations of theta and beta

Chase
4/2, 9:44pm

Chase
true
ive just been focusing on additive effects
a lot of the tones i use
are actually sets of tones
like they switch, settings like astral projection, lucid dreaming etc use gamma, delta, theta

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 9:45pm

Micah Blumberg
you want to experiment a lot, to cultivate something good, like making a good wine or good cheese
its music and its art

Chase
4/2, 9:46pm

Chase
yeah its really interesting stuff ive been doing a lot of math regarding music
in particular trying to create a form which directly or indirectly evokes particular emotions or states of awareness
using a lot of sacred geometrics and perfect circles of sound dissected
and anagrams
like music made from pure isochronic tones of dualistic mathematical harmony
just bought a fiber optic whip. i have an obsession with light and holographs

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 9:58pm


Micah Blumberg
alright. it's a lot of work, it's going to take a lot of time. I will let you know when I have some results.

Chase
4/2, 9:59pm

Chase
I appreciate it man, I'm working on getting my own. can compare results

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:00pm

Micah Blumberg
I will ask Daniel to help with the research, to conduct his own study and share the results with us.
Chase
4/2, 10:01pm
Chase
sounds good the more perspectives the merrier

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:02pm

Micah Blumberg
the broader the study the better the data

Chase
4/2, 10:02pm

Chase
just sp

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:04pm

Micah Blumberg
why don't you draft up a formal study, with all the research parameters, and we will put a request out there for other people to help us as well.

Chase
4/2, 10:04pm

Chase
thats a good idea

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:04pm

Micah Blumberg
exactly
Chase
4/2, 10:05pm

Chase
ive been doing open research
undefine
until i define it lol
no restrictions other than the laws of physics
a formal study will let me take that data and well, formalize it into an accurate analysis

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:08pm

Micah Blumberg
yes exactly, and think of how fun it will be!
Chase
4/2, 10:09pm

Chase
i am lol i love the feeling of discovery

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:10pm

Micah Blumberg
you will want to guide each person, to perhaps listen to each specific frequency for a length of time before beginning the eeg recording.
to give their neurons time to tune into the frequency

Chase
4/2, 10:10pm

Chase
yeah i was planning on saturating the neurons for 15 min and none in the control

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:15pm

Micah Blumberg
It's a good idea, and one that needs to be written into the formal study so everyone uses the same methods, so that we can have more comparable results.
One must be as strict as possible in defining constraints and parameters, to improve the quality or yield of useful information.
So everything you would do, needs to be like an instruction set, for everyone else to follow and do exactly the same way.
I will help you develop the formal study, because you don't have your own equipment yet. Then once it's really strict and perfect we will try to do it on a bigger scale.

Chase
I work on neuroscience and wave physics while my professor talks about how to perform some action in microsoft word
so i havent ever really had to formalize any of my work
for the most part nobody has seen it but me because i dont know anyone besides maybe 2 people who even understand it lol

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:22pm

Micah Blumberg
people do not need to understand it want to participate in hacking away at the problem
in other words
people want to play with that which they do not understand
so in a sense, we are writing a sort of game, a formal study is a chance to play
Chase
4/2, 10:24pm
Chase
yeah but they lose interest when that includes a dozen concepts which are needed to understand my larger idea
at least most ppl ive met
which in reality isnt a very large sample group

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:26pm

Micah Blumberg
that's why I'm going to help, I'm going to help make it interesting, the more rules we have, the less they need to think about the big picture you are working on before they are ready to participate. 
in other words, I will help make it fun, by making it clear what people have to do to help you

Chase
4/2, 10:28pm

Chase
thanks man lets do it

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:28pm

Micah Blumberg
**did I ever tell you what the words "Neo Mind Cycle" mean?**
Chase
4/2, 10:29pm
Chase
nope, but i know neo means new
i formed a group like that but i guess my ideas were too complex
or i present them too complexly rather

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:31pm

Micah Blumberg
**its sort of a mission statement, a flag, like a pirates flag, representing a ship, and a crew, of researchers like you, and me
have you heard of the book "I am strange loop" by Douglas Hofstadter?**

Chase
4/2, 10:32pm

Chase
thats cool and nope never heard of it?

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:32pm

Micah Blumberg
**neurofeedback is a loop, or a cycle**
**Hofstadter thinks consciousness is analogous to a feedback loop**

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:34pm

Micah Blumberg
**there are all kinds of cycles going on in the brain, oscillating frequencies, oscillating thought patterns. brainwaves that change our movements, that we see in a mirror, that change our brainwaves, that change our movements again, another cycle of self awareness happens in the neurofeedback of a simple mirror**

Chase
like an read, analyze, report, read, analyze.. cycle?

Micah Blumberg
that too

Chase
4/2, 10:35pm

Chase
so in essence

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:35pm

Micah Blumberg
**it's a fractal universe, in a cycle.
Neo Mind, refers to the human mind specifically the neo cortex
there are two things that make a human brain**

Chase
4/2, 10:36pm

Chase
have you read about multiple words theory

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:36pm

Micah Blumberg
the size of the neocortex, and the advanced glial cells

Chase
4/2, 10:37pm

Chase
form and content of energy and information
but thats much broarder

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:42pm

Chase
btw I use freeware sofeggio mixer v1.03 - www.ledset.com
for all my tones
its free

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:55pm

Micah Blumberg
that's good, the more we can rely on free and opensource stuff, the bigger the studies can become

Chase
4/2, 10:55pm

Chase
yeah it has all 81 sacred tones
and 9 sacred scales
also you can type in any other value into any of the nine frequency values
or input boxes or w/e you wanna call em
some of the tones dissociate me

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 10:58pm

Micah Blumberg
sweet, we definitely want to share this info

Chase
4/2, 10:59pm

Chase
others have a variety of effects, id need more trials to say anything concrete
I don't really have any connection or associations to get information like that out there

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 11:00pm

Micah Blumberg
I do
what I like is that your head is in the clouds, and your feet are on the ground

Chase
4/2, 11:02pm

Chase
like I start to feel a sort of pressure in the field of my neuron networks, that perceptive state people associate with consciousness, that will pull me away from my typical reaction to stimuli and replace it with a particular "vibe" or energy
like going into yourself or going out of yourself to varying degrees of information/neural stimuli gathering
hard to explain honestly
and they all have different effects and the combos have different effects

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 11:11pm

Micah Blumberg
sure, the morphology of perception, the symphony of consciousness, spatial temporal self awareness, cycling activations, looping brainwaves, and the question is one of identity is it not? if this spatial temporal metaphor is "going into yourself or going out of yourself to varying degrees" than what is it? what is the nature of this identity? so interesting

Micah Blumberg
4/2, 11:12pm

Micah Blumberg
it gets more interesting

Chase
4/3, 12:18am

Chase
im not sure, possibly the information that the brain uses for creating awareness by wave interference interpretation, with consonance or dissonance

like their transformations too when bouncing from place to plae
April 5

Chase
4/5, 8:53am
Chase
how do you simplify subjects like advanced quantum phenomenon to people who want to understand and are interested but they dont understand what in saying because it requires prior knowledge about things like quantum theory and dimensional mathematics, neuro perception etc) which they have to understand to understand?

Chase
4/5, 8:53am

Chase
like i can do it but it takes soo long and so much effort and like a dozen 20 page long texts
April 5

Micah Blumberg
4/5, 12:21pm

Micah Blumberg
the tools that I have include a graph of five frequencies of brainwaves overtime, gamma, alpha, beta, theta, and delta
I have another tool called 3d brainwave activity visualizer, but really it's just an interpretation of the numbers
The eeg sensors are only picking up numbers representing when waves peak, so the graph is best
other technology like fmri measure changes in blood flow so they "interpret" what brain-"wave" activity could be.
you don't mention the words quantum, phenomenon or perception,
you say you are measuring waves, electrical patterns, brain activity, to collect information and that you have a scientific process to "make original discoveries" they don't need all the same details to help, they don't even need to know the big picture of what you are really doing, they only need to know their own small part, you needed data, for science, so they if they want to help they have to do this, and we give them a list of easy steps to follow.
what they get is a simplified version of a the project that leaves out the complex stuff and just focuses them on what they can do to contribute
I can understand the whole project, and help pick out the parts that they need to know

You should know I am waiting until I get my new computer, install all my software, and get back to San Francisco before I begin the frequency tests with brainwave graphs. The project is going to start in the beginning of May. I wanted to tell you about the delay so you don't think I have forgotten this research.

4/11, 11:26pm

Chase
hey man i was wondering if youd know if i could find an algorithm for dimensional analysis if i can provide a cipher key between my input maps. im working on nasas x-hab project and am close to finishing my designs for a device which can scan map entire planets and record all dimensional activity occuring on the planet and im working on adding multilayering for sub terrain scans etc

Chase
4/11, 11:28pm

Chase
but i need software to basically encode values as dimensional variables in a encoded data sequence

Chase
4/11, 11:34pm

Chase
im also augmenting it to analyze element composition

Micah Blumberg
4/11, 11:46pm

Micah Blumberg
dude, that sounds really cool, but if anyone on earth had that program do you think the Malaysian Airplane would have ever been lost? No, there isn't yet a program that does live dimensional analysis (presumably from satellite feeds, or very high balloons, or drones) of all the activity on a planet. That could require massive amounts of AI, machine learning, to see (identify patterns) and notice when things change, and record a sequence that notes what changed. I don't know of any computer on earth that could handle the workload of the program you are designing.

what they don't say in the wiki is that after he retired from the military he went to work for space companies like TRW and SAIC
but that's okay

So far we haven't seen any quantum computers that are faster than classical computers. I'm not sure that what you need for this type of job is a classical computer, because there are some programs that can simulate quantum computers in classical computer systems.
oh typo
I meant to write that I am not sure you would need a quantum computer for this type of job
since classical computers can be just as fast, and simulate the same kinds of amazing problem solving abilities that quantum computers have

i was actually about to ask something along those lines. what about an AI that organizes and decodes all the data through quantum processes, breaking down a superposition with an artificial collapse function in order to process faster?? or somethin like that?
instead of having to analyze each input sp state it can utilize a wave collapse function in order to crunch the input sp as a whole rather than as each of its parts

I don't think anyone is building AI with quantum machines, the reason is that so far AI is a multi-stage process, but quantum computing is in some sense a one stage process. Actually what I am saying is not explaining it exactly right... do you know what I mean?

quantum computing, as it currently exists, might not be a fit for deep learning as it currently exists,

Chase

Chase
what exactly makes you draw that conclusion?
its probabilistic nature? elaborate?

Micah Blumberg
4/12, 12:01am

Micah Blumberg
AI as it currently is sort of like having a machine learn patterns in levels, sort of like learning lines, edges, letters, corners, at one level, and combining those little things into bigger things at another level, so letters, words, smiley faces, symbols, and combining those things into even bigger things at a 3rd higher level etc...

Micah Blumberg
4/12, 12:02am

Micah Blumberg
but actually you could put all those processes into sets and have a quantum machine attack the whole problem at once, don't know why I didn't think of that before

Chase
4/12, 12:02am

Chase
okay so essentially variable stacking and sequencing?
thats what i was thinking

Micah Blumberg
4/12, 12:03am

Micah Blumberg
yeah, but I guess you could also call that invariant pattern learning, because it's a flexible pattern

Chase
4/12, 12:05am

Chase
so would you have to have a non quantum ai organize such sequences first and then have a quantum process decipher it?
or could a q-comp just learn it invariantly by running it through a recording phase from which to derive a sequence deciphering collapse function? measuring/recording probability patterns in input sequences

Micah Blumberg
4/12, 12:18am

Micah Blumberg
Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

Micah Blumberg
4/12, 12:19am

Micah Blumberg
The program would be a short cut to finding everything of interest on a planets surface and sky
but, basically you could design all classical systems that can do that now.
it's just that quantum systems are designed for certain types of problems, but so far classical systems can do all those same types of problems with about the same performance

how would the human brain, in its full potential, if controlled as a computer, compare to artificial processing systems
could we create android ai processing units with a 3d printer/biocomputer
like just a bioprinted neural network with conductive inorganic nanoconductors and transistors connected to each neuron at the molecular level? a brain-computer hyprid type deal

"how would the human brain, in its full potential, if controlled as a computer, compare to artificial processing systems" that question is too broad for me to answer, that's like the entire field of what I study, maybe you could make your question more specific
"could we create android ai processing units with a 3d printer/biocomputer" not with the current generation of 3d printers, but it is possible to design android chips and send them to a manufacturer to be printed for you. that's what Stanford's Neurogrid did, read about it if you haven't already.
When I started using neurofeedback with isochronic beats for the first time several years ago, it felt as if my consciousness was extended into the computer, so it has been a goal of mine since that experience to build machines that extend consciousness from the brain into a larger external brain that humans can wear.

dude I have been working on that too
trying to design "add on" VI/AI interface processors melded to our consciousness with bci tech and working on some potential vibrational based interface methods too
imagine storing your knowledge and memories in a computer archive, transferring such files and all the other limitless potential such innovations could have

If ive designed method that uses 5 argument parameters for encoding, decoding, & interpreting an infinite series of numerically sequential sets (with composite subset overlaps) in 3 dimensions as well as a 6th argument which analyzes a 4 dimensional emanation function from 4D hyperspace to 3D reality, and I was able to use such arguments to create an algorithm for processing infinite output sequences, would the processing speed depend on how fast the computer is able to use the algorithm to determine such discrete symmetric output values from an infinite input series under the algorithms 6 argument functions?

how is your mathematics? do you need any brushing up? you can use Khan Academy for free, or more advanced math stuff is available. I can try to find you books. I have been having some great ideas lately also. I want to tell you about them soon. I just have to go to the grocery store to get some cheese first.

Good at math, so far have calculated 209,644 different values with symmetry parameters between each tone to tone and scale to scale, can expand it infinitely or contract it infinitesimally with only a few parameters

are you good at linear algebra, or algebraic topology?
I'm asking because those subjects could be essential to developing artificial consciousness, and extension brains
Chase

Both, also a little higher dimension algebraic topology too

how well do you know constructive mathematics, cohomology, homotopy type theory, and category theory?
Chase
4/21, 11:45pm
Chase
I know them more in the sense that I just use the underlying principles in my math incorporating them at different points etc, than in a sense that I could teach it
Cohomology and homotopy I'd have to look into more to see the specifics used in those topics

I was thinking about attention binding in the brain today, as a temporary frequency acceleration that creates a kind of field distortion,
I started to think about colors as frequencies in the gamma range
I mean the high gamma range, between 100 and 200 hz
well maybe the primary colors would be special numbers, you could probably pick some good numbers to represent red, green, and blue
it's a strange idea, because the frequency difference creates a contrast, that is a polarity from the entanglement equilibrium

Chase
4/21, 11:50pm

Chase
I've actually looked into attention and awareness as a field of specific sequences of neural frequencies and activity patterns directed by a functional argument that describes different types/levels of attention/awareness, where the field is sort of like a superposition of entangled frequency values and their composite subset entanglements

Chase
4/21, 11:51pm

Chase
Could have worded that better but
Yeah I have some theoretical arguments on duality of frequencies and composites that could explain the color contrast and equilibrium points
I'm about to go to bed though got a busy week, I'll msg you later and we can talk about it more

Well what surprised me today, is that my new theory is basically involves a field of cells that detect and distort the quantum field that is continually trying to equalize via entropy
okay goodnight

Dude explain to me how the cells (and what they're composed of) get entangled to form a quantum field of cells (through the process of making connections between data etc via quantum neurologic processes resulting in cell to cell entanglement which gives rise to the quantum field of awareness, whose fluctuations result from q-variants and invariants within the full sequenced field, which the neural networks measure and relate perceptual neuroanalysis of data variations and connection parameters etc, between frequency and composite frequency variances and invariants within the sequence measure and determine such values from equilibration nature between q-em energy exchanges/ entropy between different q-state entropy differentials within the sum sequential the quantized field?

Chase
4/22, 3:33pm

With awareness represented as a functional special subset derived from symmetries in the  quantum field set sequences, if you can visualize that

okay so the idea the amount of force moving everything in the cosmos towards equilibrium has the consistency of chocolate syrup. So that which is different and distinct from the vacuum itself is a temporary disruption in the smoothness of the cosmos. cells are disrupting equilibrium, but they are also detecting particles via chemical changes, braincells detect photons and electrons and such, when they fire they further export entropy to the surrounding area, distorting the quantum field, but they are also detecting the quantum field via chemical changes in each neuron. so the quantum field is interfacing with the field of brain cells including glia and neurons
