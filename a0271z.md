# Phase Shifts as Electromagnetic Wave Valence 

What is "valence processing" in the context of biology? The following article talks about the BLA Basolateral Amygdala, the part of the Amygala that receives most of the sensory information from the temporal lob structures including the hippocampus, the audio cortex, and other areas. It is thought of as the emotional pipeline for emotional arousel in mammals. To the organism, some stimulati are repulsive, for example bitter, some are attractive, for example sweet. The organisms perception of the value of whether something is repulsive or attractive is called valence. Valence is like your built in automatic attraction or repulsion, and the Amygdala, as as sensor transmitter node or an oscillating group of cells is thought to play a central role in valence processing, with the BLA being the sensor part of the Amygdala.

What caught my attention to this article was that the term valence has meaning in both the psychological and the physics realm. High valence in psychology is like the concept of good or positive relationship energy. In physics Valence electrons are the highest energy electrons in an atom, the most reactive electrons.

So I find it interesting that in a cognitive neurophysics article we have the emotional psychological concept of valence mapped to the concept of physics based interactions in the brain, at the sensory input to the Amygdala, which involve electrical charges.

On top of that the concept of increasing or decreasing electrical valence maps directly to the concept of increasing or decreasing phase signals in NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. What is being projected from a neuron & a neuron array is a phase change, that phase change could also be described as a change in relative electrical valence. On top of that interesting connection, your behavior in effect is absolutely mapped to the phase changes or valences moving between your neural arrays (which including any neuron and any oscillating group of cells such as a cortical column or an anatomical structure like the amygdala)

The memory patterns that form in each array, that define the morphology & synaptic connections of that oscillating group of cells, are formed specifically from temporarily & spatially oscillating signals that are encoding the structures of your brain with learned synaptic patterns.

The patterns that have higher valence, in terms of phasic spiking, are going to oscillate more, generating greater sharp wave ripples, that the tonic oscillations dissipate but are also changed by, that further encodes new long term patterns with new synaptic changes. The higher valence patterns over time define your behaviors, your responses, but also the evolution of your responses overtime as your responses develop in increasing complexity.

# "Holographic stimulation of opposing amygdala ensembles bidirectionally modulates valence-specific behavior"
"Here we identify that neuronal encoding of valence in the BLA is graded and relies on the relative proportion of individual BLA neurons recruited in a stable appetitive or aversive ensemble."
