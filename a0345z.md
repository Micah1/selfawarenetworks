I was watching a white herring gracefully diving into a lake to catch fish and marveling at how a slower than molasses evolutionary process squeezed out such a sophisticated product, how the laws of physics even allow for there to be a tiny and energy-efficient computer capable of this amazing feat. The idea of neuromorphic computing makes me visualize people flying around on pterodactyl-like vehicles, taking leisurely rides on the backs of highly realistic robotic elephants who talk to us and tell us stories, being served by butlers that look like giant penguins and a whole stream of other whimsical applications I can imagine flowing from powerful, small, energy-efficient computers; this time, not evolved computers like the herring’s brain, but a product of brilliant and painstaking science and engineering - humanity’s best-to-date partial plagiarism of nature (and perhaps the crowning achievement of our species before our final invention and that fateful day when humankind’s stolen promethean fire is snatched away by superhuman AI’s, hopefully for the betterment of all sentient beings). At any rate, as far as the near future goes, I’m sure I am not alone in preferring a pterodactyl to a self-driving car for those short local trips that don't require pneumatic-tube transport.

Micah Blumberg but why shouldn't AI be developed by an artificial natural selection? imagine a virtual digital ecosystem that simulates millions of years of evolution within an afternoon?

Jordan Tribby "Artificial natural selection"  I like that idea a lot and often wonder how long it would take for intelligent life to evolve in that kind of simulation, how much computing power would be required, and whether simulating a range of different environments such as those we'd expect to encounter on exoplanets might one day tell us something about the variety of alien life in the universe. If quantum computers manage to achieve a speedup over classical computers I wonder if they might be able to help. I feel like efficiently simulating billions of years of natural selection is exactly the kind of thing that having strong AI would help us to achieve so it's a bit of a catch-22 if that is how we want to create the AI to begin with. I think it would be cool to evolve communities of AIs in the presence of some kind of selfishness hunter so that from very early on, altruism was selected for. Perhaps these AIs which naturally helped eachother for the good of the group could be taught to invite any sentient being they encountered (such as us) into their group.

Micah Blumberg Earlier today I made a post, this was it:
"As I watched this video I tried to picture how what goes on in human brains could be similar to a procedure generated world. Our memories do not need to be stored in our minds as long as the same input can trigger the same procedures that generate the same temporary memory. The same temporary canvas of information, the same moment in a brain canvas we will call consciousness."

Then I revisited your wall and I had another thought. What if the evolution of Artificial Intelligence will be really simple, like the way the computer draws a unique tree in an exact location because of math based drawing procedures. 

I mean the evolution of the design of the artificial brain will almost fall out as a matter of it's mathematical procedural underpinnings within it's ecosystem as the major source of inputs. One could advance the program in time as another input, generating an instant jump of say millions of years of evolution.

Jordan Tribby "Our memories do not need to be stored in our minds as long as the same input can trigger the same procedures that generate the same temporary memory." I think this is a deep insight, but I suspect it’s not as clean as a 1:1 correspondence between inputs and activation of particular memory patterns. A certain procedure might define a certain tree in a video game, but given that there is a lot of redundancy in the brain, I think the identical input could actually instantiate more than one version of a memory depending on which happened to be more available (the preceding activity of the brain probably has a lot to do with which particular version of a given memory might be available for activation [or reassembly from stored primitives, or whatever you want to call it]. Random noise also probably plays more of a role in the brain than in a video game). Suppose you met a person twice, once in a cafe and once in a library. In the first instance they had blonde hair, in the second instance they had black hair. If you’re presented with the input “describe this person”, will you always resound the same way? Will you always form the same image in your mind? I’d hypothesize if you were primed with either pictures of the cafe, or pictures of the library, and asked to recall details about the person, despite having the same input, you might activate different versions of the stored memory you have of how that person looks, depending on how you were primed. There are probably many studies that basically demonstrate this. So-called “state-depenedent” memory would also fit with this picture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent_memory). If you have many copies of a memory, say of walking down a particular street, I’d expect the state you were in when activating the memory would have something to do with which version gets put together, and which specific details you'd be able to recall, even though the input (the question “remember this particular street”) could remain the same.

As far as evolving artificial brains, I’m not sure that I’m following your train of thought. Are you describing a virtual world in which a feature of the virtual world is some virtual machine that evolves brains which pop out of the machine and then interact with other features of the virtual world to form feedback for subsequent iterations of the brain? Would you provide the first version of the brain, or are you expecting it to evolve on its own? I'm not sure how you can skip a million years of evolution. If the entire evolutionary history of the brain was already part of the program, then yes, you could jump to arbitrary points in its evolutionary history, but if you had only the brain's initial conditions and some evolutionary algorithm, you'd still have to apply those computational steps to update the brain, you couldn't skip a million steps and see how the brain would be. Perhaps if patterns emerged, there could be some shortcuts but I don't think you could ever skip ahead arbitrarily far to get the output of computations that hadn't actually been performed yet. Maybe I'm not understanding what you had in mind, but I think if you want to apply evolutionary algorithms to an artificial brain, you have to actually run those algorithms on the brain (and then run them again, and again) so the brain evolves.

State-dependent memory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
en.wikipedia.org
State-dependent memory, or state-dependent learning is the phenomenon through which memory retrieval is most efficient when an individual is in the same state of consciousness as they were when the memory was formed.[1][2] The term is often used to describe memory retrieval while in states of consci…

Jordan Tribby As far as evolutionary algorithms as a path to AI in general, I think if you already start with a good architecture, you can improve it with evolutionary algorithms, but if you tried to get from really primitive structures like RNA to fully developed brains, even with computers that might exist 100 years from now (even assuming Moore’s law continued), I think it’s computationally intractable to simulate billions of years of evolution within a reasonable amount of time. We still don't know how likely our history was (more accurately, we don't know what percentage of SIMILAR planets given the same amount of time, would evolve life comparable to earth), so we might have to run simulations for much longer than 5 billion years to replicate the level of intelligence we have on earth. Obviously, nobody is really interested in trying to get artificial minds from that brute force kind of approach that involves molecules interacting in virtual worlds for billions of simulated years. I think it's very much an open question how far other evolutionary approaches can us get towards general intelligence (such as ones that modify code, or change the parameters of neural nets), but I suspect such approaches are best once we already have a ballpark idea and we want to improve upon it. I could imagine an evolutionary approach would be useful for taking a whole-brain emulation and getting it to perform better. I haven't read much about this topic, it would actually be really interesting to know what has actually been accomplished so far using evolutionary algorithms.

Micah Blumberg What I mean is, in the video they have described the computer drawing a virtual animal that is moving from point A to point B which might take a super long amount of time, the game designer says if you leave the planet in a spaceship and then return later on the computer will create a new drawing of the same land, and the same creature, but the creature will be farther along in it's journey than it was before. In this instance the creature sort of jumped farther along in it's journey toward B without actually moving through the distance between it's previous position and it's next position, because it didn't exist during the time that the player wasn't actually there.

What the computer is generating is an entire location in both space and time that didn't exist before, and won't exist when the player leaves, but exists again when the player returns, and when the player returns the world will be drawn with all of the locations of the animals advanced as they would have advanced had the player not left at all.

It makes me think of how spacetime could be just like that, but more interestingly I think about how a brain has so many connections, more connections than the stars of a galaxy like earth's galaxy. If each connection was represented as a planet, and each pulse that traveled through that connection was represented as an animal or a spaceship moving, and all of that was only generated as needed, and didn't exist when it was not needed.

It's sort of like a universe that exists consistently for a dissipative system, but it's existence can sort of be off or non-existent when there is no dissipative system there to observe it.

The brain is a dissipative system, and if you took a program like they have, that creates a universe for players, with billions of planets, that can generate the positions of animals at any point in time, all those procedural generated details could track the positions of soliton wave signals in an artificial mind of similar scale.

Additionally you could look at the development of that mind at any point in time, because the computer doesn't have to render all the inbetween steps between point A and point B, it only has to use the mathematical formula to generate a result of what the information output would be at a given point in time.

If you could somehow take the mind, represented by a program this large, and put that entire mind program inside a virtual character that is itself inside the same program, it would be like being a character on a planet inside your own mind. The universe itself would be doing the thinking for you. Or you could take the mind program and put it inside characters in a different program. Either way as these characters interact, they develop, live, eat, sleep, mate, create copies of themselves, die, and over time they evolve.

However all their movements, and all their thoughts are just movements, do not need to happen sequentially. A new observer might enter the game a trillion years later, and a trillion years will take the same amount of time to render as the next second takes to render, because it's all drawn from mathematical formulas, so it doesn't matter when.

Both time and space become sort of like secondary properties to underlying mathematical formula's.
