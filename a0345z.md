I was watching a white herring gracefully diving into a lake to catch fish and marveling at how a slower than molasses evolutionary process squeezed out such a sophisticated product, how the laws of physics even allow for there to be a tiny and energy-efficient computer capable of this amazing feat. The idea of neuromorphic computing makes me visualize people flying around on pterodactyl-like vehicles, taking leisurely rides on the backs of highly realistic robotic elephants who talk to us and tell us stories, being served by butlers that look like giant penguins and a whole stream of other whimsical applications I can imagine flowing from powerful, small, energy-efficient computers; this time, not evolved computers like the herring’s brain, but a product of brilliant and painstaking science and engineering - humanity’s best-to-date partial plagiarism of nature (and perhaps the crowning achievement of our species before our final invention and that fateful day when humankind’s stolen promethean fire is snatched away by superhuman AI’s, hopefully for the betterment of all sentient beings). At any rate, as far as the near future goes, I’m sure I am not alone in preferring a pterodactyl to a self-driving car for those short local trips that don't require pneumatic-tube transport.

Micah Blumberg but why shouldn't AI be developed by an artificial natural selection? imagine a virtual digital ecosystem that simulates millions of years of evolution within an afternoon?

Jordan Tribby "Artificial natural selection"  I like that idea a lot and often wonder how long it would take for intelligent life to evolve in that kind of simulation, how much computing power would be required, and whether simulating a range of different environments such as those we'd expect to encounter on exoplanets might one day tell us something about the variety of alien life in the universe. If quantum computers manage to achieve a speedup over classical computers I wonder if they might be able to help. I feel like efficiently simulating billions of years of natural selection is exactly the kind of thing that having strong AI would help us to achieve so it's a bit of a catch-22 if that is how we want to create the AI to begin with. I think it would be cool to evolve communities of AIs in the presence of some kind of selfishness hunter so that from very early on, altruism was selected for. Perhaps these AIs which naturally helped eachother for the good of the group could be taught to invite any sentient being they encountered (such as us) into their group.

Micah Blumberg Earlier today I made a post, this was it:
"As I watched this video I tried to picture how what goes on in human brains could be similar to a procedure generated world. Our memories do not need to be stored in our minds as long as the same input can trigger the same procedures that generate the same temporary memory. The same temporary canvas of information, the same moment in a brain canvas we will call consciousness."

Then I revisited your wall and I had another thought. What if the evolution of Artificial Intelligence will be really simple, like the way the computer draws a unique tree in an exact location because of math based drawing procedures. 

I mean the evolution of the design of the artificial brain will almost fall out as a matter of it's mathematical procedural underpinnings within it's ecosystem as the major source of inputs. One could advance the program in time as another input, generating an instant jump of say millions of years of evolution.

Jordan Tribby "Our memories do not need to be stored in our minds as long as the same input can trigger the same procedures that generate the same temporary memory." I think this is a deep insight, but I suspect it’s not as clean as a 1:1 correspondence between inputs and activation of particular memory patterns. A certain procedure might define a certain tree in a video game, but given that there is a lot of redundancy in the brain, I think the identical input could actually instantiate more than one version of a memory depending on which happened to be more available (the preceding activity of the brain probably has a lot to do with which particular version of a given memory might be available for activation [or reassembly from stored primitives, or whatever you want to call it]. Random noise also probably plays more of a role in the brain than in a video game). Suppose you met a person twice, once in a cafe and once in a library. In the first instance they had blonde hair, in the second instance they had black hair. If you’re presented with the input “describe this person”, will you always resound the same way? Will you always form the same image in your mind? I’d hypothesize if you were primed with either pictures of the cafe, or pictures of the library, and asked to recall details about the person, despite having the same input, you might activate different versions of the stored memory you have of how that person looks, depending on how you were primed. There are probably many studies that basically demonstrate this. So-called “state-depenedent” memory would also fit with this picture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent_memory). If you have many copies of a memory, say of walking down a particular street, I’d expect the state you were in when activating the memory would have something to do with which version gets put together, and which specific details you'd be able to recall, even though the input (the question “remember this particular street”) could remain the same.

As far as evolving artificial brains, I’m not sure that I’m following your train of thought. Are you describing a virtual world in which a feature of the virtual world is some virtual machine that evolves brains which pop out of the machine and then interact with other features of the virtual world to form feedback for subsequent iterations of the brain? Would you provide the first version of the brain, or are you expecting it to evolve on its own? I'm not sure how you can skip a million years of evolution. If the entire evolutionary history of the brain was already part of the program, then yes, you could jump to arbitrary points in its evolutionary history, but if you had only the brain's initial conditions and some evolutionary algorithm, you'd still have to apply those computational steps to update the brain, you couldn't skip a million steps and see how the brain would be. Perhaps if patterns emerged, there could be some shortcuts but I don't think you could ever skip ahead arbitrarily far to get the output of computations that hadn't actually been performed yet. Maybe I'm not understanding what you had in mind, but I think if you want to apply evolutionary algorithms to an artificial brain, you have to actually run those algorithms on the brain (and then run them again, and again) so the brain evolves.

Jordan Tribby As far as evolutionary algorithms as a path to AI in general, I think if you already start with a good architecture, you can improve it with evolutionary algorithms, but if you tried to get from really primitive structures like RNA to fully developed brains, even with computers that might exist 100 years from now (even assuming Moore’s law continued), I think it’s computationally intractable to simulate billions of years of evolution within a reasonable amount of time. We still don't know how likely our history was (more accurately, we don't know what percentage of SIMILAR planets given the same amount of time, would evolve life comparable to earth), so we might have to run simulations for much longer than 5 billion years to replicate the level of intelligence we have on earth. Obviously, nobody is really interested in trying to get artificial minds from that brute force kind of approach that involves molecules interacting in virtual worlds for billions of simulated years. I think it's very much an open question how far other evolutionary approaches can us get towards general intelligence (such as ones that modify code, or change the parameters of neural nets), but I suspect such approaches are best once we already have a ballpark idea and we want to improve upon it. I could imagine an evolutionary approach would be useful for taking a whole-brain emulation and getting it to perform better. I haven't read much about this topic, it would actually be really interesting to know what has actually been accomplished so far using evolutionary algorithms.

Micah Blumberg What I mean is, in the video they have described the computer drawing a virtual animal that is moving from point A to point B which might take a super long amount of time, the game designer says if you leave the planet in a spaceship and then return later on the computer will create a new drawing of the same land, and the same creature, but the creature will be farther along in it's journey than it was before. In this instance the creature sort of jumped farther along in it's journey toward B without actually moving through the distance between it's previous position and it's next position, because it didn't exist during the time that the player wasn't actually there.

What the computer is generating is an entire location in both space and time that didn't exist before, and won't exist when the player leaves, but exists again when the player returns, and when the player returns the world will be drawn with all of the locations of the animals advanced as they would have advanced had the player not left at all.

It makes me think of how spacetime could be just like that, but more interestingly I think about how a brain has so many connections, more connections than the stars of a galaxy like earth's galaxy. If each connection was represented as a planet, and each pulse that traveled through that connection was represented as an animal or a spaceship moving, and all of that was only generated as needed, and didn't exist when it was not needed.

It's sort of like a universe that exists consistently for a dissipative system, but it's existence can sort of be off or non-existent when there is no dissipative system there to observe it.

The brain is a dissipative system, and if you took a program like they have, that creates a universe for players, with billions of planets, that can generate the positions of animals at any point in time, all those procedural generated details could track the positions of soliton wave signals in an artificial mind of similar scale.

Additionally you could look at the development of that mind at any point in time, because the computer doesn't have to render all the inbetween steps between point A and point B, it only has to use the mathematical formula to generate a result of what the information output would be at a given point in time.

If you could somehow take the mind, represented by a program this large, and put that entire mind program inside a virtual character that is itself inside the same program, it would be like being a character on a planet inside your own mind. The universe itself would be doing the thinking for you. Or you could take the mind program and put it inside characters in a different program. Either way as these characters interact, they develop, live, eat, sleep, mate, create copies of themselves, die, and over time they evolve.

However all their movements, and all their thoughts are just movements, do not need to happen sequentially. A new observer might enter the game a trillion years later, and a trillion years will take the same amount of time to render as the next second takes to render, because it's all drawn from mathematical formulas, so it doesn't matter when.

Both time and space become sort of like secondary properties to underlying mathematical formula's.

Jordan Tribby Very fascinating stuff. I will have to think about this more. I think I understand what you mean better now, but I think there’s something wrong with that picture (at least as it pertains to our actual universe which is limited to storing something on the order of 10^122 bits of information)

If it were possible to create artificial minds inside a virtual world that could be called up at any arbitrary point in its future from a set of simple formulas, then it would be possible to solve NP-hard problems in polynomial time (which I’m afraid is too good to be true). Suppose my virtual brain is a mathematician and he checks one possible solution to an instance of the traveling salesman problem with 1000 nodes each virtual “day”. If you’re correct, then we could just skip ahead to day 1000!, by entering this 2557 digit number, and we could ask the virtual mathematician what the shortest path was between the nodes and he would be able to tell us the right answer. 

The problem seems to be that during all of those days that “didn’t exist” between day 1 and day 1000!, had they existed, the brain would have engaged in LEARNING. Even though the representation of the memories could be reduced to a set of rules, the specific content of these memories, the information determining which rules should be applied, would have to be stored somewhere (and in the example I gave, the the physical storage media for the memory would quickly exceed the size of the universe.) If we called up the brain on day 1000!, and asked it for the answer, given the actual computational resources available in the universe, the best it could tell us would be “I have no clue, yesterday was day 1. I closed my eyes and suddenly woke up here.”

If we wanted the brain to give us the correct answer, to store all the information the brain would have LEARNED during the missing days, the computer would have to store something like an additional 


Micah Blumberg Well not exactly, the idea is that the universe only has to render what is being observed, (it doesn't have to store what isn't being observed) and what is being observed is generated from mathematical formulas that result in all these fractals we seem to see everywhere. The universe doesn't have to store any data beyond the fundamental mathematical formulas that give rise to the position of every calcium ion in your brain. The reasoning is that these mathematical formula's can regenerate whatever your learning would have been, in the moment they are needed, regardless of whether you vanished from existence for some period of time prior to whatever is happening right now.

Jordan Tribby Since one thing that can be observed are the solutions to arbitrarily hard math problems, the kinds of formulas you are describing probably do not exist, and if they did, the memory requirements for storing them would approach infinity (as would the memory requirements for formulas that produced brains that thought of formulas that produced brains only as they were needed). I don't think there is any free lunch, if you replace straightforward memory storage with formulas that construct memories on the fly inside of a brain, and further stipulate that these formulas can output the same information that "would have" been output given traditional memory AND a lengthy computation, I think those formulas would themselves have to be extraordinarily complex, so complex in fact that I don't think you could store the formulas within the universe. I don't believe there are a few simple formulas that can "regenerate what you would have learned".. that information has to come from somewhere, it can't come out of thin air.

Jordan Tribby In the original example you gave of moving an animal linearly from point A to point B, it's clear that you can cut out the intermediary steps and figure out where the animal will be at some time in the future. This doesn't hold if there is learning that takes place along the path that causes the animal to change trajectory midway.

Micah Blumberg 1. We could be a four dimensional holographic projection of rules that are stored in 2 dimensions on the surface of a black hole, all the memory needed to generate (any part of) our 4 dimensional galaxy could be stored there in two dimensions.

2. An animal moving from point A to B be is no different than a calcium ion in your brain moving from point A to point B.

I think what you are missing is that assets generated in the moment from procedurals cost a lot less in terms of memory than actual assets that are permanently stored somewhere.

An asset would be a tree for example. You only need a few rules to generate a tree, you don't need to store the data of the actual tree when it doesn't exist. (or not being seen?) if you need to regenerate that tree, it will be the same tree, not because you stored it's data, but because it's regenerated from the same rules.

I don't know how much programming experience you have, but there is a joke, that goes, if your AI is more than 10,000 lines of code you're doing it wrong. Because really light programs can achieve amazing things from simple rules.

I'm not arguing that you can get a free lunch, only that this type of universe would necessarily be massively less costly in terms of the amount of data it had to store (compared to the universe you might imagine you are actually in). Somehow you think that the rules for regenerating a single moment in the cosmos would require more bits than everything that appears to exist in that moment, an idea is that is ignoring the principle idea. The principle idea that the information to generate what exists in any moment of the universe is far less than what appears. What appears is a complex outcome of far less complex rules.

Jordan Tribby I don't disagree with you about any of these general principles, so I probably wasn't clear if I gave the opposite impression. I understand for example, Jurgen Schmidhuber's idea about trying to discover the shortest possible program that could produce our universe, and that it can be quite short. I understand cellular automata, and how you can get extremely complex structures from simple rules. I also understand how the information within the volume of the universe might actually be stored on the 2D surface of the cosmological horizon rather than within, analogous to what the math says about the information contained within black holes being found in fluctuations on the surface of the event horizon (I don't think the holographic principle requires our universe actually is inside a black hole). Regardless of whether the information is fundamentally stored within the universe or on it's surface, if there is a block universe where past, present, and future all exist, it's not clear to me that you really save any computational resources by rendering only the scene of observers (if in a sense, the whole universe is already there, this would actually be more like a subtractive process where you had to first 1.) identify which observers you wanted to have a point of view and 2.) delete everything outside their view). I think that it would actually be less "expensive" to have a fully formed universe than one which reveals itself a little bit at a time because of the additional need of determining who counts as an observer. I could be wrong about this, but I'm having trouble understanding at the scale of a whole universe how you would save any resources the way you do in a video game by rendering objects as they are needed from the pov of your ONE observer (the built-in assumption that there is only one observer in a video game saves you the need of determining who counts as an observer.)

I don't dispute that you can build up objects from procedurals in a way that requires less memory than storing the whole object, but these procedurals still DO require memory, they are not free. I don't dispute you can build up a brain in this manner. Where you lost me was in suggesting that you can skip ahead into the future and have the brain know as much as it "would have known" if it had actually gone through the experiences it "skipped". Suppose a brain has 10 years of experiences. Even if all of these experiences are not individually stored in memory ahead of time, if the past moment ceases to exist as soon as it is no longer observed, the input that determines what is rendered using your procedurals is still included the prior state of the brain, those inputs are vital information that ultimately determine what state the brain will be in on the last day of year 10. Because there's a dynamic interaction between the brain and it's environment, you can't feed-forward knowing just the brain state on day 1 to know the brain state at some arbitrary future point. If you're on day 1 and you want to skip ahead 10 years, you can still render SOME BRAIN from the procedurals, but without all of the information contained in the series of ten years of brain states, it won't be the SAME brain you would have gotten if the brain had been allowed to have ten years of experiences. If you wanted that missing information to be made up for using the procedurals themselves, and indeed wanted the procedurals to make up for ANY potential missing experience, I was speculating that the storage requirements for such procedurals would approach infinity.

So to sort of summarize my thinking: The advantage you get from going sequentially is that you don't have to store all of the information ahead of time, you can forget the information as soon as it's no longer needed, but that information still has to pass through the system. If you want to skip ahead however, then that information DOES have to be stored somewhere ahead of time, you can't get that information for free. If you want that information (and any such information) to magically pop out from the formulas, then I have the strong suspicion that even if such formulas existed (which I doubt) they would end up not fitting within the universe because there would be so much potential information you'd have to make up for).

Micah Blumberg okay, lets go one more round on this one, lets say that you can calculate the location of all the atom/ions in the universe at any point in time from the core mathematics of it, and lets say that all the learning in a person's brain is just a relocation of atoms/ions really.

Jordan Tribby What you're describing is basically Laplace's demon, but I don't think it works because of quantum mechanics. I don't think we can know the precise location of every particle at every time from some fundamental equations, even if in some sense the universe "knows", or this knowledge might be accessible from some kind of god-like observer outside of the block universe.

Jordan Tribby I think if we, within the universe, had the ability to know the precise location of every particle at any time, it would lead to all kinds of violations, like no superluminal communication, the no-cloning theorem, etc. And it would also lead to some weird time paradoxes, like if you knew that you were alive ten years from now, could you commit suicide tomorrow?
