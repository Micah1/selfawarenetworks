Dualism is a map of reality, framed in polarities, and its not an illusion, but its also not the territory.

Even if dualism is not an illusion, your map of reality is missing exactly half of the story if you stop at the individual as the source of what he does.

Go inside that individual and you will find the source of what he does is the same physics that shapes stars and planets, he is one with all that is, and that non-duality is the only real actor.

A non-duality merged with the dualism that is the map in your mind makes the map an organic thing like a tree.

The mind grows like a tree, your thoughts and movements are its roots and branches.

You can choose all day, but I will know the truth, that your brain is growing your choices.

You are a tree who has dreamt of free will and dared not to dream that your thoughts are inseparable from the same physics that entangle particles and hearts alike.
