Okay, so essentially the rate coding with varying amplitudes in the inhibition and varying

magnitudes. So rate coding that results in the unique transmission of patterns along encoding

the synapses of each neuron. This rate coding with varying magnitudes and individually encoded

synapses results in the, the, the considerate detection and consequent emission. So that

so, so the neuron with its synaptic configuration represents the considerate to detection because

it's detecting in a stepwise, stepwise or computational input. We can say nonlinear input, but basically

it's like it's considering the, the sum of its, the, the clustered sum of its inputs over

a period of time. So a neuron considers the clustered sum of its inputs over time, which

is the same as a nonlinear computation. And so that means that it considers, it is effectively

considering through the weighing of charges, positive and negative charges, the, the clustering

of signals from its diverse branches of, diverse dendritic branches of, of synapses. It's

to be the, the detected, the, assuming the computation of all of its inputs over a window

of time. And that changes its, and the result is a change in the neuron's output in the

neuron's phase wave. So it could, so it has options. It could, it could be, if I had a

regular interval, it could seek with, with other neurons, or it could fire more solely,

it could become inhabited for a while, or it could fire at some faster range. And there's,

there's, there's, there are multiple faster ranges. So, so, there's the, there's the basic

action potential that's faster than the tonic action potential. The higher, so the, so the

neuron is going to fire regularly at a tonic rate, but it might fire physically at a faster

than tonic rate. And so, there's like this marker, which is like, you know, a standard

action potential firing that is faster than the tonic action potential of regular firing.

And, and then if that, if that action potential happens again at the same time, then it represents

a, it represents like a concurrence of, of, of, of past future bits, because, so now you

have the post snap, you have the post-saphtic side of, of the soma, and the pre-saphtic

side of the soma. So, that are going to encode seconds long. This is behavioral time-skeleton

after plasticity. They're going to encode seconds long, coincident detectant, coincident

detections. And this means that the pre-saphtic side of the soma, and the post-saphtic side

of the soma, are going to supercharge the action potential event if it happens again

at the same time. So, it's like the, the post-saphtic side of the soma gets encoded with the expectation

of when the last speed-up in action potential happens. And the timing of, in that, that

is going to send a surge of back propagation from the post-saphtic side of the soma, back

force the soma. And if the pattern that they're receiving from the input side, from the pre-saphtic

side of the soma, matches the post-saphtic side of the soma, then the soma does a burst

rate fire. And that's a higher phasic burst. So, at that point, the neuron at least temporarily

jumps into a different phase pattern signal. That could be, we could be jumping from like

20 Hz to 40 Hz to 60 Hz to 80 Hz. We could be jumping to 150 Hz. So, I'm sorry, this

is the, what I meant to say is the burst rate signal is like, kind of starts at 150 Hz.

So, we're jumping from whatever we were at 20, 40, 60, or 80 Hz tonically. We're jumping

up to 150, or 200, or 300 Hz, or 400 Hz, or 500 Hz, or 600 Hz. And the burst rates can

go all the way to 600 Hz. The maximum frequencies that are seen in the brain are around 600 Hz.

In human brains, I don't know if that has been observed in human beings or not, but in animal

brains, burst rate frequencies can go between 150 up to 600 Hz in granules cells, for example.

And we can see that there is an interplay between the high phasic burst and the slower

tonic burst. For example, there's an interplay between gamma burst and tonic theta patterns.

So, you know, you can see papers like, the one I recently added to the note number one

is a paper that basically shows us that when you go, when you have the organism driving

its own behavior, you can measure the amount of signals coming from the frontal cortex,

from a frontal part of cortex to the back, to the lower part of cortex. You can see that

the pattern of signals is that there's a lot more, it's a greater quantity of activity

coming from the top down, from the furthest end of the hierarchical feedback loop, backwards

towards the sensory inputs and outer outputs. And so, there's a direction of activity. I

mean, I guess the intention is for, it's really towards the outer outputs, what we're talking

about, but it's like the idea of, you know, stuff goes in through a hierarchy up to the

top and then it loops back down to the outer outputs. So, instead of, you can say it goes

up and it cycles, then it goes down and there's this, and it goes out again. So, you can kind

of think of the brain activity as like the Sonic the Hedgehog loop, where Sonic goes

into the loop from the left side of the loop, goes in a big circle upside down and then

back outside of the loop on the right side of the loop. And so, it comes in with an imagine

you have a loop for each of your senses. And each of those neurons is one of the Sonic

the Hedgehog loops. And each cortical column is also like a loop of loops. So, it's the

loop of like, so each cortical column is like a stack of Sonic the Hedgehog loops in the

formation of a loop. And then at the pyramidal cell, at the fifth and the sixth layers, they're

going to loop again. At the second and third layers, they're going to loop. And at the

fifth and sixth layers, they're going to loop again. So, they loop from the fifth and sixth

layers back down to the second or third and fourth layers. And they loop into the thalamus

from the incoming senses to the neocortex to the first, second and third layers to the

pyramidal cells and from the pyramidal cells from the tops of the pyramidal cells back

towards the thalamus and to other pyramidal cells and to the core thalamic neurons and

the matrix thalamic neurons that in the core thalamic neurons will do feedback loops for

the columns and the matrix thalamic neurons neurons will, the thalamic matrix neurons

will, will do loops in between cortical columns. And so, and then the, and then, and of course

the thalamus does loops with the, or basically like everything like loops through the thalamus

like the whole brain activity loops through the thalamus and the thalamus loops through

the hippocampus which is, which is like a special cortical column right in the center.

And so there's this, there's this thalamic hippocampal and terenal loop of activity.

And then stuff travels from the hippocampus and from other parts of the neurons back down

to the brainstem and out the motor branches. You have your motor signals that are going

from your brainstem downwards into your limbic system and out, out across to your fingers

and your toes and your larynx. And of course to your eyes, you've got all, you've got your

main, you've got all your different nerve branches, your incoming sensory nerves, but

they're also like, you know, controlling like the, the muscle movement and the position

of your eyes and your lungs. And so that's some more information about the map of the

brain. And yeah, so we've got, so each neuron is, so the timing of what the, the postsynaptic

neuron can fire is not just coming from the previously fired, the postsynaptic side of

the soma. The timing of what the postsynaptic side of the soma is, is going to do a back

propagation signal is not just set by the presynaptic side of the soma. There's also

modification of that timing from other neurons through the up-regulation and down-regulation

of, of back propagating signals, back propagating synaptic signals that are coming from a postsynaptic

neuron to the presynaptic neuron. So between the, backwards across the synaptic gap that

are either down-regulating or upward-regulating the synaptic pattern, which is the, which

is the, the frequency rate in which the, the exit terminal or the apical dendrite is going

to send a back propagating signal towards the soma to basically over-supercharge the

soma with a coincident arrival of, of charges to, from the, if the back propagating signal

to the soma and the dendritic burst arrive at the same time, dendritic based soma burst

arrive at the same time and, and you get a bursting signal. And so it's like, it's like

the synapse, it's so, it's like the, the neuron represents a part of a pattern. The idea is

that the pattern is like a sparsen distributed internal representation that is rendered with

the, when the neuron outputs its pattern through the exit terminal to other neurons. It's

rendered when the neuron signals, when the neuron sends signals to the next neuron via

a, a rate change and its neurotransmitter of release. So there's a, so the default is

that the neuron just repeats the last rate change that it had at a, at a tonic frequency.

So it doesn't, it doesn't like repeat bursts, but like when it's not bursting, it just repeats

the, the tonic rate frequency, which, which might be 20, which is like a power band frequency.

Could be 20 Hertz, 40 Hertz, 60 Hertz or 80 Hertz, but it is a regular pattern that a neuron

does. It's just going to, every once in a while, it's going to fire an action potential

at that frequency. And that is, so that encodes part of a pattern and, and in the neuron body

and it synapses will be up-regulated and down-regulated. So they'll have a, it will

have a combination of, of synaptic connections that results in the summation of its regular

tonic firing frequency. And that summation of synapses is going to be a combination of

up-regulated and down-regulated synapses. In other words, excited and excited and inhibited

synapses. And so that allows the, and so the number of, and it's also going to be firing

the tuning of its firing rate so that it's firing in the, in the same frequency as its

group as its cortical column is, is accomplished through getting regular excitatory signals

distributed from the pyramidal neurons to the thalamic neurons back down to its second

and third layer. Excited for a second and third layer. And we're talking about the case

of the pyramidal cell. The, the, the cortical columns, the pyramidal cells in the cortical

columns will receive signals that sort of prime the soma to have a certain energy threshold

that's more excited than, than the sensory inputs. So that combined, the sensory inputs

when combined with the level of, of, of soma activation will be more likely to trigger,

you could have less sensory input, can have more effect because there's already charge

in the soma that can set the neuron off. And so the amount of excitation of the soma will

make the neuron, when it, when the soma gets more excited, the neuron is more sensitive

to incoming senses. So neurons get excited and their excitement goes up and then they

become more sensitive. And it's like, when a person, like imagine if you get motivated

about some topic, if you get turned on to, it could be like maybe it's about food, you

get turned on to the idea of food, you start thinking about food. And it's like your soma,

there's a pattern of, of, of your pyramidal cells that are getting excited in the soma,

so they become more sensitive to the concept of, of food. And so you start looking for food

and related topics to what, and it doesn't have to be about food now. But maybe you, you

know, are looking for cheese and you're walking through the grocery store and you get excited

about cheese. And so your brain becomes more sensitive to cheese. And you start seeing

cheese everywhere. You see, like you're walking in the aisle, it doesn't have cheese in it.

But you notice the parmesan cheese, because the parmesan cheese is usually, is sometimes

located in the aisle, it doesn't have any cheese in it. It's like in a separate place

from the rest of the cheese. You know, you start talking about blue cars. It's the famous

saying. And imagine that you're, that you have the part, you have some of your neurons

that represent the patterns that, that your brain associates with cars. They're, they're

still much are getting excited so that the, so the inputs of those neurons are starting

to prefer the pattern of cars. And this idea is that the, the aggregate of the excited neurons

and the excited core of the columns is distinct enough to reduce the pattern of cars in the

rendering of your mind when you're, especially when you're sensory inputs coincide with

your expectation. So thinking about something is going to excite your internally in your

feedback, which is going to excite your, your pyramidal cells are going to go through the

thalamus through your central processor. And they're going to excite the second and third

layer neurons to prime the soma to it, to look to basically the prime. They're changing

the timing of the synapses on the apical dendrites to so that if you walk across the blue car

after, you know, or, or food or whatever you have decided to think about, then, then you're

going to get burst firing because now your, your set expectations will match the incoming

sensory patterns. And so you're more likely to notice after listening to this, you're

more likely to notice cheese at the grocery store and parmesan cheese in particular, especially

if it's not in the aisle with the cold cheese. And you're more likely to notice blue cars

after listening to this and other cars. And, and, and anything else that you're thinking

about, you're more likely to think about food or something. If you were listening to this,

it's like really thinking about it. And you can, and you can so whatever you want to think

about, that becomes that, like you can add make up your brainstorm a list of things that

you want to be focused on. And then that's sort of going that is going to excite certain

patterns via a configuration, a learned configuration of, of quarter column based patterns that are

also they're excited by the six layer feedback through via the thalamus. But they're also

the patterns are also shaped by the interneurons, which are in sync with the pyramidal neurons.

So the patterns are also. And so neurons are neurons that are far columns, columns of neurons

that are firing at the same frequency and individual neurons from different columns

that are firing at the same frequency can be linked together or blocked from link being

linked together by the GABA orgic inhibitory interneurons. And so you get selective, you

get select patterns of neural activations from different columns that can represent different

patterns like cars and houses and boats and cats and different neural patterns can play

through brain evoking different kinds of sensory renderings. And this can happen because the

neural path of the sequences that plays back in your brain is defined by the inhibitory

interneuron GABA orgic firing. So the firing basically the patterns that your brain produces

can be modified in real time by the GABA orgic inhibitory interneurons, which is in which

is like in sync with the excitatory tuning of the six layer pyramidal cells that are

routed through the phylamic matrix and phylamic core neurons to provide a loop of feedback

to your brain cells. And so in a sense your mind consists of these configurations, these

synaptic configurations of patterns that are changing the individual timing and the combination

of the timing of different neural patterns across different cortical columns and within

different cortical columns. And so you have connections that are basically configurations

of firing patterns across the brain and they're coordinated through synchrony and they're

connected through and so signals are coordinated through sequence firing, but thanks to oscillatory

physics and the oscillatory firing also binds the signals so that they can be so that your

whole brain can be combined sensor-transmitter system. So the changes, the way the burst

rates, the higher phasic burst rates change, the tonic higher magnitude but lower frequency

signals is the process of which your brain is detecting its own information. So the burst

rates represent the rendered information and the tonic rates represent the canvas to which

the rendered information is rendered too. So the canvas of your mind is the tonic firing

rates that are changed by the burst rate firing which is the pen of your mind and the interplay

between the pen of your mind and the canvas of your mind is shared by the whole mind through

the process of the tonic firing absorbing the phasic firing. So it's like the pen, the

paper absorbs the pen and that paper is this higher magnitude lower frequency and the pen

is this higher frequency low magnitude. Think about the pen ink. Pen ink is a lower frequency

meaning that it's higher magnitude so it's like this dark line across which you can also

have basically like a dark paper with a thin light line and that would be the negative

action potential which is the slow wave potential which is slower than the tonic frequency but

it still has that sort of like, it's still recognized by the tonic pattern because of

its irregularity because essentially like whether a pattern is extremely like whether

it's a burst pattern or an inhibitory pattern the point is that it's etching some uncommon

signal and it's interesting is that your brain, when things are happening in real time they

are, your memories are played in a forward sequence and when you think about memories

that happened in the past those memories are played in a backward sequence. Now you see

this with Busaki's work when you're about to do something you, the pattern repeats

three times. It repeats really fast and maybe 200 hertz and then it plays out at the behavioral

time scale where you play out that pattern, same pattern that played at 200 hertz you

predicted you're going to do something and then you do it and then you remember that

you did it and when you remember that you did it it plays it back super fast again but

backwards and those are like the three steps of a burst fire rate. When you're about to

do something you think about what you're going to do first and then you do it and when you

do it it's happening at the behavioral time scale which means it's happening much more

slowly and then after you're doing it you, you get this receipt this basically the whole

sequence plays back really fast backwards. This is what medical imaging shows us. So

basically basically the narrow path of that represents the tasks that you're thinking

about that real fast and that you're doing, the steps that you're taking to get to some

goal and then thinking about what you just did, that path is a sequence of firing, it

might be an original sequence of neuro firing and across, that means a sequence of firing

patterns that happened both within one cortical column and within many cortical columns that

were also locked in a firing sequence. So there's firing sequences inside the cortical

columns that are coincident with firing sequences inside other cortical columns and at a higher

scale so there are sequences across cortical columns. So it goes back to basically like

the computation of the brain is a firing sequence of basically a step wise, computation

is a step wise nonlinear or nonlinear or clustered summation of inputs via the consideration

of charges which become weighed when, when charges exceed the thresholds, the thresholds

that are defined by the capacity of the neuron by its size and its dimensions and it's basically

its morphology which can, which changes you know because if the neuron is getting, neurons

will grow to adapt to the inputs that they're getting and this causes the preference of

certain patterns but this also shapes neural paths. When neurons grow or form long-term

memories this also shapes the path, the path at which signals will travel. So it shapes

the preference of how signals will travel and so brains have, so long-term changes are

happening to your brains on an individual neuron scale and this changes the computation

at the neuron level, at the cortical column level, at the inter, at the inter-cortical

column level. So you have almost like an, so the network of the brain is basically a

network of individual neuronal computation that is networked together in collective neuronal

computation through cortical columns and through thalamic net loops and this results in a vast

array of pattern configurations or basically combinations of learned patterns that result

in sequences of behaviors, learned sequences of behaviors that connect to rewards that

are continually modified to drive new consequences or new rewards which are also, which are a

type of consequence, rewards or penalties but basically new consequences. So you have

as an organism navigates the environment with this neural computation the development

of these pathways continues and yeah it's basically it.
