a mental model of the environment, generates predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input. this comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model

I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.
