Einstein's Gravitational Redshift "clocks running closer to a large body such as earth will run slower than those from far away. Also known as Time dilation

My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?

Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.

Mass is the Magnitude of many volumetric frequencies (particles) oscillating together. With the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency defining spacetime at all scales, from galaxies, to EEG powerbands, to nmda spikes & soma bursts, to particles.
