Note this recording is from a group conversation hosted by a friend whose publication is titled: Black & Chrome Media, I participated in her conversations hosted on Clubhouse. Here is a link to the recording I made from her event. https://recorder.google.com/b3240a10-7354-4063-abd4-c46bbb367e39

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 1: Summarize:
The conversation revolves around the idea of a simulation theory and whether it is a valid explanation for reality. The participants discuss various concepts such as quantum entanglement and the possibility of living in a simulation created by someone else. There is also a debate about whether simulation theory adds complexity or simplifies the understanding of reality. Some participants express skepticism about the theory and emphasize the need for falsifiability. The conversation ends with a mention of neural virtualization and its potential ties to the simulation theory.

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 1: Summarize in one sentence:
The conversation covers various perspectives on the idea of the universe as a simulation, including arguments for and against it, references to quantum physics and entanglement, and discussions about the complexity of reality and the limitations of understanding.

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 1: Make a comprehensive list of all key points:
The conversation revolves around the idea of a simulation hypothesis, and whether it is an easier explanation for reality or adds complexity to our understanding of reality.

The concept of a simulation hypothesis is similar to the idea of a 3D environment being rendered by a computer to navigate through it.

Quantum entanglement is cited as a potential example of how reality could be a simulation, but there are also complications to consider.

The simulation hypothesis must be falsifiable to be a valid argument.

There are varying levels of skepticism among the participants in the conversation, with some being more open to the idea than others.

The conversation also touches on related concepts, such as religion, mental health, psychic abilities, and AI.

There is a discussion about the limitations of understanding and comprehension, with some participants being more optimistic about the potential for understanding than others.

There is a recognition that scientific understanding is constantly evolving, and that new discoveries could lead to a greater understanding of reality."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 1: List the most interesting arguments:
The idea that we could be living in a simulation is an interesting and thought-provoking concept.

Quantum entanglement suggests that reality could be a simulation.

If the simulation hypothesis actually makes reality easier to understand, then it could be a simpler and less complex explanation for what reality is.

If understanding the rules of quantum physics and reality at a fundamental level can show that reality is in some sense a computation or a simulation, then calling the universe a simulation is a simpler and less complex explanation for what reality is than the old way.

If anyone pursues the idea that there's a simulation and it's not falsifiable, then it's obviously a religion, and the simulation hypothesis has to be a falsifiable argument to be real.

There are no strict limitations on what we can understand, but people can accept limitations on what they can understand for themselves.

Neural virtualization and its possible tie to other dimensions is an interesting concept to consider."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 1:
Do any references in scientific literature support or refute key arguments? As an AI language model, I cannot access the most up-to-date scientific literature beyond my knowledge cutoff of September 2021. However, many of the key arguments surrounding climate change and its effects on the environment have been extensively studied and documented in scientific literature.

For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regularly produces comprehensive reports on the state of climate science and the impacts of climate change on the environment. These reports are based on a wide range of scientific studies and are reviewed by thousands of experts from around the world.

Other scientific studies have investigated the effects of rising global temperatures on ecosystems, agriculture, and human health. Some studies have also explored potential solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions or developing new technologies.

Overall, while there may be disagreements among scientists about specific details of climate change and its effects, the scientific consensus is that human activities are driving global warming and that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the worst impacts of climate change.

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2: Respond to text (no instructions given):
It sounds like you were talking about the phenomenon of de-rendering in video games and how it relates to our perception of reality. As for why distant objects can appear foggy or de-rendered, it could be due to limitations in our visual system, such as the fact that our eyes can only perceive a certain amount of detail and resolution at different distances. Additionally, atmospheric conditions, such as fog or haze, can also affect our perception of distant objects.

As for the topic of consciousness and how it relates to the brain and PTO waves, it is a complex and still largely unresolved issue in neuroscience. While we know that certain brain activity patterns are associated with different states of consciousness, such as sleep, there is still much we don't understand about how the brain gives rise to subjective experience. PTO waves, or posterior to anterior traveling waves, have been observed in the brain during certain tasks, but their precise role in consciousness is still not well understood."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2:
Summarize: The discussion covered topics such as the substrate for rules and properties, the possibility of an ideal language, and the limitations of our perception of reality. The conversation also touched upon the complex issue of consciousness and its relationship to the brain and PTO waves, which are still not fully understood.

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2 Summarize in one sentence:
The question covered topics related to substrate independence in language, the ideal language for realization of concepts, limitations in our perception of reality, and the complex issue of consciousness and brain activity patterns.

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2: Make a comprehensive list of all key points:
The discussion touched upon the idea that if the virtualization hypothesis is true, then the substrate for rules and properties may not matter as long as a set of rules has been codified in a certain language.

There was a question about whether an ideal language exists that could be applied to any substrate to gain insight into the universe.

The conversation also covered the idea that there are limitations to our perception of reality, including the phenomenon of de-rendering in video games and the effect of atmospheric conditions on our perception of distant objects.

The topic of consciousness was also discussed, with an acknowledgement that it is a complex and still largely unresolved issue in neuroscience.

PTO waves, or posterior to anterior traveling waves, were mentioned as being associated with certain tasks in the brain, but their precise role in consciousness is still not well understood.

There was a suggestion that experimentation with PTO waves may offer insight into the relationship between the brain and consciousness.

The conversation also touched upon the idea that language, rationales, and the brain's processing of information all play a role in how we understand the universe."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2: List the most interesting arguments:
The idea that an ideal language could exist that could be applied to any substrate to gain insight into the universe is intriguing.

The discussion on the limitations of our perception of reality, including the phenomenon of de-rendering in video games, was thought-provoking.

The topic of consciousness and its relationship to the brain and PTO waves is complex and still not well understood, making it an interesting area of discussion.

The suggestion that experimentation with PTO waves could offer insight into the relationship between the brain and consciousness is an intriguing proposal."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2: Can you elaborate on this part of the conversation that was about: "PTO waves, or posterior to anterior traveling waves, were mentioned as being associated with certain tasks in the brain, but their precise role in consciousness is still not well understood. There was a suggestion that experimentation with PTO waves may offer insight into the relationship between the brain and consciousness."

ChatGPT: Sure, PTO waves, also known as posterior to anterior traveling waves, are a type of brain activity pattern that have been observed in the brain during certain cognitive tasks, such as memory retrieval and decision making. These waves are thought to reflect the flow of information from the back of the brain to the front, which is important for higher-level cognitive processes such as attention and decision making.

Although PTO waves have been studied for many years, their precise role in consciousness is still not well understood. Some researchers have suggested that PTO waves may play a role in integrating information across different regions of the brain, which could be important for generating a coherent perception of the world. Others have suggested that PTO waves may be involved in shaping the neural activity that gives rise to conscious experiences.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the precise role of PTO waves in consciousness, some researchers have suggested that further experimentation with these waves could offer new insights into the relationship between the brain and consciousness. For example, by manipulating the activity of PTO waves using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), researchers could potentially shed light on how these waves contribute to conscious experience. However, much more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between PTO waves and consciousness."

# ChatGPT 3.5 Part 2: Do you know of any research, articles, citations that may be relevant to this text?:
Yes, here are a few research papers that are relevant to the discussion on PTO waves and consciousness:

Zhang, Y., Meyyappan, S., Kastner, S., & Wimmer, K. (2020). Attentional modulation of posterior to anterior information flow and its relation to alpha desynchronization. Journal of Neuroscience, 40(14), 2807-2818.

These papers explore various aspects of PTO waves and their potential role in consciousness, including attentional modulation, the neural correlates of consciousness, and working memory networks."

# Part 3: ChatGPT 3: Summarize:

ChatGPT:  The conversation revolves around the possibility of living in a simulation, with various perspectives and theories discussed, including the use of senses as gateways to education, the simulation of the physical brain, and the concept of determinism. One theory proposed is the "all in one" theory, where every life and experience is the same person in a different time period.

# Part 3: ChatGPT 3: Key points:

Discussion about what data is coming in and out of the brain through the senses, particularly the eye, and how it relates to brain-machine interfaces and education

Discussion about the possibility of living in a simulation and how it could relate to determinism and free will

Different types of simulations and their implications

Discussion about the idea of every life and experience being a version of oneself in a different time period.

# Part 3: What did the text say about the eye?

ChatGPT 3.5: The text mentions experimenting with the eye to understand what information goes in and out of it, and how it relates to the brain. It also discusses research on how young children develop their sense of object permanence through visual stimuli, and the potential use of different senses as gateways to education.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription

# Part 1

Are we considering it or anyone who was skeptical about it and now considers it a real possibility

just out of curiosity?

You know, I can't.

Go ahead.

I was thinking, I just jumped in, so I'm not sure if the context of what we mean by

speculation or not, so maybe someone can give a brief description.

So, I mean, you have like the mental health effect, you have...

So imagine a line has to navigate through its own environment and then it has to, do

you know just the way a computer can render a 3D object from code, our brains render

3D objects from incoming senses, and so the line is rendering a 3D environment in order

to navigate that environment, and it's rendering a representation of itself in order to move

through that environment, so that it can go from point A to point B.

You know, things, Coraline, I think it's a very big issue, I think it's like, it's

like, you can't really solve religion or you can't solve a lot of questions just within

an hour, but we are just discussing it long, but I hope it's okay that I joined and expressed

so much skepticism.

I do find it...

Here, you know, obviously not the universe, but it begins to show that certain aspects

of intelligence may very well be modeled.

So I had a thought about this a while back that I feel is basically the key idea here,

and that is that in order for a simulation theory to be relevant, it has to be easier

to explain reality itself, whereas if you have a situation where adding simulation theory

to reality adds a plus one to the complexity of reality, then we have to eliminate it because

of like Occam's razor, right?

We have to go with the simplest explanation of reality.

So the only situation in which we would switch from reality is what scientists have been

telling us for a long time, the simulation, is if the simulation hypothesis actually was

the easier explanation for what reality is, and so that's the big question, is it adding

complexity to our understanding of reality, or is it making reality easier to understand?

So by definition, does the simulation have to be created?

No, I mean, some people are debating whether or not it's been created already, right?

I mean, obviously, somebody created it, maybe, you know, somebody is either a, you know,

someone else's computer and someone else, you know, could be a Russian doll problem

where it's just one simulation and another and another and another, is that what you

were talking about, Chairman?

Yeah, but I guess even there, I guess, like, someone's hitting, like, I guess it's the

question of, like, it's programmed and someone has to go, like, if we think of, like, like,

have an, have an issue of physics simulation, right, we have kind of initial state degrees

of freedom and interactions between those degrees of freedom and just let the system

fall forward in time.

And then I guess, at that point, that's almost the same thing as reality to me, so, but I

get, there is, like, that higher question of whether someone actually, like, programmed

it and hit start in the first place.

Well, there's also a theory that we are our own, it's the matrix idea, where we're in

charge of our agent here on Earth, and we are in another dimension trying to have a

human experience and seeing what that's like, because we are of a higher level of intelligence,

and we want to know what it's like to breathe air and have sex and listen to rock and roll

and get drunk on whiskey or fall in love, you know, and we don't have that in this other

dimension.

I think that's a very interesting way of looking at it as well when it comes to, like, manifesting

and you get into some of the more, you know, psychic abilities or precognition.

It's pretty fascinating to look at it that way as well.

If I could say, I think if the simulation has to be someone else's, that we're on someone

else's computer, we're adding complexity, and therefore, you know, we can, with Occam's

razor, we can say, okay, well, that's not necessary.

It could be true, but it's less likely than that we're not.

Did I cut out?

Yeah, so if the simulation is that we have to be on someone else's computer, then we

have to say, well, where did that computer come from?

That is similar to the argument, well, that, you know, God created the universe, well,

what created God?

Right?

It's sort of like that.

That is like additional complexity that's not needed, and then we can just cut that

theory down because it's not necessary.

There's an easier explanation.

But if it's the case that, you know, if understanding the rules of, if understanding the properties

and maybe you call them the laws of quantum physics and reality at a fundamental level,

if we can say, well, reality is in some sense a computation or a simulation or a holographic

simulation, like I'm throwing a bunch of buzzwords in there, right?

But if at that point, maybe that ties into Amy's idea that beingness can exist at a different

level of abstraction that's different and has different dimensions that are less physical,

then maybe there's a way to say that calling the universe a simulation is a simpler and

less complex explanation for what reality is than the old way.

And in that case, as more people begin to understand that and agree with that, then that

would become the consensus, perhaps, but it'd have to be shown.

We have to get to the point where, you know, Lilith would even agree that it's easier to

understand reality as a simulation, you know, to understand, you know, everything from quantum

physics to life and everything else in between, but I'm not yet at that understanding, so

I don't know that that is an easier explanation.

So, Amy, you're talking about, like, the random Nevada text things or, like, say, I myself,

I would have agency, but, like, the inputs coming from the external world are all simulated

for me?

Exactly.

I mean, I think quantum entanglement is interesting, and I think that Lilith, do you work with

quantum physics?

No, no, just good old-fashioned linear algebras is what makes the AI that I work on work.

Yeah, it's...

Okay, cool.

I think, you know, quantum entanglement is, I think, the biggest example, I think, of

how it could be a simulation.

I think of all of the reasons, you know, that you can go through, the fact that, you know,

you can...

Well, I mean, I'm not a quantum physicist, but I do study it, and I can't articulate

it correctly, but I know that if you are, you can put...

Is there anybody here that can explain that you could put two particles together and then

you can separate them, right, and they behave the same way?

That to me suggests that, okay, if we're talking to ourself in our mind, which everybody does,

I mean, we all bounce ideas off of our...

Your microphone broke out, but that, I think you're referring to one.

Quantum entanglement.

Go ahead, Micah.

Your microphone was breaking up, so I just threw in that I think you're talking about

quantum entanglement, but I'll just pause and let you continue, sorry.

The mic...

Your microphone broke up, that's what I was talking about.

So, yeah, I'm having some...

A bad connection.

Sorry.

I just think that, you know, if you split atoms or you split particles, correct, and

there's an entanglement, I just look at the mind as in there's an entanglement in

another dimension that is communicating with me here.

Some people call that God, and we are able to exist in different planes, and that is

proven with quantum entanglement, so I just think that's interesting.

Anybody have any thoughts on that?

So, there are some complications to that, so if my mind is in an effect, so say my mind

is entangled with some external dimension, as you say, if that mind is also interacting

with the real world, then you're having a continuous loss of that entanglement connection.

So, you would have to keep those elements completely isolated to keep that entangled

connection fixed, and then you can't use quantum entanglement to transmit classical

information.

You're only really...

At least classical information can pass it, and it must be the light.

You can...

You're only really...

It's sort of complicated to go into, but you can only kind of transmit these correlations,

but there's no classical information that you can transmit fast in light with quantum

entanglement.

I have one thing that I wanted to say, well, they say a lot of different things with particle

accelerators and stuff like that, like random things that could happen, especially when

things are split, like atoms, things are split, you know, like split into two different

things that are equivalent to something they would switch to whenever they put off, you

know, immediately, like faster than even light.

And there's like so many different theories, but I think maybe it's a part of that paradox

type of thing that they talk about with particle accelerators and stuff, and how anything could

happen, you know, by creating a successful particle accelerator or splitting atoms or

something.

So maybe that's kind of like opening up Pandora's box right there.

Well, thank you everyone for explaining and helping me try to look at things in a different

way.

It sounds like if I'm to have any hope of really understanding it, I might have to do

a lot more physics homework and like get caught up on the math and the equations that have

convinced people that this is like a...

Well, remember, you can create your own equation too.

Like everything is, everything in the world is not strict, you can become your own, like

you can discover something today too, you know, so yeah.

I think you're giving me too much credit, like, yeah, I can do some math, but I'm not...

I don't think I can contribute to like a field of physics or anything.

But I mean, I think, okay, like I can still appreciate it.

So I can definitely appreciate it.

I'm like an analogy or as a way of exploring certain ideas.

I guess I just can't help but have a lot of skepticism about it as an actual, like, right,

to talk about it as like an actual, like this is our theory of what is happening, it's like

a very different thing from if I'm just exploring the analogy or different ways of like making

sense of our lived experiences, like it's just like a very different thing than to really

consider it as like a, as an explanation for reality.

It exists not really, I mean, depending on how we're gonna get, how we're gonna find this

simulation, but it's just not really possible to find it, right?

Yeah.

So I would say one kind of, I wouldn't say we're living in this situation, but I would say if you're looking for something that kind of like directs you towards the idea of something like a simulation, is that look at how the world turns towards reality.

It's kind of almost as, because when I was younger, some stupid, but I actually thought like I was a thing inside of another, you know, sort of a person that was living through an eye and it keeps going over and over and over and over.

But I don't know if we certainly didn't there, and I would say that, you know, everyone can be right and everyone can be wrong at the same time. But one thing that's always kept me on the loop is that in a simulation, everything has to be chaotic.

Whether a researcher or the person conducting the survey or the simulation, to kind of figure out what they're simulating, I think we can do that in the world. How can we do that in the world? I'm not trying to say anything, but I'm saying maybe that could be, maybe that could not be, but something that we can look at, you know.

If anyone purses the idea that there's a simulation and it's not falsifiable, that is obviously a religion, and I just will unfollow that person and never listen to them again, because you can't like, a simulation has to be a falsifiable argument to be real.

It's like saying in religion, they say, well, you have to believe there's a thing above your mind that you can't understand, and I have to say, no, I disagree with that. I believe that there's nothing above my mind, you have to approve that.

You can't just say, oh, there's things above your mind, you can't understand them, and there's things you can't figure out, consciousness can't be figured out.

Like, these are like fake sort of like boundaries that people are trying to put on you to keep you inside the matrix, inside their ideas, so I just will not listen to them just really.

Well, I thought what these questions are, I just want to say what I think is one good. One thing I want to say is I'm the same as you, I don't particularly like, you know, look religions at all, but one thing I want to say is that there aren't things that allow us to not understand or comprehend,

maybe other intelligence might be one, so I don't think it's going to happen in the rest of the universe. I think it's now that you can comprehend all the ability that we can now have to comprehend, especially in our lifetime.

But I'm going to say, I'm going to watch the movie now, I'm going to say to just, you know, believe in you man, etc.

I'm just saying, something tells me something like, you know, lead to work, lead people to AI or living through robotics or something, we can finally understand.

So the only thing I would ask you is, instead of saying we don't, we can't understand it, just say I can't understand it, and don't speak for me, don't speak for other people, just say I can't understand it, but for yourself.

You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not accepting any sort of limitations on what I can understand, but you're welcome to do that for yourself.

You see, you were going to have something, I'm still thinking about the neural virtualization, and how it had a tie to it. Jerry, you were saying something about some properties and laws, and how it, you know, it possibly had a lot of other dimensions.

# Part 2

Does a substrate for rules and properties, does it, assuming the virtualization kind of hypothesis is true, that it doesn't matter, that neurons don't really matter, and therefore the substrate doesn't matter, and you can apply a set of rules to seemingly any substrate, as long as you have codified it in a certain kind of language.

Do you see, am I going off the deep end here? No, I mean that is what some people say. That there is some artificial entity that is a program that is running, and that this program is interpretable basically by, you know, it constructs universes, and it constructs us,

and we obey, and we discover what it already presents to us by reverse engineering, what it is presenting to us.

Yeah, so like what I'm saying is, yeah, exactly, if, is there an ideal, or has it been involved by, which is 008, supreme language that could possibly be out there, that if we were to be applied to our current substrate, that it would kind of give us an insight into this, you know, because as language involves, you know,

learning things, even going to the quantum stuff, now everyone's talking about like ZX calculus, and all these different new ways to, for representation of the universe.

Is that, do you think that if we had, is there an ideal language that we could eventually realize these concepts with?

Looking at people in the AI community are still struggling with that, and there's, it depends on the kind of domain that you're talking about. You know, some people talk about, you know, some researchers talk about making languages that are so abstract,

like that, you know, humans might have a difficult time following, you know, but that's still, I don't think it would necessarily as my goal is to not be able to understand them eventually, but again, it's sort of that machine learning neural network type of complexity where it becomes a horned standstone of sort of disambiguation,

the need to disambiguate, you know, but I think it depends on the domain that you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about English and humans, you know, then we have our language that we have all, and all the rationales that go with all of the things that we do,

and you also have the, there's English that, you know, it's my opinion that the English is embedded in a lot of, a lot of domains, you know, when Micah speaks about his topic, where Jeffrey talks about his topic,

you know, anyone talks about what they're good at, what they're not knowledgeable about, they're constantly using language to situate what they know, and to explain what they know, to reason out everything, to connect every idea, you know,

you know, perfectly or, you know, as close to perfect alignment as they can to be able to make it understandable to somebody else so that it can be, if they basically turns into basically a codification in and of itself, an algorithm in and of itself,

and that's the way I like to work in the AI area is to be able to merge the directions, the language, the rationales, the how, the why, the cause, the effect, all of the subtle stuff right down to the unit of where it can't be decomposed any further.

So I would just assume that, you know, based on everything that I've seen on this planet, maybe when I go to my other planet, I'll tell you more, but on this planet at least, you know, it seems like there's a mixture of languages going on in our heads,

in addition, not only to the languages, but as Micah would well point out, and as you pointed out, the substrate, you know, our brains, as it interfaces with our brain, and so you mix all of that together, the way our brain processes and fires and connects all of this information,

the information itself, then the environment, and so that all could, if you were to be able to create a simulation of everything, all that I'm speaking of, then you might arrive in some, I think, sort of universal language that would be computable in a way that is not just standing there in a sort of machine,

but actually begins to take on a sort of a sentient, autonomous type of creature that is, you know, being able to interact with the universe in some deeper way than, you know, some simple computer.

Hey, Jordan, can I ask you a question? Sure, go for it. So, like, speaking about, like, simulations, you know, like, in a sandbox where simulations occur,

when I was in there, I used to always think about, like, de-rendering, like, you know, when you're in a game, and you look away from somewhere, a completely de-render is to see processes, you know, right from something like that, like, energy, you know, et cetera, of a memory, and then the moment you look at it again, everything is just boom, and you're like, you know what I mean?

How games are different, you know? Yeah. And so I was wondering, what about, like, some of the things like that, or, like, you know, when you're looking far in the back of the, like, a mountain, or a valley, or something, and you kind of see it's, like, distant and far and foggy and kind of, like, de-render almost completely.

I used to think about that a lot when I was younger, and then just before you fall asleep, it's like, you know, you're still aware, you're still conscious, like, the sound is gone for a second, and then you realize that it's gone, and then, like, now it's back, and your eyes are closed, you know what I mean?

What do you think of that? To be honest, I don't know. I mean, I just don't have much to say about that. I just think it's, some of the things that you're talking about are just sort of natural events.

So, I mean, there is some things to break apart. We have limits to our senses, and so, you know, things don't always remain coherent. So things do break apart. Things do get disassociated.

Things do become, you know, chaotic, or at least singly chaotic. So, yeah, I mean, these things we talk about in the mirror, they seem to be pretty explainable in multiple domains, but maybe there's some, you know, again, we still don't know.

Again, many people speak as if, you know, again, we, I know Micah, I've got to be, you know, attentive to, like, this idea that I speak for myself, but I can say that, you know, I would make a statement that some people do big claims, you know, that they are,

you know, there's certain levels of definitiveness, I think, that we need to be able to publicly at least discuss about how, you know, how people characterize their level of understanding to their level of claim as to how much they know about the universe.

And I have to say that it's still, and, you know, as we discussed in here, it's still not really enough. So, you know, when you're talking about them regarding, you know, looking out into the universe and not knowing what's there, it's certainly still very relevant, because we still don't.

There's that. Yeah, I think that rendering would require a highly, I guess, if I'm thinking back to the brain and the, like, matrix-type simulation that the five agencies and someone's feeding me, some digital simulation of my world that I'm like, a digital simulation of my environment directed to my brain,

that computation would need to be at least as large as the amount of degrees of freedom within my life come.

Yeah, exactly. And then it is a good question on top of that, how much can you compress that information, such that certain computations could be fast forwarded for certain effects, other things.

I mean, you have to think, what experiments can I do to try and distinguish between, you know, what breaks the laws of physics or something like that.

So, give me whatever tools I have access to, and more precise tools or measurements that I can make about the world and the more precise that simulation needs to be.

Thank you, bring up a good point, Jeffrey, and I'm like, what tools, and you're talking about as you drift off to sleep.

So, Jeffrey, you're talking about light cones, maybe, like, experimenting with PTO waves, like, punch them to manipulate occipital waves as you're drifting off.

Your brain kind of entertains other algorithms that normally wouldn't kind of tear apart the domains that were, because, like, maybe it's more interesting, like, we're talking about domains,

but the walls between the domains and how, as you drift off and just sleep those PTO waves, I mean, I don't quite know exactly much about them,

but from what I understand from an ophthalmological perspective, like the PTO waves, they kind of, with your occipital, they tease apart those domains and kind of do other things algorithmically

that you normally wouldn't, your brain normally doesn't do in normal consciousness.

Yeah, literally, yeah.

I have no background in neuroscience or anything about unconsciousness or anything like that, so I'm over front and coming to you.

# Part 3

What information goes in and out of the eye, like, you know, to coax, like, what data is coming in and out of our brain?

We know through our eyes and ears and mouth, but, like, looking at the eye and observing the eye as you drift off into consciousness or unconsciousness to see what,

because that's when your brain is literally exposed through your eye, and as there are really, through our brain-machine interface,

probably, if it's non-invasive, it would have to go through the eye, because that's when your brain exposes from what I understand.

So that means experimenting through, with doing experimentation with the eye, of course.

And the way, like, I'm going to just, um, make you room and laugh, you know, if you guys put on that podcast, that's relevant to what the PTO waves.

Yeah, I think I've been using all of the senses, um, you know, because hearing, uh, vastly improves with blindness, so, um,

I would say experimenting with all of the senses would be even a touch, you know.

I don't have a specific, you know, getting into some of the work that I do.

I think I was just sort of indicating, like, a conversation, if you've got another.

I don't know, so another row, some days ago.

But I do work around simulating what a child would first sense, and it's interesting when you, I mean, they used to do experiment, they still do,

but I mean, they would, they were doing them more, um, a few years ago, where they were taking children into, um, dark rooms, very, very young,

three, four month, five month old children, and they would limit all the other stimuli that would darken the room, and then put just colors on.

And they would literally just make it so that the child would, um, would not know, they would bring children in who didn't clearly had no concept of object permanence,

which is Viaget's, um, concept, I mean, his concept, his, his, uh, statement that basically children, there's a certain point where they cross this rubicon,

where they're able to say that they know that something exists, that they, that they, you know, they can begin to point to something,

and they actually know whether they have a prediction in their mind that, that they've seen it before, or they've seen it in a particular place,

and they're going to see it again, uh, that kind of thing. And so they're trying to, uh, sort of induce that in children, uh, before it actually happens outside of reality.

So they're sort of accelerating the child's propensity to do that sort of sensing with their eyes, and they find that, you know, Viaget had suggested that some children would take them till, you know, they were maybe, you know,

I don't know, 12 months old, 13 months, a certain number of months before they could get that, but they're finding that the children were able to, something as early as four months,

um, were able to be able to make that jump, that's being able to notice patterns, to be able to say that they can actually notice something, that something, you know, actually is,

uh, it's like sort of like forming your first sense, and it is, it's very conceivable as well, that when you're hearing, obviously if you're blind,

that you could come up with a series of patterns for you, for your hearing, um, patterns for touch, um, patterns for smell,

um, so our senses can be used as gateways, uh, to, uh, quite a few, I think, basically for the, the beginning, um, pattern of education.

You know

The goal is to really try to minimize perspective and at least want to be able to get it so that

we can create a generalization where we can make statements about what we can do at the

very most fundamental, right? Sort of like saying that people can add, you know, that if you teach people about the basics of math, they'll be able to add and teach them a certain pattern, they'll be able to notice these patterns in a very particular way.

In particular, in order to give somebody a word or maybe a smell or a taste, there's going to be some memory and some similarity amongst people. So, yeah, obviously what you're saying is true as well.

I mean, the perspective is going to constantly be changing, but, you know, at least the goal, I think, is at least in the AI area is to try to be able to first generalize and see that what it is that we can, what we can do that is a lifeline.

So what I'm hearing you say is that maybe it is just our perception with the faculties that we have and that two things can exist at one.

The ones that are created with just say you're in this room and you learn something, right? There's neural pathways that are created. Is that due to the proteins?

Well, yes, new protein synthesis is an essential component of your brain forming new pathways in terms of long term memory. Did that answer your question?

Yeah, I mean, it was kind of a big question.

Can I ask a question?

Absolutely.

So I've seen this meme in the news before about, are we living in a simulation? I'm curious, how would one go about determining this realistically?

Well, that's what we're here for. This is kind of just a group discussion on, you know, what it means. So, I mean, there's a lot of research that you can do in different factors.

I mean, everybody here probably has a little bit of info we've been talking about for a couple of hours. So if you have any direct question, we'll take it.

That is my direct question.

So I think it depends on which simulation you're talking about because we've been talking about different forms of different types of simulations.

That's an important point.

That's an important point that Jeffrey raises. I mean, we're talking, you know, you know, in order to get involved in simulation, you have to talk about in simulating the physical brain, the chemical aspects of the brain,

the physics of the brain, quantum relationships, the physics of our universe, the way that the mind works, getting into AI, possibly AGI, you have to be able to simulate.

You know, I've seen a type of, you know, offspring or something, and then left, you know, here, you know. So what I'm trying to say is what if another life form gave, you know, birth to the first versions of humans and different sorts of humans.

And I kind of just left. I mean, a lot of people have theories of different things watching over us and some phenomenon happening.

So I'm just kind of letting people feed off, even though I don't really believe in. Yeah, I'm just putting something out there. Yeah.

So it'd be more like harvesting our reality than simulating it then, right?

I mean, it would be technically simulating since they're always watching over and like seeing and like trying to maybe understand how, you know, because there's this phenomenon that is actually being studied by scientists.

And it's saying that once civilizations are intelligent, or they reach a certain sort of intelligence level or something, they just die.

Something happens, you know, and they're trying to understand like why that happens.

And so maybe in theory, in a sandbox, these are what these intelligent life forms are doing, trying to understand when does intelligent life forms kind of end themselves, or intelligent civilizations end themselves.

I mean, we're not even at a type one civilization yet. So it's pretty interesting, right?

I mean, a lot of these arguments could also be like metaphors for what, you know, is going on inside people's brains, trying to, you know, like this whole, this whole, the simulation hypothesis could be born out of someone's curiosity about, you know, how this civilization will end.

And we're sort of like metaphorically mapping that to some alien race, but it's just a reference to some abstract entity inside someone's mind, I guess, in order to disown their own curiosity.

I'll never forget my year eight science teacher, pulled me aside after class, and said, Amanda, I haven't told the students this in a very long time, but I just want to put this into your brain and you'll think about it one day.

And I didn't think about it, maybe for another five or 10 years when I was a little bit older. And he said, just simply this, what if your existence is just someone else's dream?

And I've never forgotten about it since that day. And it really, you know, when we ask the question, are we living in a simulation? I always go back to that.

So to give some context for anyone in the audience or maybe up on stage, my interpretation of that statement he made to me was, say, for example, someone in another place, whether it be on Earth or anywhere else, is falling asleep and dreaming.

We have quite vivid dreams. I remember my dreams really well. But what if that's actually someone else's life and you're dreaming that life into existence or something along those lines?

So I still haven't figured it out. It definitely changed my life when he implanted that thought into my brain, but I just thought, attending to the question, are we living in a simulation?

I just wanted to throw another one of my year eight science teachers mind bending questions through my way.

That's an interesting perspective of whether the characters that we dream of actually have agencies within our own dreams.

I liked that one. Yeah.

Yeah, it got me thinking.

I mean, to your point, Jeffery.

I haven't stopped thinking.

Thanks so much. That was great. And Jeffery's point before about if you're taking the simulation theory where it's from the point of origin of the universe to the point of its whatever the end point is, and that's the scope of the simulation.

If you think about that as being incredibly long period of time, but could potentially be almost a dream state, whether it's ours or some extraneous being or extraneous computational algorithm, it does certainly let me at least think about things like determinism.

I think our ego gets in the way of wanting us to have free will. But if it if it is our ask or some something like us that's actually created this extended and very complex effectively reality movie, and that's sort of the way that I think about it.

If the simulations like a movie, then it does explain why you could you could, you know, if you're the cast of the movie, then you going about your activities as though you've got free will not realizing that the plot's already written and that there's a deterministic end.

It also explains why their passive time seems progressive and linear, whereas if you then if you then collapse that movie down to a file and store it somewhere, all of that time, all of that expanded time in that external environment lives continuously and end to end at one particular point of time.

So it back to my earlier point, I think simulations here at least allows us some analogies to look at concepts from a different perspective.

The simulation that I was talking about with kind of setting initial conditions, you know, the parameters of the universe is letting the system go. It wouldn't exactly be analogous to having a movie because we're not writing like we're not writing the state of the

universe at all future times down to memory. Thank you. All you're having is the initial conditions and then you let the system interact with itself. And that sense is not actually best portable that we're keeping track of every bit of information in the universe.

The only thing to be fast forwardable is what what elements we can if you try and do some sort of compression and what what elements are easily predictable.

The beginning point.

To contest that, what about the all in one theory where the theory is that we're in a simulation but every single life, every single experience is you but in a different sort of time period.

And this is actually a theory that was actually being studied to it was to be, you know, but like it's kind of like implementing like imagine every single version of every single person, you know, me, you, Shane, Jeremy, Julie, everybody in this chat right now is just me in a different point.
