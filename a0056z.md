# Transcendence, Choice, and Behavior Consquences from Computational Biological.

The transcendent man, the way I think of him, is an idea, realized through an experiential understanding, that the general properties of a self-aware being are so standardized, that a person upon realizing their trancendent nature can begin to feel a commonality with people from generations past, and people yet to be born in the far future, based upon the idea that we, the people, the sentient beings, are similar enough, isomorphic in self-reflection, in function, and in motivation, as to be one being, one unified entity, with multiple concurrent lives existing across time & space.

It's a realization that the slave owner, the cannibal, the murderer, and the fascist authoritarian seem to be unable to grasp or even understand, the desperate corrupted evil person is separate from, and separated by a separate self concept, the ego from mystical & psychological context. Or so we might think.

Yet the human brain is a mass of tissue, compelled by the laws of physics to follow a trajectory that we can only loosely predict, and should a person suffer from strokes or brain injuries severe enough, in certain locations of the brain, their behavior & personality might change wildly. A person who has had a transcendent awakening, and a unified understanding of themselves as being one with the transcendent man may with great trajedy succumb to behaviors of horror, committing atrocities & war crimes thought to be only possible for those who are unawakened, and unenlightened.

Perhaps then that is why human beings came up with the frame work of choice, to try to explain why even if you know that something is bad for everyone, including yourself, you might do it anyway, because mankind, because of his free choice, is bound to eventually fall short of the absolute ideal. So we have this concept of choice, to help explain not only bad choices, but also to help explain the difficulties we might experience in life when trying to work with other people who have different ideas from us, especially with people who have motivations to achieve results that run contrary to our desires.

Lets say you are one with the transcendent man, but there is only one house on the beach, and you want to live there, well do you let someone else have it, do you fight for it?  Do you try to buy it? Your cells will compute the consequences of different actions, memory prediction renderings, you may dream of different possible outcomes, and if you are rich you may seek to purchase that home, if you are talented with grit you may work to become wealthy to buy the home, if you are a terrorist with big bombs your brain might plot a violent path to take the home, and if you are a poor fisherman your brain might plot a trajectory away from the house on the beach, towards a peaceful life, that doesn't involve some competition, via money, or via war, to get that house on the beach.

The point is that, our inner cognitive development, as it relates to one ideology or another, can only have some delta of influence over the raw computations your brain must perform to calculate your behavior trajectory in life, to achieve the goals you think are possible for you.

# A Fractal Rendering inside a Computational Biology.

Imagine that you realize that your mind is a computer program, and that everything that you can see exists twice, once as the real world, and once as a 3D rendered perspective for your brain.

In otherwords that which exists in your mind is essentially a fractal or a recursion of that which exists in reality.

It might be intuitive to argue that only the parts of an experience that make up the conscious perspective are rendered by the brain to the brain, in your mind, but that argument is incomplete, because sometimes you remember things later on that you were not aware of at the time, as if things are rendered outside your conscious experience that can become memories that enter your conscious experience for the first time at a later point in time.

I argue that each component of the rendering of your conscious & subconscious experience is inpart constructed from tiny wavelets, or burstlets, essentially solitons or soliton wavelets, and sequences of these, in aggregration, as coordinated phase wave differentials, mark up the canvas of your mind which exists as a separate thing, as tonic oscillation in a cell assembly such as a cortical column.

The oscillating cell assembly, that fires in synchronization, such as a cortical column, is that thing that reads the stream of wavelets, transmitted via synaptic connections, between cells that connect cortical columns internally, and connect cortical columns and other brain structures across the brain/

Neurons in a downstream listening mode oscillation, what makes a wavelet? each wavelet is the result of action potential firing, it represents a pattern that consists of many bits, temporal and spatial firing codes, that evoke a certain tempo-spatial pattern with other neurons in order to represent a fired pattern in the brain, that the listening neurons listen to

different cortical columns oscillate or take turns either in a listening stage or in a firing stage, you will have many neurons receieving the same firing instructions at the same times to reproduce high level patterns that are recognized and stored as low level patterns, each low level pattern is a fractal of a higher fired pattern, but since many neurons have to have coordinated firing to evoke that pattern they all share the same firing instructions, ie the same pattern that all of a set of neurons has learned is stored in each neuron, so each one individual detects that pattern and fires accordingly, and new patterns are learned when new AP firing patterns are added at a high level from an unexpected real world event and that modifies the memory of the original micropattern that each neuron in that sequence is going to remember as a variation on its pattern memory.

but also keep in mind that each pixel of your reality, in your field of view, everything you see right now, is not just a wavelet, or a ribbon of magnetic & electromagnetic frequency, but its also only that for one millisecond as each neuron fires for one millisecond in your multi-sensory canvas of awareness.

If I cross my eyes I find that I can imagine almost any shape, such as a black letter W, and X, and even a cross and my brain will make it appear for myself. Its a strange exercise but I think of it as like bending my brains own pixels, or bending the spoon in the matrix.

To try this Cross your eyes, think about how your vision is a computational rendering that your brain is doing, then imagine any shape you want to see, imagine that you can consciously change the pixel renderings of your internal represenation. Because you are computational in nature.

Thinking about that suggestion to think of a game engine as a simulation engine
I want to say the mind is simulation engine or a holodeck or like a game engine, the brain needs to render a virtualized camera that is your viewpoint based on your stereo eye positions and it needs to render this from incoming data.

so the idea with the mice as pointed out in the example of the rat by Biszaki in Rhythms of the brain
is that creatures have a built in evolved prediliction to certain kinds of modes of thinking, like humans have non-sensical words that they evolved to form, but the process of learning from the start of life until the end just reshapes those evolved blocks, perhaps further mutating or preserving them in the next generation of lifeforms.  

Why don't we have public discussions with the people who dislike the leaders of each country and the people who do. With the goal being civil discourse, raising the facts, letting members of the public learn and vote on every little disagreement, letting social media work out the differences between people, trusting the intelligence of mankind to resolve differences.

The consciousness without the content.
