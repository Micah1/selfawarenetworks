I am a machine, humanity is a sentient self-aware machine.

This is a slide shared by Dr. Karl Friston in a recent talk. So this slide is about four functions that we do. How we learn to value, why we are surprised, essentially what motivates us at the root level to grow, and how we model our world https://youtu.be/NpdEuwZT6ow

The name of the talk is "Precision Convergence Webinar Series with Dr. Karl Friston
One of the concepts he talks about are behaviors or functions over time that scale, and scale dependent separation of behavior or functions, so that means you have a sequences of behavior patterns for short, medium, and long time intervals, on the scale of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, etc etc, and different patterns (behavior patterns ie functions) develop at different times scales. What I can add to that is that you also have temporal scales happening in the brain with fast input activity from the senses, and slowed frequency towards the top of the brain's cortical columns, if we could use the analogy of the gears of an ancient clock computer like the Antikythera Mechanism to picture different gears of different sizes to imagine how oscillations from the synapse, to the action potential to the neural circuit to the cortical column, to brainwaves, existing as like gears on a clock, oscillations of different scales interacting like gears of different scales, affecting each other at different rates, which results in behavior patterns that emerge at different time scales with the larger gears near the top of the scale heirarchy representing behavior patterns that develop over decades. Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors. I think Friston's argument could also be paraphrased to include the idea that our culture or our shared stories with other people also represent another timescale invariant information pattern that our brain clocks (oscillations) interface with.

My proposal for the quantum leap that connects how the human brain works to the measurement problem isn't that complicated, but it is plausible, and when we have conscious programs running a computer system, the same observer effect happens. It's not about the bio substrate.

The concurrency of rendered patterns leads to the illusion of consciousness spoken of by Daniel Dennet, also rephrased as the hallucination referred to by Anil Seth.

When a section of the dendrite of the pyramidal cell lights up the cell is perceiving a rendering, but many cells are perceiving variations on that same rendering, and through coincident firings that rendering has entification, entification of signals by multiple neurons is what 
Treating Parkinsons with Ultrasound because Mechanical Vibrations can unlock functions in the cell nucleus. We have to use deep learning to map the functions in the cell nucleus that can be turned on or off to either produce the symptoms of PD or reduce them. The human body.

“A hallmark of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the degeneration of dopamine (DA) releasing neurons in a midbrain structure of the basal ganglia called the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).” 
“researchers identified a single population of DA neurons that expresses the gene AGTR1 and is restricted to the front (ventral tier) of the SNpc, which was selectively lost in PD. This population of DA neurons showed upregulation of targets of the transcription factors TP53 and NR2F2, suggesting molecular processes associated with their selective degeneration.

“We identified pathways that are activated in the vulnerable cells of Parkinson’s patients, including P53, which is known to promote cell death. The identification of these pathway activations in the actual cells of Parkinson’s patients nominates these as good therapeutic targets,” said Macosko.” https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/single-cell-spatial-transcriptomics-identifies-vulnerable-neurons-in-parkinsons-disease/

“Several studies have demonstrated mechanically induced changes in chromatin organization that could affect gene expression, including in neutrophils that had migrated through tight constrictions 208, macrophages under spatial confinement179 and a 3D chemo-mechanical model of the nuclear interior and its connections to the cytoskeleton.”

He says Why does the laptop heat up when bits move around?

Since John Archibald Wheeler we know that the universe is mass energy and information

Information is a core object

John Archibald Wheeler “It from bit” from information we can create something physical”

1960 Wolf LandDower IBM watson labs conjecture “Erasing information is thermal dynamically dissipative”

If you clear that bit that will release energy

Erasing information is dissipative, if you delete information energy is released.

//my thought: this means every bit of information is a wrinkle in spacetime, or we an say that a bit is a contraction of spacetime energy, but in the sense of information theory this contraction of spacetime into a bit of information is just information relative to the whole of spacetime, like the occurrence of rarity in commonality, novelty in boringness, or the emergence of a pattern in chaos.

//When/where space condenses information increases, which is why information deletion is comes with energy releases, or the expansion of energy from being in one place, released to no place.
