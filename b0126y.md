Perfect frequency oscillators for a critical for criticality state, achieving a criticality state. That's not like,

Stink. Like it's it's these are the regular oscillators. And this contrasts and they become a dominant, they become donut and regular because care more powerful and more widespread. So they just statistically defeat the faster, basic smaller spread I guess we should say relaxed.

There are firing relaxing around a firing, but when I what I'm saying is like so phases of basic firing is relaxed only in that. It's not a cyclic. Oscillator is not if not it's not yeah it's not there or it's a relaxed oscillator that could be irregular.

Or an isolator that's like part of the very complex system of components. So this is like if you want unique complex patterns,

And two things work really well for you and and in the face-based and one of is going to be relaxed, non-harmonic oscillators to have the cavity code occurrence of those and also Next.
