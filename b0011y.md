(This note was a thought experiment to try to ascertain why exactly the Thalamus has more neurons that modulate verses neurons that simply drive forward signals without changing them. It's speculative, and it's a hypothesis.)

Graph Signal Processing

00:00

Because the nature of signal processing in the 3D neural network that is the brain is such that it contains both spatial and temporal characteristics naturally. The nature of sensory perception, of every kind of sensory perception is.

00:19

a 3D plus 1D a 3D plus 1D graph or three blue on green graph that symbolizes all sensory representations.

This concept is about the 3D graphing of signal processing that's happening in which each each part of a network

00:56

such as a cortical column, for example, is receiving signals from above and below, to its left and right, from the front to the back and in reverse.

There is a six axis direction for signalling in the neo cortex of the brain. Everything goes everywhere eventually, unless it dissipates before it gets there.

This 3d signal processing happening in terms of like you need kind of like three dimensions of time of space and one dimension of time to sort of calculate where all the traffic's coming from and going to. There is to a great extent a direction, for neurons to collect

01:43

information from some direction and then output some sort of signal to other directions (via the exit terminal)

I look at (the Book) cognitive neuroscience and their description of neurons is sort of receiving and and considering and then transmitting a signal is a sort of like mistaken distinction.

02:16

I mean the book is not making a distinction between neurons that drivers and neurons that are modulators, signal modulaters.

and I think the key is that the key that when you look at neurons in the hand that you know the signals need to travel long distances to get to the brain & back to the hand, so you would expect that for the signal travel across long distances that you are going to have driver neurons, that are not modulating the signal, their goal is to repeat the signal accurately between hand & spine & brain (limbic & striatal areas)

When you need the signal to travel long distances, you will want to have more driver signals, basically nerves are simply passing the signal by replicating it. 

03:07
If you read just introduction, it's like neurons are passing there. Just passing the signal, from your fingers, from your eyes to your brain.

But the thing is, like, at some point the, the partial and distributed recognition, or cognition. If you have a distributed recognition and cognition.

03:36

That's so, for example, if you have a network that is like collectively recognizing something it's going to dissipate through the entire oscillatory network of the brain. But in order for that network to collectively recognize, each part of the network.

04:03

When it passes through, has to, not only receive, and transmit a signal, but has to receive and modulate the signal, otherwise it's like, it would be as if it didn't contribute. As if it wasn't contributing (to the harmonic oscillation of the collective sensor) to the collective perception of the signal. (if it doesn't modulate the signal then it's like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, a point that doesn't exist as far as the sensor array goes) It's got a pass along it's own perception of the signal to the collective of signal perceivers/transmitters, it's perception of the signal is it's own modulation of that signal.

04:26

That's the key. Otherwise, what's the point of it being there? It's not adding anything to the calculation. If it doesn't modulate the signal and pass on it it's perception to other neurons. So it has, so the very act of having a group of neurons that are going to calculate the meaning of a signal.

04:50

Collectively means that as one neuron receives it and remembers. It says, oh this is a pattern I remember, or oh this is a pattern I don't. It must therefore pass on a modulated version of the signal that contains the reflection of its knowledge that the other neurons can then pick up on and crunch.

05:15

Because if it doesn't do that, it may its in minus will be deleted from the array, because simply passing an signal is helping to compute that signal.
