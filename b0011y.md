(This note was originally a thought experiment to try to ascertain why exactly the Thalamus has more neurons that modulate verses neurons that simply drive forward signals without changing them.)

Graph Signal Processing

b0011y

Because the nature of signal processing in a 3D neural network such as the brain contains both spatial and temporal characteristics, the sensory perception of every kind of sensory perception is like a 3D plus 1D representation. It's like a 3D plus 1D graph or a three blue, one green graph that symbolizes all sensory representations.

This note was a thought experiment to try to ascertain why exactly the thalamus has more neurons that modulate versus neurons that simply drive forward signals without changing them. It's speculative, and it's a hypothesis.

I mean this includes the graph, the 3D graph nature of signal processing that is happening in every part of a network, such as, a cortical column for example, it is receiving signals from above and below to its left and right and from the front in the back. There is a six-axis direction for signaling in the neocortex of the brain. Everything goes everywhere eventually, unless it dissipates before it gets there. Like there is, there's this sort of six-axis or 3D signal processing happening in terms of like you need kind of like three dimensions of time, of space in one dimension of time to sort of calculate where all the traffic coming from and going to. There is, to a great extent, you know, there is direction, right, to neurons collecting information from some directions and then outputting some sort of signal to other directions.

But, you know, I look at cognitive neuroscience and their description of neurons as receiving and sort of receiving and considering and then transmitting a signal as a sort of like mistake and distinction that's not, it's not making a distinction between neurons that are, I guess, drivers, and those that are sort of modulators, signal modulating.

I look at (the Book) Cognitive Neuroscience and their description of neurons is sort of receiving and considering and then transmitting a signal as a sort of like mistaken distinction.

And I think the key is that, the key is that, you know, when you're looking at neurons in the hand, that when you need signals to travel from long distances, then you're going to have like, you know, basically the sensor, or sensory collection of signals and you're going to have, you're going to have those kinds of signals will be, will tend to be more drivers or basically passing the signal, which is kind of like what you think is happening. When you need the signal to travel long distances, you will want to have more driver signals. Basically, nerves are simply passing the signal by replicating it. Their goal is to repeat the signal accurately between hand, spine, and brain (limbic and striatal areas).

Direct spinal projections to limbic and striatal areas: Anterograde transport studies from the upper cervical spinal cord and the cervical enlargement in squirrel monkey and rat: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960219)365:4%3C640::AID-CNE10%3E3.0.CO%3B2-L

If you read just the introduction, it's like neurons are passing, they're just passing the signal from your fingers, from your eyes, to your brain.

But the thing is, like, at some point, the partial recognition, the partial and distributed recognition, or cognition, if you have a distributed recognition and cognition. So, for example, if you have a network that is like, collectively recognizing something through as it, as it's going to dissipate through the entire oscillatory network of the brain. But in order for that network to collectively recognize, each part of the network, when it passes through, has to not only receive and transmit a signal but has to receive and modulate the signal. Otherwise, it would be as if it didn't contribute to the harmonic oscillation of the collective sensor (to the collective perception of the signal). If it doesn't modulate the signal, then it's like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, a point that doesn't exist as far as the sensor array goes. Right. It's got to pass along its perception of the signal. That's key to building and correcting an internal representation, that's key to being able to notice your own response.

Otherwise, what's the point of it being there? It's not adding anything to the calculation.

If it doesn't modulate the signal and pass on its, its, its perception to other neurons. So, the very act of having a group of neurons that are going to calculate the meaning of a signal collectively means that as one neuron receives it and remembers, it says, oh, this is a pattern, I don't remember. Oh, this pattern, I don't. It must, therefore, pass on a modulated version of the signal that contains the reflection of its knowledge that the other neurons can then pick up and crunch. Because if it doesn't do that, it may as well be deleted from the array. Simply passing a signal is not helping to compute that signal.

# "Direct spinal projections to limbic and striatal areas: Anterograde transport studies from the upper cervical spinal cord and the cervical enlargement in squirrel monkey and rat"
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960219)365:4%3C640::AID-CNE10%3E3.0.CO%3B2-L

Why is this paper relevant to the discussion? ""Direct spinal projections to limbic and striatal areas: Anterograde transport studies from the upper cervical spinal cord and the cervical enlargement in squirrel monkey and rat""

This paper, "Direct spinal projections to limbic and striatal areas: Anterograde transport studies from the upper cervical spinal cord and the cervical enlargement in squirrel monkey and rat," is relevant to the discussion of neural signal processing, modulation, and collective cognition for several reasons:

Connection Between Sensory and Cognitive Networks

The paper explores direct spinal projections to key areas of the brain involved in emotion (limbic system) and reward/motivation (striatal areas). This highlights the neural pathways where sensory inputs (from the spinal cord) directly influence cognitive and emotional processing areas. This aligns with the discussion of how sensory signals are not just passively transmitted but actively modulated and integrated into broader cognitive networks.

Neural Modulation Beyond Simple Transmission

The findings suggest that spinal cord projections are more than just conduits for sensory signals; they may participate in modulating the signals to influence higher-order brain functions. This supports the idea in the discussion that neurons, including those at the spinal level, do more than passively transmit signals—they modulate them before passing them to brain areas for further processing.

Distributed Signal Processing

The paper’s examination of direct spinal-to-brain connections shows that distributed networks—including those from the periphery of the body (like the spinal cord)—play a role in cognition. This concept echoes the discussion's point about distributed recognition and cognition, where multiple parts of the neural network modulate signals collectively to contribute to perception.

Integrating Motor and Emotional Functions

The paper’s focus on how spinal projections reach emotional and motivational areas is relevant to the discussion of how signals must be modulated and integrated, not only for perception but for motor and emotional responses as well. This speaks to how the entire neural system—whether processing signals from sensory or motor inputs—must involve modulation to effectively coordinate complex behaviors like emotion, reward processing, or decision-making.

In short, this paper provides empirical support for the idea that neural signal transmission involves modulation, and it shows how distributed networks like the spinal cord can influence higher-order cognitive functions, reinforcing the need for collective processing across the neural system.
