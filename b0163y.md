Resolution mind Dog Consciousness

00:00

So I'm disagreeing with the integrated information theory because I am. I'm suggesting that we are the consciousness is basically a multi-sensory rendering, like I can computer rendering of. That is something that we hear sending and and something that we're receiving, and it's it's in and the way. All see, the whole objective is for the organism to make a functional map.

00:53

A functional map. So differences in colors differences. In sound. Here's it's about the organism being able to to navigate and put together where they complex representations and really complex sequences of behavior in order to navigate a really complex world. And the work keeps on getting more complex. So it keeps pulling our minds towards greater evolution and greater development over, you know, over the course of evolution and evolutionary scale.

01:40

So I'm gonna say I'm not suggesting, we're going to turn into the X-Men or something that it's very. That would be very fast. Evolution. Right. Joking or joking. Joking, joking aside. So what's wrong with? I mean, so I think that it's, it's very simple that, you know, the that the I would say that the amount of integrated, the information is going to determine the sort of resolution of consciousness.

02:18

So so that some people so that you know, human being might experience but they're looking at at I don't know, 32k resolution or whatever it is you might be experiencing what's based in front of you at a certain resolution because of this scale your brain and that's your whole brains ability to put together a picture that is functionally detailed enough to match the demands of your ecosystem and environment.

So I would, I would expect that, you know, I'm curious that if we get somehow, you know, add to a dog's brain to give a dog spraying the ability to really pronounced words and I was able to train on words and something. I mean, you'd have to add something to the dog screen because it's, it doesn't have the same as I don't have the same size, or the same amount of

03:43

But the dog doesn't have a vocal area to experience, right?

03:50

I don't know what I mean. I don't know if it's press. I precise way to describe, you know, dog has some sort of vocalization, some sort of communication, dogs, do bark, and they do take turns listening to other dogs barking before they barkers. There's communication happening in this video.

04:14

I saw she she his ladies young lady. She had a dog and she was making his videos about how funny her dog was. But she was like add like text. So the dog would bark and she would add plausible text to what the dog could be saying with its parking.

04:35

And the funny thing is like you could watch the videos several times. You could actually start to kind of believe that that the words that she was mouthing where we're actually like a high resolution version of what the dog was trying to say. I mean it's just it was my open today.
