Each synaptic connection is like a learned flash flood drainage path. The synaptic connections are attractors for certain types of patterns, like your thought strategies.

but its like a new flood of signals come in, and they create changes that layer on top of the existing network of learned patterns to branch into new pattern variations on previously learned patterns
I subscribe to the idea that each part of the brain specializes in distorting the global brain pattern in a specialized way. Like part of your brain really gets active for polished wood, or for looking at rain on a window sill from inside a dry house

the cells maintain their firing rate as a phase difference to the delta oscillation, but many points in that wave oscillation are changed simultaneously as a sort of sparse and distributed phase change across the wave reflecting a specific set of neurons that had become inhibited following another neurons excitation. So the negative imprint of a fired cell leaves its own imprint in the theta brainwave pattern as a tiny phase change with a sparse & distributed representation, that essentially creates the engram of a hot phasic neural firing pattern which is the ecphory or the pattern that is in life memory, and the inhibited pattern that is transfered from its signal input to later areas in the brain is perhaps reduced to frequency patterns in the oscillating power bands.

This book I am writing keeps growing! I thought I didn't need anything else but I can see the mind and the universe as numbers, or as a number.
