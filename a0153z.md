(cortex) 
"corresponding network of inhibitory connections that interfaces with the bottom-up network and imposes order on it in any centralized way" this was very interesting, I hadn't thought of my inhibitions as imposing order in a centralized way, in fact I usually think of my neural patterns as packs of wrestling dogs competing for dominance by inhibiting their neighbors until only one pattern reigns surpreme, sort of like a three dimensional game of GO. Much mor chaotic than a centralized imposition of order. 

our life experiences shape the strengths of different pathways in the neo cortex resulting in a modeling of sensory input and the significant links between what we sense and favorable outcomes, resulting in a consciousness that can be reduced in its function to a memory based prediction resulting in the coordination of our whole structure.
