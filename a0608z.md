Try meditating while sending your EEG signals into Mind Workstation to be combined with isochronic brainwave entrainment and then output to an audio visual AVS machine as light to the goggles you are wearing and as sound to the headphones you are wearing changing your brainwaves which in turn changes the EEG signals which changes the light and sound patterns you are seeing an hearing which further change your brainwaves, while you are on lsd and the fractal nature of all reality becomes completely obvious and you witness the beginning of spacetime itself in the most spiritual experience you have ever had.

That's what Neo Mind Cycle was! I'm not doing that anymore my studies have moved on to a different aspect of the brain.

I'm focusing more on the biology of neurocircuits right now, with an engineering focus.

The goal is to see that information is configuration, and a human is a configuration, and so the only spirituality is actually configuration, but the universe itself outside brains isn't intelligent, and there is no intelligence outside brains because that is the only place where something physical, your cells, are controlled by pure information, each one is like a lock that only moves if it gets a very specific type of signal, this signal contains meaning, it's a soliton wave, and this soliton wave has the same meaning no matter where it goes in the brain, so multiple parts of the brain are interpretating the same wave over and over again.

The network itself is so interconnected that when one part of you see's something all parts of the network know about it, they know about it in a firing sequence as your neurons oscillate in great big loops of organized pattern cycles that change as your environment changes so the outside world becomes known to the network of cells in your brain.

So with virtual reality and eeg we have the opportunity to make your brain known to you, and with increased credibility, money, and power we will be able to fund a really big project to create real human level artificial intelligence.
