(oscillat, field, array)
an oscillating cell, because of the tensegrity or physical forces between clustered oscillators (atoms, molecules, chemicals), is going to be sensitive to the environment as its delicate structure is disturbed by collisions at all scales, so any atom is capable of encoding a representation of its ecosystem in a sense, but an oscillator is not a self-aware entity that oscillates its learned patterns across different sensor/transmitter arrays at multiple scales like the human brain encoding patterns in learned connects between incoming stimulus patterns from the environment.

An oscillator like a hurricane might encode changes from its environment that alter the fabric of its casual body in phase space mimicking short term memories, but more like learning patterns that are never conscious because there is no prior memory to compare the pattern against, and even if the structure prior to the structural change is a prior pattern the pattern isn't sending signals to other oscillators except that it actually is also doing that through light, heat, particle collisions, em field lanes, sound/vibrations, as charge and spin configurations, and so on.

but what spacetime doesn't have is the specific tensegrity & configuration of the human mind to have a certain temporal and spatial scale for learned patterns that become expectations, and memories that act as attractors for learning new information
