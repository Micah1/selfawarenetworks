New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

Each map page is a time-stamped copy of a wikipage. The wiki pages ought to be time stamped but I have not yet discovered where it can be shown.

map.amplitude.md is a copy of wiki amplitude.md

Contained are all mentioned of "amplitude" in this repo at the time this note was created.

   8: space is particles with either energy or mass, and the energy state is the frequency of light speed times mass, frequency and amplitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as amplitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.
  10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

  25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

a0033z.md:
  62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude
  92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators and its entropy and its repulsion and its the expansion of space amplitude, reduction of space frequence (time)
  94: the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space amplitude (density),

  645: Nothing in my substrate would be specific to learning English text, Japanese text, or text in general. Nothing would be specific to voice recognition (We'd just have to find a way to represent the input signal as a spatiotemporal stream, such as multiple channels of amplitude over a set of frequencies, changing over time). Nothing *in the learning parts of the system* would be specific to video.

   34: probability amplitude
   48: Richard Feynman's Path Integral Formulation is a description in QFT that generalizes the action principle of quantum mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or a function integral, over an infinity of quantum mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.
  168: because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a low frequency (slow) signal with high amplitude
  170: essentially the amplitude of mass is the density of its volume

a0049z.md:
  202: spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.
  206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  14: Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.

a0088z.md:
   95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
  111: ⟪ 512 characters skipped ⟫ oscillator-type models (such as Kuramoto, for ex.). You can consider the spike as a delta pulse (for mathematical tractability), but you can also consider it an alpha function with variable latency, amplitude, frequency, rise and decay times. You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..
  129: Again, this is a misconception and it depends on the model used.. For example, in a conductance-based neuron model, a spike in the presynaptic neuron triggers a transient conductance increase in the postsynaptic neurons, whose amplitude depends on the efficacy of the synapse.. This is capturing the essence of what happens in the real brain, the neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminal will bind to the postsynaptic receptors, which can be ion channels (at least the ones working on a short time scale) and the result is an influx of certain ions whose net effect on the postsynaptic membrane is an increase in the net conductance..

a0089z.md:
   7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency
  11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  13: What is interesting is that at the neuron level, when the action potential fires, the Amplitude is pretty consistent, it's so consistent that they gave it a name, the all or nothing principle, either the neuron fires or it doesn't, this became the basis of the Perceptron which arguable was the first model of an artificial neuron, sort of the base idea for all artificial neural networks that have been created since.
  15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
  17: With the all or nothing principle the idea is that once the threshold of a neuron is reached it either fires or it doesn’t but that it doesn’t change in amplitude. but why is Amplitude changing at the group neuron scale and not at the individual neuron scale?
  21: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
  23: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
  31: Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

a0091z.md:
  81: see I was in a discussion the other day, talking about how the synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable amplitude and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  83: but the amplitude of the wave matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and amplitude also.

a0104z.md:
  19: so space is expanded because its area is the high amplitude of a low frequency
  21: stars are crunched because the high frequency (velocity, relative time of action) corresponds with less area less space and less amplitude
  23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)
  31: so the scattering amplitude of particles, and the expansion of space, is inversely proportional to virtual 

a0113z.md:
  42: Mass has low frequency high amplitude inversely related to high frequency low amplitude electrons.

  32: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  36: Micah: I mean with EEG frequencies in the brain, isn't an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency observed and referred to as 1/f? I guess I could be misunderstanding the use of 1/f.
  40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

a0123z.md:
  11: The electron particle/wave in the neural pulse, has all the same primary properties of a brainwave, including phase, amplitude, hz, look, regardless of how you measure it what's really being transferred is the "potential difference", like a negative, like a camera snapshot, A SDR SNAPSHOT that includes the minute variations in the cells dendrites. This effects the synaptic branch in particular way that is different from the previous time the neuron fired.
  19: I meant to describe the properties of an electrical wave/particle, including amplitude, hz, phase, spin etc... but the description of the particle is incidental. The key notion is that it's the transmittion of a "potential difference" representing the changes to the neurons form, including dendritic changes before and the synaptic changes after the axon fires.

  14: ⟪ 727 characters skipped ⟫ the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  37: sparse quantum pattern learning/prediction is probably better for high frequency low amplitude senses, such as olfactory, maybe taste, but taste is also texture which is about high amp high surface area. smell, emotions, and point clouds have a lot less mass and a lot more energy, so quantum signals represent a sparse sample learning spread over a large area
  65: ⟪ 408 characters skipped ⟫amics. So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales. 

a0142z.md:
  19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

  58: at the quantum scale the frequency is higher, but the amplitude is less, and perhaps this allows the brain to infer patterns from smell, and patterns from sparse quantum clouds that could represent emotion

  8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

   11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?
   15: (relevant to the question of whether we can replace the word amplitude with magnitude in EEG Studies, because the wave shape is really magnitude, a combination of amplitude & duration)

With all three memory times potentially affecting synaptic configuration there are 3 intertwined sensor modalities storing correlated time series of wave patterns with dimensional characteristics (amplitude, frequency, and mechanical to electric-acoustic soliton wave forms inside the envelop defined by the frequency / amplitude inverse relationship. So its like the pre-synapse is a loud speaker that spits, and the post synapse is like a microphone that counts spit as a charge build up (ions & atp) and then various stages of energy release happen cumulating in an action potential that in a sense is transmitting a phase pattern to its post synaptic network, the network sort of magnifies the pattern, deconverges it, and multiple patterns overlay each other, from different neurons to different areas of the brains network

  3: It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.

  52: Presynaptic K+ (potassium) modifies the action potential amplitude (APsyn) which determines the strength of the synaptic signal, including the amplitude of the postsynaptic response, including how many vesicles can be released per action potential (0 -3)
  74: In conclusion the sodium/potassium gradient in the pre-synapse changes the amplitude of the action potential which changes the strength of the post-synaptic activity including how many vesicles are activated. This process that I am outlining allows far more information to travel over each node (or neuron) in a neural network, from the dentrite/soma over the AP to the post synapse. Widespread MVR in neocortical synapses overcomes the information bottle neck imagined by the theory of synaptic unreliability.
  78: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

  17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

Active techniques include transmitting electromagnetic (X-Ray, radio, optical) or acoustic (sonar, ultrasonic) waves onto the object of interest, and detection and analysis of the return energy (amplitude, frequency, etc). The time or phase difference between the transmit and receive signals provides the depth dimension. Passive techniques such as stereo cameras (imaging the same object from two different spatial perspectives) can also be used to generate the required 3D data. Finally, 3D information can also be extracted from monovision cameras through a combination of machine learning and signal processing techniques, although this is generally inferior in fidelity and compute speed relative to direct 3D imaging and measurement.

  71: ⟪ 405 characters skipped ⟫ adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

   8: Second, if you had bothered to finish playing the video, you would have realized that they later describe how the amplitude of the action potential peaks (is capped) and then begins it's falling phase. Just to be clear, in case you can't understand the simple waveform diagrams - the amplitude is indicated by the very top peak of the waveform. 
  10: Fast forward to the end of the lecture and they clearly show the various shapes of the modeled APs. Note how each AP exhibits precisely the same amplitude (shown in the image below). Yes, I also took the very same course. I've also taken several online and in-class University level Medical Neuroscience courses (courses required as part of Medical school training). Having taken this course as well as many other courses, I can honestly say that the Coursera Computational Neuroscience course you used as evidence does not even rise to the level of an freshman level undergrad course. 

a0286z.md:
  13: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
  15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

    4: working with EEG, and talking to Neuroscientist Morgan Hough for a year when I was hosting NeurotechSF event I had learned notion ingrained in me that there was a 1/f relationahip between amplitude and frequency in brainwaves
   10: when reading buszaki I thought more deeply about the 1/f relationship between amplitude and frequency (for groups of neurons), and the fact that neurons expand when they fire
   12: how high frequency has low amplitude and low frequency has high amplitude
   14: in Buszaki it became clear that this meant high amplitude affects more neurons and low amplitude reaches less 
   18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
   28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,
   36: so I had this idea from neuroscience that neurons were expanding on mass when they fired like an a action potential, which I also think of as like lightning, positive and negative charges between the sky and earth split so much fhere is a flash followed by a bang, light and sound, frequency and amplitude

  6: In a slide about Data Processing he talks about extracting the amplitude from cortical current dipoles (assuming as measured with MEG, MEG dipoles are different from EEG dipoles) so he is talking about high level variations in points measuring dipole activity with MEG and that is what makes up his chart that reminds me of a sparse distributed representation, at a high level of abstraction variations in Magnetic dipole activity represent some sort of brain state change or memory state change at highest level of abstraction representing massive neural assemblies that include major brain areas, cortical colums, major junctions, but the important part to keep in mind is that this is just one level of brain state representation in a multi-scale heirarchical brain state. So what happens at the single neuron level or at the cortical column level matters for storing memory patterns that are not in focus at the moment. By looking at the macroscale brain activity with EEG, MRI, MEG or with some other tool you can begin to guess at what is happening at the m

  30: Instead the synapse is the core unit of computation in the brain, the ndma receptors and the dendrites help recognize and sort coincidence patterns, transmitting a wave across the axon to another synapse which breaks down the wave into ion deposits (sodium etc....) this allows synaptic calculations to control the amplitude and frequency of axon potentials, but reset if, when, how frequently another neurons fires, and whether it will be inhibitory or excitatory.

Though more rapid than beta waves, gamma brainwaves have virtually unnoticeable amplitude and can be found in every part of the brain. Gamma waves serve as a binding mechanism between all parts of the brain and help to improve brain function and perception.

  49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.

  123: But also, they are beating up space time because heating up space is the same as speeding up space time. And so the, but then some of space time is also slowed down because inhibited, so it's frequency is slower, but it's at the same time, it's amplitude is higher so it's a habitated inhibited but it takes up a lot of space.
  126: A much larger manus space than when the faster space time and so it's like space has different configurations either. It's very spread out and high amplitude, which is like the space in between galaxies or it's very compressed and crunched together, which is the, which is with the, which is a space inside the galaxies.
  303: Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.

That's the difference between I would say this, that's why a neutron and a positron. And and I try and do not merge. It's because they have different a different frequency patterns and and they have different amplitudes.
  39: So, I would say that because light has a larger volume than an electron that it, it's, I mean, I'm just saying, like, I'm speculating that that light could be could have a higher amplitude and in higher amplitude would be associated with greater area.

b0059y.md:
  40: It's lower frequency, higher amplitude. And I think of it, as more of the observer of macroscale patterns time, and then I think a
  52: But just a hypothesis it's gonna be like this rate is like the frequency gets reduced over time, but the amplitude grows up and that means that the the sixth layer is like the observer. And are they like the? It's like the that's where the it's like it's like when you look around the world imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull a little bit.

  61: It's really a lot slower than sensory and potato but it's but it's, it's bigger picture. It's it's a higher amplitude. So it's it's more network. It's when the network comes together, the highest levels and the Delta frequency.

b0067y.md:
  325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

  91: What's happening is a lot of charges is, is building up now. So these. So, if these neurotransmitters, if they arrive faster, okay? Then they're going to start to, but put in a lot of energy really fast, right? Because they're transmitted, they're sending energy faster, but if they arrive slower, what's going to happen is, they're this because there's a one F relationship between amplitude and frequency in the brain.
  94: What's going to happen is that these neurotransmitters are going to, they're going to basically a, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a high amplitude, low frequency burst, which is going to, which is going to, which is going to

b0081y.md:

  95: Open up a lot faster depending on what receptors are over there. And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.

b0103y ctpr.txt:
   93: And, and the rush of potassium opening would would either inhibit the cell or it would cause cell to shorten the action potential, right? And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
  291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,
  321: But when you feed the brain, a lot of low frequency trains like of electrical simulation like one hurts that that might inhibit basically inhibit short-term memories. In the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude, low frequency,
  323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better. Have studied LTP and LL DP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude, low frequency LTD signals, basically, stimulating the brain with like, a one herbs frequency, that is going to de-synchronize groups of neurons. That is going to not be synchronized.

b0110y ctpr.txt:
  25: Can look for patterns that are basically defined in terms of space and because of like which which nodes lit up and patterns that are defined in time and in that allows basically my frequency and and the patterns are also defined by amplitude because the the low frequency patterns have higher amplitude.
  27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part. One of the attractors of the mechanism of a group of groove, oscillations.

b0116y.md:
   17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  3: I wrote elsewhere that multi-vesicle release allows a neuron to have four levels of output with each interval of firing determined not by amplitude but by duration of Calcium channels being open.

b0127y ctpr.txt:
  37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

b0129y ctpr.txt:
  23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.

b0132y ctpr.txt:
  14: Like everything that's like below high gamma. So like low gamma and high and all the betas and alpha data and delta like those power bands are perhaps you're like low amplitude neurosurgeon set attract coop cooperation because they're low amplitude. Widespread firing results in neurons, that sort of like send a love frequency.

b0167y ctpr.txt:
  17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.

b0194y ctpr.txt:
  15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.

b0229y ctpr.txt:
  61: Now, the way, that's the reason I said, waves it, so the action potential has a waveform, right? The shape that determined by an amplitude and duration. So has an amplitude and a derision. Now, it was a second. It has a frequency an altitude duration, the amplitude, but they're all that it's tied together the duration.
  63: Carries amplitude. Okay.

b0232y ctpr.txt:
  31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?

b0233y ctpr.txt:
  21: The way that the greenness represents a phase pattern, a phase pattern is accomplished by the frequencies of light and so yeah. So, you're your phase in it. Your year on frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern, The frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern. And so if you have but actually is all right.

b0241y ctpr.txt:
  27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.

b0251y (audio) ctpr.txt:
  14: So, I feelings in my hair. My, I think I'm like, what I can. It's like my arm. I feeling my arm in the sense. Like, I don't know if my, my hand and elbow and shoulder in my head, it's like cold cold in the wind. And I noticed that when the amplitude of the wind seems to pick up when the wind feels stronger.

b0267y ctpr.txt:
  105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
  125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  228: Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.
  231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

b0269y ctpr.txt:
   4: So, okay, so. What's really interesting was that I learned how the the sodium is causing a positive spike. The potassium is causing a negative spike and when the potass when the potassium engages that determines whether the spike is going to be it's going to have a high amplitude or a low or a low amplitude or in in what's interesting is that with EEG in the brain every there's a there's there's a power law from the micro firing of neurons to the macro firing of your aus circuits.
   6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?
  10: ⟪ 320 characters skipped ⟫ he's a neuroscientist right and he's he studies the brain we had he hadn't heard this one concept and so he's so he he was saying okay, so if um, More vesicles are being released depending on on the amplitude of the of the of the action potential then then then the story is that what if it's if it's if it's the result of k it must be.

b0271y ctpr.txt:
  21: ⟪ 260 characters skipped ⟫it's gonna determine the beginning and endpoint of the spikes, so that's the arc of this bike and and then so you have to like I think yeah, I guess you have to say that the, Timing of despite is the amplitude despite so there's a time of despite but then there's also the amplitude which is I guess the amateur could be how much energy is being released at once or maybe it's fixed maybe it's a fixed amount of energy per climate so the time interval itself determines the amplitude of this spike and so the amplitude would have all in that case the amplitude of despite.
  23: Of this shape because it translates because we're translating one to one if it's always the same amount of voltage or time interval. Then the the time interval would contain the the amplitude information and then contain the shape information but if not then if the voltage can vary the voltage rate can vary so you can have more amplitude or less amplitude in the same time window let's say it's like open for one millisecond exactly if you could have one millisecond but you could have higher voltage during that one millisecond, so that's but the point is that if it's open for longer then you can have more cows.
  93: No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.

Potassium modifies the action potential applicant amplitude or APC which determines the strength of this synaptic signal.
  13: Including the amplitude of the postsynaptic response that leads to how many vesicles can be released for action potential, which is usually between zero and three. You guys could go to five. But the average number is 2.6 when a cell is at rest it's at minus 55 millivolts or minus 40 millivolts and spike happens where it shoots way up.

  508: sound amplitudes. It's it's a four-dimensional pattern.

b0277y ctpr.txt:
  75: And another thing was amplitude while you so they came up with the idea of okay, well we're gonna store the neurons either gonna fire or it's not gonna fire but what we're gonna do is if it fires, we're gonna give it a vector by giving it a number between zero and one.
  78: And there's so it's like so could be like a point 45 or something like that. It's like almost to one and the vector will transmit a sort of amplitude. So there so we're sending more information through into the known network that way. That's what they're doing. But then okay, so it's not just a want on or off.

What is the are we doing like core screened measurements or you know, basically getting like very precise changes in energy and infrequency and an amplitude and and and so on I I want to say that there we can add more to what what's being detected in terms of like amplitude and we can go even in it in more detail back to Kettering in a second, but the reason what Katerina said was very was a great.
  374: What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.
  515: I I believe he was he was he was saying that you you you basically put saliva on your finger and then put your finger on the device and and you'd have to have time oh, I see. Yeah.

  47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  182:     7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).

  86: So if the brain is all, I mean if the brain is operating sort of like in terms of electromagnetism In, that would make sense because we see that we capture all these brainwaves We don't. What is a brainwave? We're a brainwave is a way of ion It's flowing throughout the entire brain and it has a, and has all these interesting properties has an angle has a amplitude that has a velocity as, and what does it mean to to the end?
