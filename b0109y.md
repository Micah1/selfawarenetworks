I'm so when I was thinking about what a mechanical soluton wave was I or you know, I would and I was thinking about like, what what's in it? What's an acoustic way or what's a, what's a, you know, one of the topics subtopics was what's a longitudinal acoustic wave?

00:22

And then I started thinking, what are their is there such thing as a longitudinal, electromagnet electric wave or magnetic wave? Or all right I mean is that a thing is are is this in and you know, there was in max Maxwell's, you know, he max what Maxwell's he equations?

00:47

He, you know, said that, you know, you basically in, you know, in avoid and letting and avoid without, you know, air or water or anything and avoid with enemy to any materials. The you know, you're not going to, you know, he's he like, you know, you saying you're not gonna have a Sultan, you're not gonna have a lot of tunital wave, right?

01:19

That sort of carries a shape that can convey a pattern sequence, right? Like a shape that changes over time. All right, like wait like a longitudinal pattern run. Perpendicular front to the axis of the direction of signal. And so the length of the longitudinal pattern changes at each interval and so like a pattern that has both like basically they that allows patterns to have like you know to you know temporal and spatial distinctions.

02:07

It's it's it's a pattern that has more bets than than just the signal, right? It's an information containing pattern but in you know, in the human brain electric. It's seems like the the action potential like the body of the action potential is the perfect sort of machine to create a longitudinal electromagnetic wave that that creates a wave in both the electric and the magnetic domains in the magnetic fields, the electric and magnetic fields.

02:45

So it creates so long, a lot of it appears to create a longitude away than both fields. So that is. So if you imagine that your brain is electromagnetic field space, face face and you know, the, you know, the basically the when when charges build up in one area or another and a phase space.

03:09

Like, I mean, it's like that in the face space like the brain, right, if charges, if charges build up inside and neuron, it's going. It's, it's special. That's gonna be cross and those charges build up with with ions. But you know, who knows? How neuron to make detect that phase space That electromagnetic field of space.

03:34

I mean, in terms of how the electromagnetic field is interacting with, with ions, with sodium, ions and potassium ions. And yeah, so that's interesting but it's fine, but it but the the field space is like, Really. It's like it's like you're a neural function. Is involving shifts and field space.

04:12

It's creating shifts in the field space but if it's a shield space is polarizing it in a certain way. Like I mean I'm imagine you could have that kid magnify and like your magnetic event an electric, and magnet and a magnetic event. Maybe I I'm just I'm just I don't know exactly.

04:36

And and that could have a cascading a patterns that could cause cascading patterns of circuits of neurons firing that. So, it's like, it's like, you know, I'm just imagining that you might that that there is some sort of spontaneous firing in inside you, because of that are triggered by massive electromagnetic events and so you might feel something, you know, like your heart feels like it's bursting with happiness or sadness, or happiness.

05:17

It's bursting with some emotion, you know, one day, maybe you spoke to joint or something. It's bursting would happen if you smoke the giant, right, for whatever reason, and and like, well, would it if there's there's, there's a huge electromagnetic shift that's happening and maybe maybe it comes from, maybe it's created by the neurons in an oscillation, maybe maybe the large oscillating because like, you know, your heart has a lot of neurons that are in oscillation 24/7, right?

05:50

They're just they're just oscillating all the time, right? And it's like it's a synchronous. Like they're all firing together and that helps to move the giant muscle. That's your heart. And so I oscillations are more powerful, like if you want to if you want to have, you know, power that can move the motors of your limbs, right?

06:14

You're gonna need sufficient power for that to move your arms and legs, right? So so the, so the neurons, when they oscillate together they're they are sending a charge together and so the brain can have groups of neurons become oscillators that that in the oscillators, as I'll point on the book can learn patterns and the patterns that they learn.

06:43

Like they can, they can also replay those patterns. And what drives, what drives the preferences of that? Oscillators preferences that comes down that comes down to

07:01

That they're you know how well how good the results were, right? So it's like, you're memories, you're good, memories become the drivers of your of your actions, right? You're your good memories become as Iwards of your actions, you know, unless you unless your foot and that's it's the bad memories that are the drivers of your actions but you're the memories that you're focusing on the things that occupy the time of your day are our driving your your actions so it so it's like if you are your memories, let's say you are your memories, right?

07:38

You're all of your life experiences combined. You're all that waste. This is an argument. You can define yourself with different way if you want. I'm just saying for the sake of this argument, let's imagine you are all your memories and at the same time all your memory memories because there because they're complex oscillators they are basically there are tractors for certain kinds of patterns your memories are tuned in to receive certain kinds of patterns into fire when you get those patterns and their tuned to ignore other types of patterns and they're turned because of the arrangement of their synapses.

08:21

What the switch synapses are receiving signals which are not which synapses exist in which do not. And so I was analyzing basically, I mean, I think of the neuron has something that is a pattern detector at the dendritic level. But it's something also passes on a multi vesicle signal with the that represents like a one, two, three or zero to.

08:50

It's downstream neighbors. And so, you have basically the signal, the signal went through three or zero represents the vesicle release, right? So in the synapse, you can have one, two, or three, vesicles or zero, best release. And what happens is that's going. This does, you know, the vesticals open up and they release neurotransmitters like dopamine or or GABA or a set of choline or and what happens is they travel across the synaptic cleft and they, they attach the membrane on the other side.

09:33

And they, if you have more than is that, well, maybe more of the potassium receptors will be engaged, and the potassium will get out faster because there's more channels pumping it in. So, if the speed of the potassium is faster, than that means that the action potential concludes faster, right?

09:57

Because the, because it or the action could be inhibited, right? So if it's so if it's like, so if it's like, so if the action potential is the size of a three, right? Then it's going to transmit. And so if the action potential results in is the, if the action potential is a, so the extra potential by itself is a high phasic like that.

10:31

That's a that's like it was gonna release three. Vesicles, if it's a high like high beta, if it's I mean, a high gamma, if it's high gamma, that's like the ultra fast phthick that's like, it's like releasing three vessels at the same time. If it's just gamma then it's it's like really it could be, this is like, it could be, it could be like releasing two gamas.

10:58

Okay. And if it's, if it's like,

11:14

I don't know if it if it is like a one that's more of a tonic frequency. That could be. I don't know. That could be like a like an alpha or a theta. I don't know. Or maybe even like a beta. Right. I don't know. I'm not sure but it doesn't have to be like that.
