(thalamus, oscillat) an analogy that was perfect for your mind may have no meaning to the next person

It is the perfect phrase to connect and inter relate two unstructured stacks of data captures in the human brain, for your precise data structures I mean. To someone else the phrase that sounds like a key insight will sound like something else. 

triangle

the thing is that if an electron has intrinsic spin then it has intrinsic energy, and the cosmos can't have a beginning,

because as a harmonic oscillator the cosmos can never stop or start

a cosmos that starts or stops 

the odds of a harmonic oscillating cosmos reaching perfect equilibrium are about once in infinity

so 

This morning I had another radical insight into neural function that has to do with learning, particularly with how neurons change their settings to have preferences for certain kinds of data. Sounds cool right? It's going into the book this morning :))))

Folks have heard the idea that the universe is a fractal and a hologram, but an electron is not a planet, unlike a planet an electron cannot lose its spin, and a hologram does not have mass. So these ideas break down on close inspection, but do they point to another idea?

The electron is spin
If spin is intrinsic to particles its because they are spin

A particle is intrinsic spin

"(A monk asked Master Zhao Zhou, "Does a dog have Buddha Nature?" Zhao Zhou replied, "Yes.")" Long before special relativity & neuroscience ancient Buddhist philosophers pondered the nature of the dog. Today scientists ask whether or a not an insect has subjective self-awareness.

The sign of internal self-awareness is the modulation of signals (such as in the thalamus) in that there is no contemplation or observation without modulation
