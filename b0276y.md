Invisible neurons, how the brain renders everything Coin
00:00
Operation narrow hacks or two. Narrow hacks or two neuro hacks or. Narrow hacks or hacks or neuro hex or. Hexor. Hacks or. H, a x o r. hex or. No hex or. H, a x o r. H, x o r. One word, h a x o r. Hex or?
00:44
X. Hacks. Or.
00:55
Um, Yes other three pi. The raspberry pi. The sec.
01:07
Is a secret stealth project dedicated role. As secret stuff product. Subtitles and neuro hexagonal. Neuro hexor 2.0.
01:30
That's better. Yes, so. It's going to have two f nu's. Sensors on the left one right because these people can. Modify the blood flow but he loves it right which way they're looking. And then of grey versions will have essential all the place. You know, like the kernel that's it.
02:04
So but the first one is to. Fits in august quest so that certainly has replied will be wearing a wifi running.
02:28
A local host a local house and you visited locost in the web address. And so the sensors will go to the Raspberry Pi. Alright. And then they go to your website.
02:53
I can make it work with my. But it can also create like a local Wi-Fi hotspot.
03:05
Condition to that.
07:30
I.
15:00
Okay. So, I want to say next is this is going to continue.
15:09
Okay.
21:31
Okay. So imagine that there's a book right? And the podcast. History. History from 10,000 years ago. I history there was stuff you dreamed about like people walking through a canyon. I'm just saying stripes of people. And. Looking at me. Hey. Jereart to California. People who lived in. The walls the desert, right?
22:37
I thought would be interesting.
22:49
Like what if there was a modern group of people that went and lived and the walls of the desert? Sort of like just looking ancient people. Is there a way to live out there? I can't think that was ones for tuck grass. Valley.
23:10
's green or valley.
29:21
Okay, so if you were with the volcano island. And. The agent civilizations. Need to try the locks through the canyon. I also the volcanoes that wiped out ourselves. All right. I different.
29:43
Histories like that.
31:24
It.
39:38
Yeah.
01:03:19
You.
01:11:25
For.
01:13:37
And.
01:28:35
You.
01:30:23
You.
01:42:46
So imagine that you.
01:42:53
Know. It's this has a okay, so I imagine.
01:43:14
It's like each neuron. Is.
01:43:22
About.
01:43:27
And it only fires if it gets specific information. Hey because it's the computer. To. To recognize with something very specific like a specific particular sequence.
01:43:55
You can remember you start to sequences.
01:44:09
The human memory is learned. Sequences.
01:44:21
So,
01:44:33
The first deal is. Matter. Is transmitting.
01:45:02
The phrase. Better.
01:45:09
Strings of. Detecting. And so whenever we fire. Whoever sees a very specific sequence pattern. And strainable.
01:45:27
Form so it gets trained to looking forward now it's trained. Was better.
01:45:55
Than it's kinda like if you see that you see a nail. It's like,
01:46:10
The nail and let's see what's up. Areas. I mentioned three of them. Just diving into the top of now the body and the spike at the bottom.
01:46:29
The nail is several.
01:46:36
Is like, Just a frame. Each. Other. Each one.
01:46:51
Could be like.
01:47:06
And.
01:47:25
And aspirin you.
01:47:33
've done neuron is firing.
01:47:51
Is firing. I said the, Neuron is firing the.
01:48:07
Narrower.
01:48:13
Is fine.
01:48:29
Okay.
01:48:37
Because I appear.
01:48:50
Only part of this diving physical note, for example. As several different. Signature.
01:49:34
It's just like it's just remembering a very specific ring of previous pattern. Right?
01:49:44
Previous pattern is. Just learning when it's going to fire again.
01:49:57
It. I mean, it's learning what it's going to fire for sequence is going to fire for so it's like it's job is true a focused sequence learn to sequence and a books. Save us. But it's good morning.
01:55:50
So neurons.
01:55:56
The dendrite of an sequence.
01:56:06
Learning.
01:56:11
Has able to remember sequence because each neuron that sounds stream and that sequence it will interfire. 10 times only on a fire if it sees a certain pattern of retrospect otherwise with the pattern away.
01:56:34
It better utilities. Pretty temporary impact this painting impact. So it's like a pattern that like beats a few times. Doesn't know. Fires. And changes it's oscillation. I mean, you're having an active potential will change and runs like. The amount of information is changes. That changes where what changes whether and when it's going to fire.
01:57:10
Is that only going to fire? If it receives a certain pattern. Okay. Certain power, it's is like a number. And what says it's creates an abstract pattern of the temples facial pattern. Alright, so let's see if all stuff stored by dendritic vacation. It didn't despise enjoying. Spikes on the synapses.
01:57:44
On autonomous spikes in the baton. Those who are like,
01:57:53
Hotels. It's like extreme moss and they're not. I guess they are. I guess they are sitting um, it's an also.
01:58:11
Their specs. Here's my different services or not connected. I don't know if I think. I'm not sure other spikes that are just hairs kind of they're they're not. Part of the Bhutan I think there are. I don't have. Yeah.
01:58:50
Okay. So, um, What I mean to say is that but anyway Harris they can. Connect this back they can connect to connect a perfectly. And with that means is that they're. Looking for a specific pattern.
01:59:19
Hey.
01:59:31
So you have a pattern okay, so you could have a network of parents. I know network of pattern detectors. Hey, so if there's a sequence that's being played. Sequence will be played by the the set of signals we passed two different neurons because each neuron will take a timeout after five hours.
01:59:59
Or an inherition. And so it fires and so if another pet another step on a sequence comes in it passes from where the first term was at the second one and that fires and that passes from the second one to third one and that fires and so on and so each neuron takes the cell phone out and becomes a neighborhood after firing and so if they fire in like ten milliseconds if they fire like if you if you don't fire my tail seconds, And then sitting on keeps passing so now the signal is traveling right and so maybe like at some point like,
02:00:43
Yeah. That's an arrow circuit fine and that's how patterns protected it's negative spontaneous if we wiring so like remember how like if you learn if you're playing the game Tetris, okay? And. So. It's like you remember after you're playing the game for like five hours these are just detached in your head if you play it again touch rate hours and then try to sleep you might be seeing like pictures of Tetris blocks in your vision because your brain has modified itself to be thinking about tetris tetris blocks, all right and um, that means that you bring is able to modify what patterns it looks for.
02:01:31
And what patterns did a grinder shouldn't and put it into text so you know, like looking for really looking for attention spots, that's why you're saying that. And you're very unlikely to bring in so it's like better matter that same neuron that neuron fires and the sequence okay imagine a new sequence of star and I use a sequences from the first secret sentencing sequence so now it's firing is let's say that you have the same amount as a patented temperature sees a certain pattern, but that's certain pattern can come from any direction.
02:02:08
Which means it's gonna fire to learn sequences like this in a sense like you can have sequences that are asymmetric to other sequences. And.
02:02:24
So there you have so in that case, you would have like the same pattern but it would light up like somewhere else. And.
02:02:40
But both the other pattern would remember that the second sequence would remember the first sequence because when that sequence fires. It's in it's transmitting a signal to every other neuron in the brain.
02:02:58
It's like a broadcast like broadcasting it's like. It's works exactly the way electrical impedance demography works. When you're on fires, it's just like electrical piece tomography in a single as being it's being sent everywhere. Without bias it's like it's gonna go out through old of the neurotransmitters without bias in all directions, so there are transmitters interval fire.
02:03:28
From the neuron and all directions okay, but it does matter with the amplitude of the firing as patient fund the reception of k.
02:03:44
So the absolute means that.
02:03:50
I think it means that neuron can represent different patterns.
02:04:05
Yeah. I think this is part of the programming thing like the Tetris blocks, okay red light or certain smells. It's suggest that well, maybe a neuron is. Able to change. The recognizance that's gas. I don't change.
02:04:38
Or.
02:04:46
Oh my second pattern that reckon answers. Maybe different from the pattern that it transmits everything.
02:04:57
So it can look for a certain pattern because it kind of needs to know two steps it kind of needs another previous pattern and coming pattern and it's kind of translated pattern. But it could work like a regular neural network where it couldn't learn to so it's doing pattern recognition.
02:05:16
Or one neuron is looking for a specific one specific pattern, but. But actually it could recognize multiple patterns. In those multiple patterns would be but each each one would be like a packet of that festivals because that's all looking transmit is one to is zero one two, or three festivals.
02:05:41
The vesicles are like going to reach more neurons.
02:05:54
So necessary can only transmit the amplitude, which is one to or three. Which is over 0 1 0 1 2 or 3.
02:06:17
So it's going to be firing not only anyways. Right? If it's what happens is. It's going to have farther normal like rhythm but. Anyways. And this this is why it has the ability to. Like the normal rhythm sort of like is. When it's not reporting anything, right? But this is like the basis of temporary memory like it's like when you see something.
02:06:49
You are.
02:06:56
I'm just when you see something you're you're neuron is going to. See what's up neurons that are firing. And each neuron in that sequence, which is exactly. One male second. You should know and sequence of the sequences exactly one millisecond for each neuron. It's going to learn a pattern.
02:07:23
It's going to transmit a slightly different matter. It's going to learn a pattern. It's like, okay.
02:07:34
That pattern it could be.
02:07:51
I guess the pen could be a one, two, three, or could be a zero one, two, or three.
02:08:00
Yes, that's.
02:08:12
Well, the neurons are only going to recognize this year one, two, or three, let's say. I got a one because it's going to say I got a one or got a zero at a zero. I have one two. I got three. All right.
02:08:30
So and that sort of like represents like quantity. So could be like, that's like a pixel. Representation is like it's transparent. Or it's great or it's like light gray or dark gray or it's black zero, one, two, and three. So three is black. And zero is transparent, right? Anyway, you have like a four digits if like every nerve could ever set four digits.
02:09:06
All right zero one, so it's not minor. It's not finer. It's like there's four digit zero, one, two, and three.
02:09:29
Put all you need is this pressure representation. Okay, so potentially but let's see if we're just potentially having patterns, can you have?
02:09:42
One two, and three zero, one, two, three. That means I could record. Any pattern. I had four.
02:09:56
Four digits four bits. I could record four bit patterns. Multiple four bit patterns, right if I'm in our network and I can encode for it. I can record it. Any pattern? That can be converted to four bits.
02:10:22
Well, here's the thing if I could fire like a four because it's like one, two, three, four, right even though it's zero. Seconds zero, two three is x zero, one, two, three, but I okay, so I guess I know how to deposit brightness right or it could be a percent.
02:10:42
Volume of sound. Is it zero, one, two, three, four? It's like a four degree of resolution right but what happens is four. Before and then you have like you can have 40, right? So we're the one, two, three, four could represent four. Numbers zero, one, two, or three. All right, so you have three say 30.
02:11:08
Yeah 33 right are you get three? 33? 33, right? So it's like a piece like these four, so it base two. Okay, so you should ask like, three three, three, three three. Houses like each anything right but it's the sequence so you could be five five five five five five across the board, right?
02:11:35
I could be sequenced because okay, so this thing is like it's lining a sequence right so like you'll find a three five three six six nine right you can have another zero that's three, five three. Seven seven nine, right nothing is like four feet that each. Could be that you have the same round hiring for.
02:12:03
Course you can place.
02:12:37
Because they intersect with b right so ABC and TBS they cross over at b right they both have a DBS ABC because there's a B we get the intersection between both organizations.
02:13:02
Broadcast. ABC and TBS say they crossed the beat this are the intersect and they that's the crossroad again, so the, So that's recommended each other each one is a vector, right? Our line in 3d space right in a group and so there's a line to be to see a straight line that's one vector and then you have another line it's like TBNS and a two lens are crossing each other like forming an X alright, so they're perpendicular but it looks like an expat.
02:13:44
Anything is like the two lines so what is ABC when it's TPS a lot of different stretched out nice stretch for the farmer. S that you have those are five points, okay, so that'll be use one point right and then and then. Ah. Let's say that you constantly hear the ABS better than ABS and here TBS TBS ABS.
02:14:13
C ABC DVS.
02:14:27
ABC.
02:14:34
S.
02:14:46
Like you bring process circuits tbcbcbs. But that is a. The it's like it's like a seminances like the neuron is switching but it's got used to being switched on to so t so if b fires then as far as. So ABC is a fires and we fires and C fires TPS is T fires and b5s then as far as and so if you go back to ABC you were saying ABS because they're used to C5 CG I used to find wouldn't be fired, right so I was getting ready to be I was riding to a an S and wasn't going to see like oh yeah, no, wait a second set that between indicates that yeah, so I guess on any case one is you can have multiple neurons that respond to the letter.
02:15:41
S. Okay and that way if one's inhibited the neuro sequence controlled the different I reckon asked right so you have a whole bunch of guys. I recognize asked. I recognize that it's a huge reserve representing an oscillation. America is in so it's this category it's like that all affirming the same thing.
02:16:10
Like all that kind of things.
02:16:18
So a sequence isn't learned by one it's learned by a group, but like oh yeah, so like so what happens is um, I know fires and then it's oscillation begins to match the group's oscillation but that's not entirely correct underlie correct because there's actually this where it looks like the first is merging into the second one perfectly but actually there's a math equation happening because as first one is it's there, they're both merging to each other so like, The overall mass is increasing.
02:17:02
Right because one thing margin do something else is overall mass increasing. To it's kind of like.
02:17:18
It's it's it's changes the pace of overall oscillation just a tiny amount. All right, so if you have like, So if you have like a lot if you feel a lot of inhibition signal can get weaker the collector signal it's like slowing the signal down. Hey.
02:17:44
All right if you're changing the pace of 105. It could be like yeah give a sign down case like let's see this it's gonna fire so the idea is the fires every five milliseconds waiting fires and fires every five miles, sorry, okay? So it's gonna fire anyways because it's gonna fire anyways, it has the ability to just throw out a pattern by not responding firing at the regular time is the zero that's being translated.
02:18:14
Oh. But then like David fires and. If our side if a fires faster think that fires in one zero if a fire is faster than so normally there's zero is like okay, it's gonna it's interesting it's gonna go to a one state. Or two state or three state. Right and so what happens is.
02:18:44
If it fires out of sequence. I mean, this is making a difference sequence. If you find out if sequence right let's say you get the same amount over again, there's no information. Because it's just it's just like yeah, it's the same pattern so you don't make those transparent. And what would happens is, so you have a transparent field.
02:19:11
Oh shit. And so those are like the pixels of the transcript display. And what happens is, um, when a when you see something a transparent field. You see like the words pride us you see those are the numbers that are like.
02:19:36
So like if you look okay, they hold your phone in the dark. And if you see like where the screen is like super bright, okay, that does her areas where there are 3d knows that are firing and they're firing on the greatest numbers with latest finest.
02:20:01
To create the brightness effect and then there's other shapes all right and but it's like, you know this canvas. 30 canvas and narrows are firing to represent all the patterns of the room all the secret advantages to sequences. So the patterns that you see are neurons that are fire.
02:20:26
And so those two things one is is it's a passive sequence for its sequence recognizer. Recognizes.
02:20:37
Any four digit sequence.
02:20:43
Across a recognized sequence of fortuitous sequences.
02:20:51
Yeah, okay if recognized entire sequences.
02:21:02
For each sequences for sequences. So can organize an unleaded number of sequences, but only put only like what the four digit sequence. I'm. Testa I'm having a sequences they can.
02:21:31
Okay, so it's 494 bit sequence so each sequence in the sequence is four pets so we play it so each place imagine a stack of plates each plate is four bits, but it can remember the whole stack of things. So we're gonna remember a complex pattern. Several patterns with the hairs that end right up.
02:21:54
By increasing those hairs well, there's an absolute just hairs. I mean. Yeah are the spikes that we're challenged or are they just hairs despite? So but anyway like they're going to increase your decrease constantly so they appear interfere. They're gonna connect and disconnect constantly and that's short term. That's through this for this different patterns becoming coded.
02:22:25
By what's there, so let's remember it's looking for a suggesting in real time to to learn short-term patterns learning short-term patterns. So like it learns a pattern. And then. It gets reliable about repeating that pattern in the correct sequence. As I say you move say you're looking west and then you're not you're looking right so now the parents that you age of your fire, it's pretty different sequence and so the idea is that.
02:23:04
Like a pixel it's like pixel epistles like representing image a color an image right so you have like this support bits and but it's a sequence of orbits, so it's a sequence. Which means that.
02:23:28
It's sequenced memory.
02:23:42
Sequences are handled by notifying a succession.
02:23:51
With different ampliters. Okay, you can have one look for a sequence. And fire to be part of a sequence. And then and then I see that's changing the oscillations so firing so it's like you have obviously gave a group of neurons and they're all firing together in a pattern like a whale.
02:24:19
Hot and stay with that thing. And if I regularly intervals. So, they're all representing the same exact thing. But they could all be looking for different things. So like a textures detecting specific patterns and they're each capable of changing what they're detecting. So that means that they can so that each one so it's like each node is a neural network and it's doing like a detection of patterns of sequences of the and those transmitting.
02:24:51
A part of sequence. The part of sequence that represents a large sequence. Oh, damn, so has different wrestler and sequence into.
02:25:05
A symbol.
02:25:11
Or.
02:25:17
Wow a neuron has to compress. A whole sequence down into a smaller sequence. So if it's like yeah, it's like if I can learn.
02:25:33
A 40 dimensional sequence 0 1 2 or 3 and I can learn to sequence a 4 dimensional sequences. So 0 1, 2 3. Or 3. 2, 1 0. Or 2. 3, 2 3. 0 1, 2, 3, 2 1 0 or 2, 3, 2 3. Oh 1.
02:26:04
2 2. 1 2 2. I So if you have all those sequences, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2 1.
02:26:19
2, 3, 2 3.
02:26:24
0, 1, 2 2. So if you follow the sequence of string. I do is that.
02:26:40
You can have an architect any combination of. Any sequence for.
02:26:53
A represented in and with 4 bits and I'm gonna fire 0 a 1 or 2 or 3. And then as I do 3, so the default is 5 0. So in a second, it can wait it's kind of like 3 bits but it's like okay, I'm not gonna be invisible.
02:27:19
So I can imagine that like if you have if you look if you see a fan. Where the fan is where like the color in your and your eyes are different. Where's the background background lighter fan areas darker? I know that there's fan there because the darker area is darker starter you can see the shape of the fan the sequence of darker areas had steam which is different from the wall and it's contrast from.
02:27:46
Right? And like I mentioned that darker area is it has is a pixel. That's lighting up in a 3d volume. Okay. And imagine that's just the transparent area between here between where my nose is that and the fan okay, this is like a transparent area and imagine that space was not empty, but in fact, it was filled with.
02:28:18
Stars and it was filled with neurons. Right and they're all managing to be invisible because they're firing nothing that's firing there are the neurons that represent that that dark area that's a fan and the wall behind it, but everything in between everything in between the wall all the anticipates as those are right now arms are not fired.
02:28:44
But actually this thing they are firing. So when they're not firing they're firing at the regular tonic rate, which makes them a visible so if I have the normal rate, they're invisible, it's like yeah, they're gonna fire every 10 milliseconds. Okay, let's say it's time for I don't know what we're talking how often it's just gonna fire at a regular interval because it's a regular interval it's invisible now what happens is if certain patterns of certain sequences recognized a certain sequence of your homes are gonna fire.
02:29:18
And they're gonna fire one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, okay. You're gonna have neurons. I recognize parts of the sequence.
02:29:38
So I don't know what the limit is, but I guess it could be any focus each neuron could detect any part of the sequence that's four bits. Per interval.
02:29:57
So yeah, so you could so nervous if I'm if I'm an observer neuron, right? I get five if I see a one a two or three or four.
02:30:09
I could fire if I see. A three a two a one or zero.
02:30:20
I know is. It doesn't it feel like it can I am saying it doesn't have to be specific okay the downstream neurons. Fire is doing like a football hemature pixel. Right how dark how transparent is a transparent or is it like imagine all the noise in between? They have like a lot of noise imagine also like to see if it's like stare for a long time to see.
02:30:52
And know how you like your eventually start to see noise everywhere. Alright we're the fans sort of becomes like invisible and you just see like you're just like stare at the ceiling. So imagine the noise is like you begin to see noise everywhere in the family because invisible he start to see like you start to check out like oh wait, oh and the fence invisible, right?
02:31:16
It's because the reason the fans becoming visible is because it's um, The narrative represented every human inhibited because they're fine becoming inhibited so it's like it's like the idea is that and then I starts and nothing is happening so then it becomes invisible it's like you forget about it.
02:31:36
Anything that is firing at a regular a ton of great trying if it's firing a regular rate, it's gonna become visible to you.
02:31:51
But because what happens is what you're seeing is the difference where you're seeing is like.
02:32:03
We're seeing it's like you're seeing like the. Singer change and environment rate and the change D is from zero, so it's like okay, you're seeing a change in the amount of. One two, or three. And five hours is yeah, let's see what's registered a three. So it's like a three okay, so now three days like affects more neurons.
02:32:31
So more on your arms see a pattern to be part of a pattern. You see that there are detecting more of a fan. Okay, oh I dissected something. Right?
02:32:50
And then a neuron I see yes, that's like a wall which take us something a three. Select there's a lot of activity happening. Right?
02:33:05
And let's say the. Where's this okay? I imagine that.
02:33:22
Okay imagine he's here with like an eye okay here what happens is if you see a lot if you see a lot it's like what happens? Mention. Here now here we know how hard is I can I. Okay.
02:33:41
Okay and they what they may just like imagine that. When everything lights up everything like that. Let's say that like you have a home much of activation as the same time. Okay. You can fire the regular rate interest ignore that pattern. Okay or. Have pattern cause you to fire a one or two or three.
02:34:11
Magnitude response that's like okay, it's like what's the magnitude response like oh or whoa, whoa, I guess the magnitude of response right one, two, three different levels or nothing.
02:34:28
Okay, then what happens is. So you have like a whole bunch of downstream rounds like a tree. Downstream ranches, they're all connected to different things. So. It's kind of each one is like an eye. It's only gonna say like a different thing that was sort of expression like whoa, like whoa, okay, let's say a different expression based upon what it's seeing lit up light up, okay.
02:35:08
And g so it's only gonna light up see it's like a certain like kind of pattern.
02:35:19
So I'm imagining like a movie screen right it's like there's four photos it's either completely dark or it's like yeah, it's like gradient of you know ones is a little as dark but a little higher and. And here is much lighter and then three is like much lighter and it could be either it could be either contrast.
02:35:43
I could be there going for the gigabyte going from light to dark or dark to light. It doesn't matter so it's like a represent shades. Of gray or different colors and spectrum. Or different sound amplitudes. It's it's a four-dimensional pattern.
02:36:14
Okay. So that's like a line advantage it's like a line detector secondary or color detector all right and you have if you have.
02:36:28
But that's that long that's something okay.
02:36:37
But higher levels.
02:36:42
Those lower edge detections become a picture. And higher level. That I would high level you have neurons representing. Features.
02:37:05
And what happens is that the complexity of the future is represented by the lower level neurons and recognized and reduced way at a higher level.
02:37:49
By the ball. Yeah on.
02:37:55
His only gonna fire. When certain high-level features are detected.
02:38:12
High level sequence patterns are detected. That's how like, okay. So lowest levels doing simple stuff. It's like you it's like you have to hierarchy. Of detected patterns and the patterns can. Happen to any part of the image, so you know flight and dark happen anywhere. It's literally renting rendering what you're seeing.
02:38:46
In terms of in terms of different nouns firing representing different parts of your life field.
02:38:57
There's a move your head you can see that always fine. It's totally different. It's totally like. Imagine if your whole brain is processing your whole scene. Your whole visual cortex is processing everything you're seeing at this moment this is in a second. And as this moment changes. It's possible something else, that's dead.
02:39:23
And all level patterns are just predicted and they're not updated unless there's some sort of change. I change happens only when you move your head. Change only happens over time. So that's how you can set the sound of the way see what's going on over time is that the internal patterns of the brain are changing over time as you head around so as we head around you're moving more.
02:40:03
And the corresponding neurons. Are changing so as we've had something is something that wasn't in your individuality vision. Something to your left. Or something to your right something like something to your left, it could be a box. Let's say you see a box and the box is only an original if you're looking to the left.
02:40:31
You can see the box on your left you don't see the box on your right so the box on your left right, so when the box on your left, do you have in your arms in a 3d space at a representing that box what it looks like? All the properties of the box or it's made out of is a plastic is it at all is it paper what kind of boxes?
02:40:57
And so you've now it's representing those materials.
02:41:08
With this or individual cortex, so then you've got that you've got sensory neurons system and you've got the prefrontal cortex. The primary sensory input core disease and and then the pavement of free from the cortex, so I think it's brain is just like four areas, there's the audio cortex.
02:41:30
Divisional cortex this matter since record text and then the prefrontal cortex so the three primary sensor areas and then the prefrontal cortex the preventive cortex is it's every area that is an internal area is not directly connected to incoming senses and so it's all like intern neuron. So I can inhibitory area.
02:41:53
But it's interesting is that there is um, Something like similarity in all areas of core disease. But information only travels to the bottom layers. Of the primary sensory cortex. The physical cortex stereo cortex and. The. Somatosensory cortex. And the physical cortex and the audio cortex visual cortex, that's right.
02:42:32
And. So what is going to the bottom of the prefrontal cortex? Right. Was a primary thing that goes there? Because if it's not going. If it's not is it connect. Is it still connected to the thalamus because even if there's no? Yeah, so that would be interesting. Okay, so I need to know that because like the primary sensor cortises are all connected to the thalamus is where the information comes from.
02:43:03
So it goes to from your incoming sensors from your eyes to the thalamus. Before it goes to your your. Visual cortex. All right, it travels a certain path from the eyes along the optic nerve to thalamus. And then you see the back your head. To to your obstacles and then at the parietal lobes.
02:43:32
That's how vision vision comes in. From your eyes. Through the thalamus. Now supposedly nose comes in that good story comes in through five parts to the fifth part goes to the thalamus. So the eyes go to thalamus the fifth part of goostory or smell goes to thalamus. The other four goes to different parts of your brain directly.
02:44:08
And then you have the audio cortex comes in and. Hurt your old brain first and then travels up. It goes to the thalamus first before hitting the new. Cortex. And I'm not sure with the lowest point of the sound comes in it. I'd go curious again. So comes into it all brain when it comes in through the satellite specifically.
02:44:37
Before going to the cortex. To the audio cortex. It would sound as like registration layers but the strongest sounds that's a neocortex. I'd like different frequencies and so yeah, it's this idea of the brain is. Like all these different frequencies detecting different frequencies and playing back different frequencies. On a macro scale different summations of information as different frequently patterns.
02:45:16
So I pass on different frequency patterns to other people.
02:45:30
In fact the fact of speaking. Different frequency patterns are being transmitted in each stage of a word being spoken in each step of award being spoken and it's probably none see Asian of any word to be spoken. Those are sequences that are represented by different.
02:45:58
Neurons firing. So when a fire one of the neuron fires you have any a? Like any in your like inner representation. Any or a part of it, you know encouragement part of it. Or part of it it's like pixels. They're so they're so small that anyone can represent A or B or C A or B?
02:46:23
C, it could be represented anywhere and the cortex represented on your far left that could be an A it would be for being far away. You could have the pattern of A could be anywhere in your mind. So any part of your brain could recognize A.
02:46:49
All parts of your mind could recognize hey you could imagine that all your whole reality is just me out of A's. Imagine your whole reality is made out of bees. He imagined bees everywhere. You can imagine sees everywhere. ABCs imagine. T's everywhere imagine B's everywhere you can imagine the sees it as everywhere.
02:47:11
Here's where this view is wired to see for a second. I need to change. Assets everywhere sees everywhere as everywhere. You have abcps. ABC everywhere. T everywhere B everywhere. As everywhere everywhere be everywhere see everywhere. So you could recognize like Liars everywhere. It's basically it's like it's like imagine like every part of your visual cortex is imagining the letter.
02:47:52
A every part of your cortex imaging letter B, you're just imagining a letter B everywhere. Okay, like little letter V's. Heat up large hot letter B's also. If a mixture of little and big and you have a letter P's every size. Say you're filling up every your entire space with letter P's of different sizes.
02:48:12
And then moving at different speeds somewhere fast somewhere slow. So you can have every speed everywhere. You're fast bees everywhere and you have slow a large bees everywhere. Answer the fast bees your wisdom by like wind and a slow be so like trying to statues. They're moving you.
02:48:39
And then we're gonna move your solely with their giant and they're overlapping see that's like there's like a the the foot of a statue isn't every. And every place where there's an a so you have like a thousand overlapping statues and they're all massive but there's just as many dashes there are microscopicase because there were every a is that's where the foot of a new statue is beginning that's where the token is that you're beginning.
02:49:07
Wherever he is. Overlapping images. So your entire space is filled up with trying his tattoos, they're overlapping as to have like one each space has some tow represents bedtime statue. That's overlapping with other strategies.
02:50:19
Okay. So um, It's kind of like okay, so we've got a way to represent um visual stuff but also audio sequences temporal and spatial audio sequences and specifically it's gonna be. Temporal relative to. Temple like a play sound like a reference frame that's like a temporal place. I'll representation.
02:50:48
I also possible to have like abstract pattern recogn representation. But the abstract pattern representation where.
02:51:01
Still have a four dimensional representation, it would still make use of visual cortex. And and that.
02:51:13
It would be that there's the same tissue like. Yeah because you have any any part of your brain can represent. What that pattern means okay, so it's like so you could have like a one, two three pattern here in the visual cortex and that one, two, three pattern, all right, it might be zero one, two, three.
02:51:35
And it might be it's it's not just it's not just that it's like it might be like that one two, three pattern could represent there could be ten one two three patterns could be a million one, two, three patterns and they could they could be like recognized they could be recognized.
02:51:55
By enough upstream neurons of those patterns that would like each each upstream neuron would recognize the same patterns as occurring in different places, right? And so like those patterns could represent a texture. Right like a texture could be like a consistent pattern over space. And you'd have many different neurons would be representing like the same image.
02:52:26
And so you'd have something at a higher level that recognizes the pattern among patterns. And then you have a higher level of apparent among patterned about patterns as you have patterns of patterns and patterns appended a patterns and levels levels of patterns, right? To infinity and so you could have higher level patterns that are so morphic in the visual cortex to a high level pattern.
02:52:56
In audio cortex my isomorphic. I mean that those it could be high level similarities that are that don't exist that little level. And I high level similarities are when. You find a concept the concept isn't it's like the concept of the sequence it's a high level concept that doesn't exist it at the lowest level.
02:53:21
Because it's a sequence of concepts and so you could have you can have sequences detected at the lowest level and they are. In a sense there are pieces of sequences that are detected. And so the brain is putting together pieces of sequences of content in order to make larger sequences of content.
02:53:47
But you could have you have a sound of a horn. And you can sound like an oceress. And they could happen in a sequence a horn and then and then an animal horn sound and then an animal sound like a rhinoceros. You could have a hard sound and an alarm sounded sound and it animal sound and it's a sequence of sounds.
02:54:17
And that represented sequences of content and the represented by.
02:54:28
Groups of. Your consider all detecting they're all detecting the same pattern, they're all firing at the same pattern. Because they're all firing the same pattern there's a high level pattern detection that happens.
02:54:45
And it's a. And so what happens is the recognition of a pattern. Is surrendering of that pattern because that pattern exists to the mind the second is recognized because recognition. Involves a physical transformation like recognition is like, oh I'm firing a different rate than a radius fire. I was invisible before because that's where I'm going to tonic rate my rate of firing changed and how I'm visible.
02:55:18
And I'm just visible to the rights visible a lot of visible little. Visible the maximum.
02:55:27
So the end so it could be like a great scale. I guess we have like.
02:55:37
But there's it's like a. Reason is like color scale. Is because a high level pattern detection. Is the is the association. Of lower level pattern detections. So a high level pattern detection becomes. Becomes defined as a factor.
02:56:10
Becomes encoded in a factor. Of zero one, two, or three. And that can represent a high level. I could represent.
02:56:22
As sequence that fired as of other factors like represented. I learned sequence out of vectors. So those other factors could represent a more complex image. Because the first while the first factor is 20 image. That one image represents all those images have been seen.
02:56:50
So it's like okay, what has been seen is stored in the images in the neurons? I haven't seen I've seen it. And the reduction of what that is. Is there is a neuron that represents all those other neurons.
02:57:14
So it could it could be that one neuron.
02:57:21
Is representing. To every upstream. I mean every downstream. It could be that okay, so like this is the incoming sensory neuron and there's inter neuron the incoming center neuron is the downstream neuron. And the intercensory neuron is upstream neuron. So it goes from outside the brain to the downstream neuron first, which is the sensory input and it goes to in turn neuron which doesn't exist in connected to the sensory input.
02:57:55
Okay.
02:57:59
And the sensory input is going to be inhibiting a lot or it's going to be exciting. So the Internet is going to be either inhibiting or exciting but most of it is inhibiting. So we'll have all signing signals and it will fire to inhibit. Those oscillations.
02:58:28
So, we're not going to be cascading around the whole brain. With endless noise. It's kind of like they'll be firing at a rate in which the brain is able to make sense. Of space.
02:58:48
So it's hard to find or may will be invisible. But the rest of the firing will provide all of the substance of space all the colors of sounds. All the lights all the positions of the properties. That you can visualize. But all that but more to the point because the cortex is acting Sami have all the parts of information that you can hear will be in rendered by the audio cortex, but.
02:59:21
Their correlated concepts high level of patterns high level concepts. So the current so that concept is a high level pattern. Basically concept is higher. But it represents something that was seen at lower levels. So you can have lower levels like the lowest levels, okay, they're recognizing just parts of a pattern.
02:59:45
It's only a high that's only high level and cortex represents a much larger pattern. But patterns could be really complex and so a two layers you could have most high level patterns could be detected. But not just patterns with sequences. So the movies of patterns.
03:00:06
Can all be detected and so like objects could be detected and the, Actually so so they would be tech detected first in the just the first layer of neurons if I respond to the light. That's the first detection. And then if you go back the connecting neurons would represent larger detectors and the larger you go back and layers visual one cortex to fit a two cortex diode to visual six cortex.
03:00:41
In theory that's supposed to be literally each layer is supposed to have rubber be representing much larger detections, much larger image detections and sequences of marriage detection. Sequences of image detections. Okay, so the idea is but maybe like once you get to about two errors then. You know, you pretty much.
03:01:07
We want to get the layer too. So there's like there's the. There's detection layers and I and that's a visual cortex and then there's a thalamus and then there's the visual cord. There's the visual cortex, right?
03:01:40
But it's like okay, but it's like what if everything is getting detected in the first two layers? Before the images are like environment because you already got you actually come through four layers it comes through the ganglia. You've gone through the the phobia. That's where the red and. Three different areas.
03:02:04
You've gone a lot of nerves. You've gone to without us. And you've got along the, The the connections from the thalamus all the way to the observer lobes.
03:02:20
And then you're traveling to. The different they're having to from v1 to v2 to v3 for 25 and 6 and in some cases those patterns are traveling all over the brain just like a lecture like EEG Electro and I mean, just like I'm. EG. EIT EIT is electrical impedance demography.
03:02:48
See the thing is like, When you file electrode you can't direct it. So it's just going to go everywhere. For the timing of when the rest of the narrows received that signal. Is in is an image is like an image. Right? So American fire and a signal is going to travel to all neurons at different rates.
03:03:20
It's being slowed down by the tissue. And travels through different tissue different rates.
03:03:35
So you could have neurons that are just detecting internal patterns. So you have yeah, you don't sequences of brain waves firing.
03:03:50
And then.
03:03:55
So internally so that my internal space could consist of like there's regular brain waves. Because of firing regularly they become visible. But when I brainwave is disrupted. When actually fires out of sequence. That is going to be signal to all of the neurons. We said oh it's a second something changed.
03:04:18
So it becomes a pixel for that because it pixel for the entire brain, though. Because. I actually travels everywhere.
03:04:41
But it can help with travels everywhere but it gets it gets inhibited. Right? So it's like neurons are going to be tuning out stuff that that they're not interested in. Alright, they're going to burn a fire zero a bunch of times. You're not going to train as a firing property.
03:04:59
Right? But if they detect something. This unusual, that's not expected.
03:05:09
So there could be signifying at a regular one or regular two. I was.
03:05:24
Saying now is firing at two regularly that two is going to be invisible. It's only if.
03:05:34
Only if it's tops recognizing to.
03:05:40
Our.
03:05:45
Let's say that it's invisible because this is one it it's visible as soon as it fires something different what happens is it's visibility changes because it's oscillation is gonna match the neurons that it's firing with but it's going to suddenly change those that those passengers you won't really see a change with the one because it's gonna be like, but if you had like a hundred billion neurons, they're all like they all like were triggered and firing in a way that, Caused the whole brain to notice because they were they were all sort of.
03:06:26
Not the whole brain doesn't recognize it so it's not conscious it's like the pattern may happen in the brain doesn't recognize because the brain is choosing not to react it might be recognized so so it's like it's only recognizing it's only this it's only being set up to recognize certain patterns and the way it manages not recognizing is by firing in a taut and attack at a talk way.
03:06:53
But if it changes it's fired right then it has recognized something. But as soon as it recognizes something it's gonna be drawn back into not recognizing things so bias nature it's gonna retract my natures like if it's an edge of sketch it is being shaken so you can like draw a line and edge of sketch if you shake it it just this sketch disappears.
03:07:19
And so it's like it recognizes something with that wracking it would it recognize because the fade right away first of all the sequence begins to fade right away and so it's being to clear out and it is clearing up because it's making space for the next thing to be recognized.
03:07:36
So you can have a mind over time where your mind is it's recognizing sequences over time.
03:07:56
But each sequence is like a frame of time. And sequences like there's like, at least at least a thousand frames. Per second of time.
03:08:22
Okay, so it's like it's recognizing a thousand frames per sequence of time.
03:08:36
A thousand frames. Per sequence of time.
03:08:48
Per second a thousand frames per second. So it's like at that each frame is the millisecond.
03:08:58
But.
03:09:02
That might just be that might just be represented by.
03:09:10
So it could because it could compress information by representing different information as being part of a different scale. Of information, so it's like when. When the number four represents four million represents four million people. Those two forty million people the same added four hundred million people, let's imagine four hundred billion million people.
03:09:41
Okay. Imagine four trillion people automatically before just Italian people, let's imagine for billion desert Italian. For billion decent Italian. People was imagining a trillion trillion people.
03:10:04
Are there on the planet earth let's imagine that there's overtraining people and they're all on this space with you right now overlapping just separated a tiny amount by each of their toes.
03:10:20
So they're not big and exactly the same space there, they're just slightly apart and there's a trillion trillion of them. And you're not a mat you're not like you're not gonna imagine like the literal like visualization of trillion. Say this right because I did here is that I mean, you could you could but the idea is that any any magnitude if information could be represented by having representations behind other representations, so it's any representation.
03:10:58
It could so um.
03:11:04
Severe and brain could have any representation represented by any part of the brain anywhere. But what's gonna happen is that if you get um, hello representation that could happen anywhere in the brain it's maybe represented by intern neurons well the high level representation if you play it in the audio cortex, it's gonna it's gonna sound like music and if you play that the high level or presentation the visual cortex, it's going to it's gonna be made out of a pattern of light if you play the high level.
03:11:43
A presentation in the.
03:11:48
Booster touring.
03:12:04
The.
03:12:25
If it's going to sound like music if you play the high level or representations, which of course are going to it's going to.
03:12:35
Feel like a pattern that you're feeling or smell like a pattern you're smelling.
03:12:43
So it could be even like. Most even yeah, so it could there could be a visual representation of emotion, but the idea is that they're the. The lower parts of your brain are also representing.
03:13:05
So imagine that the whole neocortex was like a screen for the thalass. Just like I'd like a whole bunch of downstream neurons on the screen for upstream arms, but but they're they're each the screen for different upstream, so looks like so it looks like there's many upstream neurons but each one is his own pyramid.
03:13:33
That's summing up his own information just techniques on information from all the downstream neurons, that is connected to. So each one is a pyramid.
03:13:46
But then.
03:13:50
So that means that each one is connected to each one. As far as it can reach. Right, they're all connected to each other. As many as they can reach. So like this physical connections. I'm gonna try to reach as many as I can. And it's like yeah, let me send all my senses out.
03:14:15
Right, so the idea is that it's just going to sense patterned. From everything that it's connected to let's try to connect as much as possible. Okay and then it's going to transmit stuff sometimes so transmit stuff. So that means there are transmitters and transmitter and neurotransmitters for sometimes.
03:16:13
But the the key idea is that it's not just going to transmit.
03:16:26
A it doesn't transmit a.
03:16:33
In terms of like it doesn't have a symbol to transmit what it has is. How much how many upstream neurons is going to affect is it going to affect?
03:16:52
One downstream neuron. To downstream neurons three downstream rounds or four. Or it's more like maybe it's going to affect thirty. Or sixty or ninety or 120 neurons, maybe it's like a huge multiple.
03:17:16
Okay. But it doesn't have. Okay.
03:17:26
But it's going to be transmitting that that signal which is going to become part of a sequence it's changed a sequence and a sequence of symbols looks like if you're playing a piano song and one one note is off due to two. Because that one sequence changed. And change the piano sequence.
03:17:47
It normally do too. It's like that one note as messed up. And. So that sense that one note has changed. So you have the notes the notice if it's due to two like I imagine like maybe if you heard the same beat over and over again, it would become kind of like.
03:18:16
Transparent or less noticeable or you just sort of tune it out. Too now you stop hearing after a while.
03:18:29
Now just fade to the background depending on how disruptive it was. Your mind would focus on some other stuff. And maybe you'd remember it. But the more consistent it is in your environment. Right? Like what we're seeing is there's a whole bunch of blood pretzels in front of the eyes.
03:18:49
An idea is because they're so this they're there consistently. It's always there. Then they're they're rendered as transparent. Because they're such a consistent pattern. The only patterns that are rendered that are not transparent are the ones that are fired. At unexpected rates because it's unexpected it becomes a it becomes detected by you know network.
03:19:16
It's a unexpected coincidence. And unexpected. It's not a coincidence. It's an incidence.
03:19:30
It's almost unexpected incidents. It's an instance detector. Incidents and so it's detector. Instance.
03:19:49
Coincidence.
03:19:53
Instance.
03:19:57
This is interesting because.
03:20:03
Coincidence is. When you have a lot of a lot of things firing at the same time. A coincidence begets an instance. So coincidence is represented by an instance. Okay. And then the new instance. Becomes part of another coincidence. So it's so you have sequences of incidences. Big our coincidences.
03:20:45
Sequences of instances. Are coincidences.
03:20:53
Sequences of instances. Are.
03:21:02
Sequences are songs. Sequences of instances are songs. But the songs are. The songs are at the root coincidences. But they're also patterns in the coincidence. So coincidences of patterns. Become sequences coincidence of patterns become sequences and sequences become. Coincidence of patterns become sequences. Yeah coincidences of patterns, so the pattern is that it is the coincidence that is made up of coincidences.
03:21:53
Tactic coincidences. Detected coincidences a pattern is made up of detected coincidence, so all types of patterns are made up of protected coincidences. But those coincidences can be simultaneous or they can be sequential. Right simultaneous or sequential patterns. And so you can have a pattern that's recognized. That's that is temple and special so that means you could have a different temporal pattern like a texture.
03:22:32
Also I also come with a spatial pattern the temple and spatial patterns so that's like a four-dimensional movie right it's like where you see a character and you can tell it's the same character even though it's a different temporal pattern in each frame. You tell us if it's a it's a it's a um, that's a different character, but um.
03:22:54
It's a different different character it's a different shape in each frame, but you connect all the ships together and you're like all these all these pixels belong together, they're all part of the same character that's changing over time. Okay, so you're tracking the body and all the neurons they're all have dissolved similarities and there's all like they're all part of the same sequence right they're being recognized as part of the same sequence because there's a higher level narrow that's recognizing that all these lower level neurons are actually representing the same object.
03:23:29
Right, so where's the cell representation? Well the cell fresentation is like, Isn't two places. It's it's actually in two places but it's like when when all is like lymph place as far as the same time. It's like when the, The neuron that represents the pattern, that was detected. Is firing at the same time that.
03:24:03
The neurons are detected the pattern. Well in a sense it should be slightly right after I just like yeah this was a cat. So this is something that so this is the cat was represented by the low level neurons and then a higher upstream neuron higher upstream rods also recognized the cat.
03:24:23
Several of them recognized the cat. All right. And maybe they recognize. The calf from slightly different perspectives, right? Each one of them represented a different perspective on that cat.
03:24:44
Sort of like. But the perspective that you see is the perspective that's the most votes. So it's like your perspective is made of individual perspectives.
03:24:59
And they're voting on which ones are right.
03:25:06
So yeah, so it's like every it's a crowd it's fractal so it's like saying your whole factor room isn't is also matter of like fractal rooms.
03:25:20
It's actually saying your whole holographic room is being a holographic rooms.
03:25:37
Okay, so let's say that we have. Hodak. Every point in our deck is a pixel.
03:25:54
A volumetric pixel. So every point in the holiday is capable of representing a 3D space.
03:26:14
I'll follow you measure perfect every point in the heart attack is capable of representing a 3D space.
03:26:31
Okay. So. Every point in the brain is capable of representing a 3D space. And all the all the parts of the brain are capable of interpreting through to space. Every neuron has capable horizontally and 30 space. That represents other neurons so every neurons capable of representing other neurons or way of saying it's like, You're on network.
03:27:05
Like a neuron can represent manner of the fired specific pattern. Of neurons of fire parking represent nothing that nothing no it knows no nothing fired so either an earth represent. A specific pattern or not represent a specific pattern. In many because of neurons because neurons specific pattern could be very complex.
03:27:46
We're still talking like lines and edges there's a definite there's a definition right lifetime address. Just getting rubber string, you know something at a high level can be reduced to this hero one two, or three for each not even many neurons are measuring the zero one, two, three's.
03:28:11
And they all get I feel like the lower level representation. Was the detection. And the rendering.
03:28:25
Because they all want to know if they're going to fire again, right?
03:28:33
And so maybe. If if several of them fire. And you have the need of a whole bunch of neurons that fired when they all fired. They start to get they start to get received energy. So they start to get turned on and they're predicting all areas predicting at the whole thing is going to fire like you to hold a whole bunch of neurons the fire when holding fires and they're predicting that they're about to fire.
03:29:06
Say everything else is predicting that's about to fire say those things whatever you're on so every known as particular fire. I go all these fires all this we've got the sequence that goes through here. What we're going to have like every stage we have like oh we're all going to predict the firing is to happen so.
03:29:27
And then at some level that like sequence is. Reduced. The sequence of you know, zero, one, two, three is reduced. To zero one two, or three. In terms of like something else interpreting it so maybe if we have like if something fires but then nothing fires. Right? Oh what happens maybe it continues to pass down this part, can you just pass down and travel through the entire chance through the whole brain?
03:30:10
Right and it will fire it'll pass through transparently.
03:30:19
Well in this case of the cases the case of their own said it's also anywhere they actually reinter it so maybe they're all receiving the signal that it's receiving. It's causing them to respond. So they're sending so maybe they're sending something back. And they said that's electrical response. And it's causing it that one neuron that's not oscillating at the same rate to oscillate at the same rate.
03:30:52
And eventually become visible.
