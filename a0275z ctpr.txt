Micah's notes: Neurons transmit a phase signal from a synapse, and a coincidence of phase signals is what a dendrite is receptive to

dendrites have leaky membranes that create the requirement for coincident pattern detection, if the dendrite receives a single signal, but there isn't a coincidence, its membrane will leak the energy instead of firing. many con-current coincidences might fill up the neuron to the point that the soma burst event happens, and in a way that symbolizes that some percentage of the pattern that the synaptic arrangement on the dendritic side represents has been detected, it's like the neuron saying that there is an 80 percent pattern detection, with the percentage representing the neurons firing threshold whatever that is.
