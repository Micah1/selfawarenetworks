The question is, if you have a greatest sense, the question is, how do we translate the signals that are passing between these cells into the competition or reality? That you experience that you see here, feel a taste in touch. How do we translate the communication between cells and the brain into a computational pattern?

00:33

Is your reality? That's the goal of what my book sets us to do Mike. The goal of this book is to translate how cells how communication between cells. Computationally results in the reality experience. And so, we're going to take a walk through neuroscience, but also things that have been learned in history of brain, computer interfaces from external devices, to surgical surgically, implanted electrodes, electrode arrays Utah, raise DBS, deep brains stimulation and also many other different.

You won't catch this on your recording. I will only speak when other people are not within here. So God damn it. My fuck is a decision.

02:00

Okay.

02:08

Wow. You know what? That serves me, I did it that like there could actually be

02:21

You could actually be a collective entity that is sending a swarms of people. Every thought you thought you were thinking of like gang stalking, right? Thought you're you thinkative gangstalking, it could be a collective entity. But yeah, it's like you're never out right? Like, you never loved this. Always somebody who is watching and Here like the always like

It's like there. Brain is always trying to catch one more word, one more sound, right? Like, if each person could just collect one idea, then all of the people might collectively have that idea. And then somehow the collective entity, when crunched that data, and they would all share, like they would all begin to share that idea.

03:35

Somehow. All right. Maybe it's like literally gossip channels, right? But if there's like a gossip channel and that a lot of people are tuned into, where would I find this glass? Okay. Where would I find it? But maybe it's like, yeah, it's like, just a whole bunch of separate intro, like independent established, like city passive channels.
