(oscillat, field, graph, observer) GRID (SAN)

so when I look at a dishwasher my brain is rendering it in at least 3 scales if not also simulating it in infinite scales in tempo-spatial 3D grid like phase patterns.

the particle attraction to stable electromagnetic wave formation

as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation

A tonic Alpha oscillation might respond more to the sensory frequency expectations of day time, whereas Delta frequencies are slower and closer to the expected sensory frequences during the late night and early morning.

but perhaps the expectations of feet are going to be attracted to a different powerband that better scales its frequency patterns which ought to be different from 

The part of you that doesn't have control doesn't exist.

There is no passive observer, consciousness is like a snake propelling itself through the grass without arms. You are its story, but its most fundamental reality is that it is a kind of multi-dimensional electric, magnetic, acoustic, mechanically vibrational, four dimensional knowledge graph encoding in tempo-spatial phase pattern sequences, breathing awareness of its environment and itself.

It is reacting to the futures that it is predicting will happen and changing its shape to respond to that future.

If you see the world heading towards a cliff that ideas is going to influence your behavior in a major way.
