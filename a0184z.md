Thought of the day: if Einstein said that space creates time, and we are space within space then we create time in time?

Do you think that the space we take up within the space that Einstein is describing, are any different? Your thought reminds me of an incredibly interesting fact: our brains are actually able to slow down time during moments when we need the most time available! Individuals perception of slowing down of time, in moments of crisis, is not a perception at all. Maybe your thought of the day just became more interesting. I invite you to look up this wondeful and mind blowing fact. :-)

Spacetime is one thing, space doesn't create time, it is time, time is the fourth dimension of space.

Micah space-time are interdependent therefore one creates the possibility for the other to happen!

@brian, I'll have a thought about that when I finish work tonight.

If you watch starting at the 44 minute mark he talks about a new theory of how the brain does time. There is no clock inside, different regions of the neocortex experience time at faster or slower rates. The lower regions like V1 will experience time very fast while higher regions will experience time much more slowly. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48r-IeYOvG4&feature=youtube_gdata_player

it seems like if adrenaline shifted your conscious peak brainwave activity into the lower regions your sense of time would slow down

fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

I shall have to look up Brian's wonderful and mind blowing fact as time distortion is put down to perception and i'd be rather surprised if that wasn't the case.

Exactly. I thought he might have been joking but you never know....i've met plenty of people who believe the brain/mind can basically do anything (old school superstitious/non-evidence based thinking).

Not joking, Micah & Richard. It has been proven. It'll take me some time to pull those articles. However, I will look at what you posted. I sure hope your links are going to take me to credible literature. Mine will...once I get to them.

Yeah, their experimental methods reported in Plos One did not directly test the question, therefore that report cannot definitively negate my statement.

Brian Bauereis, you have a point in your first comment. Once I had a semi crash with the motorcycle.. I slipped at about 80 km per hour in a turn because of an oil stain and during those few seconds I had time to turn and look what the driver from behind was doing, turn my head towards the front side again and see what's coming, steer and break with my boots and hands too, while I was slipping on the wet tarmac and felt like absolutely nothing was wrong and in the same time calculate my next moves. Actually I felt like I had time for a coffee too during those about 3 to 4 seconds. After this moment passed, I felt the adrenaline kicking in and started to shake, but I was ok. And this is not the only time when time distortions appeared. The question is how do we control this?

I think like a scientist, not like a church cleric representing the imperial tyranny of state recognized science, so if I see scientific proof that the brain slows time itself, instead of it's own experience of time then I will switch beliefs. It doesn't matter to me if the source of the experiment came from an outsider working at the patent office whose name was Einstein and didn't happen to have any articles in Plos. :) Considering what I know about how physics works, including general relativity, it does seem more plausible to me that the brain is changing its own experience of time, not slowing down actual time.

However I would love to be proven wrong about that. It would challenge the laws of physics if the brain actually slowed down time. It would upend General Relativity

All of these links to real scientific studies are great, but the most profound to me is Hawkins explanation of how different regions of the mind have different experiences of time, and that the brain does not have a central uniting clock, its not even in sync with itself :) (see video posted above)
