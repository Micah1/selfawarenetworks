(oscillat, decoherence, synap) oscillation
Imagining that the neurons couple via the principles of oscillation, firing at the same time causes them to absorb each others timing, I think of the brain's oscillations as being clock like, even if one oscillation is permanently decoherent from another oscillation it is possible for their clocks to interact like gears, such that they will maintain their decoherence, but perhaps they will also share moments of coherence, such when firing does occassionally align (coherently) once in a long time before decoherence again. While writing this I am imagining two solar systems or two galaxies close enough to be affected by each other's gravitational pull, but not close enough to rip each other apart, and not close enough to merge. Another possibility could be that oscillatory alignment between two neurons that fired together is not just strengthened at the synaptic level, with synapses appearing and growing stronger to support connections inbetween those neurons, and synapses growing inbetween all the neurons inbetween those neurons.
