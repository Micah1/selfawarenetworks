(oscillat) for the human being state happens too fast for you to understand it as state

the finite state machine reality of the human brain is that all possible thoughts exist in the spectrum between .0002z - 600hz multiplied times the sensitivity of each neuron.

but imagine that it is just like the frames of your mind, except that between 0.002 and 600hz there is a lot of rangle for the oscillation based spectrum delta of the canvas of your conscious representation of reality in a perpectual loop of microscopic and macroscopic self updates. You're mind is being perpectually rebuilt in every moment in time.

you could write a movie script about a man who changes genetically in an involuntary way so his skin tone changes, and the shape of his face changes, and people assume different racial identities based on his appearance, and this movie would play with the minds of people watching to help them disconnect their minds from their physical attributes a little bit, and it might open their minds a little bit.
