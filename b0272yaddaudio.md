Millisecond Calcium Channels

00:00

So the flow of information on the brain at the 29.45 seconds mark. He says the cell is at rest. When cells at rest? So, let's actually start at the 1906 mark, okay? The presynaptic. Potassium modifies the action potential ~~amplitude~~ magnitude or action potential duration APD which determines the strength of this synaptic signal.

00:25

Including the amplitude of the postsynaptic response that leads to how many vesicles can be released for action potential, which is usually between zero and three. "I guess it could go to 5." But the average number is 2.6 when a cell is at rest it's at minus 55 millivolts or minus 40 millivolts and spike happens where it shoots way up.

00:49

It's gonna shoot the action potential. It's lighting a bunch of sodium in all this positive charges coming in and it's saying that a membrane versus basically shooting both up and then you have the voltage sensitive channels. So that's like the positive feedback loop. It gets positive. So it opens to the more sodium channels, they're both since sensitive to coding channels.

01:12

So as it gets through negative 40, it's like okay we can open. So it's like positive feedback loop. Now there's tons of sodium in and it's just shooting up up up. So it's going closer to zero and then ten twenty it goes up to positive 40 millivolts. But what happens there is you have these potassium channels these k channels that open and start doing the opposite and the reason why you're thinking to wait, this is positive or wouldn't that be more positive current yes?

01:48

When that be more positive current yes, except there's a gradient. And so now, While there's more sodium outside than neuron then there is inside the neuron. There's way more potassium inside the neuron than outside the neuron. So if you're going to open a potassium channel, the positive charge is going to go the other way and basically end up with the net negative charge.

02:11

It would be like a negative charges entering the cell. Although it's really positive charge leaving. So that potassium k current is re-polarizing the cell back to where it was. And it even overshoots a little bit and that's called the after hyperpolarization but. The timing of these things, come on are so synchronized.

02:44

They're so fast. It results in a spike that last less than a millisecond. So these potassium currents start shooting up and before they're even done shooting up. I said that backwards. The sodium occurrence the sodium currents starts shooting up the voltage of the cell and then even before it's done shooting up the potassium currents have turned on.

03:13

And started shooting it back down. To the point where you just get this super quick spike and then it goes back down. So now the result of the spike spike transmits down the axon, which at the very tip is where the vesicles are.

03:36

And at the very tip of the axon, you have these calcium channels. And calcium is something that needs to come into. Some calcium is one of the things that where there's like a gazillion times more more outside the cell than inside the cell. So for calcium channel opens the force.

03:59

That shoving the calcium in the cell is just the strongest you're going to get. But these calcium channels on the very tip of the axon. They are voltage gated and they're not going to open unless it's a super positive charge now it's a super positive charge yeah.

04:33

They only opened during a spike. They only open if it's a positive voltage so the calcium channels only open during a spike so that split second that's less than one millisecond of a spike that finally reaches the tip. The tip of the axon. Gets this calcium to come in and when the calcium comes in it binds to something called synaptotagmin. Synaptotagmin is what the Calcium binds to.

04:59

# Synaptotagmin is what the Calcium ions bind to in order to facilitate greater neurotransmitter release.
"Synaptotagmin-7 Enhances Facilitation of Cav2.1 Calcium Channels"
"In addition to Cav2.1 channels, the high-sensitivity Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) has been proposed to support short-term synaptic facilitation by binding residual Ca2+ in the nerve terminal following the action potential, thereby increasing interaction with the SNARE complex and enhancing Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Jackman et al., 2016)"

# "The calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 is required for synaptic facilitation"
"It has been known for more than 70 years that synaptic strength is dynamically regulated in a use-dependent manner. At synapses with a low initial release probability, closely spaced presynaptic action potentials can result in facilitation, a short-term form of enhancement in which each subsequent action potential evokes greater neurotransmitter release."

# Rizo-Rey says his goal is to understand the specific physics of how the activation process of thought occurs in much more detail. 
"Writing in eLife in June 2022, Rizo-Rey and collaborators presented all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of synaptic vesicle fusion, providing a glimpse at the primed state. The research shows a system where several specialized proteins are “spring-loaded,” awaiting only the delivery of calcium ions to trigger fusion."

"“It’s ready to release, but it doesn’t,” he explained. “Why doesn’t it? It’s waiting for the calcium signal. Neurotransmission is about controlling fusion. You want to have the system ready to fuse, so when calcium comes in, it can happen very fast, but it’s not fusing yet.”"

The flood of calcium into the cell basically shoves the vesicle into the membrane allowing the neurotransmitters to spit out into the synapse. And that's the basis of neural communication in a chemical synapse.

If you mess with the potassium so that the, So that a split one second millisecond mellow voltage that reached the end of the axon allows the calcium to come on now, if you mess with the potassium (inhibiting or exiting potassium channels) that means the Soma burst action potential doesn't turn off (as fast or as slow) as it would normal time (at tonic firing rates) that it might take shut off, and so what you end up doing (in some instances) spreading (or reducing) the duration of the action potential. Instead of just being one millisecond it's longer so maybe two or three milliseconds not sure, (there was a suggestion that) it could last as long as ten milliseconds.

06:00

Or maybe a lot shorter than that, maybe one, two, or three milliseconds.
It's going one millisecond to two milliseconds or five milliseconds.
So this is just the amount of time that it stays very positive when the calcium will be let in. (with more calcium let in more vesicles are pushed out.)
