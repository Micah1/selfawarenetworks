Fires Neuron Oscillation

00:00

There's this paper called the zero point field and I talk about how the brain's how conscious could be etched inside of zero point field, and it's interesting idea. But what what in the brain could be causing a zero point field? And then and I thought well actually maybe what if a what's the tonic oscillation of an oscillator circuit.

00:31

And and a brain, I've also this trophy circuits of oscillations of synchronicity between multiple circuits or synchronicity between the neurons and it's any given circuit or an alternating oscillation, right? Like what is it about? The the because there's many different levels of oscillation that interact with other oscillations. Like superchargers, nucleus is 20 million is super key as matic.

00:59

Nucleus is 20 million neurons that oscillate towards the center of your brain and this these oscillations, they don't all combine me but they have if force that's applied to one another

01:24

You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.

01:55

That would be how the camera's at content. Common consciousness was worked, worked out. And then whatever, the zero point field would be detected as any as any neuron. That fires basically is going to is going to.

02:20

Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?

02:45

Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

03:09

That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.

03:35

That is specific rate and there's there's different rate options like I could fire it. You know, anywhere between 0.02 hurts and 600 hertz, right? So good fire any of those ranges. But but actually it when I guess in theory yeah depending on what? But it has this. It's not like this is like when I think of yeah is that once it once a neuron gets set doing a certain thing it's like learned a pattern and it just sort of sticks to that pattern and doesn't sort of like

04:15

It's kind of like having like specialized brain areas right where they get used to processing a certain kind of signal so that you have the brain, modifying its circuitry and let's see fair modifying his service review.

04:49

But it's it's modifying the let's say it's modifying with the zero point field represents perhaps. Yeah that makes sense but not no no wait okay well yeah that could be part of it. It's really complicated but it's also changing. What the? No, no, I think it is really more about the etching.

05:16

It's more about because the etching the action, okay? So the etching of a neuron is the configuration of a neuron, the configuration that a neuron takes, that represents a certain pattern that it has been learned, okay? So, it learns new patterns, and it forms new branches. When new patterns, when it learns new patterns.

05:38

So, over time it learns more complex patterns. But to sort of like map, all the complexities of all of its patterns. It grows more dendritic branches.

05:52

Wow.

06:00

And earlier I thought. Well what if the what if I give the book out for free like shareware but if you want to if you want to own an authentic copy of this book, then you can buy an NFT which referring which will certify that the copy that you own, which is identical to every other copy is a copy that you actually bought and paid for.

06:21

Like, that's what you'll get. Is you get a the receipt proves that you were willing to trade money for this book and then whether you like are embarrassed by that or like really well, just really like proud. What if you're just really proud to be a reader and owner of this book?

06:41

That's that's what I'm going for is. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, if you read this book, like, you're I know you're badass because this is buck is about all the cool stuff. So, anyway, I would sell the book by, you know, they making any they buy an entity of the book, which is proof that book at the copy.

07:02

They own is something paid for, which they can tell honor to own a copy of the first edition and that will only be like 1,000 copies of the first edition. So, they're just gonna go up and value.

07:20

And yeah, that's it. The own one of the first 1000 copies of the first edition and they're just gonna go up and value. So yeah. I'm you train different areas of your brain to oscillate with different patterns because they take up different regions of space and there is a fired together.

07:51

They have a they have a tonic pattern that's represented, okay. And that is distinct enough to the rest of the large scale. Atomic firing patterns. So that that becomes like, they all know who fired when someone fires because they've all mapped for themselves when they're going to fire after that neuron fires and other neurons fire, they're all like predicting like, okay.

08:24

Well, all these people fire a lot together, which means that I'm gonna fire with them, right? That's an oscillation, they all fire together. So I'm listening to the whole heard. I know what everyone's gonna fire. Oh, then there's like this. Really this verse that causes like and neuron to expand.

08:40

Okay. And that's the creates like a sonic way of and now all the neurons feel that first. They also that's on a wave. It feels it's own action potential because the action potential is like this disruptive, seismic event like an earthquake, but it's like an earthquake where the earth itself is sensitive to the change that was made because that affects the distribution.

09:08

The physical shape of the neuron. And now, we're creating a new protein synthesis changing a shape, right? The prep, the the protein structure contains the shape of memory and when the protein structure is,

09:34

When the protein structure is inhibited, when it's like, what a memory is retrieved, right? That's shape and sort of like it's it's it's rebuilt. It's built based upon the predictions I guess. So, the shape is like a long-term memory. It's like this. The protein structure is like the dendrites building a new, adding a new protein to the structure to support the changes and in the dendritic branching.

10:06

So, the new branches, the new dendritic branching happens, and that means that the, the shape of the neuron has changed. And now it's representing a different pattern. And what it's representing is the shake of the dendritic branching in long term. There's a long-term memory and so what'll happen is that I listen for less than a fire.

10:27

And it's prediction is the way to deny its are connected based upon where the energy pulls is going to come. From energy is like where the food is kind of. Oh, the food is like, okay, so imagine your pacman right? And up ahead is like the glowing ball and you're moving towards the glowing ball, right?

10:45

That's what you want to eat it. You're gonna eat out the dots. You need to big glowing ball to Pac-Man is like, okay? I'm moving in the direction of the light. It's moving towards the energy, but I just means it's like moving on and accessing the access is not, it's like, not Pac-Man's direction, but it's like, the, it's like the direction as indicated by the connections that wind in Android has to other neurons.

11:11

So that during it and it's a neuron, it's under, you know, network has to point every possible direction. Like, you know, both up and down, left and right back and forth. Six degrees of of, it's it's a six axis sort of system where you know, every every direction is very direction.

11:37

And so, then try. It's our constantly. Like the long-term memory is like growth.
