# Cognitive Augmentation, Treatment of Mental Health Issues

The articles discuss various approaches to treating mental health issues and enhancing cognitive function. Participants explore the use of psychedelics and cognitive-behavioral therapy for mental health treatment. They also delve into the mechanisms of SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and the potential for brain-computer interfaces to assist in cognitive-behavioral therapy. The benefits of combining fNIRS and EEG technologies in treating depression are also highlighted.

The focus shifts to cognitive augmentation technologies, specifically transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Both are non-invasive methods with the potential to treat depression and enhance cognitive abilities. Photomodulation, another non-invasive method, uses infrared light to stimulate blood flow, potentially improving cognitive function and treating conditions like Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury. The articles emphasize the need for more research to understand the long-term effects and mechanisms of these technologies. Participants express enthusiasm for the possibilities of human enhancement through advancements in neuroscience and technology, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges. The importance of early detection and intervention, especially in the context of an aging population and prevalent cognitive impairments, is also emphasized.

1. The discussion centers around neurophysics, brain waves, brain oscillations, neural circuits, nerve gear (brain-computer interfaces), and artificial intelligence.

2. The article discusses the use of EEG in virtual reality and augmented reality experiences.

3. Combining EEG with Fnirs (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) can provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain activity and cognitive processes.

# Pathogen Detection Using Electromagnetic Signatures

The discussion is about various advancements and possibilities in the field of pathogen detection and biological material modification using electromagnetic frequencies. One key development is the "Pathometer," a compact device that employs an existing radar sensor called the "Soli" sensor. This technology aims to quickly and accurately detect pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their unique electromagnetic signatures. The device has the potential to revolutionize public health responses by offering fast, low-cost, and non-invasive detection methods. Ongoing research aims to refine the technology and expand its applications, including the potential to target specific pathogens and customize treatments.

Another article explores a device that can not only detect but potentially modify biological materials such as DNA and RNA. The device uses spectroscopy for detection and identification of pathogens. While the current focus is on detection, future possibilities may include the modification of individual nucleotides in DNA sequences. The article emphasizes the importance of expert evaluation, privacy concerns, and the need for regulation and coordination with public health agencies. Advances in materials like gallium nitride and gallium arsenide are also mentioned, contributing to the device's expanded capabilities.

Additionally, the articles touch on broader scientific concepts like signal encoding and detection for inferring entanglement responses between individuals, the role of electromagnetic and biochemical factors in information transmission, and the potential influence of cosmic microwave background radiation on the emergence of life. The need for further research and regulation, especially considering risks like bioterrorism, is emphasized.

17. The idea of modifying DNA and RNA sequences using the device is discussed.

18. The concept of gradients and electromagnetic fields as a means of changing molecules is highlighted.

# Transcribed with Whisper

I saw a lot of topics there. Okay, can we just start with something first?

And I can see if I know anything about it. Yeah, go ahead. So I mean, so yeah, so basically,

to define a broad scope, so neurophysics is about brain waves and brain oscillations and

neural circuits. And then the other two topics are, you know, nerve gear, which is like brain

computer interfaces. And that's closely related, right? And then we have artificial intelligence,

which, you know, the topics related to artificial intelligence are pretty broad. So I mean, I sort

of like, I have like this mental model, which is like all these different how all these different

topics are connected. But, but yeah, anything inside that, inside that realm, there's a lot

of different ways you could be the conversation here. So what kind of project have you done

previously on anything related to this topic? Okay, so, so I had a, in 2012, I opened a

neurofeedback salon, an alternative biofeedback business in San Francisco. And, and that involved

bringing, having EEG drive light and sound effects with, with goggles and with LED glasses and

headphones. And then in 2018, I brought, I led a project where we co wrote an application that

brought EEG into WebVR or into virtual reality. That sounds pretty interesting, I think. But

VR is a really quite hot topic right now. I've got some friends, they, one of them are working

the medivists. I think it's a VR company working the biomedical research, not just research,

biomedical, just work with the hospitals to try to visualize the people's organs in VR.

So I just want to know if there's anything about VR that you can apply artificial

intelligence on?

Um, I mean, well, in fact, so I actually wrote an article about this just recently, not like,

I think a month ago. And you can see, I mean, let me pull up the article. So if you go to

svgn.io, okay, that's, svgn is short for Silicon Valley Global News. And then look at the article

on top, it says, where web AR wearable digital fashion, NFT, digital shape completion, DNN

animations, gas synthesis and sensors. So that article, I didn't intend to bring it up in the

conversation today, but it basically talks all about how we can, we're already using

neural networks with VR and AR.

Well, I see. Yeah, I would check that out later.

So is there anything about a 3D construction? Yeah, yeah, I just saw you. So exactly how did

you do that? I, maybe I soon need time to read the article, but yeah, I'm not sure if you're

willing to talk about it right here.

Yeah, I mean, so what is your question? How did we do what?

A 3D construction using artificial intelligence, any kind of AI techniques.

And so you're asking me about the project from 2018 that did not involve the use of neural

networks. Yeah, that's different. So you didn't use artificial intelligence in that?

Not in that project, no. Oh, I see. So I don't yet have a project that I can refer to that

combined artificial intelligence with brain computer interfaces. In terms of artificial

intelligence, I've used, that involves using basically like body tracking and body tracking

is, but body tracking that's not connected to a brain computer interface technology,

but body tracking in the context of AR and VR applications.

I see. It's not that it like so like eventually I'm going to connect the brain computer interface

with the body tracking with the VR in-air application. That's just one more step ahead of

where I'm at at the moment. So that's a future project. That sounds pretty interesting. So

yeah, I think we have talked about the brain computer interface last time in the journal

class maybe. Yeah, and I think you can project that to people's brain directly, right?

I didn't, I missed the last part of your sentence. Would you say it again?

No, I mean, just the last time, I mean, I think

Ariane, is that his name? He held a journal club. I mean,

talking about the brain computer interface. I think that paper I mentioned the last time.

It's Andrew Jones on paper about translating people's thoughts into voices, into taxes,

and you want a project that kind of playing into people's brain directly using VR,

like a 3D projection. I'm sorry, I didn't know much about it.

I'm not remembering the exact conversation. Oh, I see. What was the name of the paper? Maybe I

can look it up. I think it's in Depeche's Twitter. I think it tweeted about it once.

It's Andrew Jones on a lab in UCSF, and they're working on the kind of brain computer interfaces.

That sounds familiar. I still want to see if I can find the name of the paper.

It's Dekei's Twitter. Let me see if I can find it real quick. Yeah, yeah.

Okay, so what I'll do is I'll search for Depeche and Andrew Jones at the same time.

I'm sorry, I didn't know much about VR. I just hear people talking about it. I think it's a

special expertise. It's super interesting, but also kind of

uncomplicated for me right now. I never do that before.

Well, congratulations. It's always the first time. Also, I don't want to dominate the whole

conversation. I want to make sure to invite Jay Hill and Brandon, and everyone else in the room,

if you want to come up and speak, you may just indicate somehow.

Go ahead and applause myself while I'm searching for this paper.

Yeah, what's going on, Micah? Hey, Dore. Got a question. I'm interested in

the EGVR device and the process. I would like to actually

experiment with that in some sense or fashion. I'm sorry, this was going on in the background.

So, yeah, I'm interested in the EGVR. Let me give you one second.

Nice. Yeah, Micah, I'm just happy to hang out, listen in, and contribute if I can if there's

some neurobiology kind of basic science-like questions. Happy to chime in.

Awesome. Very cool. I will have some questions myself later on. I guess we're just getting

warmed up right now. As you can tell, my voice is vibrating a little bit because I'm

standing on a platform just circulating my blood to wake up my brain. I will

have a lot more questions in a little bit.

Oh, we're waiting, Bray. I'm sorry, I'm driving. I can't look at your

profile or anything. Do you work on anything neuro-related or AR-related?

Are you talking? Are you asking me? Yes, sorry.

I never done anything AR-related. So, my studying during PhD is basically using

AI technology to biomedical researches and recently I'm working on something using

the voice waveform to detect Parkinson's disease. I don't think it's very related to VR,

but I'm quite interested in that. I have a question. Maybe it's kind of stupid because

I didn't know this before. How accurate do you think this brain-computer interface

has that? I could perform based on or compared with a traditional mouse or traditional

basically a traditional way of input on a computer. So, exactly how did you guys do that?

That sounds like a question for Mike, I think. I work mostly in animal models of various nervous

system diseases, mostly spinal cord injury and, again, rodent models. So, very basic science.

How does neuron A connect to neuron B and how does a drug or a therapy modify that connectivity?

So, that may be a question more for Micah. Okay, would you refresh your questions? Sorry,

I was a little distracted. Ray? Oh, I just wondered how accurate is that kind of

has that using EEG compared to traditional way of input? Compared to traditional what? Inputs?

Yeah, basically like a mouse. So, I'm not sure how advanced this technology has already become.

I see. So, trying to compare EEG to a mouse is really a hard comparison to make. It's like

comparing apples and oranges. So, trying to, for example, use your brain to move a cursor

with EEG is really far-fetched. There's something you can look up called brain gate,

which was electrodes implanted inside the skull above the motor cortex. And that was one of the

best demonstrations of using your brain to control a cursor on a screen. And then more recently,

we've seen this company called Neuralink use another form of surgically implanting electrodes

into the brain to also allow a monkey. There was this video where they, it was very popular on

YouTube just a little while ago where they showed a monkey controlling a cursor with its brain,

but EEG is not quite capable of doing that very well. I mean, I guess there's, I guess people are,

yeah. Yeah, I see. So, EEG compared to this invasive. So, I can basically assume that's the

most invasive, the very invasive, invasive method like a brain gate that they could 100%

reflect the people's well. But EEG may not be as accurate as the people, as the, as the

those invasive methods, right? So, there could be some errors, but how much is that? And is that

already not sure enough to be bringing on our kids? So, I mean, I, you brought, you brought

too many questions in there at the same time. So, I'm just like, okay, let's maybe, let's,

let me try to answer one thing. I think one part of the answer you're looking for,

I don't think that in the short term, we're going to see EEG being rolled out as a product to control

your mouse on your screen. It's just, I don't think it's going to, it's likely that we're going to get

there, you know, with EEG anytime soon. Maybe, maybe it's more likely that maybe in the future,

we'll have some sort of system that combines eye tracking with EEG or something for user interface.

But that's, that might happen. You know, there's, there's, there's a Lucid VR headset, which is

pretty cool. And that combines eye tracking with, with EEG. And there's, there's, there's the next

mind device. And I mean, but that's, it's not just EEG, but it's not just EEG by itself. So,

maybe that, maybe that helps. And welcome also, Garrett. You may, yeah.

Yeah. Hey, everyone. I am currently in the engineer previous life. I was a neuroscientist

working at Stanford. I had rotations through a pain, a pain anesthesia lab, working in

systems neuroscience. Then I worked in a essentially a reward. What was it essentially?

A decision making and addiction lab. That was a really fascinating lab. And then most of my time

was spent in a dementia aging traumatic brain injury lab. So I've got a little bit of experience

working in a couple in both clinical research, medical research and in neuroimaging. So Ray,

I'll ray in a way in a little bit on this question. EEG is just a, is, I don't, of course,

I'm coming in the middle of this. I just got here just a few minutes ago. EEG is just,

is really kind of not a great one for spatial resolution. And because it gets a lot of,

it gets a lot of, it combines a lot of signals from multiple parts of the brain. So essentially,

each part of the brain sends out a different, its own signal, right? And then the thing is,

is that by the time it gets to an EEG sensor is that they'll all get added, added together. So the

thing is, though, is that that's great if you have maybe a flat or you have a fixed number of nodes

in your signaling one sensor. But our brain is essentially an organ that's been curved in on

itself. And not to mention you have multiple neurological nodes as you probably were aware

of different, different these neurological clusters that activate together. So then even

then you may have certain circuits that may operate separately from those clusters. So you

have all that going on and all that's hitting a EEG sensor at any given time. So it's very

noisy, at least from that perspective, from if you're looking at particular sorts of

circuits or processes, or if you're just looking to see trying to distinguish a right hand versus

left hand movement, it can be quite, it can be very challenging from a signal to noise type of

processing perspective. That's the reason why Neuralink and that ilk are, as far as the direct

brain brain implant brain sensor type interfaces are are you when you have much better way of

doing it, because you're getting that contact neural neural attenuation free sensors that will

be able to directly read the type of neural patterns that are coming off of the brain. And

then someday, of course, actually respond back with meaningful patterns that the brain will

be able to actually understand. So in long run, the Neuralink type brain implants and will be

much more, not just more temporally and spatially more sensitive, but also being able to provide

a way of feedback. EEG is kind of like, there's not much more we can do with that unless someone

comes with a breakthrough in signal processing, and some very advanced mathematics that we

haven't seen yet. And even then, I would really love to see if that mathematics comes along,

how much processing would take to actually get that done in real time. Because something as

straightforward as, well, I don't know, a 16 point EEG net? Boy, I mean, that's still a lot

of data to go through when you were sampling over a 30 minute task. So it's a lot, I mean,

that's it's just, it's, and you're asking a computer to do that in real time, to control

a computer. And especially to a high degree of precision. So yeah, it's one of those things.

It's so as far as market market readiness, like, yeah, I mean, I don't think so.

So some people might disagree, but I wouldn't put, if I were an investor, I wouldn't put my money on

it. I would don't even think it's 15 years out. I think neural link is possibly 15 years now,

but I don't think EEG is 15 years out. No, I'm done talking. Okay, thank you, Garrett.

Just make me realize this really like the outer carbon coming to life. And I just noticed that

Elon Musk invested in his neural neural link project. And yeah, and do you guys have other

things to talk about like David? Do you have anything to talk about? And Sharina, just notice

you're here. I'm just getting back home at the moment. So a bit of background noise. So I'll

just listen for the moment and I'll say something as soon as I'm away from the noise.

This is Sharina and I am wondering what we're talking about for oscillations in circuits.

So we've just been talking about EEG and Ray's been asking what are the

current capabilities of EEG? That was the question.

And we were comparing it to neural link. It's like, which one, if we're talking about

go to, which one's as far as go to market ready? And I was like, well, none of the, yeah, so we

were just in talking about that, add integrations to that and spatial temporal resolution stuff.

Okay, have you talked about combinations of FNIRs and EEG technology taken together?

We have not, but actually that was what I was thinking about mentioning that, but please go ahead.

Yeah, the nice thing about the combination of these two technologies is that FNIRs,

it will have good spatial resolution, but EEG has really good temporal resolution.

So taken together, a person can triangulate these signals to determine

or about what is going on in the brain at a good temporal spatial resolution.

And perhaps this can be used for various interfaces and controls of things like drones,

which has been published about by some group that I don't quite remember right now.

There are more potentials as well, such as monitoring brain signals and seeing how they

may change over time in different behavioral states and characterizing, okay, what is really going on

for different whole under brain states as well. Welcome to...

Hey, happy Friday from Austin, Texas. How y'all doing?

Doing great. How you doing?

Yeah, super blessed. I mean, I just got a ping to join this room and it seems super

interesting. So I decided to accept. Thank you so much for the invitation.

Right on. So I think of it as a popcorn style room where these are a bunch of topics that I

think we all like and then people can ask any question or share any subtopic and or anything

on the top on one of these topics that they find interesting.

I mean, so we were just talking about FNIRs and the infrared, I mean, infrared technology,

infrared sensors are very mature. EEG is very mature. You combine them together and

and yeah, I actually agree with Sherena that there are a lot of potential use cases for combining both

in order to get, pull out very meaningful signals from the brain and getting an idea like, okay,

left brain, right brain, or maybe just even motor cortex, which essentially let move your left,

as someone's visualizing, moving their left and right hand and seeing what are the activation

substrates thereof and getting some sort of meaningful signal out of that and building

some sort of interface out of it. There's definitely potential there.

I wonder what is a good paper because because I'm, Sherena mentioned like you can do triangulation

between the FNIRs and the EEG. I would like to read more about that specifically. That's cool.

It's very cool.

But I'll just, I'll just Google stuff. If anyone knows about a paper, like.

Yeah, now off the top of my head, Sherena, do you have one off the top of your head?

I have one off the top of my, my internet. Okay, third one in frontiers and neurobotics, hybrid

EEG, FNIRs based eight commands decoding for brain, computer interface, application and quadcopter

control. And so they, they are able to use both of these signals to control a quadcopter. And the

fact that there is both EEG and FNIRs, it allows for more different kinds of commands

that can be sent to the quadcopter. This is very nice because, okay, if a person can control a

quadcopter with their brain, then what does this mean for the future of prosthetics? Can prosthetics

be made less invasive, but more accurate? That would be really a wonderful thing if less brain

surgery was needed in order for things to, to be moved in ways that people want. And I know that

Adam Askarian and Ramin Saltzanoda, I believe that's how to pronounce his name. Yeah, they are

trying to create brain pulse, which is a company that combines FNIRs and EEGs together. There are

a few other companies that do this as well, including what is it called? Colonel? Colonel might be

doing it. I don't know if they are, for sure. Oh yes, Neuroelectrics. They have a system that

combines FNIRs, EEG, and also some custom stimulation protocols. Oh, very cool. I didn't

even know about these companies. Thank you. I mean, I think I've heard of brain pulse before,

but I'm this one in particular, Neuroelectrics. I hadn't heard this one, so very, very thankful.

Yeah, Neuroelectrics has been around for a while, and they have some pretty good stuff.

As for brain pulse, they are still forming their team and trying to have a great neuroscientist

and a great engineer, I believe, as they develop their technology. But what they have so far is

something that can monitor FNIRs and EEG at the same time, but this is for the frontal lobe.

As for Neuroelectrics, their system, it goes all over the head, so it gets other lobes besides

the frontal lobe as well. While I was muted, I'm also looking up kernel to see if I can

confirm real quick, just on the internet, if it does say specifically combining EEG with FNIRs.

I thought they were, but maybe I need to confirm that. Hang on. Anyway, welcome everyone.

If you have any interest on any of these topics, questions, or exciting things you've heard recently,

feel welcome to speak up popcorn style.

So, something about kernel, I mean, I've actually heard that they're more secretive

than NeuroLink in regards to what their development path or what sort of technologies

they're using for brain and computer interface. Those are people that or who have interviewed

for them. So, if you find something, do let us know. Do let me know. I'd be really interested as

well. But I would also be very surprised to dig up anything on the internet because they're

more type-lit than NeuroLink. Well, at some point, both companies were really,

you could only find a basic page with no information on them, but both companies have

come out with lots of announcements. I'm looking at lots of stuff right now.

Yeah, but the only thing I would say about NeuroLink is that they were more clear about a

direct brain implant type interface because of the people they were hiring. The people who had

joined them in the last several years were definitely like tissue, like material specialists,

and some other very, very specialized people who had done biomedical circuitry type of stuff before.

That's the reason why I had pointed that out. Nothing usually would never have to do that unless

you went into, you had some really weird interest in cybernetics. So, and or you would want to do

something what's called deep brain stimulation, like put electric probes and electrically stimulate

parts of the brain and actually make biomedical implants out of that. So, it's a very, it's such

a highly specialized area that, you know, it's the type of people that join them and hire them or

just you know who they are within the field. I wouldn't say anybody knows of the hiring,

but they just, they make it, it's notable when they get actually get hired and they continue

doing work. Oh, I found, I think I found it. So, there's a, there's, it's called, the title is

Kernel Flow, a high channel count scalable TD-F nearest system. And it says Kernel Flow is a TD

NIRS system that has been designed, but it includes an eight channel electroencephalography. So,

it includes EEG. And yeah, but whether they're using that or not, I'm not sure. I would think so.

There's also the question of, okay, if they're using this, then what are they using it for?

I know that Kernel has a collaboration with Cybin, which gets me wondering, okay,

given that psychedelics, they largely operate on cortical neurons

by the 5-ht2a receptor, this allows us to, well, it would allow them to monitor cortical activity

with these technologies and to determine maybe more things about how the brain operates under

different psychedelic states or different doses of psychedelics, which is an emerging field of

research, despite psychedelics having been around for a while, it takes to regulations and changes

over time. Go ahead, sorry, I'll mute. Okay, so as Farina just brought up, that's about,

and I just wonder, and does anything that this have anything related to some psychological

treatment like depression? Do you guys know anything about that?

I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? What are your regards to treatment of depression?

So Shimano just mentioned that the application of such instruments could be used for monitoring

the psychedelic states, so I just wonder, does anything already gone through the FDA's

improvements where that's such as the treatment for depression or so?

Okay, yeah, there is one. It's called transcranium magnetic stimulation. It's used for the treatment

of severe and persistent major depressive disorder that is approved for under the FDA that, and

that is the one I know of that has been cleared for use. Essentially, it's stimulating

areas like the dorsolato prefrontal cortex and can't remember what else. It's been a while since

I've done, but to the protocols. Yeah, Sharina, do you remember the protocols for that one?

Oh, not for this one. I was going to answer Ray's question about

psilocybin for FDA approval. Yes, it's been approved, and yes, there have been clinical

trials from various places, including Johns Hopkins about this for depression.

Okay, awesome. That's excellent. That's really cool. So we got TMS, so that's two ways of

going about it. So they are using magnetic coils to stimulate parts of the brain,

and they're using psychedelics psilocybin in order to see if it helps people with

depression. But as Ray, as you might well know, there are a couple different types of depression

comes in different types of forms, and of course, it comes along with the bipolar variety as well.

So it's not that these treatments aren't clear for every version or every type of

depression. So that's the, that's the boilerplate caveat.

But if you do wonder how psychedelics differ from traditional

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are often used for depression treatment,

well, they operate on different parts of the brain. Whereas selective serotonin reuptake

inhibitors, they tend to be closer to the mid brain in terms of where they are activating.

But psychedelics, they operate more on the cortex because of the certain receptors that

exist there. So there are two different kinds of treatments that work on different areas of the

brain. And so they will function somewhat differently. One thing that is notable about

psychedelics is that they take a lot less time to become effective. So a small dose of a psychedelic

may lead to a person being very well treated very quickly, whereas selective serotonin reuptake

inhibitors, they take a while for them to work. And that's why psilocybin is considered a breakthrough

therapy according to the FDA for severe depression. Yeah, I'm actually pretty interested in that. I

know that SSRI basically is the, I like the front line treatment right now. And maybe psychedelic

is, when I was undergraduate, I think they told me that it's not the first choice, but yeah,

it's for some occasions. But I'm more interested in this kind of headset really helps the cognitive

behavior treatments like CBT. So I think, I personally think CBT is the most effective for

for for depression treatment. So do you guys have any ideas about that? Because I personally have

gone through CBT and I think it's pretty successful treatment compared to any drugs.

So you're, are you, I guess I don't understand the question. Are you comparing CBT to medications in

general or are you comparing therapeutic CBT among therapies? I mean, I mean, the brain,

the brain computer interfaces, I just wonder if this will help CBT because I know that for

depression treatments, for some simple tasks, the the headset can help monitor if the drug

has gone successfully for the brain in some controlling depression state. But CBT, I think

it's something can solve from the roots, but CBT is also very, very expensive and also in its

long run for treatments, right? Actually, there have been some studies, TMS, because transcranium

in the extreme has been around for a while. There have been studies that have done CBT and TMS

treatment together and have shown a beneficial effect using both. So there has been that,

psilocybin, I will have to defer to Sharina if they've started doing trials of psilocybin with

a traditional CBT therapy. So Sharina, if you can, if you have a thought, let me know.

My thought about this is that I don't know. The studies that are being done nowadays, the good

thing about them is that they're very, very, very controlled. By that, I mean that usually

what happens is that a person goes over to Johns Hopkins or Imperial College, London,

or another place where they have a center that is devoted to the study of psychedelic medicine

and more consciousness. And the person, they have to go into a room and to undergo a very

certain protocol where they are asked to usually reflect inwards. So focusing their attention

inwards, usually with something to cover their eyes, often on some sort of comfortable couch

or something like that, as they are given a psychedelic or a placebo. And so there are

these randomized control trials. I do not know whether this has ever been done in conjunction

with CBT as well. But that is what I know is being done.

So I guess, I don't know, this is kind of, this kind of made, this is a little bit,

so I don't, this is an area that I don't know very much about, but I wonder why. So I guess,

I guess the main reason that SSRIs are treating the brain differently from LSD, DMT, and psilocybin

is because of the receptors that they tend to target. Like the psychoactives are targeting the

5-HT2A receptor and then SSRIs are targeting some other receptors. Is that how it works?

Yes, exactly. The SSRIs are essentially are slowing down, are inhibiting the reuptake

of serotonin, which is one of the neurotransmitters that's thought to play in the role of mood.

So it's a very, you're right, it's a very different receptor, different neurochemicals,

different pathways. But one thing about all that should be said about any drug pharmacological

or any drug is that when it affects the brain, affects the whole brain. And even though certain

pathways in the brain, like whether for hallucinary experiences or depression, they seem to be

focused or only on certain network and certain pathways. So it does, anyway, so the main thing

is is that, yes, it does affect, they do affect different circuits, different receptors in the

whole brain, but in the whole brain, not in different, not in a specific region.

So I mean, I guess there's like 14 different serotonin receptors, but or more. But is it like

so is an SRI, like so DMT and the psychoactives, these are like, what is it called agonists,

serotonin agonists, receptor agonists. And but so is SSRI, but is it right? Are SSRIs also agonists

for serotonin receptor? No, no, SSRIs are different. They are what's reuptake inhibitors. So they work

by slow. So what happens with serotonin, once it's released from the nerve, from the nerve,

from the cell is that they're usually, once it's lashed on the receptor, and then it's

and then it's in back in the synapse or the synactic gap, it gets reuptake and reabsorbed.

Now, what the reuptake inhibitor does is that it slows it down or it prevents it from being

reabsorbed. So there's more inside this, inside the synaptic gap. And Serena, of course,

can correct me if I'm wrong in the terminology, because I'm a little tired tonight.

But essentially, it is, but by having more serotonin in the, in that, so by slowing down

on the reuptake, it then there's more serotonin present in there versus the agonists effectively

increase the amount of serotonin that's produced, that is released by the nerve cells in period.

And it would not slow down the amount that's reuptake by either cell, by the, by the scent,

by the releasing or the receiving cell. Okay. So my follow up question is,

so what, so what I heard is that, is that the, in the case of DMT or basically serotonin agonists,

receptor agonists, that, that the effect on their oscillations is going to be, is probably going to

be like, either like the excitement of, of, of oscillations, or, or maybe perhaps the increase

in inhibitions, if, yeah. And, but so by contrast, what is the effect of, of the SSRIs? Are we,

are we, in general, are we talking about more excitement in part of the brain or more, or,

or, or slow down to the oscillations of the brain?

That's a good question. I'm sure there's actually some very deep neurosurgery papers that are done

on this. I'll speak only of the SSRIs because I've done more research on that, is that the

general thinking is that it increased, is if you think of that there's a potentiation threshold

for a nerve to fire, it has to reach, so in order to reach it, you have to have a build-up

of neurotransmitters to get to that level. So by introducing the reuptake inhibitor,

let's say you get 50% upway, halfway up, because the serotonin just doesn't have anywhere to go.

It doesn't get re-updated, it's just sitting around. So then the other sending cell has to send

50% of what it normally does to hit the potent, hit that threshold mark. And then once it does,

when the threshold mark hits, then the potentiation fuck, and goes off, and it fires. So I would,

so the theory is, is that the oscillation wave would look more, would look, how we should say,

the periods would look more frequent, you might say. Wait, the period, the periods between spikes?

So we're seeing a slowdown? No, no, no, periods would look more frequent, so you would have a

shorter period. And I can talk about the psychedelic side, which is that it said that

that psychedelics, they increase cortical entropy. So they increase activity in the cortex,

and that is how things like hallucinations can come up, though a person can also, like,

riddose and have not a hallucination. There are some scientists who are trying to work on

creating so-called non-hallucinogenic psychedelics, such as, I'm trying to remember this person's name.

Oh yes, Brian Roth. Yep, he has a grant to work on that. The thing about

creating synthetic biology, creating synthetic molecules for things such as psychedelics,

is that there is, it's a real question of receptor and agonist bit, and getting the molecules to fit

exactly right, if possible, and trying to get them to be as specific to the receptor

that we want to activate as possible. So when it comes to psychedelics, a lot of them,

they don't just activate the 5-HT2A receptor, they're also sticking to other receptors and

opening up channels that way as well. For example, some dopamine receptors may be activated. So

they are not exactly perfect, but the biggest effect comes from the activation of 5-HT2A receptor.

This is Sharina, and I am done talking. I think, by the way, thank you so much for that,

Sharina. I wanted to bounce back together for a second. If you, so if what you're describing

about the 50, like the 50%, it may take, I guess you were saying like, in order for one neuron to

get another neuron to fire, it would have to send 50% more signal? Was that, was that what you're

saying? Like it would have to work harder? Let's go back to basic, let's go back to the example. So

in a normal situation, it's at zero, right? There's nothing in the synapse. The synapse is a gap,

right? There's nothing in there. So the first cell, the releasing cell has to send a bunch of

serotonin to get from zero to 100. And once it's 100, any other cell says, okay, I've got enough

serotonin, I reached my threshold, I'm going to fire off. So with the, so that's, that's, no,

that's like everyday work. That's, let's say that's the everyday brain. Now, the everyday brain has

taken SSRI, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. So the reuptake inhibitor prevents

the serotonin from actually being reabsorbed, and or, and what, so it sticks around for a lot

longer. So instead of starting from zero, we start at, let that, for my example, was 50%.

The actual percentages and how much serotonin is actually going to be in there will vary depending

on, you know, it's going to vary on a lot of factors. Like you mentioned, there are multiple

types of serotonin. It's going to depend on how many, you know, how many synaptic connections

there are. There's a bunch of like lots of dynamics that are involved. But I'm just

simplifying and say, okay, we're at 50% because of how much serotonin's there already. So that 50%

then is like 50% less actually to actually get to the threshold mark for the second nerve cell

to say, okay, I've got enough to fire. Um, yeah. And anyway, there's been a lot of, and, and people

who've done more focused on, I'm on the system side. So I look at more like nerve clusters and

looking at how whole brain, brain, brain regions respond to this. There are, I would say ex colleagues

now, I haven't talked to them in a while, who actually like pull out or look at particular

brain circuits and then bathe them and bathe them in pharma, in pharmacological, in different drugs

and actually measure their neuro, what they call neuropotentiation, which essentially electrical

signals and see how they respond. So, and yes, there are definitely changes, like I described,

not to the like 50%, then we get to another 50%, we get a neuro firing, but there are definitely

changes with the neural oscillation patterns that happen with the firings. Of course, they do all

sorts of, you know, different studies with that. So I, now I totally understand why the neurons

might fire faster, but I'm also interested in what's happening to the electrical gradient. Well,

the chemicals, because it's a, because of the neurochemical process, right? If not the synaptic

gap, electricity can't pass that gap. It has to be between the neurons. It has to come, the only

way from the neurons to talk to each other is sending chemicals at each other. So then what

happens is that in order for the chemicals to not build up, they have to be re-uptake by either it's

by the sending cell or the receiving cell. I'm going to pause there for a second to think about it.

Yeah. So I didn't, so I didn't know that they had to be, so I mean, I guess, I guess the concepts

of re-uptake is pretty straightforward, but, but, but I, but the, so I'm like, I'm like,

I'm just like wondering, well, okay, so either the re-uptake has to be done by the receiving cell

or the sending cell, but where is it, where is it going exactly if it's the receiving cell,

because the receiving cell receives it and then it brings it in where, like it just absorbs

through the membrane or something. And then it goes through the cell wall. Okay. So if you,

so if you, there's a lot of specific mechanisms for that. So, but yes, it's actually just go

through the patient's cell wall and to go goes in and then it gets reabsorbed by the cellular

machinery gets reprocessed. So if you're, I mean, I think of it as like you're clogging up the

receptor. So stuff gets stuck in there. Yeah, exactly. I mean, what we're doing is that we're

partially clogging up the receptor and that's why taking too much SSRI can lead to problems.

Yeah, but so, yeah, but that, but that also is going to affect the, the, the great, the

electrical gradient of the cell because, so does the SSRI have a positive or negative charge?

It doesn't. So the positive and negative charge has to do with the ions that are across the,

the, or across the cell. So the interesting thing about the cellular chemistry is that

you have, it splits the sodium, so the salt ion. So it kind of started, I can't, this is going way

back to my neurochemistry, but essentially it splits a salt molecule, the positive ion and

negative ion across the membrane. And then when it wants to fire, these channels open

and these ions are allowed to mix. And of course, you know, from basic chemistry that electrical,

because of the ions are now allowed to interact as a specific channel is that we will have

the electrical current that will pass along the membrane. And of course, this current is then

all along the membrane, all along the body of the cell is this, is this salt, that salt solution

that crosses that lines the entire body of the cell. And this will essentially would have depolarized

and electrical signal, electrochemical signal will pass along it until it reaches the other end.

Before I run away, I'm going to say that neurons are like salty bananas.

I mean, yeah, they have a lot of sodium on the outside, and they have a lot of potassium on the

inside. So when a channel opens up, then you know what's going to happen. Maybe the, the sodium from

the outside is going to flow to the inside. And that is what allows for the polarization that

eventually can lead to an action potential. This is Sharina, and it's time to run away and maybe

even eat a banana. Thank you for writing. Thank you, Sharina. I'll catch you later, Sharina.

Good to see you. Have a good night.

Way cool. So yeah, answering question, the serotonin neurotransmitters, both the, I mean,

both psychedelics and, I mean, the SSRIs, which are not actually serotonin neurotransmitters

themselves, they just mod, they quote unquote modulate serotonin neurotransmitters,

they're actually don't have any polarity to themselves. It's, but the neurotransmitters,

they trick, they kick off this, this polar response by triggering these channels to open

and causes this be polarity to happen. And this kicks off this electrical, electrical,

chemical pulse to travel along the cell body. Okay. Maybe we could go a little bit more,

a little bit more deeper into it. Like, in terms of like,

I don't know, if people want to, maybe I'll reset the remote quick and just open it up.

So, so this room, there's a lot of topics listed, neurophysics, brainwaves, oscillations,

neural circuits, nerve gear, that's brain, computer interfaces and AI. These are all

cool topics. And there's a lot of different ways to, there's like a whole like, like a whole bunch

of different conversations that could happen around these topics and how they could all connect

to one another. So anyone can ask a question, anyone can bring up anything that they're interested

in, anything that they've read recently in science news that's related to these topics.

And that's, go ahead. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, you know, so much. And these are definitely

fascinating topics. I mean, you know, as, as a, you know, human evolutionist, I guess,

if you will, futurist, you know, just the, just this notion of augmented, you know, humans,

I guess, versus, you know, the postulation of, you know, artificial intelligence,

I guess, you know, there's a lot of really smart people in the room. I'm just curious

to, to pose, you know, to pose the question. You know, how, how do we, you know, what, what are

some short term ways that we execute on, you know, augmented, you know, humans and enhanced humans

from a neuroscience perspective? Joshua, my thoughts always go towards how do we

either prevent or cure disease or pathology, right? So how can we augment the nervous system

in ways that, let's say, after a concussion or after a traumatic brain injury or after a spinal

cord injury, how can we provide either therapeutics or maybe stem cells or types of rehabilitation therapy

to, I will say, to harness the, the plasticity of the nervous system or the ability of the

nervous system to change, to restore some function, whatever that function may be, that may be

bowel and bladder function, that may be local motor function, that may be fine motor movements,

so that somebody can grab a glass again, but figuring out, I think, going deep enough into

the science to figure out the molecular mechanisms to augment that, to, again, to restore function

as the ultimate in my head and through my training as the, it's kind of the ultimate end goal of how

can I restore function from a, from a certain disease or pathology, so that somebody can live

a more, quote, unquote, normal life. Giving this a little more thought, I'm kind of with Brandon

here, but both taking on a different set of problems. And in, I, one of the biggest challenges I see

is actually aging, especially that's why I spend most of my time in the dementia Alzheimer's lab

and traumatic brain injury lab, is that as we age, is that we accumulate a lot of, I mean, a lot,

not just health problems, but mental issues, mental health problems that will degrade our

cognitive abilities over time. A lot of it's not understood yet and we're still trying to understand

a lot of the molecular aspects of it, but a lot we do understand and a lot of, it has a lot of ways

to prevent that or to mitigate it involves everything we've heard about for the last

several decades, just eating healthier, exercising, being more engaged, learning, etc, etc. The only

problem is, is that we don't see any of the incentives in society actually playing out in a

meaningful way. And yeah, there's a lot that's not being, there's not going on, there's a lot

that's not, that's happening there, because there's, there's more happening, especially from social

neuroscience, the place that our brains are actually highly responsive and actually builds new

connections and even build new brain cells, depending on who we interact with. And especially,

and there's more just general social psychology, like, and longitudinal studies, like the

non-famous non-study that looked at it, that followed several nuns for, not several nuns,

a whole convent of nuns for decades, and tracked their cognitive decline in those who developed

dementia, those who developed Alzheimer's, and see what type of behaviors and what type of social

networks they developed. And of course, one of the things they found was that the nuns who have

wider social networks essentially had, like, big, had a bigger, like, bigger number of friends,

and who were able to write more verbosely, and were more descriptive with their wording,

and with their communication, had less cognitive decline or less at risk of cognitive decline

than those who had fewer friends, and were not as up to talking, or actually being descriptive

with their speech, or were not as proficient in their speech. So there's a lot in there that can

be derived in how we actually live our own lives going into the future without having all the really

nice medical, pharmacological, biochemical data out our hands yet, which still hasn't panned out

for the most part. Like, we know a lot, but we don't know enough to start messing around with

their own brains, at least with any confidence. So that's what I, that's what I take it is that

there's a lot of lifestyle changes that can be taken up. Now, of course, I just want to

get caveat for anyone who's an introvert in the room. No, you do not need to be making a large

number of friends. Just take it, you know, get a good intellectual interest in something you

should be fine. There was one thing that I see the outweigh in the nuns that he was taking a keen

intellectual interest, and those nuns did pretty well, too. So that you don't have to have a

large number of friends to offset cognitive decline.

Yeah, go ahead, Jay Hill and Mike.

Yeah, I just wanted to, well, thanks again, Michael, for hosting the room and Gary, this

is the second time I've been in a room with you. It's great that you mentioned a few things that

I've been interested in kind of understanding a bit more and this is for myself. I've yet to

speak with a specialist. So this is my first time like openly talking about it, right? So

Mike, I asked you about the EEG VR headsets, because I'm interested in actually

seeing how my brain is firing and looking for solutions, right? So I have noticed recently that

I've been struggling with more of like memory loss or just retaining certain things short term

and or even long term. And yeah, I'm interested. I know that when I do, say, smoke, for example,

or intake, I believe it's a strand, it is, I'm drawing a blank right now.

Were you going to say something like Sativa or Indica?

Yes, thank you. There you go. Thank you, Michael. It was, I believe it's a Sativa.

And I noticed that my brain functions quite differently. And I experienced a bit more

empathy, right? And understanding, I just kind of see myself in a completely different light,

right? And I just interested in seeing what steps that should be taken to, I guess, understand

that a bit more. And it's not just that. It's, I self-diagnosed with ADHD, right? So I've just

kind of noticed that there are some similarities with, you know, some of the people that have

described their symptoms and some things kind of relate. So yeah, I'm just really interested.

And this is why I love these rooms to just kind of hear, you know, specialists just

under, to explain, you know, their journeys of, you know, some of the, I guess, cases that they've

gone through over the years. And yeah, I'm just kind of like a fly on the wall, but I'm interested

in hearing, I guess, more for you. No, it's a little bit. I would say it's always really good

to hear when someone takes a really keen interest in order to make sure that they are healing themselves

and that they're taking care of themselves. So good for you, Jay. It's fantastic to hear.

I've got us, let me see. I don't have anything off the top of my head for the ADHD or the memory

stuff. I mean, if it's a major concern, I always say consult a medical professional. And I never,

just say never settle for one. I mean, the standard level psychiatrists and the licensed

clinical social workers, they're good at what they do. But what they do is they help people who are

in immediate distress of suicide, anxiety, you know, a lot of mood, a lot of personality disorders,

the type of stuff that we, especially for attention deficit and memory issues,

starts getting more, unfortunately, gets more specialized. People who are in like the cognitive,

what are our neuropsychologists, the people who are cognitive rehabilitationists, those type of

people, those type of specialists. So if you do decide to go down that route, it's, it is a bit

of a journey, but it's well worth it. So prove for your PM me if you want to reach out to some

suggestions of titles of people who are clinicians who would be qualified to take a look into it.

And that's, yeah, and hoping, yeah, that's hoping you'll get the answers you're looking for.

Thank you, Garrett. Yeah, definitely will PM you. And I guess we just have a few more

more questions I'd like to ask. And I know this is not medical advice. I've talked a lot about

crypto. So, you know, we give the disclaimer, this is not financial advice. So I completely

understand. But yeah, definitely appreciate you sharing, you know, your perspective. And yeah,

greatly appreciate it. I saw you on Mike, Josh, what did you want?

Did anyone else want to respond to that? Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for that. And I

think, wow, what a great conversation once again. And for me, this is, this is absolutely, I love the,

you know, the corrective and, you know, I guess therapeutic, you know, rehabilitative,

you know, aspects of the conversation. And for sure, I mean, I'm getting older. I'm going to be

40, you know, this year. And I noticed that, right? And I'm not necessarily, you know, a low

performing person. However, I do start to notice like the effects of just like the wear and tear of

living an active lifestyle and just going out like as an entrepreneur, as a businessman,

just having dinners and just that whole, you know, and so, you know, for sure, I mean,

I definitely appreciate what Derek was saying, just like, you know, just by tightening up your

lifestyle and paying attention to, you know, your self care and your diet and meditation,

like I definitely can, I see that. But I'm also super curious about just really understanding

the deeper aspects of the science, you know, when it comes to just, you know, and I know, Garrett,

you kind of talked about this a little bit with, you know, like what Elon's doing with Neuralink

and, you know, what other, you know, researchers and entrepreneurs are doing in this whole space of

like augmented humans and like, you know, what I really just call like, it all falls under this

category of like human optimization. And, you know, this has always been something I'm fascinated

about. And at different areas of my, you know, my journey as a human and as, I guess, as an

entrepreneur, engineer, etc. Like I've, you know, been, you know, deeper down the rabbit hole than

other times, you know, and so when I see like this, this topic in a room like this, you know,

kind of pop up, like it just like, it brings it like back to the front. I'm just like,

what can we do? Right? Because, you know, I want, I want people who need rehabilitation,

you know, to have that rehabilitation. But just from like a human optimization and like a human

transcendent perspective, I guess I'm just curious, like, you know, what can we do to optimize

ourselves to maybe, you know, unlock a greater, you know, you know, percentage of our capacity to

just like, understand, compute, just, you know, we know these, you know, we throw around these,

these loose terms that we're only using, you know, like a very small percentage of our cognitive

abilities. So, you know, what innovative, you know, research or what new things if any, you know,

is anybody in this room coming across that's like, you know, moving us in the direction of,

you know, unlocking a greater percentage of our ability to use our inherent, you know,

neural capabilities. And then, you know, not just with what's going on with Neuralink, but

what other scientists and researchers, you know, doing in the field that are going to

give us a greater ability to, I guess, you know, for lack of better words, to transcend our current

state. So, there is, there are definitely two different things because there are, I mean,

there is cognitive enhancement, like cognitive augmentation, and then there's cognitive

rehabilitation. And you would think they would be on the same, they would be the same thing, but

in, in the scientific field, they are definitely different. So, I guess we could take it either

direction. I just, the question is, is that which one do people want to take it in? I mean,

you've already mentioned yourself, Joshua, but you're also experiencing a little bit of a slow

down with age. That could be the immediate thing. But of course, it's always fun to talk about, hey,

here's all the cool stuff that we could do in the future. So, I'll leave it to you about,

oh, I mean, I could talk about either one. This is my, this is my chill time for me. So,

what does anyone want to, so I'll leave it to everyone to decide.

Joshua, before you maybe clarify what we want to get into, that notion of that we only use,

let's say, I don't know, whatever percentage you want to throw in there, 15% of our brain.

It's, I don't know where that's come from. I've heard that a few times, but I don't,

that doesn't really hold any weight or water here. Right, if you, it's not like it, parts of your

brain are just inactive. So, I don't know where that comes from. And you think blood flow to the

brain, right? So, you got to provide oxygen for, especially for nervous tissue to be active, because

it's primarily oxidative driven. So, it has to produce energy using oxygen. And it's really

just a shift in the blood flow in the brain to provide oxygen to areas that are active. So,

all of the areas are constantly active. Some ramp up, some quiet down, but it's not that,

again, we only use a certain percentage of our brain, just shifting which percentage of your brain

or sub-core structures that we're using, depending on the task that we need.

Josh, are you ready to respond to that? I could add some things too, but I guess

you're going to make a selection about which way you want Garrett to go.

Oh, no, my god, definitely want you to go first. Please, please go ahead and add to that.

Okay, so I just wanted to say that there was a paper, there's been some studies on creatine

in the brain. And I have a friend, one of my neuroscientist friends insists that creatine is

the only thing that's been proven to actually improve your memory. I'm a fan of, there's something

called D ribose, which is a supplement that affects your body in a similar but slightly

different way than how creatine affects. I don't think it has been shown that it improves your

memory, but if creatine doesn't, I don't know, maybe it does too. There's something,

yeah, that's a big stretch, right? There's, I like new tropics, I'm a fan of new tropics.

I don't think there's any proof yet that they actually improve your memory, but I take,

I take, you know, I take, so, you know, like I'll take choline or I'll take new pep. I think

what I'm taking right now is, gosh, like, yeah, how good of my memory if I can't remember the

names of my new tropics? No, so if I forget to take the choline, then they don't work. So they

definitely like, you know, like the oxy-racetam or the, oh yeah, so there's one called fassor-racetam

or collaracetam, different names. But you can look up the topic of new tropics. And so, so some

people who have ADHD, they have, in an MRI scan, they have like less blood flow in the, in the

frontal pridal lobes, for example. And like, I think J-Hell mentioned ADHD, yes, you definitely,

like, there's some good books on ADHD that you might want to read, but also get your diagnosis

validated. Because there's too many, like, there's many things that can appear to be ADHD, or ADD,

that, and there's many different, I guess there's many different versions of it. So you might want

to get your diagnosis validated. And also the possible treatments, like you can, you can, it's

possible, if you're doing, if you're trying to self-treatment, if you're trying to do self-treatment,

like you can really mess it up, taking too much or too little of whatever you're doing,

maybe completely ineffective, and without a doctor's guidance, it's easy to get lost.

So self-treatment is not super helpful. And then, like, I mean, my, my first impulse is to, like,

start asking you, start asking Jay, for example, like, what, what is the, what do you think the

cannabis might be doing to your memory, in terms of how you feel? But I don't, I don't actually

want Jay Jay to answer that because, because it's a group setting, and we don't really want to get

into diagnosing a person in a group setting, or a diagnosing person at all. But, but, but the idea

here is that maybe, maybe in some cases, you know, smoking in general, not cannabis specifically,

but smoking in general can create inflammation. And that can, that can impair memory. And if

there's a lot of smoking happening, then memory could get worse. And a person may not connect it

to the smoking, but because it may be happening, like, basically, basically, in terms of, like,

what's happening in the month overall, right? Not, not an immediate, the effects might not be

immediate. But that could be a contributor. And there's a lot of, like, you know, trying to diagnose

psychiatric issues while someone is, is taking substances. I mean, like, everything is, everything

you eat is a substance, right? But you just, it's hard to get an accurate diagnosis if you're not

accounting for, for things that might be causing inflammation or other weird things that could

be affecting your memory. And so going back to, so Neutropics, creatine, I have this vibration

platform that vibrates at, like, 40 hertz. And it's a linear, it's like a linear vibration

platform. It's not the one that wobbles. It just goes, like, straight up and down. It doesn't,

like, wobble up and right. And I think it's, it's, it, I hope that it's, it's maybe helping

with, with blood flow in the brain. If I, if my, if my blood flow was not, like in, you know,

like in the example of the ADD patient, if their blood flow is not, it's not, it's not really good

around the whole brain, then maybe some, some, some therapy would help. I don't know. But that's

just, you know, it's, this is not real medicine when I'm doing it. And it's just, I'm just trying

something. So I should, I should pause there. So Joshua, which way do you want to take? Do you

want to do brain enhancement or cognitive rehabilitation? Talk about general topics

and talk about what's, what's in the field. Yeah, absolutely. Micah, Garrett, thank you so much for

that and, and Brandon as well. I mean, it's really about enhancements, right? I mean, and I've only

got really a few minutes left, you know, for tonight, but I'm just excited. Okay. Well, my

position is, what's that? Oh, well, I was wanting to say, I thought you had stopped, you're welcome.

I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, I apologize. Um, yeah. So no, I just want to say, like, I, I think I'm excited

about the possibilities of, you know, enhanced humans. And I think that there needs to be a

greater level of attention that is focused in that direction. Because around, you know, this whole,

this whole sphere that I play very heavily in, you know, the, the fourth industrial revolution,

as it were, I mean, robotics, AI, machine learning, you know, we talk about these things

prolifically and extensively. And, you know, and even, you know, at all, all levels, like what they

can do for us are fears as, you know, as it pertains to that. But I think that there's a lot

that is, it's this, this minor portion of the conversation that I think that there needs to

be a greater emphasis on. And that is, what if we're just optimizing ourselves? And for sure,

that all, you know, a significant port, you know, percentage of that just goes into basic

self care. And there's a lot of that that's being discussed, right? And then going into the

the new tropics and going into, you know, some of these other supplementations, increasing blood

flow, oxen, you know, oxen, oxen adjacent, you know, I think these are the basics, but I'm just

excited about the possibilities of us just, you know, I guess just getting better as humans,

and, and maybe just, you know, further exploring that. And then, you know, maybe, you know,

in a related, you know, context, off, offloading, you know, things that we deem to be at that point

more menial to like robotics and AI to to kind of handle things. And it's an interesting paradox,

because so much of the conversation around, you know, techno ethics and AI is like, oh, my goodness,

we're taking away these menial jobs from human beings. And I said, well, shouldn't we just be

more focused on getting better as humans, right? And letting, you know, robots and AI just kind of do

things that, you know, we, we shouldn't at that point just not even really care about doing.

And it's such an interesting thing. It's like, it's almost like we don't want to evolve,

but I feel like we should be evolving. And that's, you know, why I'm excited about,

and there is a part of that too is like, and, you know, again, like about which way do I want

to take the conversation? It's just for me, it's all related, you know, because nobody wants to see

somebody who's not doing well, right, from a mental health perspective, or just from a,

you know, just from somebody who's gone through like had a TBI or, you know, and I'm a veteran.

I, you know, have seen, you know, just, you know, the, the impacts of trauma and that,

and that field, but also trauma is a very real thing, just for humans in general, you know.

And so for sure, just how do we, you know, address the rehabilitative nature of things,

and then just the natural course of aging, but also, you know, I guess, how do we just get better

as humans in general, and be comfortable with that evolution and actually more so than just

being comfortable about it, get excited about it. And then, you know, I just, again, you know,

but I'm a human evolutionist, you know, in a lot of the conversations around what I do with

digital transformation and, you know, next generation technologies, there's so much fear

around, okay, well, where's the human in this? And I think that this is absolutely the answer to

the human, the human evolves because we figure out how to, you know, how to do so in a, in a healthy

way. And, you know, I guess those are just, just some thoughts. But again, thank you guys so much

for, for this room. It's a great conversation. Actually, welcome. Hey, thank you for your service

too, by the way. We really appreciate everything you've done for this country.

Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Joshua. Gary, you have the floor if you want to respond to anything you

want. And I'll just say, real quick, yeah, absolutely, my pleasure. And thank you for saying that.

I'm going to listen in for a little bit, but probably within the next few minutes, I'm just

going to peace out. I don't want to be rude. But I just, you know, again, want to say thank you so

much. I'm going to listen for a little bit longer. And then I'm just going to kind of

peace out so that I don't disrupt the flow of the room. Okay, well, I'll talk a little about

some of the human augmentation technologies I've been reading or the cognitive augmentation

technologies I've been reading up on. There have been, there's a lot of interesting stuff in the

field. And this goes beyond your tropics. So this is beyond using supplements and nutrition to

augment one's chemo ones brain performance. Now I will, there's a big board of the plague warning

I'll say this again, I'll say at the end is that these technologies and scientific studies are

still in the experimental stage, they're still being researched. There's still a lot of unknown

about the ad if there are any adverse effects, and what would be any long term side effects

of use of these technologies. So take that with a grain of salt, as they talk about it.

So one of them I mentioned is actually was used for depression. I mentioned earlier in this

room was transcranial magnetic stimulation. And one, it is a technology that uses alternating

magnetic fields in order to stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain. Now the interesting thing

with this one is that you can actually stimulate certain regions of the brain, like dorsolateral

prefrontal cortex, normal proven or you can stimulate areas like the frontal cortex or the

prefrontal cortex in order to hyper stimulate it in order to perform better. There is however,

because the technology has been around for a while, it's pretty well understood that it is a short

acting effect, at least for people who do not have an active deficit. There's still research on people

who have had like brain injury, dementia, etc. They may actually have a longer, receive a longer

term benefit. But for normal people, there seems to be some sort of significant drop off and non

long lasting effect. But for a short period of time, they can get by having this magnetic stimulation

to these areas can get a boost to whatever function that they receive in these areas. Now,

of course, I did go without warrant. Of course, I need to, it goes without saying that these

focalized stimulations of the brain regions are very focalized, that they're only like,

if you're only doing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that may be only moved, where you're

doing only if you're doing the language area like Broca's area, then it's only language

production. It won't actually help you with language recognition. It's that specific on the

vocal stimulation. So that's something to bear in mind with this type of with TMS. So one of the

possible people are looking at more rehabilitation technology than as an enhancement technology,

but the possibility exists. Maybe someone will find a pattern or they'll find a brain area that's

a little bit more longer lasting or receive that or some some long that lasting benefit

and will go that direction. Another interesting one is transcranial direct current stimulation.

This one has been also around for a while, but it's been gaining interest in the last 20 years.

So this one is applying a very small, so like a five volt, one amp or five volt,

essentially five volt two amp charge directly to the scalp. Essentially it is, people really don't

feel it. Just to be clear, this is not a painful, actually painful, it's a very low powered,

essentially electrical current that's applied to the head. And it's essentially applied to the

four part of the head and then the positive terminal. The positive is from the back and

the negative is from the positive front and the negative back. And the big and people have reported

generally enhanced cognitive improvement for several hours afterward. Also when they are

after an electrical stimulation of this, they have reported that they can improve, they have

better memorization and remember better learning of the material that they learned during the

stimulation period. This one has been both is both under investigation for enhancement and

rehabilitation. So this one has been very promising if there's any and also what type of protocols

should be used under specific and what type of cognitive benefits will help besides memory.

Does it help with sleep? There's some evidence for that. Does it help with learning languages?

There's some evidence for that. Does it help with learning doing math? Some evidence, not a lot,

but some. And the effect is not that great, but there's definitely more with memory. So

it is an interesting one. There seems to be definitely benefits. Downsides, there's not

been any long term studies to know what happens if you keep on zapping yourself. Needless to say,

that could be bad. There is a lot of, there is a lot of conjecture that the brain could build

up resistance just like it builds up resistance of drugs that you may require larger and larger

electrical stimulation in order to get the same effect. And last thing we want is people start

electrically stimulating themselves to death in order to get a bigger and bigger cognitive boost.

So long term effects are unknown. The other thing too is that they, when is the reason why this

technology was initially not produced or not pursued as a research topic was that after this

period or after the initial boost, there would be a depression period. So after a few hours,

you can get a boost of learning or performing higher, they would then perform below normal

for a period of time. And then they would come back to normal. So the concern was, is that okay,

how long does this depression period last? And does it affect other skills? And is there some

for long term damage that might persist later on? So far, it doesn't seem to be the case, but

everyone's brain is slightly different. And with everyone now trying all sorts of new

cannabinoids and psychedelics, the goodness knows what type of interactive effects could happen.

So that's another thing. And that's why people are proceeding very carefully. Because now we're

going to add, we're going to cross effect maybe a electrical stimulation and a psychedelic. We

don't know what will happen. So this depression effect has been a concern for a while. But now

the dynamics are well understood that research seems to be progressing forward a lot more.

So fascinating area for that one, hopefully, it will be well understood in the rehabilitation

arena before it gets applied in the augmentation arena. The other one that's really interesting

I ran across actually here in Clubhouse, but it's a well resorted in Europe is photo modulation.

And this one is using different frequencies infrared light in order to stimulate areas

in the core in the scalp and cortex. The basic idea is to stimulate blood flow into those areas.

And then by blood flow improving different cortical function. From what I understand,

this is of course one clubhouse room, I'm going to do additional reading on this,

is that it does seem that there is definitely improvement overall for improving areas in

on the brain surface. So you're not talking anything like deep brain like hippocampus

would be a deep brain structure and that governs memory. But you could get to things like language

and you can get to things like certain like visual cortex, which is visual processing,

all useful stuff. So that could be extremely useful. So it's limited, but extremely useful.

Other downsides, downsides is how long lasting it is. That's a very important question.

Number two is that it's only certain frequencies of light and infrared. So the treatment protocols

for treating one's self have to be very specific. And also there is, you can't just keep on zapping

yourself with it too. It doesn't quite work like that. The brain, the capital blood,

the circular system does get used to it. So the doctor who was speaking on it in clubhouse was

very keen on that. He recommended if anyone wanted to look into it and look up the research.

So it's like anything, it has very particular dynamics on how it works in order to be effective.

So yes, and also the third thing is that like I mentioned, it doesn't get to deep brain areas.

So if you want to enhance your memory, it's most likely out of luck. It might actually

improve memory, but I have to do some reading. I think maybe there is someone who's had proof

provider protocol that affects memory in some way, but I couldn't find it. But there wasn't

mentioned on the clubhouse stuff it went on to. And I haven't found one yet on the article they

read. So those are some of the really interesting thoughts that is coming down the pipe for

augmentation. And that is just, that is non-chemical. So, and that's not, that's not even counting any

of the existing stuff for biofeedback, eye tracking, stuff that's been like out for decades already.

So you might have heard of those technologies already and I'm leaving those out because you

can just Google that. Those come up much more readily. This stuff, it's like you have to like

specifically, like, transparent or direct current stimulation. Like it won't come up on most Google

searches. You have to look at it or Google scholar search on it in order to find it. Even photo

modulation. I was in neuroscience for a long time and I didn't hear about those here in clubhouse.

So I just make everyone aware of it. These are interesting topics and here's the board of the

play again. They are still in the research experimental phase. We do not know what the

long-term consequences of using these technologies are and we don't know what the side effects are

for these. So they are still under investigation and should be considered as such until we understand

better on how they improve human cognition and what sort of consequences that would mean for the

human body and for the human brain. And I'm done. That was amazing, Garrett. Do you mind if I ask

some neurophysics questions? I'll try to answer. Some of these I don't know. I mean, obviously TMS

and transcranial, I know them most about. The other ones, I'm not as good at it. So I'll try.

Okay. So I'm wondering what are some of the neural correlates to depression

specifically? Like, so I guess there's the, you know, some people can say, well,

this somehow the circadian rhythm can affect depression, sleep deprivation,

neurogenesis or a new protein synthesis. Can interference with new protein synthesis

cause depression? Can inflammation cause depression? Can a metabolic disorder or the inability to

produce ATP cause depression? And so go ahead. That's a very broad question. I mean, the answer to that

is yes. Yes, they're all in time. Everything in protein synthesis because to my recollection,

this is talking to a neuroendocrinologist a time ago. If you have a problem with protein

synthesis, there is some other metabolic thing going on that you're probably going to feel sick

on something else way before you feel depressed. Depressed is probably going to be a consequence

of you feeling sick. So I want to say yes, maybe accept that one. So I'm just throwing that out

there because the way we understand the brain is that it's very, it is actually very sensitive.

It seems to be very sensitive to blood flow. It's sensitive to information. It's sensitive to

neurochemical levels. It's sensitive to nutrition. It's sensitive to all these things. So throw these

out of alignment. It's throws a fit. And if it's not anxiety, it's depression. So that's what that

little neuroscience is telling right now. I mean, it might be anger too. There's a lot of people with

CTE, electronic traumatic encephalography, that just, you know, they get really angry. So, I mean,

they don't really, some of them don't even report depression. They might feel depression,

but they don't report it. So what you're just saying is that there's a lot, I mean,

depression seems to be one of those things that emotion, that is an emotional signal

and we experience saying something's wrong as far as, as far as what body literature is indicating.

So, yes, I will say, I'm saying that's why I'm saying it's qualified, yes, because the exact

mechanisms, like, okay, what is, so what are the, like, if you ask me, what is the specific

particular mechanism, how does information translate into some chemical that triggers

the lack of dope serotonin from being released that causes a, well, in this case would be the

dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex from decreasing activation. And I don't know, I don't know what

that pathway looks like. But I know there is, but I've seen that there's these, there are

correlation studies that show that there is a link, there is a decrease in activation,

just don't, I just can't tell you how it gets there. So, I mean, I guess a long time ago I read

something about people were trying to detect depression with EEG and they were saying that

there's a difference in the bands, maybe there's more theta or delta, maybe there's less alpha or

beta in someone who's depressed compared to their baseline when they're not depressed. So,

like, what I was thinking was, okay, well, what if also, like, the amount of, I just was like

wondering, like, because, you know, I just thought about the fact that this is a weird idea and it

could be totally wrong, but the fact that we, you know, some of our brain wave oscillations

are just characterized by how slow or rapid they are basically. Theta is very slow, beta is much

faster. And, you know, I thought about, well, if you're, if you're, you know, maybe, maybe if

someone has a metabolic disorder and their brain is not able to produce as much ATP,

they're, you know, maybe, maybe they're, maybe they're also being interfered with,

their metabolism is being interfered with, with lots of stress that's causing inflammation,

which is also interfering with their, with their body's ability to, to produce energy. And because

they have less energy, they can't, their brain can't operate as fast. So, it has less energy,

so it has to run slower. So, you'd see more slowdown in the, in the theta. You see more,

more prevalence of theta and delta and less prevalence of the faster brain waves like the,

like the beta and the alpha. And this would be like, the idea is that, that some, some forms

of depression will be just basically like metabolic disorder from, you know, you can't

produce, your cells can't produce enough energy. And, but then all the, all these treatments of,

of for depression, like basically with SSRI, with, with psychedelic medication, with TDCS,

with TMS, with photomodulation, these are all stimulations, all, all, all different ways to

stimulate the brain in different areas. So that means you're, you're trying to increase brain

activity. And so you see these, we see these temporary effects. Oh, the patient looks happy

for a while, right? And then they're followed by like this immediate depression. Now I'm set,

like I'm just like, well, I was happy for a while, but I don't know what happened. I can't even think,

I'm tired, right? And then, but the idea is like, yeah, well, well, that didn't solve the problem

if the core problem was just that the patient's cells were not able to make enough ATP. And you

like, it's like, there's not like, by, you just, by stimulating the patient, you're like increasing

the brain activity. But what, but what they really need is the, it's like increasing the demand

without increasing the supply. And the problem is they don't have enough supply of energy.

And we're just going to increase the demand to, so that, to, but without increasing the supply of

energy. That's what I, that's what I'm saying. It's an interesting thought. I mean, I would say

everything, but the transcranial magnetic stimulation, because the ones with those studies,

they have, they have not seen a depressed after effect with using it for depression patients.

There's no, once I can't remember what the clinical term is, but they don't have a resurgence of

depression after a treatment or after continued treatment of that. So it's, it's not stimulation

the way you think in, especially with the magnetics, with, with the magnetics. I really recommend

reading up on the physics behind it. It's, it's fascinating. So how it actually stimulates that

area. It's, it's very different than a lot. It's a very non obvious way of using alternating

magnetic fields in, or into, on, into trigger a very local, a very specific area of the brain.

And doing it in a way that gets them, it's almost like an agitation rather than a stimulation.

The agitation is not even the right word for it. So backing off the specific technology,

just in regards to the question of, is this enough metabolic juice? I mean, there, I mean,

there are some, there are some, I mean, this is almost going with the area, but Daniel Eamon

Los Angeles has, you know, this is argument in regards to metabolic activity in regards to

like depression and all that. What's his name again? Daniel Eamon. And the reason why I mention

is because his theories are definitely controversial within neuroscience. He uses a scanning technique

called spec. And it actually looks at a type of metabolic activity. But there's a big problem

is that it's very messy. It's a very noisy technique. And you can certainly look at it,

and certainly it is useful in certain contexts. But what the brain is that you're looking at

a whole bunch of different metabolic processes. The mirror, I mean, there's not just neural,

there's not just neural. And you're also looking at clear cells. You're looking at

cardiography and vasculature. You're looking about a whole bunch of different things in there.

And this spec is kind of a lower resolution. It just, it just pushes that all together.

So however he likes it, and he uses this, and people benefited from this. And the reason why

I mention him. And he argues in regards to helping metabolism or helping your people's,

helping people's mood and their brain function. So how much I buy into that personally? I don't know.

So, I mean, it's an interesting point. And I got to give it some thought. But I'm out on, I mean,

I'm still undecided on that particular point. Because there is a lot that goes into, I mean,

when you look at healthy people who have traumatic brain injury, and they get depressed,

when they get angry, it's obviously not a nutrition issue. It's not an energy issue.

It's not even a blood flow issue. There's definitely scarring in their brain going on.

There's definitely, there's definitely other things going on that have happened to their brain.

Or people who have suffered an ischemic stroke, I mean, that the, or type of,

different type of blood clots to the brain. I mean, that area of the brain just had a major

type of trauma because they have lots of oxygenation. It's not a nutrition issue. It's a,

it's a direct nutrition that definitely suffered because of oxygen deprivation for a period of

time. So it's, there are a lot, I mean, metabolism and metabolic efficiency could be an issue.

And I'm not going to roll it out. I'm just going to, I'm, I'm just pulling out, there's a lot,

I'm just saying there's a lot of other ones that are bigger fish to fry in, in the hierarchy and,

in the realm of possible causes. There are bigger ones that potentially fry first.

Sure. I just want to say that there is one particular TMS story that stands out that I,

I haven't really seen a real response to from anyone yet, but the article is called Too Good

to Be True, How TMS Damaged My Brain by James Hall. And so he's a 73 year old, he's a, sorry,

37 year old man. And he says that he did the, he went to the Mayo Clinic and he did the non-invasive

procedure that uses magnetic fields to simulate nerve cells in the brain. And so, so his article is

about his, his experience and, and you know, they basically, he says they pushed him to

max out his, his treatment, but his symptoms got worse and he developed tendonitis and some other

like really frightening symptoms that, that just went beyond his, what he had ever experienced

before. So, so he started to have some serious health issues. And, and so then, but then he,

so after he had this, you know, months later, he started to, to reconsider basically TMS is

basically like being a descendant of, of electroconvulsive therapy. I know it's, it's, it's,

there's a lot of differences, you know, I've looked into it a lot. There's a lot of, you know,

I guess you can get very specific about the frequency patterns and the direction of where

you're, you're sending the stimulation and, and so it's not, it's, it's, if TMS is just

this really blunt instrument, I'm sorry, if, if, if electroconvulsive therapy is a really blunt

instrument, you can, it's, TMS is a lot more precise, but still TMS is more of like a shotgun

than a scalpel, right? And then, so anyway, but it, but it's like, so I think this article is, is

at least good to think about in terms of like, yeah, well, I wonder why there's no, there's,

there's at least one like really negative story about TMS. And, and so maybe it's not,

I wonder if there's, if there are stories being swept down the right end of the ride,

because a lot of the talk about TMS is on the marketing, marketing side of things.

Well, I have to take a look at this study specifically. I know from, when I've done it,

and the protocols that I've seen or come out, you know, since the clinic, when they,

when they have clinical, when they use it clinically, is that if there are any neurological

adverse effects like tinnitus, or speech appendement, or motor loss and motor control,

or patient complaining, is to immediately stop. So I don't know what the hell Mayo was thinking.

Actually, I know researchers of Mayo, researchers of Mayo that have used TMS, and they've used

the same protocol. So I don't know, I mean, it could be, I mean, things could have changed at

Mayo. I haven't worked in the game, like I say in my bio, I'm an engineer now, I'm not a current

practicing neuroscientist. So it is possible that they change something. But one, so as I left the

field, however, things were different, in that those type of neurological symptoms was an automatic

stop to any procedure, or to any protocol. And that essentially that this person either, it was,

it was essentially a patient comfort level with the first, like any, like any procedure, whether

the surgery with, with getting, you know, getting a mole removed or anything else. So, yeah, it's

kind of how to dig into the story details later, in regards to that, because getting, beginning

response like tinnitus is highly unusual, and also very boring, because that is the temporal lobe.

The temporal lobe is highly excitable part of the brain. And also, temporal lobe is where a

lot of seizures occur. So any, any neurologist or any neuroscientologist worth his salt would say,

you know, that might be worth backing off a bit, we're getting something,

you know, getting a part of the system, the auditory neurological system that's being a little

too excited. Let's see what's going on here, especially if that's not the area they're targeting

with TMS. You know, if they're targeting like visual cortex, which is the back of the brain,

you're getting part in the material on the temporal lobe with that, you know, that's worth

investigating, right? That's something, that's something we're looking at. So that, I mean,

there's a lot to dig into the story there. So, yeah, I don't know. I can't say about that for

your good example. I have say that everyone who came into my, who came to my lab was practicing,

came walking back out, had a very good time. The only person who did not have a very good time

was actually not under my guidance. And he passed out before he even applied the TMS

trial because he was so nervous. And of course, we never applied the TMS, we never applied TMS

to him. We just, you know, you know, sat, made him himself comfortable, made him comfortable

until he, he woke up being passed out because he passed out because, you know, he just, you know,

obviously he couldn't consent to doing anything at that point. So, and then we figured out we,

we debriefed him, you know, like he passed out. And I know how nervous he was and, and just kind

of send him on his way, you know. So, um, yeah, not sure what to make of this particular story.

I had to dig into it. But I haven't seen, I mean, if you haven't, I haven't taken more articles on it,

but most of the, I mean, yeah, I mean, I won't say anymore because I'm obviously not vetted to

tie to the technology at this point or anything like that. It's just been, it's still under

investigation for other uses besides major depressive disorder. Cool. Right on. Thank you.

By the way, I, I, I, I posted it to my Twitter. So if you click on my profile and click on Twitter,

it's, it's one of the top two links that I just posted. But I will also try to send you a message

on the Instagram and in a little bit to send, to send a copy to you. I'll just try it.

Okay. All right. So let me just reset the room and invite anyone who wants to come on up,

to come on up and ask, ask any question on any of these amazing topics like neurophysics,

brainwaves, oscillations, neural circuits, nerve gear, artificial intelligence, or just talk about

any, any, anything that grabs your interest this week on these topics.

Michael, before anybody jumps up, I'm actually going to head out. It is a touch

till midnight here and I have to be in the laboratory early on a Saturday tomorrow. So I

appreciate you setting up the room and I look forward to the next one.

All right. Sounds good. Thank you, Brandon. I'll, I'll, I'll invite some more people too.

I'll just say one more thing. I mean, I scan the article that in bold faces of the FDA,

these incidents have been reported to the FDA for years or and not been, or have,

but he found others who had problems with the TMS and these voices have not been reported to the

FDA. I mean, I do feel bad for these folks because this was an investigational technology

before that. This isn't, this TMS has been an investable technology has been under investigation

since the nineties. And I mean, under a lot, it's been under a lot of research scrutiny.

We've used it in all sorts of, on all sorts of patients, all sorts of healthy and non-healthy

people to really get a sense of how the technology worked. And I'm not saying as an eagle thing,

interesting is because it's how much data was produced on it. It's kind of a, I don't know

what to make of having a few people having some severe side effects to make out of it. It's really,

it kind of disheartening in a way. And that's my personal reaction on it. But also it's a little

bit, I don't know what's going on an academic researcher level is like, I don't know what's

going on because like, you have like a mountain of data and then you get, and then after you release

the technology and you get a few that are having some very severe problems. I'm like, and of course,

when you do it in the research environment, you're doing all sorts of, you know, all sorts of crazy

what we call outliers scenarios. Okay, well, how about someone who's had half of their brain

removed? Like, okay, well, how about someone who's had like another whole surgery in order to like

a brain implant? Like literally, we have someone we did it on someone who had a brain stent in there.

They already had a neurosurgery and we applied TMS to it. That's how safe it is. So I mean,

I'm not saying there's nothing wrong. I'm just saying there's also there was I'm just saying

there's a lot of data under a lot of different circumstances that this technology was applied

to. And then we had a few and then of course, there are these people who have these significant

circumstances coming up. And I'm weighing those symptoms very carefully. Like, I don't know how

they didn't I don't know how we didn't how we never caught these before. So yeah, that's that's

all I'm gonna say for now. Because obviously, I'm not in the field anymore. I just pass along to

the right people and see if they can make heads or tails of it. Right on, right on. I and by the way,

I so I guess was the founder of TMS was that Len Oaks? I don't remember. There have been so many

people who revised the technology. I mean, we had a Japanese person in our lab who further refined

the coil and frequency technology after that. And then we had another postdoc who did from Caltech.

Actually, she came from Caltech. And she was called she created another different a new coil

design. So you could say that there was an originator. Yes, I don't remember who was and that

name does ring a bell. Well, we had so many people working on so many different designs and iterations

of it. That I that who knows at this point that there's so many different versions and the overall

point they didn't think opera and same scientific principle. But the different protocols and the

different mechanisms which they operate are very different. So it could be a neural star that could

be this particular manufacturer that had this has this particular problem versus all the ones that

were loving the crafted and carried and built in the lab, you know, so it could be it could be that

different. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you for saying that because I was just I had read that.

So there's there's the Len Oaks protocol, which so so but but yeah, so I didn't know about all

these. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so there's there's been a lot of different machines. And that's

important. It's not just like there's one sort of coil that does it. Okay, multiple, many, many

coils, many different, and not just Stanford, of course, many different. I mean, that Caltech,

not Caltech person, she went to UW. I know MIT's got a lab that does a lot of TMS. There's there's

a lot of the premier institutes have like built their own or contribute to different

different coil designs and different protocols. I mean, right now, there's like only two people

have kind of established there's two really good protocols. But as far as coil designs, I think

there's like two dozen that are really effective. So it's a couple different ones. And of course,

you know, all the particulars from there get more granular on the type of magnetic alloy they use

and all that and all the software and all the other stuff. All right. So this is a good deal

variation. So, again, would you would you like to talk more about what you what you usually

focused on? And maybe we can learn the group can learn a little bit from from what you do.

All right. So what I do, so what I'm doing right now is I am I'm doing I am working last job I had

was essentially working with startups on integrating with large tech companies and

essentially project managing and like strategically and project managing and strategic planning.

So I transitioned a while ago from neuroscience into engineering and I found that there were a

lot of gaps in just not not gaps in just between science and just in the startup world just gaps

between big big corporations and the startup space because I'm used to like, let's just get

things off let's get things off the ground and kind of well, minimal viable product and launch

things from there. So yeah, just kind of and then from that's what the Peter Theo calls zero to one.

And then getting it from one to end that's where most companies are most big corporations are good.

Okay, like we've got a product and scale it up from there. So it's a lot of disconnect trying to

figure like getting the two mindsets together because they are very different mindsets and me

having a technical and engineering background it's like, I can help bring that together. And that's

what I usually try to do and I talk about that in various contexts in around clubhouse and I also

talk about some variety stuff I have a fairly good knowledge of crypto in regards to the technical

aspects as well as talking about randomly on geopolitical and behavioral economic stuff

because that was one of the labs I did research at. So that's a range that's that's what I've done.

That's what I've done. That's what I talk about. It's all it's a lot of fun. Sounds sounds good.

Let me see if I can invite some more folks up here. So it's we're not making Garrett work the

whole time. And also, Jay, how do what are your thoughts?

If you want to speak up, Jay.

So so at the moment I what I've been doing is I've I've invited a bunch of folks to the room,

but I do have some questions. Let's see if I can ask some easy questions. So I okay, so

I am forgetting my questions. Oh, right. Just go just go ahead and go for it. I probably had

it. I'll probably take off in a few minutes. It's a quarter had a long weekend. I'll take

it or go to bed early. So yeah, no, I totally I totally understand we've we've we've you've been

tremendously helpful tonight. And that's totally understandable.

We're consuming a lot of a lot of energy from you today. But thank you very much.

Let's see. So oh, look, we got someone someone came up. So let me just go ahead and pause and

welcome to the stage. Go ahead and tell us about yourself. And what do you what do you want to talk

about? Hi, thank you, Mika and Garrett. I've just stepped into the room. I'm more in listening mode,

but I noticed that this is a subject which I enjoy. I don't know enough about it. Nor am I

technically qualified to speak on it. So for the moment, I'm going to not ask questions, but

what subsume myself into this just being a listener. So thank you Mika for inviting me up,

but I promise to participate as we go along. Wonderful. Wonderful. Yeah, I'm at the point

where like Garrett like I like is probably at the point where we both could like take a

five, 10 minute break, but we need someone else to come here and talk to do that. Well,

well, Garrett can take off. But okay, here we go. We got Ramsey coming.

Welcome Ramsey. Yeah, so I saw the title of the room and haven't been in here for much of the

conversation, but I can kind of guess with context clues that you're talking about some of the cutting

edge technology in brain stimulation devices. Nerve gear. Am I on the right track or can you give

me some pointers here? Oh yeah, absolutely. Great question. So yeah, so so nerve gear is that

is the concept of the next generation, the ultimate brain computer interface that you

you can read and write to the human mind as if the human mind was a special kind of hard drive

and basically change anything or download anything, upload anything that that's the the

ultimate ultimate idealized version of nerve gear. But how we get to there is that's a that's the

hard work. That's what we like to talk about. Okay, maybe I can kind of steer the conversation to

something that relates to the topic, but isn't exactly like this interface that you're imagining,

but there is. So back when I was in Michigan, I was working on some clinical trials on this

new brain stimulation device that treats Alzheimer's, but it can also be used to treat

other conditions. It is a brain stimulation device that uses red and so so infrared and

near infrared light to kind of like basically penetrate through the skull and stimulate the brain

and kind of entrain the brain to fire at a particular frequency. So for example, people with

Alzheimer's, they find that when they use EEGs, when they study people with Alzheimer's with EEGs,

they find that they have a reduction in in the gamma band and the gamma band is associated with

you know, some of the higher order cognition, you know, like insights, creative, creative endeavors.

It's a very high order, you know, condition. So when people are like when people have the aha

moment, you know, when you have that insight, when you're doing something creative, that's

associated with gamma gamma oscillations. And there's a whole suite of, you know, higher order

mental functions that are associated with the gamma band. And you find that people with Alzheimer's

have a very strong staunch reduction in the gamma band. So what they've done is they've designed

this brain stimulation device that uses infrared and near infrared light. And it's basically you

put this device on it's like it's like a helmet, you know, you put this helmet. And then you also

insert an electrode into the nose so you can stimulate like the prefrontal areas kind of like

imagine if you insert an electrode up your nose, you're kind of stimulating stimulating the region

of the brain that is like not accessible directly through, you know, the forehead. So kind of like,

you know, like your orbital frontal cortex, you know, that region. So you can imagine this funny

setup where somebody has an electrode sticking in their nose with a light at the tip of it. And then

on both sides of their temples, they have this electrode with a light. And so these electrodes

have powerful lights that fire at the infrared and near infrared frequency. And so these lights

are supposed to be powerful enough where they can penetrate the skull. And then these lights are

meant to oscillate at the gamma frequency. So when Alzheimer's patients are stimulated with

this brain stimulation device with all it is a light, it's light at the infrared frequency

and the near infrared frequency. And they flicker the light at I think, I think it's like 50 Hertz,

I could be wrong about the exact Hertz, but whatever Hertz is the gamma frequency, the gamma band,

and they flicker the lights at the gamma frequency. And they've found that this treatment actually

has FQC in treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's. And what they found is they, in order to kind of

like come up with an explanation of how it works is through some mysterious mechanism,

we don't know what the mechanism is. Whenever the brain is stimulated by light that's at a

particular frequency. So somehow the neurons detect that they're being stimulated by light

and they will do this thing called entrainment, where they will synchronize with the frequency

that is being stimulated. So I mentioned earlier that people with Alzheimer's have a reduction in

the gamma band in EEGs. So when you stimulate the brain with a gamma frequency and the neurons,

you know, they will tend to synchronize with the gamma with the stimulation. So you're kind of like

training the brain to recapitulate its ability to fire at gamma. And this has been shown to work,

this has been shown through clinical trials, it initially worked in rats. So they developed

this treatment with rats and then through translational research they implemented it

in human clinical trials and it's been shown to work. And there's some other proposed mechanisms,

you know, there might be something involved with mitochondria that stimulated things that the,

with red light kind of might, it causes some changes in the mitochondria and the production

of ATP. And this might kind of enable the neurons to be more efficient at cleaning out the beta

amyloid plaques and tangles and the tau protein. So it might kind of like give the neurons a boost

in their ability to, you know, clean up the gunk that is like clogged up the neurons with the

beta amyloid plaques. But yeah, this is some very cutting edge research, the clinical trials

are currently in progress right now. I don't know if it's been FDA approved quite yet,

I need to double check on that, but there's some pretty fascinating research coming out about this.

Ramsey, can I ask you to restate the last part about, you said the light stimulation was helping

to clear out the plaque, the amyloid beta and the tau proteins? Yeah, there might be some sort of

mechanism with mitochondria and ATP in which red light stimulation does something. We don't know

the exact, maybe somebody, maybe some researcher has elucidated the mechanism, I don't know if

top of my head is the mechanism, but something about red light does something to mitochondria

and increases the production of ATP and this might have something to do with enabling the

neurons to be better at cleaning out the beta amyloid plaques and the tau protein that like

clogs up the neurons pull this gunk. But yeah, this research is still in its infancy,

but the clinical trials are ongoing, people can look it up. I think there's a researcher at

MIT. So is this called photomodulation? Yeah, I think so, I think so. Okay, all right, okay cool,

because I was talking a little about this, I am not that familiar with this, I'm glad someone

is actually came up, this is awesome. You know, if I may just add to this Ramsey at some stage,

I was looking at this photomodulation and apparently it's had great results with combat veterans

in terms of being able to remodel there the trauma that they've had during the combat time.

So this is what I remember reading about.

So I got a question, there is another hypothesis I ran across that in my

actually also stimulates the vasculature because infrared has also been known to stimulate

vasculature in other parts of the body. I gather that hypothesis is not as popular now.

You know, also I've also read research on, this is Shika speaking on red light therapy and

infrared therapy specific wavelengths they've been studied. I believe it's, the reds are 650,

670, 630, those three were particularly studied, there's research papers on them and then the

infrared ones were eight, they were in the 800th and so and the infrared cannot be seen and they

have been shown to help with bone growth and they go directly into the skull. That one is very deep.

The red light is more for surface like circulation and yeah, red light is good for circulation

and the infrared, the deep, the 800 levels like 850, 808 was studied too and these,

that one 808 and they are supposed to help for the brain, tagging off exactly what Ramsey was

saying, I've read about that research. Thank you, I'm done speaking.

Well this is great so far, there's lots of good information. So when Ramsey started, I did see

the immediate connection to photomodulation that Garrett was talking about, but my first impulse

was to consider that we were treating the symptom instead of the cause, but then when

Ramsey said it's also increasing the production of ATP, I was like well that was the cause I was

thinking about. So we went back to, so like the production of energy is what I was sort of

rambling about to Garrett earlier in terms of like my minor hypothesis that the metabolism was

really a root cause of depression and why it's stimulating the brain in all these different

ways was not helping. We have patients with SSRI treatments, psychedelic treatments, TDCS

treatments, TMS treatments, and more that are not responding well, not 100% of patients respond

well and I say well so maybe it's because those patients are depressed because their cells can't

make enough ATP and so if we used photo stimulation to just increase stimulation in part of the

brain and that and you know basically we could you know it's like okay so maybe the brain is

going to clear out the tau protein and the amyloid beta because you're increasing the stimulation

but what if that you know like the real reason that stuff was collecting was because there wasn't

enough ATP being made right and but then but then you're like yeah it then increases the ATP I was

like oh oh whoa so maybe that does address the cause those are my thoughts anyway.

Yeah the research is still very early on I know there's a researcher at MIT I forget her name

it's like it's like a difficult for me to pronounce foreign name but I'll try to dig up her name but

she's at MIT and she initially discovered that this was effective for an Alzheimer's condition

in rats or mice and yeah it's it's worked with rodents and it's cool that they're doing some

translational research to try and implement these treatments in humans and it's really

fascinating to see the state of the research you know have these advancements before our very eyes

and it's very exciting to be alive to see these new developments but I have high hopes that this

treatment might be able to help a lot of people and yeah and who knows how much potential treatments

like this might have because the best part about it is that it's noninvasive you know it's a brain

stimulation but you're not using electric current you're not using magnetic fields you're just using

a light and you're not drilling holes in the skull or anything you're just using a strong enough

light that it can penetrate the skull and it's having success so yeah this is what I'm seeing

I'm done speaking okay so maybe um Shika or Ramsey or anyone else and welcome to the stage

Mary you can you can talk anytime you want just interrupt me if you want and I'll let you take

over um the quick question that I had though was um maybe um uh someone can speak to the the big

differences in between the stimulation you're getting from these machines uh and Shika mentioned

a lot of different frequencies and the red light you get from the sun um would you mind uh click

if you know the answer I'd love to know uh so um the red there's so many different wavelengths in

the sun there's lots of infrared light in the sun that comes from the sun um there's red light um

but there's also um lots of bad bad kinds of light that do damage to us too um and so that's

what I know about that area and um yeah those specific targeted wavelengths that I mentioned

some of them like 808-850 um then the 650 um they are they were particularly studied and

those are also found in the sun so I think that's kind of amazing but um that's all I had to say

about that um Mika thank you I'm done speaking thank you very much this is Mira I really liked

what Ramsey and Shika has been bringing up about um about just photo modulation because I remember

there is a paper I think in 2018 where it talks about reducing tau pathology using near infrared

light and you know they tested that it it does rescue like long-term memory and mice models and

and it's it's pretty promising new treatment if they if they ever get it to clinical trials but I

but I do remember that it um there was a severe limitation in terms of in the synaptic level

and that it doesn't it doesn't rescue it doesn't rescue the effects on long-term

potentiation that that the original beta amyloid plaque already had um so it doesn't it doesn't

reverse any of those effects it just kind of it it it lessens it or that it slows it down

which is which is good in itself and I think that it it has a lot of potential for

for future therapeutic treatments in terms of not only Alzheimer's but also other

other forms of tau pathologies and I think that you know this is it's fascinating because I don't

like I don't generally work in your degenerative diseases but but I I love hearing about it and

I just love this conversation um so there was a there was a a really interesting paper about

new protein synthesis um and Alzheimer's and um and uh it was recent and they were saying that

basically when they um you know in general with Alzheimer's new protein synthesis is is uh there's

a lot less of it happening and you think of it as important for making long-term memories for

long-term potentiation but when they when they treated the the animals to get they get I guess

to get them in chemical to improve their new protein synthesis uh the animals were able to

recall uh their memories better and uh so that was very interesting and then and then I I I said

well what if the new protein synthesis is also an issue and in in Parkinson's disease and and

sure enough there was a study last year where they discovered that it is it's the same there's

there's an issue with new protein synthesis also in Parkinson's so the question is if you

treated animals with Parkinson's with um uh to to induce uh to you know something give them something

to increase their new protein synthesis that would also be another treatment for Parkinson's but but

why that does anyone want to speculate on that and and and how that how might uh photo simulation

affect new protein synthesis well let's let's look at the pathology for Parkinson's that is

dopagenergic pathways production of dopamine and the sustenitonite substantia nigra so it's not

exactly an easy part to the get to because it's not a cortical region it's not an area that's

posted to the skull it's a subcortical good brain region so I guess I feel like we'd have to look at

you know it's uh if I mean as far as infrared or near-infrared who knows if we can actually get

down there by as far as degeneration of social substantia nigra yeah it can the reason why it's

no longer able to work is because the substantia nigra just can pump it its its main job is to

pump out dopamine and then uh it's been all sorts of Parkinson's disease but it essentially pulls a

particular pathway in regards to other motor area motor area and reward circuit areas of the brain

from that from the substantia nigra but it all starts there because once the substantia nigra

starts breaking down then the people start losing motor control without enough dopamine going to

those areas so why protein synthesis well I mean it makes sense because you need the protein synthesis

in order to do in order to build new transmitters as well as repair of repair cells in the

substantia nigra that would be my first that would be my hypothesis for why it would help

sounds great um anyone else have thoughts on that

I guess that's that's like like really like a world-class answer like no one

I think everyone else is like there's no way I can go after that

I try I try I'd be really better if I can do it I should remember what were the motor cortex

areas in the dopatergic circuit then I would be like hey then my then my then my advisor would be

really proud of me um yeah everyone still speeches um maybe we just need a second to uh

uh process yeah processing yeah I mean there's some crazy stuff with Parkinson's trying to treat

Parkinson's um there's like deep people have done like using themselves to restore the substantia

nigra people have done like putting an electrode there it's electrically stimulating the substantia

nigra there's been a lot of stuff a lot of crazy stuff too or and most of it's actually worked

the problem was it's so invasive because how much tissue you have to cut through in order to do

something there so it's kind of one of those difficult it's it's like we they definitely

know that's the trouble spot but it's definitely difficult to treat um and also they know chemically

how to treat it I mean you can give a el dopa which is a dopamine agonist or any of its ilk

and you can and that will actually help restore a lot of function but the problem with el dopa is

that you'll give dopamine to pretty much any other part of the brain and you'll get a lot of other

side effects like um shoot you can get a lot you can get addictive behaviors you can get um

yeah there's a lot of different you can get well you can get excess with dopamine which is

what excessive hand tremors difficulty motor control so there's a bunch of different effects

so you know everyone knows like Parkinson's is kind of well understood it's just it's hard to get to

okay um I guess a follow-up question is it could be um what um is there a part of the

brainstem that's that is is strongly associated with Alzheimer's or is Alzheimer's mostly in the

cerebral uh and in the neocortex yeah I was wondering also um if it's like part of the

where it originates the prefrontal cortex I mean I'm not can't be that but amygdala you know all

these different areas of the brain so nice to have Garrett a neuroscientist in here

or Ramsey Ramsey has a background in it oh you're all already neuroscientists amazing

yeah I'm gonna speak no worries uh from what I work so this is an old this it's it mostly starts

in the midbrain hippocampal regions of the brain that's where you'll start if um what they've done

is it's kind of complicated how we actually know this and because how we know this actually

dictates how much we know understand about progression so the the plaques so what we've

been able to do is that certain certain versions of the the plaques are taggable by pet by using

certain imaging techniques sometimes some people have version of the plaque that's not taggable

but we're some people but there are a couple mutant versions that are taggable and what we've

been able to discover is that the the progression is that it seems to accumulate in the midbrain

where the hippocampus is which is most important for memories then it it it definitely seems it

it accumulates there is some accumulation in the other cortical area so we're talking like speech

motor reasoning planning vision processing all and all that sort of stuff but it's very little

as people get older it definitely seems to accumulate over time and it definitely and

worse if there seems there is a shrinkage of mass that there's a shrinkage of cortical mass that

occurs with the entire brain so and it does in this and this is of course the late stage of the

disease so much so that you actually when they do an autopsy compared to a normal brain you can

actually see how shriveled is you don't even need to put on a scale at that point so there is a

so essentially it starts in the midbrain memory is the first thing that's obviously effective but

then it bit I would I hate I did spreading is not the quite the right word it's just the proliferation

of the towel proteins and the beta amyloid plaques it just it it becomes more pervasive

as the disease progresses that's probably the best way to describe it what we understand about it

and of course whether that actually causes the brain to shrink or the brain shrinks in response

to that that's a whole other question but doesn't seem to progress as well as time goes on and of

course that could be because cells are dying off at the same time it's it's hard a little hard to

know there's a little bit of cause and effect we don't understand with that thank you very much

that um yeah this is very interesting that's what's a nasty disease it's a terrible disease yeah and

that's why it's hard to diagnose from an imaging scan at the beginning because if you don't have

that mutant plaque it can't people can't tag it and it's invisible um people are working on

different scanning techniques just see if they can get to survive the towel proteins for the beta

amyloid plaques in a different way but i haven't seen anything promising yet on finding it and of

course by the time you spot it on a scanner in a late stage you the persons have already had enough

behavioral problem behavioral and cognitive issues that you would not have needed a scanner to pick

it up so it's it's one of those yeah so of course in the last thing you want to do is take a biopsy

of someone's brain to take a look what's going on yeah it's difficult to diagnose

and spooky yeah great i was going to say an interesting topic is is uh is the different ways

that um uh that that's technology is being used to diagnose uh these uh these diseases for for uh

just just a quick example um um there's a computer program that that has been used to

detect dementia based upon how quickly um the patient can respond to uh you know something

coming i guess it's i guess it's maybe something is moving towards you and you're supposed to either

move out of the way or or and if if you are moving too slowly that that might be a a

science your doctor that um that you have a have a symptom that uh is in is part of the

diagnosis that they want to consider um but um i'm so what i guess my question is what um what

have you seen in terms of maybe vr or technology or you know using using uh neural networks to

analyze like the the the gate a person's gate uh their walk um to or to using like a a watch to

monitor biorhythms or or head worn devices to um um detect their their blood flow and their their

brain activity to try to detect um there's actually a lot in this area uh adam gazaleo

used at university california san francisco is doing a lot of research is doing a lot with this

in order to as a not just as a detection well both as a detection early diagnosis method with vr

but also as a therapy and then um there's a i mean like i said there's a lot of people

before using all sorts of wearable biometrics and as you mentioned ai using um ai using reaction

time the thing you were referring to is decision time reaction time that is definitely one of the

early science for dementia or cognitive impairment so yeah there's a lot in that space um multiple

researchers are definitely working on that adam gazaleo just comes to mind because um i mean he

was on clubhouse too recently so i see that we already all my information's coming from clubhouse

to see there's just i gotta work on that a little bit but yeah but um there's a lot of researchers

who are working in this area because it would because doing a full caught a full suite of cognitive

tests is usually extremely expensive and also can't be done that often versus what you're

always thinking you're mentioning from the mobile tests to the vr tests to like the wearables

is a lot cheaper and a lot more frequent to do and can catch these type of issues a lot sooner so

there definitely is a lot of interest in that considering the size and scope of the problem

that everyone will run into as they get older maybe you can talk also from a business perspective

what what how bigger the opportunities for companies who are considering investing in

in this kind of tech uh i can't speak to the business opportunities right now because my

brain is starting to get really sorry to get tired but it but it is it is huge i mean look at the

baby boomer population uh we look at our gender i mean the millennial generation the both huge

gigantic large populations that are going to get all the dimensions that we're gonna get you know

it's some sort of cognitive impairment as we i mean that's just to break down the the science

because that's what's coming to mind right now because after age after after after age 30 we kind

of hit our our cognitive plateau that we have a kind of cognitive pinnacle so to speak there are

some things that do increase over time like the amount of knowledge that we gain the experience

that we gain those do increase there's no doubt about that but the reaction time our memory our

ability to our working memory all those things decline so 40 and afterward there's a slow decline

but there's also seems to be an agreement from a lot of aging researchers that about

well you know 60 70 afterward the aging the decline starts to accelerate now there are a

lot of factors that can um there are a lot of factors that can of course change the trajectory

of it or for most people that accelerates quite a bit and there's a lot of health factors

contributing to the decrease and of course i mentioned some things earlier people who in the room

earlier like lifestyle factors could change that quite a bit but the main fact but the main thing

is is that everyone everyone who grows older runs into this there is no person that is an

80 year old who has the mental and flourishing i would say cognitive speed and capabilities of a

20 year old it's just not it doesn't it's the it's not there unless that 20 year old is somehow

cognitively deficient in some way then that evens it up quite a bit but we're talking on an average

median an average or median 20 year old versus an average median 80 year old there is definitely a

huge difference um so and then we're looking so we're looking at the population statistics

population is that baby boomers are already hitting that millennials will hit that and then you're

looking at the international populations i mean the chinese population is already hitting that

with their older generation and then the single child up and coming generation will hit that

eventually uh japan has already hit that because they have an aging population uh i don't know

where india is at in regards to their and versus their generation of cycles but they will they

already have the degree of it so they it's it's it's it's it's a common error common problem as

we all get older the only thing we have not been able to improve is the cognitive improvement

now do i have numbers on this right now no are the numbers easy to get yes so i can encourage

people to google it because i am tired right now i can't recall the numbers but the numbers are

there because if you can just look at the rate of how many with the current percentage of people

with Alzheimer's in the us today over 65 boom it's it's a pretty it's a pretty well understood

number and then we can get like by 2050 how many people left what's the what is that percentage

going to look like over 65 you need etc etc and it's just it'll get bigger because work there are

more people so i think a major emerging concern for people who have uh for that's the major

emerging health concern for a lot of people is going to be questions about long covid in terms of

like uh this has directly related to what you just said so you're talking about like basically

aged blood vessels and in an aged lymphatic system where the degrading of the endothelial

lining and the destruction of the ACE2 receptors caused uh maybe permanent effects in terms of

vasoconstriction and the rigidity of of the blood vessels and lymphatic system the kinds of things

you see uh when people age um and so maybe you can speak to long long covid and and rapid aging

and and and what we can do to treat ourselves and and what that means well there's a lot the jury's

still out what's happening with that because i read the numbers too it's like one out of three

you're still suffering from cognitive issues from long cope from after long covid and this is

even after they have like after the vaccine and they have a whole suite of like uh court

steroids and other sorts of medications used to treat them they still have some sort of cognitive

effects afterwards we and you mentioned a lot of good things in there because there's a lot of

there's a lot of hypotheses like the brain either the virus attacking ACE2 receptors in the form

from the through the sinus onto the brain or because of the vasculature or because of chronic

inflammation there's still a lot but no on the particular elements of that and because of that

we don't know what the long even longer term elements of that are so all i've been saying is

this is is this i is what i've been reading about sustained healthy and to um and to get help when

needed because there is a lot of cognitive revealed cognitive rehabilitation specialists the brain is

plastic despite it slowing down well into our later years there's still a lot of neurogenesis

neuroplasticity that happens and that's the best thing you can offer at this point because

unfortunately i'm rendering my bedtime i'm i'm slowing down i have to take one more question

before i start i start crapping out so i will just say the last thing about the covid questions

we need to keep eyes on the research as we track long haulers with cognitive issues and see how

they continue to respond to rehabilitation to additional drugs and medication and see and track

if they do start developing other sorts of long term cognitive impairments or cognitive issues

because of their battle with battle with covid

uh if no one has one last question i have one last question let me just

okay i guess it's me um so uh what the steroids uh what the steroids i guess will they reduce

inflammation and oxidative stress um and will they also like improve improve blood flow and

vascular dilation and also um are they going to improve basically the um the the the the the

plasticity of the cell walls are basically you know how like the cell walls are the rigid the

rigidity situation which is which is the aging situation of cell walls and blood vessels

well i can tell you right at the bat i do not know i am i am not a pharmacologist you know

enough about the dynamics of steroids to understand what the glucose steroids will do to the neural

to the neurons or to even what will do to bring neurological tissue i usually that's when i say

i gotta go talk to my neuroenterologist to find out okay so i i cannot answer that question

all right it's something i can look up later i guess but thank you very much anyone else have

that anyone else want to say anything all right well i'm glad i've been helpful to

illuminate a couple of things and share and share a few good laughs and and and here's some good

and and help get some wisdom out there so i will catch you guys another time peace out wonderful

thank you gary have a great night all right i guess i can reset the room uh people you can

talk about anything you want uh the the general topics uh are neurophysics brainwaves brain

oscillations neural circuits nerve gear artificial intelligence and ask any question or talk about

anything that's been interesting to you this might be really off like off topic but um so you

know i'm into quantum physics i'm happy psychic somewhat of a psychic like tendencies you know

and so that goes with you know energy and physics and so with i want to tie that into neurophysics

and see if you know you guys experts mika or um dilla if i don't know your background but if you

guys have anything to add about that because i'm trying to figure out these things you know

about myself because like how to use your psychic like how to use these things it's not really

generally taught like it's not mainstream taught you have to figure it out on yourself and you learn

like you learn you know it's something you just kind of grew up with you know and there's no training

for it so all right um so i kind of want to ask you though because um oftentimes people will will

ask well what about neurophysics what about um quantum physics in the brain and um and i

have many thoughts and i've read a lot and uh so there are things that i can say but but i think

what i want to do this time is maybe listen a little bit more about um what are the answers

that you're hoping to hear and um what are the answers you're looking for so maybe that maybe

go a little deeper um i guess um kind of like kind of um where it's like coming from in the brain

and then sometimes oh yeah so it turns off when i have alcohol you know i don't i don't drink

really at all but i notice that when i have wine like even just one glass of wine the next day i can't

i can't read things as well and so um you know of course we know that alcohol kills brain cells

but i'm curious about this and i feel like this is a safe space to ask so this is the first time i

asked this to like a scientist you know like yourself i've never asked like i've never felt

comfortable to really ask um a technical person in my life and so um yeah i just felt comfortable

so i just kind of wanted to that's yeah i don't really have a detailed um exactly a detailed

question but i can form that since i feel comfortable with you and i followed you and so um you know

what i mean uh okay um sure um well um so i mean i guess so so um i guess so so

um i i think i'm well i guess i'm what i am trying to narrow down sort of like um

because because uh there was a guy a scientist who proposed a way that quantum effects could

affect memory and um and um but it doesn't it's um it doesn't uh directly connect to

some of the other ideas of memory and so there's that um and there and then there's people who

talk about you know how basically um you know the quantum the quantum uh range is a is a frequency

range uh i mean not i'm sorry i i misspoke um maybe i'm getting tired i definitely am but so no the

quantum range is is uh like we're talking about very small things right this is this is common

knowledge and um we're talking about things that happen at a very small scale and um and uh but

they're happening everywhere they're happening everywhere in the brain um and when we talk about

you know basically like so uh a neuron has um has a an electric has a has a has a has a gradient

an electric gradient and that electric gradient uh um you know it's like where are the positive

and negative charges if they're if they're very far apart then uh that neuron is going to uh that

neuron needs to reach equilibrium it needs to balance itself and those those positive negative

charges those positive negative ions um those are those are um you know we're we're we're at the

quantum range right there right we're at the we're at the range of um of of of atoms and electrons

and and particles um and electromagnetism we're we're there we're at that frequency i guess um

um but i mean but still it's it's it's it's i don't know if so but then there was this guy so

there there was this guy who um i guess uh let me pull up his name real quick so if you look at

the wikipedia for um it's a really interesting article for neurophysics okay look at the wikipedia

for neurophysics i know it's great that this is like the name of the of the group and i'm

saying you go to this wikipedia it's it's actually i love it i'm going to write down the name i have

my notes ready yeah so um so so it go to the wikipedia article for neurophysics which is

just so so ironic that uh that's where we're we're going to try to answer this question so um uh so

the guy the guy's name is hands burger and uh so he thought that um there was a story about hands

burger so um so there was a there was a woman who had the stream that her boyfriend fell off a horse

and she wrote a letter about it right and the exact moment when she had the stream that her

boyfriend had fallen off a horse um her boyfriend had also fallen off the horse

in a had fallen off a horse in a different part of the world and um but there was no way

that she could have received a letter um from her boyfriend uh with enough time for for her to

have um have written a letter the only way that she could have the the the the the the scientist

hands hands burger uh thought the only way that she could have um had a dream about him falling

off the horse at the exact same time at the exact same time that he fell off the horse because this

is like before the internet right before telephones uh and um so he so he thought the only way she

she could have had the stream at the same time was because of telepathy so he went and started

measuring he started uh he went and and he tried to to figure out what what um you know what was

going on in the brain with uh uh with with uh in terms of uh electromagnetic phenomena right

what what what what's going on can we measure the electricity of the brain this was the question

and so he developed he helped uh develop the first EEG measurements and uh so he's a famous

neuroscientist but what he but what he discovered um unfortunately at the time was that um the EEG

signals were worked were they didn't have enough power to to go anywhere outside the uh the skull

itself um they just they're very low power signals so EEG by itself was not uh going to be a way for

that um telepathy could happen and uh so uh at that point in time uh neuroscience uh i

forgot about the idea of telepathy and they said well that that can't be right and and then of

course you know like well now then a long time later uh people started talking about telepathy

again because uh they started talking about you know teleportation from from from quantum

entanglement and uh and i don't know enough about that to uh to uh okay it's it's really it's it's

like i so i i mean i don't know enough about that to really give you to really um say that that is

possible or isn't possible um with uh between two brains is it's just uh yeah i think on this you

know we're always still learning about the brain and um i think this is an area which um has yet

to have some deep research and into it to really understand but um yeah that was so interesting

what you shared um but yeah i mean this is this oh okay i'll let you talk to her no i was just

gonna say it was so interesting what you shared about the telepathy between the couple

and then how the EEG machine came out but then they couldn't it's that's not something you can

use to measure really telepathy it has its own use i think well i mean it's but it was really like

he was it's just interesting that he was trying to to to uh discover the mechanism of telepathy

by measuring EEG and and then came he then came to that um to the uh to the idea that to the

conclusion at the time that uh that in i think it's still the dominant conclusion that uh there's

no mechanism that heat that we can see uh that does telepathy in the brain but um but it's cool

to think about and maybe yeah maybe like we're talking about stuff research that people will do

100 years from now uh is that's how far it's how far how it is i i don't know wow that is like

that is like so far out i mean i'll never know then in my lifetime i i just made that up i mean i

don't know when we'll get when when uh people will probably disprove those ideas

they're fun ideas i mean i'm so like i'm also wondering about the frequency i feel like you

know um maybe it's like a certain brain frequency that helps you that like there are certain times

when you can like that psychic power is turned on you know what i mean like when we were talking

about the gamma rays and all of that before i think in the theta waves i mean it's it's it's

it's really like it's uh it's sort of out of my ballpark to speculate on on psychic phenomena

really i i i i i don't have a lot to say um

i so i i mean i think there are okay so i think there are basically some explanation some possible

explanations for the experiences that people have that are really surprising and that uh you may

that you may um you know you might like some people might say okay well this is this is the

only possible explanation is psychic phenomena but i think that like often there are alternative

possible explanations that that that might also work and that might not be related to psychic

phenomena um and um so but so like for for example like there was there was some connection between

uh the two people who so i mean it's okay so like um so i don't know the whole story about because

that was a really old story about um the the girlfriend who who had the dream and and the guy

who fell out the horse but um so i had this experience where i i had this intuition with

that my grandmother was going to die soon and she did um and um and and and but the thing is like

i also think that it's possible that people who are connected can sort of like like i could like

if you are if you're next to somebody long enough you can begin to learn their their

circadian rhythm right you could be not just their circadian rhythm you could begin to learn

their rhythms like their behavior rhythms your mind will just remember uh the frequency at which

they do certain things maybe at the unconscious level maybe most of most of understanding other

people's frequencies are at the unconscious level and um and and maybe uh so you have so you and some

other person um you like have you ever like you think of of someone else's name and and and right

after that they call you and and you think wow that that is that is that there must be some

there could be some some sort of psychic connection there but the other possibility there

is that is that um you you were both listening to each other's rhythms and you both made an

unconscious agreement that at some certain point your brains made this unconscious agreement

at some point you were gonna you're gonna try to reach out and connect with each other um

um and uh and and then at a certain at a certain uh time and it's not it's not like a it's not like

a time in terms of like you know um May 16th that at six o'clock pm that your brain is thinking

about it's thinking about in terms of like uh you know 2000 cycles of of this abstract rhythm

that that the brain is just sort of calculating and you're not really like um it's not even coming

up to the conscious level but you have this like at certain at a certain point in time you both um

you both uh start thinking of each other and you both uh reach out to connect to connect

to each other because it's like it's like it's like a synchronized clock where you're both

planning to connect at that time again and um and so even though I don't have a way to prove

that that is the case what I'm just saying like just by that story itself there is an alternative

explanation for why two people could have the same idea at the same time and it's because the their

brains um uh made an agreement at an unconscious level to think of of each other at at a certain

time based upon a deep a deep understanding of each other's uh biorhythms and um so just the

fact that there is another possible explanation uh just um is is is just uh uh something to consider

at least thank you all for speaking and thanks for answering my question best you could

sure sure so um I'm of the school thought that the probabilistically speaking to create a

synchrony among large numbers of neurons to fire in search of pattern seems very difficult but

having said that uh I've been in a situation where like there'll be several people in a room and they

yawn at the same time and this could be just a biased observation but have you experienced

like this and is there a kind of a study into why uh such things happen?

um I just wanted to add that you know I also I feel like people can catch people's energies you

know there's a bioelectron there's an electromagnetic biofield um hippies call it aura but then it's

also scientifically proven um that there's an energy field around us there there's been some

like research that it's around 15 feet before they thought it was smaller but new research

is saying that it's 15 feet and so I think that being in the same room as the same person I also

catch on people's vibes very quickly and so that's what I had to add to that and um I've

done speaking thank you Mika what do you have to say about Carl's um what Carl had to say

uh well you're both bringing up interesting thoughts um right now because I am reading a

book called uh Rhythms of the Brain um uh at the moment and and that book talks a lot about

um the fact that we in order for our thoughts to um in order for our thoughts and behaviors

to be coordinated we need uh we need a conductor but there needs to be like basically like um

uh essential like almost like a centralized rhythm maker that is like a like the conductor

of an orchestra that is is like you know okay this happens and this happens and then this happens

and they have to happen at the right time in order for things to work and so their has their

the brain has to be like you know with its electromagnetic field basically um not only it's

not it's not it's not enough that we have uh one part of us that is generating thing and we have a

bunch of different parts of us that are generating things but all these all these things have to

together sort of like have a sort of um have a there's sort of like a high level agreement or

a sort of democracy of all these different components where at at at the high the high level uh

macroscopic um behavior is giving feedback to and balance to all the different microscopic

behaviors across the whole brain and and so there's this there's uh there's uh micro there's uh

really small behavior and there's macroscopic behavior and there's this cycle between them

that that each they're each acting on each other they're each balancing itself uh the the other

the the macro is bouncing the micro and and and the micros are changing the macro and and um it is

it is um it's sort of like well and then what and so we're talking about you know the bio the

bio field which um you know I guess that's that's that's this that's interesting um and because um

you know you would think that uh that and and you know maybe the the the behavior of an electrical

system within the brain in terms of um and by the way uh hello to IO do you do you want to

jump in here in the middle of what I'm saying you can yeah yeah I can comment a little bit so

like my team does measurements of electromagnetic signals of genetic molecules like viruses and

DNA RNA we found that they behave very much like fractal antennas so antennas can tune into fields

for the distance and so this kind of idea of telepathy I don't think is that far off from

antennas and signals and uh that's kind of uh you know we just need a very precise and sensitive

measuring equipment but there are basically fields that are emitted by people and you can

actually characterize somebody and identify them from their electromagnetic signature alone it's

as unique as your fingerprint in fact that signal contains the information from your genome it may

be messy and very uh noisy but the signal is there so if these molecules behave like antennas

then the whole system kind of resonates or oscillates and so that that would be my uh

my contribution at this point um could you can could you put on a paper to what what you're

saying so that there's I mean that's profoundly interesting but you said the biofield uh is

identifiable it exists and is unique to the underlying structure so if you have a sequence

let's say ACTG and then I have ACTT I can tell the difference between the two just by their

electromagnetic signature in fact how they move and behave and so on can also be characterized in

fact in a very similar way to radar we just got awarded a hundred thousand dollar prize for our

work and now we're racing to bring it to market so basically it's like a wireless genome sequencer

or pathogen detector that uses these waves and we can tell the difference between you know two

very similar strains of a virus so wanting to trace the various variants out there of COVID-19

as possible we can also extract the sequence information itself from these systems as well so

it's quite uh it's quite cutting edge so we don't have a publication out although we are

getting ready to release a few publications one of them will probably be in IEEE but

on my Twitter you can watch the little pitch video that we we had for our company so

um but that's closer to like extra extra crystallography it's not so much the

communication information but just um as to the shape of the molecules no

uh it's more of a resonance phenomenon which is what we suspect so it's not only the

waves like the where you call spectroscopy it's not it's not similar to that it's a little bit

different but it's like a you require an array of sensors to be able to detect these signals

and then using something similar to a multi input multi output array of sensors you can make this

kind of characterization that was so fascinating carl and io thank you so much for sharing

um so my you can't see you can't see my face but my jaw has just just been on the floor

or just listening i'm just like my jaw dropped i'm listening to to eric is eric osoliskies

yeah uh oh this is amazing i i like i would like to if you want to talk about this for an hour

the floor is yours i mean i just uh would you mind uh so i was specifically how is um

um can you dive more deep more deeply into how you said um did you say bacteria was like an

antenna it is is a neuron also like an antenna uh well the the underlying structure the genetic

structure the dna RNA all these different molecules uh you hit them with an electromagnetic

what electromagnetic wave they absorb some radiation they allow some radiation to uh

permeate through them they reflect some radiation and from those kinds of processes you can

characterize each nucleotide and if you have an array in the same way that a pixel grid

on a camera can photograph something and tell you what the structure is imagine it being something

similar to radar in the sense that we're sending out different electromagnetic waves and using

something like beam forming which is present on the current uh starlink satellite system

you see the dish there it doesn't actually matter where you point it because the dish is able to

exploit uh phase uh what is it called uh phase phase shift temporal shift and spatial shift

so you're able to accompany all of those parameters and using that you can extract a

lot of the information and if you have a wide enough grid the more resolution the more accurate

and right now we're able to do it to about a single nucleotide which is

more impressive than I ever thought was possible within my lifetime okay so um from what I understand

from that uh you're you're you're sending you're you're sending uh something like an em wave or a

beam to to hit the and then um and then uh it is something do it with the the the nucleotide

uh material is is interfering with the the uh the beam in in such a way that if you have uh that you

can you can predict its structure if you have if you have like a like an array set up um I that's

that you know that reminds me a little a little bit of um like electrical impedance tomography

just a little bit because the electricity will will flow through different materials at different

speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can um you can basically uh plot a grid and notice where

the coincidences in slowdowns uh between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you

can plot out an image um so it sounds like it's like a kind of tomography these molecules these

molecules tend to resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have uh

uh uh what is it called when you have harmonics but they go downwards instead of upwards so you

have that kind of effect as well it kind of spreads out in both directions and then you

can make characterizations across almost entire spectrum so depending on what kind of circuitry

you have and what kind of signals you can send you can make certain uh qualifications of these

signals quantifications it's it's quite impressive it was mind-blowing to me that we could even do it

and our goal right now is to do it for about 50 bucks which is uh crazy because the hardware that

we use in the lab is about a quarter of a million dollars so uh trying to break it down a few orders

of magnitude is actually quite possible again through uh a bunch of tricks that are more machine

learning based but uh basically doing something similar to computational photography where you

leverage machine learning to increase the resolution or resolution capability of a low cost

sensor by training in tandem with a high resolution sensor

does the sample have to be crystallized form or can it be in vitro uh it can be within the cell

and it can be outside of the cell so we can have like so far we've been doing mixed samples and

pure samples so we're able to do both case scenarios which again is is kind of crazy so

even if you don't have cells that have um like been filtered out and you only have the virus

isolate um we're able to also identify it in a mixed signal where you just have a bunch of cells

and you don't know if they have the virus or not and we were able to tell the difference between

cells that have a particular virus versus another one in fact work done at Purdue University also

showed that they were able to use um something like Doppler radar to distinguish pathogens so you

can look up Doppler radar pathogens Purdue University and you'll find their reference

ugly enough they wrote in their article that oh it's so exciting because we're the only ones doing

it and our team was chuckling because uh we didn't publicize it because we're racing to market not

racing to publication so very good uh so yeah so that was the February was it February 24th

scientists use Doppler to pair inside cells well yeah probably at Purdue University it's a guy who

standing in front of a table i think that's kind of the image that they have yep uh i genomics

with the handheld DNA sequencer researchers to go handheld sequencer like he's standing in front

of the table there's lights integrated circuitry oxford nanopore sequencing so so that's so

their concept is vaguely similar to what what you guys are doing yeah somewhat yeah okay um

the so but you mentioned that the the the DNA is like uh is so the DNA and you're not so you're

not referring to well i guess you said viruses to you're detecting viruses but uh so but then you

you mentioned a satellite a satellite dish right did satellite dish exploits phase shift temporal

shift and what was the other one spatial temporal and phase shift so spatial temporal and phase oh

okay that's kind of what they use for um like reception if you google memo m i m l uh that's

kind of the principle that they use there so your phone can actually have reception in areas

that are noisy so how do you pass a signal through a noisy or perhaps shielded region and that's how

you do it you kind of modulate these different parameters okay so okay can you explain uh

this is a super primitive question because i usually think about the brain is just having

like temporal and spatial frequencies but um but but but uh maybe someone else can argue

that the brain has temporal spatial and phase frequencies but what is what is phase uh in this

context uh it's uh shifting the frequencies so instead of sending like 450 gigahertz you spend

you send 451 or you modulate between 400 and 451 and you do it in increments of 20 megahertz

and as you do that you generate a data set that is this curve and then you shift that within

the space so you move over one pixel or something and then you can also do two of them simultaneously

but different positions and various combinations thereof so that you can actually get your signal

through and kind of extract as much of the signal as you can um yes good that's possible

my understanding is that uh when you shine a coherent beam to a sample um the the beam would

actually uh be reflected and the reflected signal would be uh in mixture of the original signal in

phase and uh some component that's going to be phase shifted relative to the original phase of

the beam that was shined upon it it's just the general behavior of anything that uh anything

that you um see in it's a general phenomenon so i think that's what you mean by uh phase shift

and you can actually clean some information by looking at the degree of phase shift in the

reflected signal or refracted signal i think that's what you mean yeah uh not quite because we're

not using a beam like any sort of optical system we're using just radio waves so um i would just

say it's more like radar and the phase shifts uh it's kind of like throwing an orange ball from

the left hand side and throwing a blue ball from the right hand side and if you throw the left one

then the right one or the right one on the left one you sort of the both uh you throw one or not

the other and vice versa you do those all those kind of measurements or those kinds of signals

and reflections and transmissions uh allows you to cut away in a very non-linear way at

what the signal is so uh and the signal is what we claim has the information about the structure

encoded in it but the main principle relies on this resonance phenomena we presume it's a resonance

phenomenon but you know that's just a simple claim that all matter has electromagnetic properties

so it's basically just molecular radar if you want to think about it yeah that was just reminding

me that there is actually discussion of um doing phase shifting in um in AFNIRs that i

it's a head blanked out on uh but basically um yeah they all they're alternating uh different

frequencies uh to get to construct an image uh with with function there for its spectroscopy um

so yeah it's like well i had i had that information in my head but i hadn't uh connected it together

uh anyway uh but do you have more so so um uh shika was talking about like okay so if you

have a bunch of and actually maybe it was Carl who said this but there's a bunch of human beings

in in a room and they all start yawning at the same time um so uh it was brought up that human

beings have a biofield and um that and then um and then the idea is is that well uh our DNA

and maybe maybe our viruses i'm not clear maybe our viruses maybe our bacteria uh can act as

antennas that can pick up the signals of other people's biofields um is that correct do you

believe that um and and and maybe how how how might that work i'm just interested uh yeah yeah

that is kind of how it works they all tend to exhibit uh different properties bacteria have

a peculiar property of having a thin film which kind of shifts the frequency so you get a phase

shifts at the membrane and then another phase shifts upon reflection back through the the same

membrane or transmission through the membrane uh but they're able to see enable or they're able

to see within side of a cell to be able to even characterize whether it's pathogenic so uh work

done by dark of the radio bioprogram also sought to understand the relationship between uh organic

or living matter kind of like dna rna and its relationship to the spectrum and how certain

therapies and other thing it basically sounds like you're building an energy weapon

i couldn't like give you cancer from far away or virus from far away and that's actually not that

far away from the truth of what's currently capable or possible with the technology so

uh we do actually do a documentary called water memory it's a controversial documentary by uh

or about a french uh scientist who actually discovered that aids was caused by hiv when

they're nobel prize for this um and his lab actually discovered that hiv itself ltr 104h

or whatever it was had a unique spectral signature and they were able to reconstitute it using

just the pcr process so a ribosome a bunch of letters a few primers and then all you're doing

is you don't actually have the virus as a source you're just stimulating the sample with the signal

and the ribosome was able to reconstruct 97 percent of this virus and even though it's very

controversial the unfortunate thing is is in the naming of this paper in this work that was the

only controversy because they called it uh dna teleportation which is uh already a keyword in

physics so they were just laughed out of the room and for the longest time i was like is this possible

is this bullshit was this guy lying people told me that like you know there's nobel laureates

have the distortion field that they say everything they say ridiculous things and people disagree

with them because they have a nobel prize and then we actually did the experiments and i was like holy

fuck i can't believe that it actually worked i can't believe this is possible what the hell's

wrong with these people turns out that you know shanghai genetics genomics institute i think hired

him so they were like yeah yeah you come work in china don't worry about it the russians are also

working on this i know because i know some people work in the russian academy of sciences and we

wanted to collaborate with them and our government here in canada did not allow us because of that

chernobyl incident we were told that if i tried to fly to uh russia i would be arrested at the

airport here because i was also trying to bring like vr technology and do all these other things

and have a technology transfer so then our university can also collaborate with collaborate

with them and there was so much political friction that it became unfeasible and impossible

wow i'm so i'm like looking up right now the effects of like electric magnetic and

electromagnetic fields on on bacteria um but but and so and you've you've also confirmed that this

is is is is the uh electromagnetic fields are affecting dna and rna correct like by changing

they're changing the phase shift so this is so this is research i can look up i guess is what

you're saying yeah some of it some of it is a little bit more difficult to to find but i think

there's um there's an episode of voices from dartbar where you can hear them talking about a

little bit about this but it's it's very difficult to find any information about this because it's

a branch of radar technology and that kind of technology is heavily regulated kind of like

their weapons so the knowledge is kind of uh very restricted or very like access is somewhat difficult

so like it was difficult to learn anything about radar when i was first trying to understand

or figure out this problem like there was like one set of lectures and a few books and most of the

resources that i was able to get was uh through the uh the pirate data of the enough and most of

the servers were hosted in universities uh near military bases so i was like what is this kind of

weird like you guys are hosting a book about radar technology in a server near a military base in the

u.s i was like this seems like some sort of uh there's like that in a honeypot or something

but uh using those texts and uh reading about it more allowed me to advance closer to this problem

so a very weird almost conspiracy like journey that i've had yeah i mean i noticed that like i

have a tremendous amount of knowledge about um uh different uh brain computer interfaces and

companies but but the experience of you know people um like i'm in a bubble somehow because

like i realized that other people want to know about brain computer interfaces they don't have

the foggiest idea and they can't find out like they they can't find information about it i don't

know why but it's like their their experience of reality is is different and maybe it's because

they're they're personal google search habits or something i don't know but yeah always do an

anonymous google search uh in fact uh i i never just used one source so uh you know you have to

use a few sources but it's it's it's definitely difficult some things can be shielded like

sometimes my partner is able to find something that i can't and only after i go into incognito

and anonymous mode and all these other things on another search engine i end up finding it so uh

other times the results don't even show up so i'll know of a website that has this information

but you can't get to it through a google search so there's definitely something fishy going on but

i don't i don't fault them for it because it is quite dangerous like uh like if you uh if you

paid attention to Haiti about two years ago there was some sort of energy weapon acoustic or electromagnetic

that resulted in the ambassadors having brain damage uh in their uh was it white matter in their

brain cohere or congruent with um concussion but they didn't have concussions and so it's

not beyond the scope of this kind of technology to do those kinds of things to hurt people so

it's uh it's quite dangerous like the the joke that i have about our technology is you know you

have a movie like 12 monkeys where the guys walk around the airport in the airplane with a virus

in his pocket well i could be walking around with a transceiver that is emitting this kind of viral

signal and the virus will spontaneously form within your own body because you have all the

building blocks to do it so it's uh it gets kind of crazy like your body is always having these

components of r and a dna broken parts of cells flowing through like your body's filtering this

but if we have the right kind of signal at the right time in the right place and we repeat it

for long enough statistically these molecules have a higher probability if you can bias the

field that they're occupying it's such a mess i mean like now like okay well how do i walk around

is some sort of you know fairy day cage from now on yeah yeah yeah basically like that's that's

what that that's actually the first thing that we actually addressed was well how can you develop

a countermeasure for this can i now develop a device that is you know a frontline worker or

warfighter you know new theater of war is able to wear on their person and not only detect a new

pathogen in an environment but also send out the correct carrier wave or signal that prevents them

from becoming infected from this virus so there's there's there's all sorts of things that you want

to work on wow so the implications of this is is that um you could you could detect you could

wirelessly detect a virus in an environment just by like leaving a device and if it if that virus

appears in the doorway or something you you'll you might detect it precisely that like like like

like a hundred like a hundred thousand dollar investment why wasn't your company given like a

tent that your company's gonna be doing dollar company that like why wasn't it a ten million

dollar investment uh it's uh it might be a hundred million dollar investment in a few months so we're

working on this story there's also a lot of like bias you know Elizabeth Holmes the kind of friction

that she created with her bullshit about look our sensor can do this we've had we like responsibly

we've done the responsible thing and kind of gone through and done the science and kind of estimated

we've been very um you know very determined in fact uh when we contacted uh some places uh

like DARPA of all places who inspired us to work on this and they even uh when I reached out to them

they said yeah come on send us your application I sent them the application they said you can't do it

you don't have the technology you can't do it and it's not possible and then my approach to that

and this is kind of a testament to how stubbornness can sometimes play a bigger role than talent or

persistence uh my response was well you know challenge accepted I'm gonna show you and so we

worked really hard and our team was able to have non-trivial results that were uh quite impressive

and now we're just trying to move forward because it it basically presents the future where you'll

have a device a size of a thermometer infrared thermometer that we call a pathometer that you

can put to your head or put to your skin or even aim in an area and be able to characterize the

pathogen content or other aspects of that area so it's uh it's quite exciting

so this is called an infrared thermometer

well no like like an infrared infrared thermometer revolutionized the last century

we have something that we're calling a pathometer and we're aiming to the same kind of form

factor so handheld device 40 50 box max that can tell you within a second whether you have

covid or not and you can measure yourself many times a day kind of like you do with the thermometer

because right now the rapid testing that exists is limited by the very nature of the consumables

that are required which during the pandemic can become quickly consumed what's the what's the

etymology of the word pathometer what was it constructed from pathogen meager so it tells you

it's able to meager or measure how much of a pathogen there is if you have a better name please

i'm open for suggestions but that's kind of the easiest way to think about it no that's super

cool that's super cool i was just wondering what what a minute you'd like to pre-program the

signature that you're looking for yes it's not a uh scan for all is it uh it is able to scan for

all so the whole point is that you are able to extract sequence information although we can just

very quickly you give me the signal or you even give me just the sequence i can synthesize the

virus measure or estimate its signal just from that informational loan so there's some theoretical

calculations we can perform in some empirical calculations and then that could be sent out if

this device was integrated let's say into every cell phone everyone all of a sudden could know

whether they have covid or not in fact the recent pixel 4 xl and pixel 4 non-xl had something known

as the soli sensor which is a small little radar chip and in fact the team that we're working with

helped to develop that radar chip and so that's kind of the technology that we're building on

something that already exists in a phone and integrated into the pixel 4 because the millions

of dollars were already spent on the development of this chip the refinement of these kinds of

technologies be estimated like 12 per phone if you're able to integrate it so it's uh it's quite

interesting very low cost so so and i just i came in a little bit late but to be clear you're

developing a technology that is able to measure the let's call the biological oscillation or the

vibration or frequency of what you pre-engineer design as the frequency that corresponds to

the genetics that people represent as the SARS-CoV-2 virus or what causes covid

uh we just detected the virus using its electromagnetic signature in a similar way

to how radar is able to bounce some radio waves off of a plane and characterize which plane it is

yeah okay like spectral information or spectrographic technology

now how are you characterizing the signature frequency that's specific to the SARS-CoV-2

virus as it has yet to be isolated uh what are you so what are you using as your reference point

to let's say okay i have we have the virus yeah well all the cdc articles that i've read

and the peer review journals that i've read how what are you referring to yes we have the virus is

that a morphological petri dish that is grown and then you're using that as the reference point

is it something that corresponds to the specific cdc related genetic information that is represented

as corresponding to the root cause of covid infection i don't know what you mean by uh i don't

know what you mean by root cause but what we're able to do is take various forms of covid so it

could be a mouth swab it could be a swish it could be uh a sample of cells that are collected and we

can identify within each of those whether the pathogen is present or less or which pathogen

and do you have to do a similar to like an rtpcr do you have to do a exponential growth do you

have to no concentrate it or expand it so you're not able to have a level of specificity and accuracy

of metering that you can put this on the skin is that the that's correct yeah it's it basically works

like you can put your finger on the sensor and we can detect with uh with a high degree of confidence

between or of this whether the virus is within your finger or whatever so so you've mapped the

signature frequency of covid to a level of specificity or tolerance that you can put something

on your skin and then that is pre-engineered to receive whatever you and you organize it to have

or engineer it to have it can read that highly highly highly highly highly specific signature

frequency uh yeah there is a very convoluted way of saying that but yes well i mean i'm

please i mean might so i have i'm extremely familiar with uh biological oscillation units and

vibration and metering and monitoring systems and you know the star cov2 virus and covid and

etc just i this i mean i'm excited this is the first i've ever heard of that level of accuracy

and specificity being available as far as being able to specifically pinpoint i would assume it's

tied to the genetic the genetics of the virus that's right yeah it's the nucleotide molecule itself

that is getting this signal and that signal i would just say i would phrase it like this the

signal exists so that's the first thing that we checked does it exist and then we checked for

uniqueness and once we had uniqueness we were looking at specificity and how low can we go

with that specificity of genetics and we were able to bring it down to a nucleotide single

nucleotide level so are you using as far as the are you using well so there's four nucleotides and

how those obviously are in order right it's they have certain resonances in the 450 gigahertz range

above so in terms of radio waves that's kind of where their responses live i'm just saying in regards

to there being four let's call them base pairs or four nucleotides that are in a wide variety of

combinations all of those combinatorial matrices or experiences creates a quote unquote individual

frequency or vibration the idea that you're able to one get those nucleotides to get that

order of nucleotides in that specific order three under the perspective assumption that that is

corresponding to covid i have in the peer review journals i read that wasn't uh conclusive so to

speak yeah some work yeah so some work done by israel actually had a lot of money behind them and

they were actually using antibodies other people were using nanoparticles and just our differences

that were able to do it from the signal alone and then using some you know fancy combination and

geometric configurations of these sensors i would you know describe it as like an array of sensors

not just one sensor and this array of sensors is able to take certain measurements of these

nucleotides so let's say i have like ac tg ac tg and then they're in this weird kind of shape

um what happens when i paint the a's what happens in sensor one one one what happens to sensor one

one two and one one three and so you see them all on this grid and we're able to make certain

measurements and certain resonances come off each of these molecules and if you're very uh very

careful you can extract some information about it how close does the uh the does the transmitter and uh and

the device the transmitting and detection device have to be to what you're measuring and uh yeah

yeah right now it's uh you put your finger on the sensor that's the nature of what we've been

pursuing but we're able to focus these beams in all sorts of ways because i mean this the second

part about how like how you could just detect a pathogen in in a room uh that is a tall it seems

like a bigger problem it's right uh yes and no it depends on the relative energy and so on it's

it's just a different problem like one of the other things that we were working on was something

like a smoke detector where you have passive airflow and instead of having it on the ceiling you have

it on the floor and eventually it comes across one of these viral particles and so you can have

that kind of system as well so there's all sorts of ways you can do it long range you can do a

short range right now we're just focused on close range but it seems to be more medical application

anything else in my opinion would be a little bit more um military focused if it was but but i

guess i guess in the in the room sensor you're waiting for the virus to fall on the sensor

in a way through event some sort of ventilation system uh yeah that's that's one way uh this

little smoke detector thing yeah but if you had something like uh you could also have continuous

monitoring so something like on your arms like a smartwatch uh you can you can have a setup like

that as well and in fact that's uh that was one of the applications uh i i mean uh uh

micah i was uh you know it's uh i has been a excellent discussion in the room but i was you

know i'm running around so didn't get chance to come up and so i heard the i o sharing the very

exciting technology they're working on and uh i'm not you know i just had the interest in this

you know names and so yeah i in at MIT there's a group that worked on uh shrinking the ramen

special spectroscopy down to say it can be incorporated in the cell phone so basically

coin size chip uh that's just you know to me that's a fascinating revolution i mean progress right

so for what you're trying to do i think uh uh if it's can be made into early you know at the level

of a uh product level that that's really fascinating right so i mean in in terms of a

uh sample preparing uh there's also i worked with uh we were trying to help a group also not

MIT but related to their startup programs one of the prize winners they're they're doing the

uh MEMS uh uh basically the basic level of you know carbon nanotube chemical sensors so that's

i mean it it has you know they have they had uh went through the you know IP and pattern all that

preparation but still uh it turns out to be very hard uh for that technology to to go to the market

of course they they they had the product itself has a a lot of advantage being pppp level and

also can uh low power and all that so again for for for me to understand you're the product you're

developing this uh i mean on the line of the micah's question i mean the the noise i mean

the there's so many uh pollution right so it has to be a very pure sample so that you know

no it's it's not we've we've shown them even with mixed samples we're able to detect this and

i'll just refer you to the technology fundamentally already exists in cell phones i'll direct you

to the pixel four solely sensor which is a compact radar sensor already on the market and in fact

we're working with the team that helped develop that sensor so we're already working with the team

that was affiliated with google so it's a much easier undertaking when you have already this

product that is out there and you're just trying to develop this new application and new ip uh can

you uh i didn't miss the earlier discussion can you uh repeat a keyword to search for the radar

that the totally sensor s o l i s o l i yeah solely censored by google atab advanced technology

or something something so um i was wondering i don't know if you've heard of uh rife and the

rife machine but i'm wondering if you could potentially target the frequency and i think

it was like from the 1930s and the idea was that you could find out the frequency of the

liquid molecule that you're looking for and then um like essentially use resonance to yeah yeah like

a wind guess yeah yeah that's uh that's basically like it's like the movie elicium with that tanning

but they're where you can like lay down and it not only can detect these aberrations maybe these

cancer cells and then selectively cook them because you can know the exact sequence that is

responsible for that mutation and kind of like you hone into a bridge with the correct gust of

wind at the correct rate you can actually destroy some of these things without actually exhibiting

ionizing or without imparting ionizing radiation so it's like but the non-linear effects are very

counterintuitive are you so are you also working on that or do you see that in the long term is

like practical application or no it's something that we are exploring in fact we're going to be doing

in a um what is it it's um proof of concept study with the london health sciences center here in

canada and we're going to be examining some cancer cells and seeing what kind of what kind of things

are possible and that's one of the things that we'll be exploring to see if we can actually

target these things much more specifically because personally that's my guess as a physicist i'm like

yeah that's an easy problem i mean while everybody else is like rolling their eyes saying that holy

shit that's very difficult so it's it's my hope i believe that that's possible theoretically

and the only question when i first got into this problem was uh does the technology exist in my

time kind of like that iron man father his father was telling like you know it does it i'm limited

by the technology of my time and so i was very curious to see if the technology of my time

is limiting in this because when i first started this about five years ago uh the computational

power was not there to process these data sets uh the sensor sensitivity was not there yet and so a

lot of things culminated together very quickly during the pandemic and uh coordinating between

two labs uh accelerated program and uh a company was uh was quite stressful but somehow we did it

would you uh um maybe sure again you said you said we need the first thought of this five years

ago are you the are you the the key in the inventor and on on the patent is that what you meant yeah

yeah yeah i'm the chief technical officer wow cool i guess that's like we were already honored to

have you with us and now we're like even more honored thanks so so you already have a pattern

is it a pattern out already or is under your name uh so we have a provisional patent uh and a few

other things it's not under uh my name here um but uh some of the work that we will be releasing and

filing will have my name on it so it's it's not on the google it cannot be searched by google yet

right so that's right yeah not yet we just incorporated i think in january so a lot of

paperwork is still going through so uh so as as i understand so the pure will be uh uh i think

michael asked a good question that uh have not uh malachi like you know path path pathogen

in like type of a meter is that uh if you go if you go on my um on my twitter you can actually

see the pitch video for the accelerator program where we presented this work so you can go there

and see kind of how we've called it you have alternative suggestions on what kind of keywords

we should use but no existing terminology kind of describes the technology in that way it's very

much um like people have just been calling it green fields because there's no existing etymology to

uh identify it great thanks all too yeah thank you yeah and if you have any further questions

please feel free to uh reach out or if you're curious to join the team you know we always

need more people to uh work on this problem and that's in fact what we're uh ramping up to do

so we really think that this could be released to market very quickly and a lot of the magic

does happen with uh software so i'm fascinated i mean i i'm a career and uh have uh i consider

myself a have a proud background and i mean especially interested in uh developing tools

and you know spectroscopy and all that and helping you know special life science and stuff

you know i'll follow you up i'll follow up with you in the home page yeah i followed you on twitter

you can uh follow back and you can chat more there um but a big part of this was actually

in frustration when i was diagnosed with cancer it took me 10 months arguing with seven doctors

before they finally believed my diagnosis and got me tested properly unfortunately by that time

the cancer had already spread from my mouth and my throat down to my neck and my lungs

and uh it was a very difficult journey a lot of invasive surgery part of my tongue was removed

both left and right sides of my tongue were removed i had reconstructive surgery on my tongue

that's why i'm kind of mumbling sometimes because it's hard to speak with only a third of your tongue

remaining um but yeah it was very motivating and in fact you know kind of like the joke on

your on the clubhouse by some people is uh yeah if you kicked cancer's butt this must have been

a piece of cake or walk in the park kind of thing uh it was not it was very difficult and i was very

fortunate to have a lot of teams come together that were able to leverage this technology and

it was amazing because i didn't even know that the team had worked on the solar sensor and uh

i brought to them the concept of look i want to get the raw data from the solar sensor because

i think this is possible so if you want to look up a another paper there's one by Purdue University

about pathogen uh detection using Doppler radar and that's probably the early the most recent

paper that you can find about similar work to this but the the observation that i have about

that article is the guy says oh it's exciting because we're the only ones doing this so we're

the first ones doing this no you're the first ones talking about doing this uh you're not necessarily

the first ones so that's kind of something to keep in mind and i'm very aware of that as well

because there was work being done in this field by DARPA that was work being done in this direction

from the russian academy of sciences so there was a lot of these teams around the world are racing

towards this thank you for the pointers but i i i'll do my uh do the descent and read up them

so you you mentioned the the Doppler radar is it works on the different uh physics right so

from from the your e.m. proposals right uh well they're similar they're related technologies i'm

not going to go into too much detail because that would be proprietary uh uh discussion but if you're

willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement i can show you whatever you like okay okay thank you yeah

okay um so going back to um the uh so when when you're you're using the uh so for example if you're

using the solely device um and you're you're you're sending out something to um you know to to

detect um uh you're sending out the uh your your signal to detect the nucleotides um and

um and then you're getting something back and you're in your uh solely sensor is uh has a sufficient

enough array that it's able to decode the uh the sequence in the correct order but um but the question

then is is uh was your measurement uh did your measurement uh cause phase changes to to the dna

did it change the dna uh or the RNA i'm sorry in the case of the virus is an RNA virus um uh and uh yeah

in does it does measuring itself uh with this technology change uh the phase shifts of bacteria

and viruses uh no no but they do uh kind of uh exhibit a lensing effect so if they're alive

they kind of respond and it's a dynamic signal so it's a time-dependent signal

and uh if they deceased uh the molecule only itself resonates a little bit but their decibels

of the signal are not sufficient to allow these jumps that's the next step of our research to

see if we can make these selective changes ideally it would be amazing if you could like you know

aim a signal a certain way kind of like cowboy aims a gun and bam you would knock out that one

letter that's causing the cancer without having to destroy the cell it's not clear to us whether

you have to destroy the whole cell or whether you can uh impart energy that can change the

internal structure of the dna of the cell okay what you just said was super interesting on a

tangent uh what's the difference between uh a live RNA strand and a dead one in terms of one

that reacts to one that doesn't could you say a lot uh it's a it's a population it's a it's like

if it's within a cell and it's able to interact with other molecules and all these gradients then

yeah but if it's on its own it's a little bit different so it's kind of like taking a picture

of a city you want to make a movie because then you can see what this city's all about in the same

way it's hard to learn to dance if all you're doing is looking at pictures and other people dancing

you actually need to look at a video of people dancing so that's kind of the intuition that I

would give but from a first principles perspective it's a time-dependent signal in some cases that

is more important

yeah I mean I'm like still processing that but anyone else who wants to jump in time-dependent

signal that's more important I'll just pause myself anyone else who wants to talk go ahead

uh again coming back to the earlier question the so the first using the covid virus as an example

that's definitely not a thing right so you mentioned the smoke uh so basically basically a

swap or something and so uh is there what would be the minimum like signal noise level that you can

detect are you're asking what the relative noise is or yeah yeah so again it's so so for example

for the uh uh it is it's so for using the earlier that uh using what I'm uh uh had a little bit

knowledge of is so when you say it's a smoke detector it uh someone mentioned there's a

wind issue there if the wind doesn't blow your way so there has to be you can now say take it out

outdoor just do you know like like you know uh a laser temperature gun or something

this is not that robust right so there has to be some some sort of uh condition uh

you know I mean right now you're in a concept uh uh proof of concept level so uh so my questions

to the wind when you you're part of oh the cancer is the uh the cancer protection is the

concept the viral stuff is already known through the proof of concept oh okay uh yeah so so again

this is so so so I guess I've now fixed things together so uh for for the for the nucleotide

but what what is the sample again then the swap of the uh saliva or so it can be saliva it can be

a swab it can be a certified sample a mixed sample so like saliva represents a mixed sample

you can also do detection through the finger so uh those I'm sure you're familiar with uh

was it noninvasive glucose measuring it's similar to that

then that that's uh they're different that using uh leds right so no that's not true

no so if you look up the pitch video and you look up the lab that we're working with

you can find more information about it there it's the center for intelligent antennas and radio

systems at the university of water in Canada so okay us us oh so it seemed like you're familiar

with the rake machine and I was wondering if there's anything um like there's you know books

of frequencies associated with different um you know diseases and whatnot I have no idea if it's

uh there is no there is no such database we're in fact building such a database that's one of

the exciting things about this yeah awesome yeah that's what I was wondering if there was like

anything to the uh yeah once it exists now yeah like our goal is basically to sequence everything

on the planet give everyone a wireless genome sequencer and turn the world into like Pokemon

with the pokedex where you can just have a kid uh put this sensor up to an ant and we could know

the sequence information of an ant or a leaf or whatever and then the possibilities are quite

profound from a public health perspective with respect to the next pandemic that instead of

having to go into this very expensive lockdown we can just say every day just scan yourself

a few times a day or in fact have past scanning in a smartwatch and be able to tell you whether

you have a certain pathogen or not if you do please stay at home contact health officials if

you then you know all these things could just be automated and and really streamlined so we don't

suffer as a as a species oh so just to be clear there is a one but i just don't have any idea if

it's accurate or i would guess it's probably not but um if you haven't seen it i could get a copy

sorry what what did you ask um in terms of like a frequency database like there is one

that's associated with the rife machine but i don't have any idea if it's accurate it was kind of

what i was asking oh i don't think yeah i know i don't think it is accurate in fact unfortunately in

genomics the rule is everybody's data sucks make your own data and so that's kind of what we have

to do and we're going to be partnering i think with potentially caltech as well to build this up

and you know my hope is that everybody builds on this together and eventually it becomes as

synonymous as an MRI machine except it's not millions of dollars it's maybe 12 dollars 30

dollars 50 dollars hopefully integrated into every device and then that way we can have a much better

chance of fighting these things but the database is quite literally the most important parts like

andrew and stanford jonathan how we're moving from a model centric uh industry and machine learning

to a data like quality data uh perspective and so that's kind of the model that we're trying to

emulate is that all this data um so if uh so if the database was missing a particular pathogen

and this machine wouldn't be able to register it as a pathogen yes uh if we can extract the sequence

information we can extract what it is um so even a novel virus if you just tell us the sequence

information we can extract what signal we predict would be from it of course but uh

if if it's uh if that sequence was not available it was not known to us and therefore it's absent

from the database then you wouldn't be able to detect as uh it's not clear to me whether that's

the case because there are certain patterns that pathogens seem to have in terms of their

characteristics uh you can look at work done by uh what's his name uh dimos christopher dimos

dimos from batel memorial institute uh he was examining how to extract structure or predict

structure from random bit information so jebcon 26 x86 uh backdoor i think it was on cryptographic

instruction sets so how can you tell if there's a compromised hardware backdoor within your

processor you have to mine this space but how can you tell from the structure alone that there is a

problem and so by mapping some of these signals to something known as a space filling curve uh

you preserve locality and that locality allows you to make certain um estimations and extrapolations

with the patterns that emerge so uh that's that's what i refer you to defcon 26 christopher dimos

x86 architecture i can also put the link into my um it's my bio here so the the other awesome

implication of this is that you're not anticipating them um if the situation was coming with their

tests that should be hiring false negatives i think um and so this would be yeah completely

certain that like we change the game yeah that's the whole yeah um the there is no like the the

false negative false positive rates is very low it's kind of like if you had a shitty camera

sensor you're not gonna take good pictures so we're just focused on taking really good pictures

in essence but using the spectrum of of radio waves instead of uh the uh visible spectrum

yeah like i have um Lyme disease in the test for that like it's it's almost like a 50 50 it's just

awful so yeah like you would just be so comfortable with so many people you know just overall

bacteria is interesting yeah also the virus for Lyme disease um you know there is um you know

some viruses because it's not clear whether Lyme disease is caused by just one virus or

bacteria or combination or confluence or whatever the case may be but um some viruses

retreat into your lymph nodes and then they only come up or flare up in certain immune response

situations so um that's kind of the the the hope or the the thinking that we'll be able to even

make measurements on lymph nodes themselves and be able to tell you kind of what virus

data bank you're carrying or not so that's the next focus that that yeah so um so i the Lyme

spire heat is one thing but there's also the um the guy had four co-infections and there's a lot

of theories circulating like around biofilms um and i'm wondering like when you said an example

if this is something that could also pick up biofilms um which is like the idea that these

things have evaporated together and it's like a shield from your immune system basically yeah so

we can actually penetrate the biofilm and be able to make these kind of protections where

your immune system is unable to identify it chemically so because these sorts of cloaking

technologies that these viruses develop and these bacteria develop sometimes uh are able to be

chemically resistant or robust but the spectrum never lies as it were so that's the that's the

upside that no matter what these things are doing they will be able to help your immune system by

seeing things that it can't so um i want to ask you more going back earlier to the very beginning

of when you jumped in what with human human uh the human bio rhythm that extends outside the

human body or the the bio which is a human bio rhythm and uh maybe that's not the the word for it

but the the biofield i would call it electromagnetic signature that's kind of the best way because

that implies that maybe there's a time dependence and other things like that okay so the time the

time dependence and and that time dependence might might reveal our dna and but but so in that dna

so what i'm wondering is so that bio i'm also wondering that that biomagnetic field um well

yeah essentially that's what you're talking about you're talking about dna and rna right in in the

field itself right yeah yeah that's the smallest signal that we're kind of pursuing you could pursue

smaller molecules but that's the ones that we're currently focused on but but but so you're detecting

but so that's that's different from detecting uh like nucleotides now you're talking about

detecting an electromagnetic field and decoding dna from that that's that's right well a nucleotide

is a molecule right like a nucleotide chain is just a molecule where each of the chain each of the

balls on this chain uh let's just say it's a beaded chain uh each of the balls has a different

resonance so uh it's basically like it's like how cell phones work that's the best way that i can

describe it all right so um so what we're broadcasting to other people um do you think

that is so is that enough to actually be causing um uh changes in in the i guess spatial temporal

and phase shifts of other people's dna what we're what human beings broadcasting

sorry can we rephrase the question sure so so one person's biofield is is being broadcast within

the frequency range of another person's biofield are each of those persons biofields um powerful

enough to change the phase uh temporal and spatial um patterns of of the other part of

someone else's dna and someone else's biofield uh i i would i would i would estimate that yes but

it's not clear to me because we haven't done those kinds of experiments but i would suspect that

there is a certain interaction distance but uh it could it could also be uh the kind of training

that happens when you're with somebody you're both uh interacting simultaneously you're viewing

the other person's responses and in that capture of that sensory information there's some sort of

entanglement that occurs and that entanglement allows you to both have the same kind of information

and perhaps it's the signal that both you and i shared uh is encoded and then later on one of us

accesses that signal that may infer some sort of entanglement response from the other person who

has that information encoded but that's uh that's very speculative i would say that's kind of along

the lines of sir Roger Penrose's orchestrated reduction model okay um so i don't know have

they detected pheromones yet that humans are giving off in it because i'm thinking about like the way

that women's cycles line up if they live together and what the mechanism is there i'm wondering

if it could be something like that where the fields are overlapping or they're putting up

certain energy well every time we're breathing we're trading viruses like i think famously for

every hour that you spend with someone else you're trading about 10 000 viruses an hour at the lower

end in fact i would say it's probably every 15 minutes you trade 10 000 viruses so in a conference

everyone is sharing all these viruses and if you think of what's actually triggering or what's the

result of this kind of sharing is that when uh when the E. coli gets uh into your body and your

body raises the temperature E. coli kind of opens the door for viruses or phages to come in and offer

information that can perhaps allow it to modulate its metabolism to stay alive at that higher

temperature to continue living and uh that's kind of i think what happens with viruses in general so

not only would it be electromagnetic but it's kind of like biochemical warfare that where each of us

are sending viruses and other things and these things are allowing our systems to evolve and

it's counterintuitive because you would think that you would want to isolate from viruses but viruses

are actually what allows the system to uh evolve so like damage from ultraviolet rays helps the

system evolve damage from viral infections and other things helps us gain information the classic

example is um a virus from our very early history for i think brain structures on earth uh had a

specific function of pruning synaptic connections and in fact the remnants of that virus have become

integrated in our genome and in fact we can identify that oh look here's the remnant of this skeleton

of this virus it's now part of us and it helps us prune our synaptic connections which if out of

lack if there's too much of this kind of activity or not enough represented in our genome you may be

you may succumb to what we call schizophrenia because not enough connections are being pruned

and you're beginning to make false connections that perhaps diverge from reality so the nature

of how information travels between the systems is not only for magnetic but also the particulates

and is that the arc neuronal gene that you're mentioning because i know that was one that's

now supposed to be viral and it's like integral to memoriam i don't remember whether it was synapse

pruning but it was definitely associated with higher functioning cognitive ability uh i know

it'd be i think i know the author so menolus callus out of uh mit was one who discussed this so um

if that's the same person but maybe but yeah it's the same kind of idea that you know where

what is our dna is just the collection of generations of evolution where we've been

collecting this information and in fact whenever biologists talk about how does an information

or how does a system gain information if you know physicists say that entropy is always increasing

or how do you reduce entropy to allow for complexity it's through these kind of viruses and some

estimates put the population ratio of life or complex life to viruses or phages for every

one complex living organism on earth we have a hundred trillion viruses or phages to that one

so most of the activity on earth is said to be phage like or virus like so just think of it like

if you actually like open your eyes you just see viruses everywhere in the room that's that's kind of

my imagination so they also float in the upper atmosphere and i wondered if you have any theories

about um like the relation between uh electromagnetic events in the like um the earth's magnetic field

and the viral like um i've heard theories that like there were old papers that looked at um sunspots

and potential correlations with viruses and the theory was that uh significant enough magnetic

poles would force those upper atmosphere particles closer to humans um yeah yeah there's all sorts

of uh i think situations like that where the mineralization energy or some sort of standing wave

or some sort of stimulus from an electromagnetic field elsewhere can bias certain molecules to form

or uh emerge or whatever like um i would think that the cosmic microwave background radiation

itself creates a certain bias on planets where you know in addition to the gravitational field

of that planet in addition to the radiation from its local star and in addition to the

background radiation you get a certain set of possible solutions for life and that's kind of

how i would think about it that it just changes the bias a little bit so maybe instead of waiting

a billion years all you have to do is wait 100 million for these kinds of uh events to emerge

so that complex life or multicellular life could emerge but definitely there's some sort of mechanism

there where they trade it's all basically coupled i would say okay awesome thank you so much not

to totally derail this but do you think that um the muon controversy is anything related

or like in terms of the yeah the standard model being incorrect and i keep going back

to the fact that i think our electromagnetic model is poor uh i think the electromagnetic

model is fine just needs some expansion um i would say that it's nice to see some new physics but

one in 40 000 is not the sufficient bar for particle physics uh they usually demand like one in a

billion or likes like it just basically a ridiculous amount of standard deviations and the only

symmetry with our project is that we're also trying to go for very very high confidence with

these sorts of measurements so that you know you make an announcement but you're saying so far

we think this will work now we're going to perform you know several thousand hundred thousand maybe

measurements to make sure that uh what we're saying is uh accurate so it's kind of an interesting

symmetry i never thought i'd be performing these this many measurements in um a biophysics project

all right so um i uh let me just invite everyone else up here

and we'll invite kyle and uh invite daniel and uh invite uh siruthi

and so i'll reset the room real quick um this uh this room uh you can you can talk about anything

you want but the main the main topics that we're floating around are neurophysics uh brainwaves

oscillations neural circuits nerve gear ai and uh i've really enjoyed the last uh last hour uh

talking to um uh this uh talking about uh the the the technology from i guess i i guess i should

say i o from i o right and um it's uh you know super cool to speculate about about um

um not just the the neural oscillation and not just the the brainwave oscillations and neural

circuits um on a micro scale and within the brain but also what's happening outside of the human

body and that's sort of like where we went in the last hour um and uh and devices basically devices

can detect uh this information and uh i i am kind of like curious about i don't know um i do you

know the the difference uh between in power between the um between uh obviously you know

you know the the the solar sensor but i mean like the actual difference between that and the human

biofield in terms of amplitude and power i don't know if you i would know that in about two months

two months you can ask me um we have uh we we hired a few people to actually perform those

measurements and uh it's just a matter of getting the paperwork done and things like that especially

because our uh province is going into like level four lockdown or whatever the fuck that means

it's just gonna be a little bit difficult to coordinate things but definitely something that

we'll be looking at um right now it's been kind of easy uh to make these sort of distinctions

but in general like if we wanted to focus on what the differences of the background or ambient

field of the human body versus just of these little pathogens or other molecules uh i'd have to i'd

have to look it up just to tell you uh just i don't have the uh graph in front of me but i'll

look it up so that next time i open to you i'll have the answer sweet yeah i mean it just occurs

to me there might the answer might be on mine i could probably just google by human biofield or

something and and uh and then compare that to the soli sensor yeah yeah but uh we're not necessarily

using the soli sensor that's just the the team that we're working with them i don't i don't

want to necessarily say that it's the uh soli sensor those it gets a little bit more complicated

but uh i was uh i just got like uh not the not the best looks from one of my colleagues uh

they were listening a little bit and they were like you know please be careful about what you say so

i've gotten a stern not warning you know even though i'm just yeah right yeah i mean that yeah no

no worries um but i will say i kind of have like an elon musk kind of answer uh when people ask me

like well you know where did you think of this or why do you think this will work i say like uh

like you know i must have this story about you know aliens come to earth and they uh fly in this

little hot thing bouncing off the atmosphere then they parachute and land somewhere in the ocean

and they open their hatch and they say there's nothing to fear we come in peace that would not

be really reassuring and along those same lines i say you know aliens come to earth they abduct

a bunch of humans and then they get their little chemistry set out and start studying us i don't

think so if they're going to be traveling they're going to be traveling lightweight

and they're probably going to be using or modifying or manipulating the spectrum

to perform these sorts of measurements or abductions so i kind of have a cheeky answer for

that and uh so far at least a lot of the people who are in the field or uh military related

chuckle and and find it funny but it's i'm also half serious so yeah so it sounds like uh researchers

like yourself talk a lot to the military about certain projects and the military's interests

are going to be a lot different from from civilian interests in terms of in terms of what you what

you're going to what you're going to sell in civilian marketplace and what the military is

going to want to buy yeah yeah there is a big difference uh i am happy that we are focused on

the medical aspects at present um i did reach out to a lot of my physicians who actually treated

my cancer and i asked them what they would i i asked them like what do you think of this project

you know what if we work with the military what about this what about that they said you know

whatever you choose please give back to humanity don't make it something that's locked away and

covered somewhere or in some warehouse like indian jones uh do make sure that you know it's not used

to harm people either and in fact that was one of the moral kind of um i don't know conflicts that

have internal conflicts about hey you know if i develop this technology and it's used to hurt

people am i responsible and some people said you know uh to develop the technology it's somebody

else's job to uh regulate it and but you know i went above and beyond to try to get make sure that

i wasn't stepping on any toes or pissing off the military we reached out to all the appropriate

government people we notified everyone of the experiments and everything so we've been very

open and and explicit about these projects and so far the um wow it's remain civilian and medical

oriented but i suspect there are programs that are doing things differently so um in terms of um

you know so so you you may have the ability to mass market this this product they might you

make it may be in everyone's cell phone it may be distributed all over the world and uh and people

and people in every country may have this technology and and um you know so i i imagine that

there's going to be a lot of companies especially foreign companies that will be uh trying to

re reverse engineer what you've done and and and and violate copyright laws and patent laws and

just you know try to try to sell this at least you know at least on the black market or just outside

us regulation i mean these kinds of things happen um and um but but that's not the point so the point

is like okay so so um other other companies illegally reverse engineer and in and in duplicate

and forgot the technology uh eventually uh what are what kind of um potential risks are we looking

at in terms of how how other um um uh how uh basically how foreign military how could they

hurt us yeah there are a lot of a lot of answers i don't want to get too many away sometimes it's

irresponsible to comment on bioterrorism as this would be categorized as so uh disclaimer

we're all gonna watch this now um because i said bioterrorism online i don't know but one of the

people that i know talk about bioterrorism and uh you know talk somewhere and then the next day or

i think the same day the fbi showed up in this house and they were like why you talk about bioterrorism

here um so there are some things to keep in mind but in general uh a simple scenario is you have a

sensor that can tell you what a pathogen is uh or what a certain sample has in it would constitute

that sample uh just through the process of variability people could find viruses and other

things so there is obviously an element of um regulation that goes along with this technology

and so i've reached out to scholars physicians academics regulatory agencies like the the normal

approach is asked for forgiveness not for permission while i've gone and done my due diligence to

kind of tell everybody about the risks and other things that pertain to this and how i would

generate countermeasures and things like that but if a kid samples uh their grandma's saliva and they

see that it's some sort of you know exotic virus grandma here spin into this test tube and now all

of a sudden somebody has a sample that they can cultivate and that's actually what happened with

ebola and a bunch of people who had ebola were kidnapped by terrorist groups and there was a

lot of concern that they were running these ebola camps or ebola farms where they have people in

this tent uh and uh you would just keep bringing in new people to become infected and as you brought

in more people the virus would mutate more and so you were able to accelerate the evolution of this

virus to a very deadly scale so that's kind of one of the scenarios that emerges and therefore

regulation and surveillance is one of the things about this technology that's necessary so first

applications will probably be B2B we would trust physicians and dental offices and schools and

airports and things like that and then eventually somebody would have something in their hand but

it wouldn't tell you uh you know what kind of virus this is that would be more left to a professional

somebody who is accredited and follows regulation but of course once the genie is out of the bag

then it's hard to control that so the only hope is that you can develop countermeasures

yeah but like just to be clear you're building a detector not like a um you know what i mean like

it's it's i like your idea it's akin to like a thermometer or something um because i already

want like i have deep concerns already about the way the genetic database is so open like somebody

on reddit just like you know handed out the entire like you know dna of covid and it's like um or

whatever that you know it has a few intentional spelling mistakes in it so uh it's very difficult

to synthesize it so that's kind of something that scientists don't talk about but they put

in intentional spelling mistakes that it cannot compile oh so interesting yeah because i worry

about like the 3d printing of you know um yeah like we're looking at printing organs and stuff and

as that takes off if we have all these like public databases of you know viral yeah uh yeah but like

i could take i could take your straw from your drink you're drinking outside and sequence it right

now and know your genetic information that's actually what happened with the ceo of marvel

and uh somebody known as uh something tanning bomb from toronto a head hunter and there was

this entire controversy in maro lago where the ceo of marvel wrote some defamatory letters to all

of the guests or all of the um tenants of that area and claimed that this new person tanning bomb

was a pedophile and so this tanning bomb guy sequenced the letters so got whatever genetic

material was on these letters and then he had a meeting with the marvel ceo and the marvel ceo

said it's absurd and all these things he denied it but then he threw away his cup into the garbage can

and they used that cup to sequence his genetic information and match but unfortunately in florida

the law prevents you from sequencing but of course the ceo threw away the cup so that

personal genetic information became private property as soon as it left his person so

there was a lot of weird legal loopholes in this kind of game

yeah and there's also um this is only tangentially related but i think the department of defense has

like a um they can identify you by your heart rate variability so they can you know just look

like uh infrared or whatever and see you know identify people in buildings and whatnot and

it's supposed to be pretty accurate like um yeah they actually use a wi-fi router

oh wow i did not know that crazy yeah yeah yeah it's called wi-fi at w i d i and they can actually

use a few wi-fi routers and not only detect you through a wall but identify your uh cardiac

rhythm and be able to say oh that's this person or this is a child this is an adult this is a woman

uh this is uh it's it's it's quite impressive

yeah on this note that when i uh came to uh i mean uh for me my uh i used to be a very uh

i mean still kind of a paranoid you know when i attend like uh went to MIT for graduate study

and uh that was the time when the you know the you're the internet just you know had the very

early stage so back then you know the the password will go you know not many of you probably uh

familiar with uh telnet the command to log in okay so it's actually doable so i mean uh i

live in dorm and so people uh just log remotely they many of them just like don't know don't

don't know how to use the encryptions right so and so this is all called you transparent text

their passwords so i did it once just i didn't come in everything i don't hold this proof against me

and just as a you know nerd kind of poking around now why how vulnerable i actually later on work

for the MIT you know the the what is rca the consultant to to help people uh residents solve

their computer problems but yeah so that's how later on i just gave up because now the uh we

have the handheld you can download a very interesting app on your phone it's called uh

now for me there's many of this uh it's called a fit uh just just a second let me load it up

it's very interesting it can tell you it can utilize all the sensors in your phone and do

physics related the type of measurement oh it's called a ph y ph o x so i just uh fired up

just see how how many sensors you are carrying around right so uh uh okay the manual says acceleration

without g with g gyroscope light like lightness right so in lots measuring thermometer parameter

yeah i guess for this one yeah and uh say they have like you can measure the echo by by the

acoustic echoes uh for for distance so it's it's a characteristic type of burbs uh then it can tell

so not very accurate but it's proof of concept demonstrating at the education kit it's quite

cool right so so all these things you know i mean the the the the one you mentioned that you can

you know measure using the router to measure activity and even to the sensitivity the the

pulsation it's you know we are all connected so there's no joy so so that's that's a no escape

yeah there's no no it's okay but uh so i think there's doesn't write off the so there's so

constant discussions on this uh clockhouse it's fascinating about the uh the conscious the collective

you know what is the uh do we have three wheel right so i think i i still insist that we do

it's just i mean what i mean uh tell sign we are here and a few of us discussing this topic is

basically a sign indicator of that there is a you know there's a water there's a boat

both rises right so that's that's the that's the it just is a chase i mean i mean if you

i wasted all the time you know back then when i was you know started to try to escape but i

now i just go with the flow and yeah anyway so that's a very fun discussion topic but but for

you i just quickly looked up salty videos it's a very short video it's about three minutes right

so here in the middle there's one you showed a technical graph i saw it is actually the

frequency is at about three g uh three g hertz and uh there's the you can you can have a very top

you have a slight uh an area of difference of the two bars you can discriminate right yeah

yeah so so yeah okay so that's a limited picture of the frequency range though so that's uh

that's only part of the slide that we were instructed to show we wanted to show more of

the slide but they wouldn't allow us to show more of it oh sure sure so that gives me a rough you

know understanding what what what you're you know trying to do and it's fascinating can

really you know be able to uh get a noise ratio uh signal to noise ratio that it can enable you

are able to uh make it a product but that's that's that i think that's you have to overcome a lot

a lot of you know uh there's tons of you know work all right yeah yeah it could be um i would say

that that's debatable but that's from last year so there's uh we have new measurements they kind

of show that the signal is surprisingly robust so consistency of measurements uh there is very

little variance so it's um it's it's quite consistent um yeah um yeah that's that's all i would say i

don't believe in privacy though i think it's a human construct i think we need to move on to a

better construct or a better idea but uh privacy is very poorly understood it is merely the ability

to do something autonomously without being interrupted secrecy is what most people confuse

privacy for so secrecy or the ability to conceal information that is up to the person to be able

to do in fact the NSA has a cheeky answer they say you're not being spied on there is nobody

watching you because they don't classify a computer passively recording everything as a person so

there is nobody spying on you because everything is being recorded that's kind of the future so

unfortunately um fortunately more of these things are going away but the only

the consolation that i have or the solace that i could provide you is that um regulation and

legislation laws senators governors members of parliament all over the world uh these people

have to change the laws so that uh for example your genetic information if it's acquired passively

through these systems cannot be used against you and in fact that makes the world a little bit more

equitable overall yeah i'm pretty much well with you on the other end so the uh so i had a thought

yeah so the uh in terms of uh uh the uh turn turn it around if you look at this way i i'm

i'm a big fan i spend a lot of time reading up the you know work actually working collaborating

on these history of science right so uh the history of science is i think this should be

required uh at a undergraduate graduate level for all the subject right many good teachers they

actually go into uh at the first few lecture have a good introduction of the history of the subject

which which is which is very good so uh right now we are given that we are in the mobile mobile

what are internet connected all connectedness right so the level of connectedness the the the

web so i i i tend to see a metaphor so all the artificial technology goes the the social construct

construct go with it right so the the emways are radiating through my you know all the walls of my

room and they all goes you know all the standard industrial standard all that but turn it around

so in the for his historians he he used to be a very challenging word to dig up what this you

know original thinker uh how how how they actually uh came up at the you know come how

do you rig a moment hit upon them and now i mean the work supposed to be should be easier right

it's we are going into a page uh or a simtotic approach in that age that everything is recorded

digitally so i mean as a matter of seconds you can search and look up what you know

restore that uh and uh you know what would what the hologram right so that that's for me it's a

positive you know thing yeah i agree it is nice that we can record that stuff personally i would

have wished for people like Einstein or Feynman to have used like oculus and have been in the

lecture explaining something because then if we have this three-dimensional or four-dimensional

recording you know space plus time this movie that you can be inside of and move around imagine you

could be over the shoulder of Richard Feynman he's explaining something or or situations like that

would be very phenomenal my eureka moment actually came as a result of participating in the big

data vr challenge hosted by welcome trust and epic games back in 2015 so this is an idea so big

data vr challenge uh and then welcome trust w e l l c l m they're the second largest biomedical

chair in the world um yeah they invited my wife and i to visualize and represent genetic sequences

in virtual reality and that was actually where a large part of this idea came from when we were

trying to understand these sequences and in fact we stumbled upon uh tools from the russian academy

of sciences that transformed genetic sequences into signals and then did um uh they used uh what is it

hadamard and um yeah hadamard matrices and hadamard transforms to understand these systems

and that naturally led to the question of well hold on if we're using tools from signal analysis

um what if it is a signal so that was kind of if you want to understand the eureka moment from it

so that was kind of how simple it was to begin with but it was because we were already involved

with all of these researchers from Sanger Institute from all of the world so it was it was not as

isolated as perhaps it seems but yeah the previous thing you were you were mentioning

was that wi-fi can allow for uh monitoring people and read the their vital signals yeah yeah so

technically you can hack uh a router and start doing that whatever you get to have the router

is that correct uh you can hack a router to do that yeah the paper is wi-fi wi-fi and the subsequent

work shows other aspects as well so um yeah there's a lot of information with radio waves in fact the

way that they trained it was they had a connect camera um with a uh router next to it and the

router was sending signals signals were bouncing off but then the connect camera was also sending

signals and getting information back and the first iteration of this technology just sought to extract

skeletal information and so they were able to see skeletons through walls based on these radio waves

and then when they removed the connect camera so not behind walls but they were able to see

like the person in front of the camera then the person went behind the wall and then they

took away the connect camera and the machine learning system that they built was sufficiently

robust to be able to reconstruct the skeletal form just from the partial signal information from the

radio waves along so that's kind of the tricks of the trade as it were wow that's that's very very

interesting i mean for for spying or monitoring people that's incredible all right thank you thank

you yeah yeah my uh my device is almost done i'm at two percent so if i uh like if i get taken

out offline or whatever don't think it's the government that came after me so

that's a joke just so that people understand yeah we know but we're gonna keep an eye on you don't

worry yeah there's a guy Paul Stamets who does like mushroom research and he talked about a crazy

incident where like he'd submitted for a patent that involved you know specific you know medical

applications and they didn't approve it and then at some point like black helicopters came and he

you know people in the lab called him and were like there's helicopter circling and he was like

okay inoculate yourself the fungal spores and like scatter so like for serving the experiment

but i thought that was so crazy because it's like you know he was not intending anything

uh he had only good intentions so just be careful yeah yeah yeah i do try to keep it in

in mind um be responsible i'm always like no no no please no i'm on your side gi joke come on

america number one oh yeah i love Canada yeah so i do try to be uh told the line as it were in terms

of the message of the allies or the western world but it's also something that i believe in full

disclaimer and i say i know you're listening uh so there's no reason to go after me in fact it's

better to enable such work and work with scientists although i do suspect that some of these applications

will be classified as it were so some of the things that i did talk about you probably never hear about

ever again so i haven't gotten that order to not talk about it so because i feel like i'm mortal

in terms of my cancer it could come back and things like that i would much prefer the technology to

be out there so that if i don't get to be able to build it for whatever reason let's say i die in a

magical car accident tomorrow at least some of you can rebuild it in fact the cyclical nature

of these kind of discoveries is very fascinating because it came up in the 30s then in the 70s

then in the 2000s and each time people tried to make certain progress in this but were limited

by the technology of their time and so that that's kind of uh also it's it's a very fortunate coincidence

in time i mean there is a there's like a broad sort of um it's like a it's like a broad so like

there's this like general advancement of technology but there but um but in terms of imaging technologies

we're we're that we're having simultaneous innovations and meta and imaging uh technologies uh in every

industry in every science um it's this it's not like you you're just talking about like today

this is we're just talking about one thing but there's so like there's so many advances happening

simultaneously in terms of imaging uh it's just amazing and they're all they're all it's like

the they all have there's all like commonalities so they're all basically like um you know coming

down to uh in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way i think of of of you know when

you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that array to figure out

what's what i mean that you know like i compared to e it in terms of like it is uh kind of like

tomography maybe i i mean without knowing your secret sauce it sounds like it's kind of like

tomography and i would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography uh type of technology

that is is related to uh um you know the there's there's the four basically the projection theorem

for your transform projection theorem uh then there's uh like you know photogrammetry um you

know if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image into uh of biology and into um

into uh 2d slices that's the projection for your theorem but then if you're gonna turn 2d

slices from from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so

now we have volumetric video and we have uh you know we're doing uh we're doing semantic

segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to uh the the different

that belong to that object in a 3d space has been captured with a camera but then but now

we're like talking about okay well you know we're gonna we're gonna shine light into the brain

with functional and spectroscopy and combining with ultrasound and basically reverse the refraction

of of light which is holography which which is and but then but then we're gonna sort of like

but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography uh has to involve

taking scans from many different locations so again we're coming back to tomography

and even like when you talk about like um you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor

imaging and that that um that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like

because you need to capture the the the um the brain for multiple different angles and and so

those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit uh is older but but but yeah but

it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year

trans the four the projection slice four-year transform and it's causing this massive innovation

everywhere all at once and and maybe people were thinking about this a hundred or 200 years ago

maybe um sounds like it but but but now the the technology is allowing all the different

possible variations uh too and even stuff like that was never imagined before to start to happen

yeah i mean we talked a little about the difference in the history of science um

one of the like larger arcs that i see i think in terms of the advances in optics and the way that

that's impacted us as a species um there's like this weird relationship there with like um

silicon i would say because you you know the invention of the telescope and then of the microscope

and um now the like screen and the way that we're basically like we've changed the way that we view

the world and the like spectrum that we have access to and like that every time that's happened

that's like fundamentally revolutionized like all the rest of our technology

yeah yes nice i hope to separate you on that on this point the uh the we are i mean it's just

dumb funny it's it's you know when when one thing reflect on that and think about it also

so in a way of what i mean this is how i see you know the ancient thinkers how i mean i start to

appreciate them you know uh even more you know given that they are so rudimentary in a way

uh so so promoto in a way in a sense they're hopeless i think Aristotle and they they so

stole them they they're able to point to the way you know it cannot be perfect and no one's

he was he was in the states and many places but still i mean a human evolution the evolution

uh enabled that the human uh much more than our close relatives with the new cortex and stuff

i mean where the potential lies is still i mean sucked in the air and people like nowadays

contemporaries like uh alamosk and you know all these leaders that the operating system we use

microsoft and on the apple phone and it's really up to so this it's it's it's high for me i mean

it's always you know i wide open and see uh to touch on the connective back to where

earlier sharing by iodata and i i had a similar uh worries before but i mean even right now i mean

uh i'm for different for me i mean the way i visualize the you know the but uh in short i

think i wouldn't worry that much as uh so there's no it it doesn't i mean for me uh i tried to

become more uh vigilant of you know what the boundary of itself versus the exterior that's

right that that's what we can do but uh that there's a max limit that we can do otherwise

we cannot find time to work right so the different cultures just like different

appearance right it's like babel tower that would though but still i mean there's a common

language we call mathematics and science right so there's so it's so for me i mean i i i see it

uh that's supposed to be one um i'm not saying anything religious but i i think uh like einstein

said that when they asked him you know if you're religious he says i have uh some sort of a god

but it's i wouldn't call the religion religion he says natural i think that's what he couldn't so

but anyway so the uh so so the uh it's also i mean that thing is exciting right now i mean

there's a knowledge in the general divide somehow for for for a few of us here i mean students

were to lean on the lockier side but so uh for contribution i mean with the clockhouse i think

it's definitely contribution and so so vibrations that we uh on a similar uh frequency to resonate

and maybe something will will come out of it it's making a positive uh contribution so i think that's

uh what i'm you know in terms of spectroscopy i mean the high energy physics just recent days

there's just so there's a new new experiments from the Fermi lab right so it's a new one there's

might be new particles to be discovered and so so it's never ending so so if but uh also the other

day i mean for me i think the i don't know what uh so so i you're you're in water i think water is

it's great it has a great uh computer science and physics uh group and so the what what so many of the

recent days of noble like uh work uh physics and chemistry most many of them can connect back to

i mean i actually kind of made a contribution to uh biology right so be it uh tools of new

measurements or be it uh you know complete sequencing i think this chair probably is not a

a uh it's probably good uh will be what was her name sorry tip the family for the uh for the mr

may uh vaccine right the lady you know but uh but they're not yeah i know you're so

well in the summer we're making group programs yeah it's uh surprising how many scientists

will live things together for covid more than the hollow and the nine half project combined so it was

really we have to see like every lab that could fit into covid do so and uh the the only thing that

i would say for some of these innovations sometimes it's perseverance or persistence any reasonable

any reasonable person would have long ago quit and uh that's kind of what i would say about

my project that any like i even got lost out of a classroom saying that i'm crazy

thankfully i went back recently and uh like the good roll hunting thing i was like how do you like

them apples or i said like hey look i got some results that we're not trivial who's laughing now

so you felt good but uh unnecessary but that's kind of the the friction that you get when you're

doing crazy new things and it's difficult sometimes to get people to um take you seriously even now

people like i'm close of outright called me like a liar and i'm like yeah okay um i'm telling you

the data is there and uh you know there's money behind this and it's not just me drinking my own

kool-aid so there is but but the thing is like um like um it's like to even to even like think about

this right this is like this is there's there's um you know it's just like this like there's there's

what you what you've described has a level of complexity to someone who was who i think that

that someone who was uh uh messing around you know wouldn't wouldn't uh you know i hope wouldn't have

wouldn't have uh that much uh knowledge as you have so it's just um you know it's like what

what you're you're you're talking about things that are like novel concepts you know and you're

in you really understand what you're talking about that's that's what you know and and that

you just like you there in in your like you've got to ask me anything happening right whereas

you know if someone was making up a story they would be pushing back against you know questions

and stuff like i think but i you know i'm not i'm not an expert but i just um i think it would

be hard for for i mean i i guess because i guess instead of the beginning you had your fear was

that you would be compared to um to uh uh Theronos or whatever whatever her name was yeah yeah what do

you think it's gonna is gonna be um uh the way that you're gonna um show people that you're

you're because because i mean i guess like you're saying there's gonna be a small percentage of people

who are gonna say well if someone has a new a new technology that's really amazing uh we should

automatically be suspicious well what uh what's the strategy uh to get a competing lab to evaluate it

so we've talked to investors who already have affiliations with Caltech and once we finalize

some of the designs and aspects of this device we'll be shipping it off to them to give us a

grading like uh to give us a mark or whatever you know to evaluate the the device and uh that's

kind of how we're going about it to be very robust very open um and collaborative because

this project is impossible if you just want to build it on your own the very instruments that we

use now are a quarter of a million dollars just to be able to capture the signals and the question

of can we miniaturize and reduce the cost of these kind of circuits uh that's just an engineering

question uh so it's it's not even a question of of if but when and uh we've been very open about

the the time frames uh between one and three years you can expect some sort of consumer product

and uh in fact we hope to have a prototype done by the end of the year that is self-contained and

not using industrial grade equipment so that's the that's the hope that the first device will cost

anywhere between three hundred and three thousand dollars and that will be the cost of the prototype

itself so uh when you mass manufacture something like that then you reduce the cost and that's

kind of what i'm focused on now it's kind of weird that you have to hustle very similar to

how Elon Musk kind of started Tesla so that's kind of been one of the inspiring things or the

things that i've been following is how Elon Musk went about creating a Tesla stuff even though i

don't agree with a lot of things that he said about covid but yeah yeah um okay so so uh that's

a fair enough point but um the um yeah that was the whole like that that was that was the promise

of magic leap basically that they um that they they said uh we have this device that it's super

expensive and it produces amazing augmented reality holographic experiences and we're gonna

we're gonna shrink it down and and you know from being like a multi-million dollar device

and into being something that uh that is affordable to the everyday consumer and that was basically

their proposition to you know to investors is that they're going to deliver this magic in a

portable package and of um and then everyone got really mad at them temporarily because

for a while because because uh uh the device they delivered that was portable didn't have any of

the capabilities of the big uh you know multi-million dollar machine that they were showing off before

it was um it was very much like a copy of the HoloLens and um and then but then but now i guess

you know we're waiting to see what their new they're they're they're coming out with a new one

this this winter and maybe maybe they'll have show us that they've made some advances um but um

but it's very it's very much complicated you you you guess you you're promising to

turn something that costs millions of dollars into um you know something that is is 50 dollars

or whatever and you say it's just an engineering problem well sometimes those engineering problems

are a little bit harder than than uh you know than you than you might expect but so anyway that

that i think that that's where you'll hit some some some people will be uh wanted to raise that

point but anyway yeah so um various implement like there is a variation of this sensor that we have

now that is about 500 we have variation that's about 250 000 but we want to make one that's in

this range uh so that we can actually scale things down properly in the way that we want

so some design decisions change but we're already in the ballpark and just reducing that by by 10

is uh it's not that it's not that big of a leap it was a huge leap to go from 250k to about a few

thousand but uh a few thousand to maybe tens of dollars it's uh surprisingly feasible i was not

expecting it to be this feasible so yeah nice i'll go ahead please i was just gonna say we're

like you're part of a long tradition like if you want to think outside of the box you have to be

kind of outside of the box and like i think tesla's uh professor told them that um you know his devices

were an impossible perpetual motion machine right and and i had the same instinct that you did like

um once i recovered i you know went back to my doctor and wiggled my fingers which he said i'd

never be able to do you know so yeah i think yeah fundamental about like if you're going to make

something that's outside the norm it's because you're already free thinking you know so yeah good

on you i did have another question so earlier um someone said that they basically saw that your

device was in terms of the potential harms that your device is uh the potential harm or

the device could could detect um the one of the things you said it could detect make it too easy

to detect harmful viruses uh in the environment and then and then that that could be a big issue but um

but but they but basically it was a detection mechanism and and so uh what i wanted to drill

down on is basically is it is it more than just the detection mechanism um or is it a is it a

trichord is it a trichorder that can that can that can uh make some DNA changes uh to you know itself

not the current models so the energies are purposefully only for um imaging or detection

identification not for modification um that is the harder problem but in in essence i think the

modification and editing is not impossible it's just a matter of the relative energies like if

you look at the movie elysium where they have that tanning bed and people lay down and it's

scanned your body and all that stuff that's like that one of the first presentations that i did to

the engineers i was like this is what we're aiming for this is this is the goal everyone

but right now we're here and so it was it was kind of a funny thing because everyone chuckled

but then they were like yeah but that's true we're actually not that far away from it

but it is a matter of like regulation so even if you were to detect like a pathogen there would

probably have to be some sort of coordination with the government that okay when the sensor goes off

and it detects this thing that pings the local public health agency that you know uh is able to

at least keep track of this stuff so unfortunately the monitoring is uh is one mechanism that's

going to erode privacy but privacy in exchange for peace of mind i don't mind so

so uh quickly uh i already did the movie uh elis i um is that the one

elysium uh the uh the medical bed or med med bay med bed uh little uh video on youtube you can

watch that so that's kind of uh how i try to get the engineers more sure great i'll make

by the way uh uh i'll mike i uh go ahead with uh you could but uh after that i i would like to

ask the room and also eric that uh what uh uh what's what's your comment on you know

uh your uh technology fall in the category of uh spectroscopy but uh what uh do you think the

material wise you know say in nano or macro uh that what's your what's your comment on the you know

the fast-paced uh uh progress on in this direction will well contribute to the field that you are

interested in yeah gallium nitride and gallium arsenide contributed to the expanded spectrum

capabilities for detection so without those advances of those substrates this would not

likely be possible okay so that's uh uh leds right gallium nitride is a replacement for silicon

that also it's in the terahertz range so oh so you're talking about the three and five uh okay so

some some some people will call it the three three five i mean uh third generation but

those are mostly for power right so high temperature uh high uh voltage

alternatively high sensitivity so but there's also a sensor that you can look up called a

reiberg sensor at r y d b e r g and it's in the town with r y reiberg reiberg r y d r g um yeah so

that sensor came out last year us army infectious uh no not us army infectious the us army communications

division developed this sensor um to cover a large band of the spectrum so they're able to up to i

think 100 gigahertz with only one antenna or one sensor so that's quite impressive and they can

expand it to about a terahertz so you don't need multiple sensors or modules to cover the entire

spectrum so there's been a lot of advances that have helped okay so if we're talking about um

if we're talking about you know so there's the concept of 3d printing and the concept in sartreck

there's the the concept of um basically uh the replicator right where you can make any food

right so so let's say that um let's say that theoretically you've got you've got the uh

you know it's it's 50 it's i don't know if it's 20 years from now 50 years from now 100 years from

now you've got the next the next generation version of your technology that you're working on right

now and um it's and uh it is we're not just detecting anymore we're changing things and so like

we we can uh we can point this um this at uh at a dish and uh and and change and maybe change the

flavors of the dish change the smells of the dish change that but then when we're talking about

DNA you know maybe you could you could uh like instead of a drug therapy you could just intro you

could introduce the the um you know some sort of uh some sort of um effect which is it which is

equivalent to the to the drug right um yeah yeah there's actually a famous episode of the

star trek voyage or where chikapote uh brings like this little device over to shell camp in

jain when it says my ancestors used to used to take psychedelic drugs but now we can just do it

with this device and he holds his hand over the device and it allows him to start tripping with her

and so that's kind of ugly enough a lot of these science fiction things have inspired a lot of these

scientific advances so I suspect that is also possible and um but so so like um uh and if we're

gonna like if we're gonna if if I if we're talking about like just a matter of like so I guess my

question is like um just in terms of using the em frequency range uh theoretically to just change

the the amplitudes and uh the the frequencies and and the phases of RNA and DNA um how how

what's the upper bound on the kinds of changes we can we can cause what what what can we change

exactly and maybe the limits of that yeah I think we can make uh like we can just we can

obviously destroy the the the sequence uh the modifications I suspect are in line with the

sensitivity of the detection so if we can detect single nucleotide or single letter changes uh we

can probably make single letter changes but uh that's just conjecture at this point um okay but

what I'm saying is like uh so like a single so we're talking about a single letter we're talking

about a like if you know a nucleotide could be like the the letter the letter g right and um so

how would you so are you talking about changing the letter g to like the letter c is that the

kind of thing change you're talking about yeah yeah and and so that removing it completely or whatever

and or removing it completely okay so basically like like destroying just that one part of the

sequence um which is exactly and then repair mechanisms within the cell can allow the dna to

be reconstituted so there's a bacteria that they discovered in the arctic uh rhodo something it's

a very radiation resistant or radiation tolerant organism that they bombarded with uh like ionizing

radiation the genome gets like splattered across the inside of the cell but within 24 hours the

dna spontaneously reconstructs itself so there's something about the lining of the membrane and

all these other things that allows the uh structure information to be preserved within the confines

of the cell wall and uh or the bacterial wall and um that allows it to rebuild itself so similar

mechanisms that if you only make small little changes here and there those can be fixed almost

similar to runtime i suspect like or what i would call like at fixing at runtime well i mean like

so like the polymerase right is like a like a spell checker yeah uh and it fixes uh air as it happened

but um oh okay so i so this question is like okay so the difference between a g a c a g and a c in

terms of uh nucleotides is that is it really just a matter of like um um like uh like uh

like a difference in in phase or difference in uh like a temporal pattern like i don't know how would

you how or or is it like like because we're yeah we're converting one to the other so i'll go ahead

and pause yeah yeah so um uh they they not only differ a little bit but the actual shape of the

curves across the entire spectrum uh are quite different uh they're almost orthogonal sets so

you can almost make a wavelet set from the different shapes meaning that they're very uh

amenable to orthogonality in a particular kind of space so you can set up a certain kind of metric

where um these different signals could be considered orthogonal and then you can perform very quick

calculations to know whether you're listening to uh uh guanine or sinine or cytosine or uracil or

whatever so we're talking about like um with with uh em frequencies we're changing the we're changing

the shape or the orientation or both uh just just the shape of the frequency response changes

based on the different molecules so the guanine will have a different response from adenine

um i'll try to pull it up tomorrow um if you're around here or whatever um next time i'm i'm

on here i'll make sure to have a screenshot of the different shapes of the nucleotide so you can

kind of see how oddly similar and oddly weird they are um but but at the root of it we're changing

one type of molecule to another type of molecule with a with an electromagnetic uh

uh because they're exchanging so they're always there's always letters floating around so all

you're doing is creating a preferential um gradient that wants to have this letter instead of that

one so first you set up a gradient that knocks it out and then you set up a gradient to replace it

just at that spot so it's uh okay and so a gradient is is uh we're talking about an ionic gradient

like an aem field gradient well they're both they both react to one another right so um

depending on the ambient uh depending on the host solution um you can have certain so it is

kind of specific sometimes but you can tune in kind of like how you tune in with uh this radar

but i am getting really tired now so i'm gonna have to call it a night um it's actually it's

down to one percent now so it's actually it's actually midnight so we're so i'm also signing off

and i want to thank everybody uh for coming we'll we'll we'll do this uh very often so

have a good night everybody thank you very much io and uh good night everybody yeah thank you make

a thanks mike thank you and and uh thank you yeah everyone else take care everyone stay safe have a good night
