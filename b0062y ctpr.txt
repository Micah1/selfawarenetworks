So let's go back to the eyeball. And I want to say that. Imagine. Okay, so you have the light comes into the lens, it's a little area. And then the the round sphere of the eyeball is where the red nose is. And that's a fractal. The brain. And the question is that, if that's a factor of the grade, then whereas like, coming in from, and it just so happens that there's something special happening in the enterino and table loop.

And I'm basically arguing that if you consider the brain, it's a fact of an eyeball that the center of the eye is, right? Where the that where the lens is the lens is where the, the hippocampal lupus. But the the retina is, the of the brain is six layer of the neocortex and the hippocampal.

That's how the brain is a fractal of the eyeball.
