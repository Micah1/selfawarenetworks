(emotion)
I see the reality of no self

if you think hard, as a baby you have no sense of self, in fact you will not initially recognize your own reflection

just today I randomly sat in my chair, and wrote the words "is there a central character inside my brain that is doing the choosing and deciding? or are there only thoughts, predictions, and expectations that make it seem so...." before I could finish what I was writing it felt as ifmy body and mind just dropped off.

the body fell like a rag doll for a second, when my head lifted back up I realized the autonomic nervous system was still here "acting" my heart feels like a ball of glowing energy and warmth, I feel like I am part of my surroundings, its as if the whole universe is moving itself, bringing these people to have these funny lives, but its pretend, or its like pretend, its like the reality is pretending there was something else inside, pretending there was a soul or inner actor, in addition to what is just apparent.

the autonomic nervous system, the thoughts, the actions, the expectations, its all happening on automatic, the universe making herself

I had a dream of self and now that dream is gone ^_^ then I logged onto facebook and started searching for people like me.

I am profoundly enlightened in this now present happening, as the present happening is suddenly all that is real, the rest including myself is this flickering character or song that seems so much weaker now in contrast to the present moment. Its like self became a shadow, and whats here came out of shadow to become way more relevant.

On pondering further it is as if my inner orientation between the present, and the character I had in my mind shifted or flipped on its back

the present becomes real, the character becomes unimportant

I know that I keep referring to myself, but it doesnt mean the same thing it used to, because internally my emotions are not tied to that notion, its just a reference point for social dialog, self is a tool for the social contract, but there is no personal self that is real to me now. The character is not me, there is no real self, no stuck actor with stuck opiniona and stuck mindset, its like freedom, swoosh, feeling release now, sudden release into the present :)
