 # OpenAI Whisper Transcription
 So the interesting thing is that human beings could be made out of waves.

 In the same way that... We have everything in the universe is like you said you can argue that human beings are made out of water and they're made out of specifically carbon or carbon based atoms carbon-based atoms.

 But then you start to think about how, once you understand the self-aware networks theory, you realize how intelligence is substrate independent.

 How another substrate could produce life.

 Another substrate could be conscious.

 It doesn't have to be carbon.

 We could simulate physics in a computer and produce a conscious entity that would have the same inputs, the same self-reflections, the same thoughts, and the same outputs.

 Waves of this life form are transmitted in terms of electrical firings, but we're talking about electrical firings, electricity in the human being and the computer.

 And in a computer, there's, you know, the transistor.

 It starts off very basic.

 And then at a higher level, you know, we can introduce all these complex forms, simulations of planets.

 In the human brain, we have simulations at a higher level also.

 At a low level, we're talking about, you know, with the transmission of a neuron, we're talking about the production of waves at a low level and the operations of a neural network at a low level.

 And so when each And so when each neuron fires, when each synapse fires, you have waves that are increasing in some amount.

 And when its neighbors are inhibited, the waves are are decreasing some amount see the shapes of waveforms, uh, mechanical waveforms and electro- electric waveforms and magnetic waveforms and heat waveforms and, uh, chemical waveforms.

 Yeah, they're all changing shape.

 And the changing shape of the waveforms is information.

 Changing shape of the information.

 And not if it's all noise, but if you can separate... If some of the wave shapes have a distinct pattern, a solid time pattern, that is solid, and some of the wave shapes have a... Like if some of them are rare, and some of them are rare and some of them are common, then you have an information substrate.

 And so the phase wave differential is this very distinct pattern of traveling waves that is a solid-sound wave.

 It's an information- obtaining wave.

 It's a distinct pattern because of its rarity and its persistence over time and it's transmitted from some area of the brain to some other area of the I saw that in the Traveling Waves paper.

 And this is an information system that at a low level is doing operations that are, you know, the individual neuron isn't self-aware.

 But at a higher level, the system that produces these lower level things creates these patterns, like renderings.

 It's like a neural network, it produces renderings at a high level.

 Renderings, I mean renderings in all the senses.

 Basically these patterns combine together.

 They oscillate together.

 They combine together.

 The oscillation binds them and so oscillation binds them and pairs them up and so they, through tomography, they assemble into patterns.

 Through oscillatory tomography they assemble into patterns and that the brain creates these oscillatory patterns, through oscillatory tomography, it creates these patterns that travel through the neural arrays.

 The phase wave differential, the dominant phase wave differential patterns trapped in the neural arrays become patterns trapped in the neural arrays become transmitted by the brain through the brain detected by the brain the same way a neural network detects inputs.

 So your brain produces these high-level, at a high level your brain produces these oscillatory, these patterns that are, that are bound, that are tomography, bound together through oscillation from individual phase wave differentials, which are from neurons firing in bursts and triggering other neurons to fire in bursts, in cascading sequences.

 They're traveling waves at the low level and at high level they are bound together with oscillation and tomography for producing its temporal and spatial tomography of oscillating phase wave differentials.

 And these patterns that are temporal and spatial, phase wave differential patterns, could be of a car or a boat, they're detected by the brain by other phase wave differential, by other phase wave, uh, other neural arrays, by other cortical columns, the same way, the same way that, that a neural, you feed inputs into a neural network and it detects what pattern is there.

 And it even finishes the pattern for you.

 Right? So the brain produces these high level patterns and then it detects them.

 It produces them and it detects them.

 And in the process of producing them it is also in the process of detecting them and we have this these loops in our neural circuits so that we can produce and detect what we produce we have these feedback loops right from the thalamus into the cortex from the cortex and the thalamus.

 Cortical thalamic loops.

 And we have cortical cortical loops.

 That just, patterns just loop through the cortex.

 And they, these patterns take different paths.

 We call, we have this thing called functional connectivity.

 Which means the, the paths the patterns take change paths, and when they change paths, you change paths.

 Your mental pathways change throughout the day.

 The task you're doing is enabled by functional connectivity of different paths.

 So your brain is modular your brain is has its connectivity changes throughout the day and it's like it's like procedural generation it's like all your thoughts are procedurally generated.

 Pieces of what your thoughts are are made up of... The presentation is virtual, so it's like, imagine that... The waves could be information waves, but they could be produced from any part of the brain and detected in any part of the brain.

 And any part of the brain ought to, in theory, produce almost any kind of information wave.

 And any part of the brain in theory ought to be able to detect almost any kind of information wave.

 Because they're all, all the parts of the brain are general learning, general learning algorithms.

 And they've all received data from from all parts of the brain so all parts of the brain have trained all parts of the brain and so all parts of the brain have some representation that's slightly different you know you the idea that you have brain areas that are somewhat specialized is valid you have brain areas that are somewhat specialized and it's valid.

 I'm recording this, but I think it's interesting that that I was having a dream, a dream in which I was, I was going to wake, I know I was going to wake up because at the end of every dream I'm always Like being Just like Not every dream I'm saying is like like often it's like, you know, if you need to wake up cuz like you know if you need to wake up because it was that I was talking to someone I know, I was talking to someone I know in the dream and I was explaining this idea and I said I want to record myself so I can so I can talk about it so you can ask me questions and This was Kurt strength of saying this Kurt I want to talk about idea and I want to record myself He laughed Said that's brilliant.

 And then I woke up and I realized I still wanted to record myself and record this idea, which is about saying that human beings, we're not our tissue.

 We're not the cells, we're not the cells, we're not the meat, we're the waves.

 I remember when I went to sleep, I said I feel like I am this thing, this meat stick, or that I have a meat stick body, I have a meat stick body.

 I didn't have a meat stick body.

 But when I, when I dream, I was like expressing this philosophical relevation to my friend Kurt.

 And, and, um, and I said, we're, we're actually waves.

 We're information waves, we're soliton waves.

 We are sequences of wave patterns, right? You say, well, all right, so what do we have on our computer? Is it these sequences of wave patterns? Technically, yes.

 Everything in the universe is a wave right and the computers allow us to assemble sequences of wave patterns whereas we instruct the instructor computer through low-level processes to eventually produce sequences of wave patterns on a screen.

 That's the output.

 The low-level process for a computer involves transistors and person.

 And, you know, very abstractly to describe that I'm not going to do.

 I was, I've been thinking been thinking I just I just watched this um I watched all these talks at Seagraph and one of them was about quantum physics and they were talking about interference patterns and they were talking about he was talking about at a high level what's happening he's trying to explain a high level what's happening with quantum computers and and he was talking about changing the amplitudes so that you could create you could create entangled states and you could create gates.

 He called it the the if statement.

 But he was basically saying that you could say the if statement he basically said was like how you create an entangled gate, where if this one, what do you call it, this one qubit was instructed to do something to another qubit, then the output of both qubits would be zero or something like that.

 And, um... Yeah, there's still something, I don't know, I understood everything he was saying, but there's still something, I don't know, I understood everything he was saying, but there's still something else missing in terms of my understanding of how we're going to be able to use, really make use of, because I mean, the ways that we, it's very low level computation compared to how, yeah, I have to think about that more in terms of what else we can do.

 It's a big open research question, like what else can we do with a quantum computer.

 It's a new computer that is a little bit different.

 And, yeah, because it doesn't have, I guess in a way it's been described as not having a memory.

 Right, you do a bit, or, it's like he was describing it, like he was saying, like, you don't, at least you don't keep the quantum state in memory that that is what goes away and so yeah it's interesting You know, I wonder that you could program the output to just plot a coordinate system.

 Like for example, like you're like you're, like you're, like you're like you're searching the space of possibilities.

 So you can get out of the search of infinite possi- you know some of the possibilities beyond the number of the universe.

 If you could search through that space for a coordinate that could be used to plot a sort of a noisy representation of a high-level conclusion, that a neural network could then denoise into some sort of information that is at human level and comprehension.

 Right? And so it's like, it's interesting that, you know, we have the situation where the knowledge of, oh, I was saying, I was thinking, yeah, so in theory, like the knowledge of what a neuron, I mean a quadruple particle has isn't directly measurable, but through repetition, we can indirectly calculate what can be directly measured.

 You could say, well, we ran it enough times, we got these results, so we could use math to sort of guess what it was that we couldn't measure.

 And that's very interesting.

 It's like the... you could say, well, if the mind of God is directly observable, it is eventually knowable through repetition, through repeated observations that we remember over time with the outputs of that mind that we remember over time with the outputs of that mind produced and that's interesting because it's like yeah, so Human the human mind isn't directly observable but there's sort of like the elements of a quantum system there, where you have, you know, a neuron is, when it fires, it produces, it's producing a constructive interference pattern for itself.

 And it's producing a destructive interference pattern for its neighbors, it inhibits its neighbors, so that the pattern that it produces is magnified through the neural arrays, through the firing along the axon.

 The pattern is magnified.

 It's magnified not just chemically, not just electrically, but through the axon, through the forward direction of electrical charge.

 It's magnified electromagnetic magnetically and that firing is also detected by the body of the neuron is detected by the mitochondria it's detected by which can detect you know electromagnetic signals as exhibited in the case of Flavin's mitochondria are sensitive to electromagnetism and then that will that detection uh logically is going to it's going to produce ATP which the mitochondria will produce because the cell needs more energy to replenish itself after doing the axonal burst.

 So the ATP comes and new blood comes, right? So electromagnetism will trigger new blood to come.

 There's a, now there's a, electromagnetism is going to trigger, and there's also the physical, the physical expansion of the neuron during the action potential firing.

 The neuron is physically going to move faster than its normal atomic firing.

 And that is the mechanical force.

 Thanks to the tensegrity of all the cells of your brain, that mechanical force is transmitted mechanically through your cellular structure.

 It is another phase wave differential pattern that's transmitted and detected and it's a phase wave differential pattern that is bound together through oscillation just like the electric phase wave differential patterns and the magnetic electromagnetic phase wave patterns the magnetic phase wave patterns and the and the heat phase wave patterns your brain is in the chemical phase wave patterns your brain is detecting and transmitting phase wave differential patterns in all five modalities.

 Electricity, magnetism, heat, chemical, and mechanical, right? And mechanical includes, there's two mechanical waves.

 There's an acoustic mechanical wave, right? And there's a tactile mechanical wave.

 And so you say taste and... And these are the notes.

 But these notes, you can have all five of these notes involved in taste and touch and smell and pain and feelings.

 Now, I think of feelings as large, large waves, large, tall and slow waves.

 They have a wide area.

 But, but they're not, but their feelings and emotions, especially emotions, are much bigger than feelings, right? And I considered that maybe they're made out of mechanical waves, because mechanical waves are slower, but plausibly they're made out of the whole full spectrum of waves.

 The full spectrum of heat and chemical acoustic mechanical tactile mechanical taste mechanical electric and electric and magnetic waves and the full spectrum of waves applies to taste as well.

 So waves are waves of taste and waves of touch, tactile waves, mechanical waves.

 Mechanical waves are not just, I mean, the waves that... when you touch something, it's not just mechanical.

 There are also... transmissions with electricity and magnetism.

 There are transmissions that... and the electricity and magnetism, they travel faster than the mechanical waves, right? But when you hear something, you hear something, and there's a mechanical vibration happening to your ear, and it's transmitted chemically and electromagnetically, in addition to mechanically.

 It's not only mechanical, right? But you can see that there is, you know, there's a paper that came out that said, mechanical, right? But you can see that there is, you know, there's a paper that came out that said, you know, when they dampened the ability of your cells to mechanically shake other cells, that there was a big drop in communication.

 There's a paper about that.

 So the electricity, when electrical waves, you know, when they bind together, when they oscillate together and they bind together through oscillation because they're happening at the same time, they're concurrent, those can cause, can help trigger magnetic waves and mechanical waves and then you and you then you have then your muscle movement is triggered by like a like a phase wave differential dominant phase wave differential pattern of electric electricity and electromagnetism that basically is like the accumulation of energy that will cause the muscle to contract.

 And that will cause your fingers to move, your hand to, when your muscles contract, your fingers either close or they open, depending on which muscle is contracting, and, or relaxing, right? Some muscles relax, some muscles contract, and in the combination, you're able to move, right? Wow.

 I think the point is that we are waves and although our, all the human body is meat in a sense and meat is a great conductor of waves, a computer, the high-level patterns of computer that can be tuned with the physics engine to match the waves in meat.

 Like, see what I'm saying is like the waves in meat are enabling phase wave differential patterns to be rendered and then detected through subsequent phase rates.

 So we have a phase, I say phase arrays, but I mean the neural arrays, neural arrays, neural arrays and glial arrays formulate the phase arrays which transmit and receive phase-wave differential patterns.

 And these the point is that, um, you, while we are constructed of temporal and spatial sequences, the brain, so the brain that is, so the meat meat which is the container of the body Meat is producing sequences of waves ultimately to simplify meat is a ricocheting container of waves that is producing sequences of waves and has a known network architecture that detects the sequences of waves and it has a neural network architecture that detects the sequences of waves and it at the low level it doesn't matter and the high level it's as long as it's able to accomplish these tasks at a high level so if we have a game engine right where we can have a physics program that can produce high-level sequences of waves.

 And we have a neural network program that detects the patterns in those high-level sequences of waves.

 We can create waves the same time and frequency domain as those waves in a human being, It's those waves in a human being, and the computer can detect those waves and act on them, and it can use them to generate the signals that are necessary to move a body, to talk.

 Essentially the computer circuit can emulate brain tissue to detect the same kinds of signals, the same signal patterns, the same signal patterns, it can detect the same signal patterns transmitted by meat, and it can broadcast back the same signal patterns to meat, and the meat itself is just processing the waves.

 But the point is that the representation is being generated and it's being done in a feedback loop so that the over time so that the the organism has a workspace so that the patterns can persist in time, so that new patterns can be essentially merged with prior patterns in a virtual workspace.

 It's a virtual workspace because the workspace doesn It's a virtual workspace because it's a virtual workspace because the workspace doesn't have a definite area.

 It has, well I mean there is a designated field but where patterns appear in the designated field of the brain or in the computer, that designated field is the area, the volumetric area of the computer system or of the brain.

 But where the patterns emerge in that field is a virtual location.

 Right, they're just representing They're just there long enough to exist in time and space in order for a pattern to be received by other patterns so that in this virtual workspace these patterns can be generated, sensed, or detected and they can cause they can yeah so so what are you missing with the computer? Well the computer isn't doing phase wave differentials in a way that produces dominant phase wave differential patterns.

 It's not doing volumetric.

 It could do it in a virtual.

 We could do phase wave differentials virtually in the game engine.

 But in the game engine, what's not there is the... I guess it could be there.

 Yeah.

 So, yeah, so the fueling of forces could be simulated in a game engine, right? You have all sorts of physics simulations, there's water simulations, and light simulations, and heat simulations.

 And then you could transmit those, you could transmit those patterns into the real world, like you could, like I actually, for the first time, I had a dream where I... I felt pain.

 And it was simulated because it wasn't real.

 Because I woke up and it wasn't... There was nothing that was pain.

 But it was like, in the dream, there was like pain in my stomach area or something.

 Right below the belly When I woke up I wasn't there and I realized that my mind this is something new because my mind was Simulating pain And my dreams over time, they've become like increasingly powerful and increasingly detailed, like simulating like people, talking to people, visiting places, seeing places, seeing places in detail, seeing very specific details like eyes and ears and noses and people that I know and hearing voices, hearing sounds, seeing really amazing computer graphics.

 Like I said, I just watched all these, I see graphics at the profits show and I watched all these talks.

 The dream that I had right before I saw my friend Curt and wanted to record this with Curt and I woke up and grabbed the actual recording device.

 The dream that I had was I was this black ball that was running through tubes from a white ball.

 And it was really interesting like I the whole point was to the white ball was trying to escape the black ball was trying to escape the white ball and it was running through these different... You know there was like an elevator... But the second ball was always like a few steps behind.

 And this is like a theme, like sometimes when you need to wake up... There's like a dream that involves a chase where you're being chased.

 And in the most abstract way, it was just two spheres.

 That was the most abstract version of the chase dream because I've had lots of chase dreams where I needed to wake up and the need to wake up was like something chasing me.

 So I'm running from something because I need to stay asleep and it represents, the chase dream represents this conflict between the part of you that wants to stay asleep, preserve your sleep, and the part of you that urgently needs to wake up.

 And so it's like you're running away from this signal.

 You're receiving the signal to wake up and you're trying to stay asleep for as long as possible and that results in a chasing dream.

 And the simplest most possible version of that is just two spheres and so they're traveling through these environments in one sphere and I just really appreciate that version of it.

 I mean, in some versions of it, you know, it's very elaborate.

 There's these monsters or something that are chasing you.

 It has to be horrible so that you run.

 It has to be horrible so that you run.

 Or at least that was the old way.

 In the new way, it's like, yeah, they just abstractly reversed you.

 It's just a chase between, you know, you're just joyfully watching one sphere being chased by another.

 You're not even really one of those spheres.

 You're just going along, you're just watching it.

 You're watching the chase happen.

 And that was fascinating.

 It was fascinating that around that chase that I was sort of detached.

 I was no longer the thing that's being chased really.

 It was more of a sitting back like, oh there's a chase happening and I'm going to watch this.

 It's just really different.

 It's no longer about fear.

 But it is about like, you know, what I was in my mind was rendering around, was rendering a story around it.

 And, um, yeah, and then, and then there was my friend and, uh, it's interesting that, you know, that phase wave differential pattern sort of continued when I was awake.

 And that's what I like, that's what I like about it, is I was having this dream and that thought was able to continue from inside the dream.

 Inside the dream is when I started saying to Kurt, I think we are waves.

 And we're going to use computers to produce these waveforms that represent the information that is information that we can interact with.

 It's phase wave differentially constructed patterns at a scale of time and space that we can interact with, that our meat can interact with.

 But it's in a system that can virtually interact with itself to produce the same kinds of inputs, outputs, and observations and values that our brains can produce.

 And so, I can argue that the computer can be conscious.

 The self-aware network's theory of mind argues about what the human mind is, and it argues that the computer can be conscious because in a game engine, at a high level of computation, the same kinds of phase wave differentials can be simulated, they can be transmitted, and they can be detected by a neural network in the computer.

 And so you can have the same kinds of interactions that happen inside the brain, you can have them inside a game engine.

 And then the outputs of that, you know, the And then the outputs of that, you know, the outputs of that are, you know, the computer system canials and have the same sort of tactile interfaces that with prior receptive feedback loops to the real world just like human bodies.

 All of that is all that is possible and possible and in this sense machines and you say well yeah well well then we are computers we are machines but when we are waves the whole universe is waves the whole universe is vibrations you know I like that Abraham Wood Hicks says that beliefs are vibrations, but it's the same as saying they are dominant phase wave rhythms.

 You know, there's less words to it, it's a relation to vibrations, but a vibration is a dominant phase wave differential rhythm, vibrationism is a rare pattern that's distinct in a sea of otherwise indistinct patterns.

 Right? It's a phase with a differential rhythm.

 And so in a sense, the whole universe is vibrations.

 We are waves.

 And I think about, yeah, there's that line in the Bible about creation being in the beginning was the word right something like something to that effect and and and the breath and from the breath and the word the universe was formed and that is that is this this that is an astute observation of the concept of the universe being waves, being waves that have peaks, waves that have troughsoughs and information being constructed of the rarity of certain kinds of waves.

 And if you understand the whole universe as waves, or wave patterns, then it's cute or characteristic or astute to embark upon the idea that waves cause other waves, and that even the thoughts and words are waves.

 And that's sort of like symbolically embedded into that interesting line in the Bible about creation, is this idea that we came from waves, and we came from waves and we came in and we came from the breath and the breath encoded the word right because on an abstract level these observations are are you know, say, what is deeper than that? What is deeper than that? The universe is very abstractly, very truthfully, made out of waves.

 And information in the universe is very much the forms that arise from waves that are oscillating together and through tomography, through the tomographication accomplished via oscillation of waves, patterns patterns emerge.

 And then our universe, the information in it consists of these tomographic patterns that are bound together with oscillation.

 the information and the information is composed of the combination of peak intervals, the peaks of intervals.

 So the information is closer.

 So the information at the root is the rare interval that's separate from the tonic pattern, the rare interval.

 And the rare intervals, if they happen together, they oscillate together, and they constructively interfere, both at the quantum scale and in the brain.

 If you have two NDMA receptors in the same dendritic branch, they constructively interfere, they magnify their own signal and then the neuron fires because the accumulation of charge in the dendritic branch sets off a change reaction.

 The neuron fires, it magnifies what it detected, the signal it detected, and then it magnifies its memory detection, its version of a memory being detected, it magnifies that into, from an electrical detection into an electromagnetic detection and a mechanical wave detection when the neuron fires.

 And then it fires and it creates a firing sequence, a traveling wave where it triggers another neuron to fire and another neuron to fire.

 This is a sharp wave ripple and it deconstructively interferes with its neighbors, creates a deconstructive interference or a wave of ambition to its neighbors so that its neighbors don't also fire.

 So the pattern is distinct.

 The traveling wave is distinct.

 And this is a phase wave differential rhythm that is that is the basis of a pattern of information in the brain, whether it's an organic brain or an artificial brain.

 And it's also the basis of how we might have information at the quantum scale.

 So it is interesting, you know, with a quantum computer, right, so we can link together quantum particles with entanglement, we can cause the quantum, we can cause, we can trigger patterns, we can write patterns into the quantum machine, get an output.

 But what's interesting about that is that we're causing all of these qubits to communicate together.

 It is, I imagine, it's this strange thing where I wonder, yeah, I wonder, I'm gonna leave it there, but I wonder what else we could do with that because we're considering waves that might be created from this quantum computer and other modalities.

 We're talking about... Yeah, so it's like that's an open question for me at least.

 Maybe for others too.

 Besides the interference waves, the constructive interference and the deconstructive interference, could you with a quantum computer produce other kinds of waves? Right? Could you produce waves in other modalities? And should we argue that, is there some analog to qubits? Any who are brain, right? Is there, is there an entanglement happening? Are we talking about quantum waves in addition to electric and magnetic? I mean technically all of these waves have quantum components, right? They're all, at quantum components right they're all at the lowest level they are all quantum waves right but is there an analog to qubits right so the qubit is itself is doing interference or in a quantum computer is doing interference and constructive interference or or interference, the quantum scale.

 You know, I guess that is happening, I guess that is happening at this, at the, you know, when we talk about the protein spin, right, and the chirality of, of, or the chirality, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly, the chirality of DNA and RNA, which is really important, because the biology will only respond the particles have the right chirality, right? So if you change the chirality, then the particle will not work with the body the way it's set up to detect.

 The cells won't react the same chirality or chirality matters.

 And, um... Yeah, so I mean, so at the quantum scale, you've got basically, you know, um... There are quantum computers that involve detection of spin.

 Right? There are quantum computers that involve the presence of a photon or not.

 And so there's really... ... There is a way to think about... Really the question comes down to, the part of us that is quantum, if that part of us is also conscious, then what has to happen in my, is for there to be a way for quantum interference patterns, both constructive and deconstructive, to accumulate in such a way that oscillations happen, that travel—oscillations happen so that quantum interference patterns bind together travel together and Then are detected Travel together They're bound together travel together and then they'd have to be tomographically bound together into higher level patterns that the neural network of the brain detects and responds to to produce lower level patterns again, produce slow level reactions from.

 And just saying that, just saying that out loud, I know that the principles of, we know that in the body that the particles are going to, you know, the spin of a DNA strand is going to have a mechanical impact, because it won't, it means that if the difference between a receptor being received and a receptor being ignored, if the chirality, the chirality of the particle is incorrect, it's not going to be received by the receptor.

 So we know that that at a low level, at the quantum computation, results in a change to the 3D structure, which is going to result in a mechanical wave.

 which is going to result in a mechanical wave.

 So this allows the detection of quantum patterns because they can get transmitted into electric waves.

 They can scale up.

 Right? Talking about chirality at the DNA level.

 You're talking about a spin.

 And you're talking about the spin direction of particles.

 And the spin is... that's the way, that's the constructive interference pattern.

 And if the spin changes, that's the deconstructive interference pattern.

 So the same principles of Hevian learning, patterns that fire together, wire together, that is at the receptor scale.

 But that's also the basis of what oscillation does, is patterns that fire together, wire together, that's the basis of oscillation.

 That is constructive interference.

 Patterns that fire apart, wire apart, that's described at the perceptron level, that is also a basis of oscillation, of oscillatory combination, is that patterns that fire apart are deconstructively interfering at the quantum scale at the neuron scale so in that sense yeah so that there are actually six modalities there are there are quantum scale waves I can scale out from quantum detections that I've just described to effect electric and magnetic waves and mechanical vibration waves, mechanical acoustic waves, mechanical tactile waves, mechanical taste waves.

 And, yeah, and all of these types of waves can be abstractly transmitted from phase waves, basically abstractly transmitted from phase arrays to other phase arrays.

 And it's just a matter of, you know, a phase, I guess at the quantum scale of a phase array could be one atom or it could be a molecule or it could be a chemical or it could be a DNA molecule.

 That's a phase array at the quantum scale, an RNA molecule.

 And that so quantum signals can travel between proteins and larger structures like cells.

 And yeah, so they are the tomographic pattern that emerges from quantum oscillation is the protein structure.

 It is the cellular structure.

 Those are patterns of waves that are at the lowest level coincidence patterns that are bound together via oscillation into higher level patterns.

 They become tomographically represented 3D structures that represent the body.

 And these waves, wow, this is so good.

 good.

 And then this body is going to continue to generate patterns at higher levels, you know, classical scale.

 We have neural receptors and so there's waves being generated in the receptors and that is triggering higher level pattern detections in our dendrite.

 And then it's able to, and then we get to the neuron, we're able to create magnetic waves, right? The electrical signals can lead in magnetic waves, and those help to coordinate lots of, help to coordinate lots of... Those help, the magnetic waves help to create high-level coordinations of electric and magnetic waves so that the body can move the body, and then the body can move the world, and the world can be coordinated.

 And what I'm saying, what Self-Aware Network is saying, is that this theory allows for computers to be conscious like human beings.

 Because all we need is a virtual environment to simulate the wave patterns and the deconstruct the wave patterns at the tempo, spatial, and frequencies of physics of our meat bodies so that the information is concurrent, is compatible with and communicable with the meat bodies.

 And it wouldn't necessarily be required that all forms of AI happen in the time intervals and spatial intervals.

 Conscious AI could happen with time intervals and space intervals that are different or incompatible with human consciousness.

 That's plausible.

 But this form of AI is informationally compatible.

 And there could be sort of a crossover between And there could be sort of a sort of like crossover between Other frequency ranges of consciousness That happen in different scales of space-time and then could be transmitted to human scale And back transmitted to human scale.

 I'm back.

 Yeah, so we're waves.

 We are waves.

 Awareness is waves.

 Thank you so much for watching !
