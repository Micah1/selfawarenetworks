Sharp wave ripples, sequences brief high frequency bursts & spikes triggering phase wave oscillations of local field potentials greater than 150ms in duration. Some people in the medical imaging community think of burst firing & sharp wave ripples as brainwaves in the fast range 80hz-200hz frequencies, but brains can issue burst firing at frequencies as high as 600hz.

Sharp Wave Ripples, or sequential patterns of bursting & spiking include coincidental patterns of synchronous inhibitory waves or slow downs in the rate coding of nearby cells that emerge from the bursts & spike sequences.

High Phasic bursts, aka Sharp wave ripples trigger collective synchronous events. (Their decay rate or action potential duration sets the timing of the neural array defined by it's exit terminal that is inhibited after the Sharp wave ripple.)

Neuroimagers notice that Sharp wave ripple events in the Hippocampus it mark a time when the Hippocampus is sending something really important to the rest of the brain, that causes coordinated synchronous activity (the memory is scaling up, for a visual imagine a stone skipped across a pond causing ripples where it bounces.)

Sharp Wave Ripples are activated memory-prediction-renderings, and what they represent to your brain depends on where they came from, what they were connected to, and  

But essentially High phasic ripples or bursts are the key process for how a memory prediction stored in a synaptic location scales up to become part of a whole brain pattern.

Paraphasing the video linked above: "A ripple event in the hippocampus causes place cells in the hippocampus to become active during the ripple, they are activated one after another, in otherwords a sequential activation of ripples happens across many place cells during a sharp wave ripple, and this has been shown to correspond to specific trajectories, representing learned paths or learned strategies."

High Phase Burst Sharp wave ripples cause sequential activations of spiking activity in the brain that can be observed with medical imaging. This phenomena is not restricted to the Hippocampus, but most of the research on SWR has been done in that area.

I think the big difference in the research on Burst firing & Sharp Wave Ripple events is simply that the study of Sharp Wave Ripples is focused on the sequential activations that follow the burst firing. To rephase that I think Burst Firing & Sharp Wave Ripples are both about Burst firing, but the Sharp Wave Studies are about studying the sequential activations of spikes across the brain that result from the Burst firing. Whereas studies on Burst firing tend to be focused on just one neuron.

When researchers use the phrase Episodic memory, such as in the context of you ate something and then you had a (video or emotional or other sensory) flash back to your childhood, because the taste triggered a memory, what I think they are describing is a volumetric rendering, in terms of sensory modalities of vision, taste, smell, sound, feeling & emotion. The concept of Episodic memory implies a volumetric reconstruction of a remembered past lived in experience. Perhaps I should say a volumetric video, with volumetric audio, with volumetric feelings, tastes, smells, etc.... Episodic memories have spatial & temporal dimensions. They begin they last for a time, they end. The experience was felt somewhere.

The feeling of being somewhere, of being here in your body is a spatial & temporal rendering, that your brain is producing with messages between cells, between synapses, that are stitched together with phase wave oscillations. This feeling of being somewhere exists in contrast to the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern that you have inwhich there is no intrinsic feeling of being anywhere. In otherwords your sense of location is created by the shapes of your active neural paths (from active synapses) as your brainwaves thread your neuropathways with oscillating (looping, cyclic, feedback) activity.

In a nutshell researchers associate sharp wave ripples, or phasic spikes that trigger cascades of spiking, and waves of synchonized oscillations (via the inhibited exit terminals from each spiked neuron) with episodic memories, because sequential activations, in brain activity, is what you might hope to see if you were looking for the neural correlates of a memory movie being played back in the brain. Similar in concept to how a movie is constructed from a sequence of individual pictures frames.

When you remember something, that memory starts with a sharp wave ripple, which begins with a high phasic burst, that inhibits it's exit terminals, followed by a sequence of action potentials, each of which are inhibiting their exit terminals, and the Sharp Wave Ripple sequence is triggering both sequences of inhibitions (anti-action potentials that have lower frequency but higher magnitude (they affect a wider radius and magnify the area of the signal)) and sequences of excitations (that lead to action potentials they have lower magnitude but higher frequency, they affect fewer neurons by area, but they travel farther in terms of distance in the brain).


# "Burst Firing in the Electrosensory System of Gymnotiform Weakly Electric Fish: Mechanisms and Functional Roles"

"Natural electrosensory stimuli consist of sinusoidal variations in the amplitude of each fish’s own EOD that arise in multiple behaviorally relevant contexts. For example, when two fish are located close to one another (i.e., <1 m), interference between their EODs will cause a sinusoidal AM (i.e., a beat, whose waveform is considered a first-order stimulus attribute, Figure 1B) at temporal frequencies of 0–400 Hz depending on the EOD frequency difference between the two fish (Hupé and Lewis, 2008)." 

In fish that have electrosensory temporal (read tonic beat, or first order stimulus) frequency spikes in the range of 0-400hz. (This is the tonic firing not the burst firing)

Those same fish are going to have high phasic burst firing in the range of 150-600hz
"Burst Firing in Peripheral Afferents. We first describe burst firing at the sensory periphery (Figure 2A). EAs display strong heterogeneities in their baseline activity (i.e., in the absence of stimulation but in the presence of the animal’s unmodulated EOD). Indeed, their baseline firing rates range between 150 Hz and 600 Hz (Nelson et al., 1997; Gussin et al., 2007; Metzen and Chacron, 2015; Metzen et al., 2015b)."

Your brain is capable of burst frequencies as high as 600hz

**SWR are sequences of synchronous bursting of cells.**

# "Hippocampal sharp wave‐ripple: A cognitive biomarker for episodic memory and planning"
"These sink‐source distributions are strongly correlated spatially with the evoked LFP responses of electrically evoked discharges of CA3 pyramidal neurons (Fig. ​(Fig.6B),6B), the relationship suggests that [SPW-Rs Sharp Wave Ripples] reflect the excitatory depolarization of the apical dendrites of CA1, CA3 pyramidal neurons by the synchronously bursting of CA3 pyramidal cells (Buzsáki et al., 1983; Buzsáki, 1986; Suzuki and Smith, 1988b; Sullivan et al., 2011)."

# "The hippocampal sharp wave-ripple in memory"
"One such pattern is the sharp wave-ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance."
"Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes."

# "Normal and Abnormal Sharp Wave Ripples in the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Cortex System: Implications for Memory Consolidation, Alzheimer's Disease, and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy"
"It is posited that these waveforms reflect rapid network interactions among excitatory projection neurons and local interneurons and that these waves may contribute to synaptic plasticity underlying memory consolidation. Further, SWRs appear altered or ectopic in AD and TLE. These waveforms may thus provide clues to understanding disease pathogenesis and may even serve as biomarkers for early-stage disease progression and treatment response."

# "High frequency burst firing of granule cells ensures transmission at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse at the cost of temporal coding"
"Nevertheless, high-frequency burst activity induced a short-lived facilitation to ensure signaling within the first few spikes, which was rapidly followed by a reduction in transmitter release."

^ High phasic firing, burst firing, also triggers inhibition, inhibitory waves, alternating inhibitory & excitatory sharp wave ripples. Like waves in the water. Like sinusoidal waves but played out in sequences of neurons. A sine wave is a curve describing a smooth repetitive oscillation.

What is funny is that some researchers think the goal of the brain is synchronous firing. 

"The notion that frequency coding is partially lost in individual GrC firing patterns has interesting implications for the cerebellar network as a whole and challenges the idea that GrCs merely act as interposed relay-neurons. What is the purpose for a GrC to fire a high-frequency burst when actual release falls behind?"

"This means that a brief PF burst could overcome the initial low RP to ensure release within the time window of the burst. Moreover, as the presynaptic insufficiency caused a rapid fall in RP, restricted release prevents immediate saturation of the postsynaptic site, thus leaving room for temporal summation at a lower rate. Ultimately, these characteristics point toward a non-linear mode of synaptic transmission, in which the actual occurrence of a synaptic event bears significance as well as its timing within a burst."

In the context of the physics of oscillations a slow down in the frequency of one metronome clock that was previously synchronized with another metronome clock matters. When the two metronomes resynchronize it means the difference between them has been dissipated between them evenly, slowing down the faster metronome by 1/2 the difference in the slow down of the slower metronome.

Some folks think this "frequency coding is partially lost in individual GrC firing" is an accident, or a loss in precision, an error in the system, an inefficiency. I don't agree.

I think it's how the signal gets magnified from high frequency low magnitude signal, to a low frequency high magnitude pattern.

# "Preconfigured Dynamics in Our Brains by György Buzsáki, M.D., Ph.D." https://youtu.be/izVCKEsDSq0

A Sharp Wave Ripple might have 3 stages, such as a 200hz fast pre-play sequence, then a slower more space out firing sequence as the organism acts out the sequence on a behavioral time scale, then another very fast replay that is played back in reverse (past memories of what we did are played back in reverse in the brain.)

György Buzsáki, M.D., Ph.D. says "the goal of interneurons is nothing else but to guide the traffic of the action potentials of the principle cells or the pyramidal cells in the right direction. The interneurons are the traffic lights of the brain that allow that the messages in the brain go in the right direction at the right speed"

a0007z.starburst

In the retina the "Starburst Amacrine Cells (SAC)" inhibit the "Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (DSGC)" in just the right places at the right time to allow the DSGC to not fire when it see's the wrong pattern of what it is wired to detect, so that it does fire when it see's the correct pattern. In theory a left to right direction selective cell might fire if it's receptive field receives stimulation from an object that appears right infront of it but does not move from left to right. The SAC cell can recognize other patterns that the DSGC is not supposed to recognize, and if it does, it can inhibit the DSGC from firing.

So we can imagine that the inhibitory interneurons are helping to shape or bifurcate neural paths by doing their own pattern detections like the Starburst Amacrine Cells, which the path of signals determining which neuron's receive signals, and also what renderings appear in your mind from the output of the neurons that received signals and fired bursts that created sharp wave ripples across the brain. 

György Buzsáki, M.D., Ph.D. also says that "Sharp Wave Ripple from the Hippocampus both fan-out to the neo cortex and at the same time they fan-in to lateral septum and then to the hypothalamus" He says also that the dense connections from the Hippocampus to the Hypothalamus allow for SPW-Rs Sharp Wave Ripples to phase reset glucose level fluctuation (our blood sugar). Essentially your 24 hours blood sugar oscillations are driven by your 24 Sharp Wave Ripples, and my conjecture is that Sharp Wave Ripples are activated memories. Rephrased, your past memories are driving your blood sugar levels throughout the day.
