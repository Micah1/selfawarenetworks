  9: My updated conjecture is that long term memories are not just from synaptic connections but essentially they are from the morphology of the cell itself, specifically the morphology of the dendrite, because that determines what signal patterns the dendrite (or the cell) responds, how great the magnitude cellular response is, and what types of variations in the signal the cell might create at the exit terminal of individual synapses.

  24  Reduced neural feedback signaling despite robust neuron and gamma auditory responses during human sleep"
  25: "Next, we focused on auditory-induced high-gamma (80–200 Hz) power responses, which are known to be closely linked to neuronal firing rates in human auditory cortex37, and compared them across wakefulness and NREM sleep. The results revealed highly robust auditory-induced high-gamma responses (Fig. 3a–d; additional examples in Extended Data Fig. 4). The magnitudes of high-gamma responses in NREM sleep were not significantly different from those in wakefulness"

  30: The quantity of potassium in the cell at the moment of depolarization determines the wave shape, also called the magnitude, but specifically it means the duration of time that the calcium channels on the exit terminals are open, which determines the quantity of the release of vesicle sacks filled with neurotransmitters.

  61: All of which result in distinctly new signals, with new frequencies, magnitudes, and oscillation phase changes disbursed through the brain.

   32:  frequency and ~~amplitude~~ magnitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.
   33  
   34: If energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space.
   35  

   55  
   56: While the oscillator has a location the velocity around the oscillator can't be found anywhere and instead of seeing a particle with velocity we get the void of spacetime with an area magnitude that is relative to the density of the oscillating volume of mass.
   57  

   59  
   60: I argue that spacetime, including mass & energy, is a fractal of oscillators. It does not seem to be a stretch to consider that spacetime is 3D time interval between oscillations, with the magnitude of the 3D space at each interval of time being flattened time.
   61  

  123  
  124: Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which iterates slower time with greater density, and that which iterates faster in time with less density but more spatial magnitude.
  125  

  151  # The Tonic Mind
  152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

  203: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)

  91  
  92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators, its entropy, and its repulsion or slowdown in the frequency or density of mass, and its the expansion of space ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, reduction of space frequency (density)
  93  
  94: the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space volume ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, 
  95  

a0041z.md:
  167  
  168: because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a high frequency (slow) signal with low magnitude

   74: but basically a human is like a rock monster on some level, with our neurotransmitters being analogous to rocks, or molecules with properties like force, momentum, frequence, magnitude, velocity and other physics properties that rocks or molecules in space might have
   75  

  205  
  206: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  207  

  211  
  212: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  213

  19: the low frequency high ~~amplitude~~ magnitude tonic oscillation has a wide area entification or unification affect, a synchronization of large oscillating groups of cells, to ready entire groups of cells at the critical point, ready to react to incoming stimulus.

    6: (oscillation magnitude)
    7: ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
    8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.
    9  

   11  
   12: And the slowing effect would have a higher spatial magnitude than the smaller but faster phasic bursts.
   13  
   14: Phasic burst might be characterized as being higher frequency but also causing a greater magnitude distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters.
   15  
   16: The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.
   17  

   19  
   20: The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.
   21  

   99  
  100: We know now, and I am presenting more of this research today, that the all or nothing action potential isn't an all or nothing event in the computational sense. The reason is because the potassium channels are doing more than just repolarization & hyperpolarization, the potassium channels are manipulated by metabotropic receptors that affect cAMP Cascades and this manipulation can change the duration of the action potential, changing the magnitude of the AP wave shape, causing calcium channels to open longer, releasing more exosomes or synaptic vesicles. There is a lot more happening with Potassium channels and it affects the signals that the cell is sending to other cells.

  12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  13  
  14: Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.
  15  
  16: Mass is the Magnitude of many volumetric frequencies (particles) oscillating together. With the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency defining spacetime at all scales, from galaxies, to EEG powerbands, to nmda spikes & soma bursts, to particles.

  10  <insert dot painting>
  11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative. The neuron understands how many little dots were needed from which direction before it became overwhelmed and had to fire, there is a literal three dimensional chemical counting process going on with a dendrite collecting charged ions in various branches, or t

   7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   8  
   9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between ~~amplitude~~ magnitude and frequency
  10  
  11: Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.

  35: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  36  

  40  
  41: James Bonaiuto "Yes, that's right! I just didn't understand what you meant by magnitude"
  42  
  43: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

  93: Today I practiced imagining myself quantity my sources of stress as circles streaming out of people, and the quantity, frequency, magnitude & scale of those circles represented a quantification or the delta of stress from that particular person, from that casual body, this inner visual metaphor of my environment with people inside it provided for me, and for brain which I think of the environment for the rendered self and the rendered ecosystem a new program from which I was able to understand my sources of stress and my responses to those sources of stress better. As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.

  13: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
    6  
    7: as the particle/wave increases in magnitude / mass it decreases in frequency / speed. As it increases in speed / frequency it decreases in mass / magnitude
    8  

   10  
   11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?

  56  

  64  
  65: Can we say that space time is magnitude is inversely proportional to frequency 
  66  What was that equation?

  74  
  75: but then we need to quantify how the density of atoms in some volume of space corresponds to the magnitude of time dilation from a given mass.
  76  

  79  I realized that since AP wave duration is changed by the amount of potassium
  80: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.

  26  
  27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

  47  I need to say more about the interactions between incoming sensor inputs and the tonic brainwave pattern to fill in some conceptual gaps.
  48: I mean the sensory input neuro path ways are creating phase shifts that have via the duration of calcium channels opening & varying numbers of vesicle bodies a magnitude signal difference in terms of the quantity of neurotransmitters per interval of firing (frequency).

  67: While current TMS is a rather blunt tool, like a shotgun of brain stimulation, (according to a neurosurgeon that I asked) researchers are working on refining it so that it is more like a scalpel in terms of its precision. In order to use TMS for Neural Lace it would need to become at least an order of magnitude more precise in terms of the signals it sends and receives, but the good news is that scientists are working on refining the technology.

The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  21: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  22  
  23: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
  24  

  26  
  27: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  28  
  29: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  30  

  40  
  41: It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.

  15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also

  20: the varying rates of burst like distribution of cell communication, meaning that synaptic releases of transmitters like dopamine vary in magnitude with the action potential shape change (duration of calcium gates determined by potassium rates, determined by rates of received activity) allow signals to vary in noise levels between arrays but this effects pattern development across the 3D neural betwork because the lines that distribute the next round of information are constantly changing resulting in new combinations of learned patterns meeting temporally oscillating patterns representing previously learned memories, resulting in the novel creating of creative lines of thought and the product of differences in perception between people, but also eventually the production of agreements between people as certain patterns become learned invariantly across brains.

  45: So, there's a lot, there's there's a lot more to cover. But basically, that's why I can say, we couldn't reduce an app in the abstract, we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are. I feel the face. Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  46  

  48  
  49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.

  53: It's, I'm arguing that we've the current model of the brain is one. And one in which a phase is is not not something that has a magnitude a sort of like started in deep in the magnitude of the phase is sort of discarded in and in the modern deep learning network.

  63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them.

   43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.

But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.

    56:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

   327:   11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices.

   341:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   342     8  
   343:    9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between ~~amplitude~~ magnitude and frequency
   344    10  
   345:   11: Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.

As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment.

   722:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

  1349:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount.

In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe.

And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.

It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  3612    1584:    751:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

  4162    2264:   2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

  4806:   4443:   1034    15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  4807    4444    1035:   25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

  4815    4477    1516    85: Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

  4854    4575    2493:    852:   109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.

  4856    4577    2495:    942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

  4879    4621:   2637:    278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  4880:   4622:   2638     293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

  4886    4628:   2677     666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

  4888    4630:   2679     685:   102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

  5500:   1336:    273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  5501    1337     274:   206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  5502:   1338:    275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  5503    1339:    276    212: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets

So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  6492:   213    111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

  6583:   307:    86:    11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?
  6584:   308     90:    15: (relevant to the question of whether we can replace the word amplitude with magnitude in EEG Studies, because the wave shape is really magnitude, a combination of amplitude & duration)
  6585:   309     94:   116: calcium subtopics, amplitude, duration, magnitude, release
  6586:   310:    99:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.  
  6587:   311    103:   48: The phase pattern of the mind is a 3D grid pattern, a pattern defined by frequencies with varying durations (magnitudes) in a 3D grid of cells (your brain)
  6588:   312:   107:   58: Can we say that space time is magnitude is inversely proportional to frequency 
  6589:   313    111:   68: but then we need to quantify how the density of atoms in some volume of space corresponds to the magnitude of time dilation from a given mass.
  6590:   314    115:   73: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
  6591:   315:   120:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  6592:   316:   125:   41: I mean the sensory input neuro path ways are creating phase shifts that have via the duration of calcium channels opening & varying numbers of vesicle bodies a magnitude signal difference in terms of the quantity of neurotransmitters per interval of firing (frequency).
  6593:   317    130:   67: While current TMS is a rather blunt tool, like a shotgun of brain stimulation, (according to a neurosurgeon that I asked) researchers are working on refining it so that it is more like a scalpel in terms of its precision. In order to use TMS for Neural Lace it would need to become at least an order of magnitude more precise in terms of the signals it sends and receives, but the good news is that scientists are working on refining the technology.
  6594:   318:   135:   24: With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest.

The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  6599:   323:   158:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  6600:   324:   160:   17: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
  6601:   325:   164:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  6602:   326:   166:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  6603:   327    170:   35: It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.
  6604:   328:   175:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  6605:   329:   176:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  6606:   330:   181:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency
  6607:   331:   185:   15: both the mass/energy or magnitude/frequency or amplitude/pitch or weight/occurance rate
  6608:   332    190:   26: Also, the numbers could be off by four, even five orders of magnitude (!) and still support the idea that the majority of the brain's processing is subconscious.
  6609  
  6610:   338    214:   45: So, there's a lot, there's there's a lot more to cover. But basically, that's why I can say, we couldn't reduce an app in the abstract, we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are. I feel the face. Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  6611:   339:   218:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  6612:   340    222:   53: It's, I'm arguing that we've the current model of the brain is one. And one in which a phase is is not not something that has a magnitude a sort of like started in deep in the magnitude of the phase is sort of discarded in and in the modern deep learning network.
  6613  
  6614:   342    228:     7: reference note a0221z.md on synaptic unreliability and search all the notes in this repo for magnitude specially in the context of magnitude in note a0089z.md which explains that a neuron passes its magnitude not through amplitude, but through duration, which scales up or down the number of vesicle sacks released between 0-4 with each firing of the APsyn
  6615:   343:   232:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  6616:   344    237:   154: But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?
  6617:   345:   242:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  6618:   346    247:   564: Charges into charges and magnitude so it's ultimately attracting and repelling in a sense.
  6619:   347:   252:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.

  6621  
  6622:   350    261:   392: But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. That's important because it's like how much does this pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are we gonna be paying attention to?
  6623:   351:   266:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  6624:   352:   271:    9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  6625:   353:   273:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  6626:   354    278:   236: It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.
  6627  
  6628:   356    287:   74: You have four potential magnitudes of synaptic communication bits with micro vesical release you have you can either release. Zero vesicles, one vessel. Two vessels are three vessels. And that basically, for example might contain 2000 atoms of dopamine. Yeah. I mean 2000. Yeah. 2000 narrow transmitters that like don't remain or something and I mean if they add them so these are but don't mean.
  6629:   357:   292:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  6630:   358    297:   9: # The magnitude of the wave, determined by Potassium (see Synaptic Unreliability article a0221z.md) is passed via duration (calcium channels open longer)
  6631:   359:   302:   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  6632:   360    307:   11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal.

  6634:   383    410:   46: More than twenty years later after my Grandmother passed away, as an adult, I would find myself living in my Grandfather's house for a time, it felt like months not years, I don't remember exactly how long. Although I don't recall him mentioning the tv show "Get Smart" by name he would sometimes refer to me as 99, or Maxwell Smart's sidekick from that 60s tv show. He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them. 
  6635:   384:   415:    13:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  6636:   385:   419:    50:   12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  6637:   386    420:    51:   14: Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.
  6638:   387:   424:    59:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  6639:   388:   426:    61:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  6640:   389:   430:    83:   32: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  6641:   390:   432:    85:   40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?
  6642:   391    436:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

  6675:   424:   550:    279:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.  
  6676:   425:   551:    280:   58: Can we say that space time is magnitude is inversely proportional to frequency 
  6677:   426:   555:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  6678:   427:   559:    315:   41: I mean the sensory input neuro path ways are creating phase shifts that have via the duration of calcium channels opening & varying numbers of vesicle bodies a magnitude signal difference in terms of the quantity of neurotransmitters per interval of firing (frequency).
  6679:   428:   563:    330:   24: With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass)
  6680:   429:   567:    357: ⟪ 1504 characters skipped ⟫ event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  6681:   430:   571:    417:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  6682:   431:   572:    418:   17: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
  6683:   432:   574:    420:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  6684:   433:   575:    421:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  6685:   434:   579:    430:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  6686:   435:   580:    431:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  6687:   436:   584:    446:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency
  6688:   437:   585:    447:   15: both the mass/energy or magnitude/frequency or amplitude/pitch or weight/occurance rate
  6689:   438:   589:    579:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  6690:   439:   593:    584:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  6691:   440:   597:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  6692:   441:   601:    664:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  6693:   442:   605:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  6694:   443:   609:    698:    9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  6695:   444:   610:    699:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  6696:   445:   614:    748:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  6697:   446:   618:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  6698:   447:   622:   1090:   105:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.

  6888    680    115:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

  6955  

  6968     272    198: disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy
  6969:    273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  6970     274    206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  6971:    275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  7059     794    30: The synaptic events can be thought of as oscillators sending a knock, a knock that nudges the oscillations of other oscillators plus or minus in their own phase pattern.

  7096    1033:   13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. 
  7097:   1034:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  7098    1035    25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

  7155    1289    51: The idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's a very short great duration between when something that happens to one is then perceived by all the others.
  7156:   1290:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  7157    1291    67: The dissipated amount (of energy resonating from Action Potential Spikes into the tonic oscillatory fabric of the mind) is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective across the entire sensor. So it's multiplied in scale but it's basically a very consistent tempo spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away (over the entire brain & body)

  7188:   1515:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  7189    1516    85: Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

  7252    1928     35: I'm trying to say that long stretches of monotonic sounds, have meaning, long & slow meaning. Our cells, our body mind and voice are entified, bound, compounded, unified, assembled, by oscillation, by cells firing together in close synchrony. 
  7253:   1929:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  7254    1930:    84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.

  7385    2427      8:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
  7386:   2428:    11:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  7387    2429     20:   62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude

  7436    2493     852:   109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.
  7437:   2494:    938:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  7438    2495     942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

  7497    2614:    115:   19: It's a self-aware network in 4 dimensions rendering a 4 dimensional pattern to itself that is reactive to the world and able to make prediction-based models of reality with sparse spatially & temporally distributed frequency/phase patterns that represent coicident neural firing or coincident neural inhibition deviating from the oscillatory norm of a given oscillator on some level as observed by the neurons in the oscillator, and by oscillators or circuits or cortical columns linked across the brain thanks to the activity of interneurons and major intersections of traffic such as the thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, the tempo-parietal junction, Werneck & Broca's areas and other areas of the brain that are highly connected or connecting multiple regions of the brain together.

  7515    2632:    233:   33: its burst, inhibition, and subsequent tonic oscillation is like tcp, and like an ant colony, and like echolocation, its sending out a signal, and collecting a response, creating the feeling of expectation, shared by neurons in its pulse frequency pattern.
  7516:   2633:    260:    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
  7517    2634:    264:   66: # antigravity or anti-gravity propulsion might be a splay state oscillation to the oscillation frequency of gravity

  7520    2637:    278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  7521:   2638:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  7522    2639:    312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

  7532    2649:    416:   13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1.

  7552    2669:    599:   19: Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)

  7554    2671:    603:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

  7560    2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  7561:   2678:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  7562    2679:    685:   102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

  7580    2697:    767:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  7581:   2698:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.

  8362:   1363:   3246    313:   120:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

  8469:   1053    213:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

  8478:   1062:   323    158:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.

  8482:   1068:   343    232:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  8483:   1069    344:   237:   154: But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?
  8484:   1070:   345    242:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount.

It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.

  8490:   1078:   359    302:   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  8491:   1079    360:   307:   11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal.

  165:   5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
  166:   7: as the particle/wave increases in magnitude / mass it decreases in frequency / speed. As it increases in speed / frequency it decreases in mass / magnitude
  167  

  169    30: The earth's time dilation field, responding to the earth's mass, moves very slowly from a human perspective, but in a sense it's ripping space apart as earth moves through it, disporting space as it moves through space
  170:   68: but then we need to quantify how the density of atoms in some volume of space corresponds to the magnitude of time dilation from a given mass.
  171  

  205    22: Except that I am arguing that all mass is essentially a time crystal, including quantum particle masses.
  206:   24: With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass)
  207    30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)

  680    115:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

    33     4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
    34:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
    35    12: space expands over time relative to the mass of oscillators like black holes, stars, atoms and people, as a reaction to oscillators, this space is simultabeous with the expansion of time, referring to time dilation at greater scales

    94    147: the observer viewpoint is essentially a mini hologram inside a hologram (space) we are each the image of the spacetime cosmos and fhe product of spacetime cosmos, and a dissipative system in the spacetime cosmos which is an harmonic oscillator in total, with space and time being resonating oscillators
    95:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
    96    151: in an oscillating field oscillations grow together once they oscillate together

   173    90: everything is relative to everything else, in time space and oscillation phase, including in our brains.
   174:   92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators, its entropy, and its repulsion or slowdown in the frequency or density of mass, and its the expansion of space ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, reduction of space frequency (density)
   175:   94: the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space volume ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, 
   176  

   272    198: disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy
   273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
   274    206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
   275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   276    212: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets

   332  

   715     3: time dilation oscillates, because spacetime oscillates, time is a wave, just like spacetime.
   716:    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
   717    35: # Theta oscillations in the human hippocampus normalize the information content of episodic memory

   756     56: The memory that comes around comes around again if you want it. If you forget a cool memory, know that your memories oscillate and you might remember it again if you wait for it, and you might construct it into an even more awesome idea down the road.
   757:    73: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   758     75: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.

   792    24: Electric oscillation and coupling of chromatin regulate chromosome packaging and transcription in eukaryotic cells
   793:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
   794    30: The synaptic events can be thought of as oscillators sending a knock, a knock that nudges the oscillations of other oscillators plus or minus in their own phase pattern.

  1033    13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. 
  1034:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  1035    25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

  1289    51: The idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's a very short great duration between when something that happens to one is then perceived by all the others.
  1290:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  1291    67: The dissipated amount (of energy resonating from Action Potential Spikes into the tonic oscillatory fabric of the mind) is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective across the entire sensor. So it's multiplied in scale but it's basically a very consistent tempo spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away (over the entire brain & body)

  1515:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  1516    85: Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

  1734    232: And in terms of creating, like basically the likelihood that a pattern will move towards that oscillation is is 50% instead of 1/3. So that, although that oscillation has better chances of being a collider along, the lane that it travels. And so, if you have the convergence of lanes, as facilitated by an oscillator, the traffic lanes, then the chances that of a vertical of a vertical collision in between that oscillation point.
  1735:   236: It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.
  1736    238: On space farther, they get away from the oscillator because they're fanning out. That's not something fans out. The distance between the different fans is broadening and so that like defines the curvature of space but also the patterns that are moving for horizontal, have they continue to have a chance of moving downward, more more often.

  1928     35: I'm trying to say that long stretches of monotonic sounds, have meaning, long & slow meaning. Our cells, our body mind and voice are entified, bound, compounded, unified, assembled, by oscillation, by cells firing together in close synchrony. 
  1929:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  1930     84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.

  2427      8:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
  2428:    11:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  2429     20:   62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude

  2493     852:   109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.
  2494:    938:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  2495     942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

  2600      25:    8: as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

  2637     278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  2638:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  2639     312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

  2649     416:   13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1.

  2669     599:   19: Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)
  2670:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  2671     603:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

  2677     666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2678:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  2679     685:   102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

  2697     767:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2698:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.

    29:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

   108:    8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

   115    15  
   116:   16: The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.

    34:   30: The quantity of potassium in the cell at the moment of depolarization determines the wave shape, also called the magnitude, but specifically it means the duration of time that the calcium channels on the exit terminals are open, which determines the quantity of the release of vesicle sacks filled with neurotransmitters.

    75:     8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

    95:   100: We know now, and I am presenting more of this research today, that the all or nothing action potential isn't an all or nothing event in the computational sense. The reason is because the potassium channels are doing more than just repolarization & hyperpolarization, the potassium channels are manipulated by metabotropic receptors that affect cAMP Cascades and this manipulation can change the duration of the action potential, changing the magnitude of the AP wave shape, causing calcium channels to open longer, releasing more exosomes or synaptic vesicles. There is a lot more happening with Potassium channels and it affects the signals that the cell is sending to other cells.

  1074:   350    261:   392: But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. That's important because it's like how much does this pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are we gonna be paying attention to?
  1075  
  1076:   357    292:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.

  1078:   359    302:   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  1079:   360:   307:   11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal. 
  1080:   361    312:   67: The maybe there's that, like the gate synaptic gate opening. I don't know. I don't know. Like like how, how much variation could there be in the cycle windows? When do the gates open? And when do they close? There is one thing that opens the gates or something else. I close the gates, but the thing that opens the gates does that have a different magnitude, or spatial pattern.

  1082:   380    397:   184: it's a one or zero in terms of whether it's activated but then beyond that artificial neuron has is represented by a vector which is just greater or or less than the it was either closer to to zero or closer to one in in terms of so it's sort of gives some sort of magnitude to the to the neural network.
  1083:   381:   401:   200: The presynaptic k potassium modifies the action potential (magnitude) or apsin which determines the strength of the synaptic signal including the (magnitude) of the postsynaptic response and then that leads to how many vesicles can be released per action potential which is between usually between zero and three.
  1084:   382:   405:   251: So, I think that's what you're talking about with the by messing with the k the k currents the k channels. The potassium channels you're you're changing the shape of the spike (magnitude) which you didn't mention but that's basically the result of that and by making the shape of the spike more spread out (duration) it allows enough time for its not just one vesicle to get released but like a bunch of (vesicles) get released over that much time.
  1085:   383    410:   46: More than twenty years later after my Grandmother passed away, as an adult, I would find myself living in my Grandfather's house for a time, it felt like months not years, I don't remember exactly how long. Although I don't recall him mentioning the tv show "Get Smart" by name he would sometimes refer to me as 99, or Maxwell Smart's sidekick from that 60s tv show. He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them.

Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?
  1088:   391:   436:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

  109: 13. I built my own model of a neuron that combines Hodgkin & Huxley with Soliton Wave Theory, with Thermodynamics, and the model explains how the quantity of neurotransmitter release is affected by the magnitude of the action potential via it's duration (calcium channels open longer) which counteracts the notion that an action potential is all or nothing event, otherwise described as synaptic unreliability (an idea that led to the artificial perceptron, a flawed concept which is still used today in modern deep neural networks)

I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

   106:   11: Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.

  1352:    127:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  1353     128:    9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency
  1354:    129:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  1355     130:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?

  1380     184:   36: Micah: I mean with EEG frequencies in the brain, isn't an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency observed and referred to as 1/f? I guess I could be misunderstanding the use of 1/f.
  1381:    185:   40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

  1429     333    30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)

  1440     358:   13: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.

  1442     360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

  1467     418    13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1.

  1512     580    13: It has a regular tonic frequency firing and that regular tonic frequency firing changes and these face changes are bounced together with alsoations that in the dynamics of which you can read about with the likes of Giorgio by Sakazaki and Steven Strogets. But what we need to consider from a computational standpoint is, what does it mean to create a neural network that has that only transmits face changes in between cells?
  1513:    581:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.

  1557:    701    11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  1558     702:   95: Open up a lot faster depending on what receptors are over there. And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.

  1583:    750    119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  1584     751:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices.

The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative.

  2023      33     4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
  2024:     34:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

  2264    2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2278:   2698     773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.

  4444    1035:   25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician.

  4621    2637:    278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  4622:   2638     293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

    28:    56: While the oscillator has a location the velocity around the oscillator can't be found anywhere and instead of seeing a particle with velocity we get the void of spacetime with an area magnitude that is relative to the density of the oscillating volume of mass.

    44:   124: Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which iterates slower time with greater density, and that which iterates faster in time with less density but more spatial magnitude.

   102    205  
   103:   206: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.

I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  1226    207:   30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)

  1308:    174:   92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators, its entropy, and its repulsion or slowdown in the frequency or density of mass, and its the expansion of space ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, reduction of space frequency (density)

  1336:    273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  1337     274:   206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  1338:    275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

    43:    60: I argue that spacetime, including mass & energy, is a fractal of oscillators. It does not seem to be a stretch to consider that spacetime is 3D time interval between oscillations, with the magnitude of the 3D space at each interval of time being flattened time.

  1007    1584     751:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  1048    2023:     33     4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
  1049:   2024      34:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

  1432     280    23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends.

  1451     751    122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  1809:     34    10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

   22:   11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as a negative.

   26:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.

   49:    11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?

   85:   35: It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.

Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  107:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.

  210:    61:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.

  274:    699:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons.

According to Han Bin Lee, CEO of Seoul Robotics: “3D image processing requires fundamentally different techniques since voxels (3D data element) represent an order of magnitude more information (a cube vs a rectangle) and costs for annotating this data manually is very expensive”. Figure 2 compares 2D and 3D imaging in typical automotive scenarios:

The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  323:   158:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  324:   160:   17: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
  325:   164:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  326:   166:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  327:   170:   35: It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.
  328:   175:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  329:   176:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  330:   181:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency
  331:   185:   15: both the mass/energy or magnitude/frequency or amplitude/pitch or weight/occurance rate
  332:   190:   26: Also, the numbers could be off by four, even five orders of magnitude (!) and still support the idea that the majority of the brain's processing is subconscious.
  333:   194:   36: Also, the numbers could be off by four, even five orders of magnitude (!) and still support the idea that the majority of the brain's processing is subconscious."
  334:   198:   41: David Bergman Micah Blumberg: totally correct. To try to extract only the, for the test, useful bits (pun?) is definitely skewing the processing estimates of consciousness by a few orders of magnitude...
  335:   202:   63: Micah Blumberg Even if the numbers are off by only a hundred trillion orders of magnitude, the data should still be THROWN out because the premises have no ground to them AT ALL.
  336:   207:   20: the varying rates of burst like distribution of cell communication, meaning that synaptic releases of transmitters like dopamine vary in magnitude with the action potential shape change (duration of calcium gates determined by potassium rates, determined by rates of received activity) allow signals to vary in noise levels between arrays but this effects pattern development across the 3D neural betwork because the lines that distribute the next round of information are constantly changing resulting in new combinations of learned patterns meeting temporally oscillating patterns representing previously learned memories, resulting in the novel creating of creative lines of thought and the product of differences in perception between people, but also eventually the production of agreements between people as certain patterns become learned invariantly across brains.
  337:   209:   22: for each neuron array a neuron, the one that reaches firing threshold coordinates or transforms received temporal durations into displayed spatial magnitudes by inhibiting some varying number of cells (via varying rates of neurotransmitter release) on the rest of its array.
  338:   214:   45: So, there's a lot, there's there's a lot more to cover. But basically, that's why I can say, we couldn't reduce an app in the abstract, we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are. I feel the face. Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  339:   218:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  340:   222:   53: It's, I'm arguing that we've the current model of the brain is one. And one in which a phase is is not not something that has a magnitude a sort of like started in deep in the magnitude of the phase is sort of discarded in and in the modern deep learning network.
  341:   227:     6: # The biggest failure in the entire history of neuroscience is that we have been using the term amplitude instead of the term magnitude to model the action potential.
  342:   228:     7: reference note a0221z.md on synaptic unreliability and search all the notes in this repo for magnitude specially in the context of magnitude in note a0089z.md which explains that a neuron passes its magnitude not through amplitude, but through duration, which scales up or down the number of vesicle sacks released between 0-4 with each firing of the APsyn
  343:   232:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  344:   237:   154: But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?
  345:   242:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  346:   247:   564: Charges into charges and magnitude so it's ultimately attracting and repelling in a sense.
  347:   252:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  348:   256:   363: # Multi-Vesicle -> Multi-scale Magnitude Neuro Transmitter Release (referenced in b0123y)
  349:   257:   364: # The magnitude of the wave, determined by Potassium (see Synaptic Unreliability article a0221z.md) is passed via duration (calcium channels open longer)
  350:   261:   392: But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. That's important because it's like how much does this pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are we gonna be paying attention to?
  351:   266:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  352:   271:    9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  353:   273:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  354:   278:   236: It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.
  355:   282:   248: So of course if the if the earth you know, collided with another earth size body then it would it might fall out of orbit, you know, now or you know, it's trajectory could be changed. I don't know how much exact, how much magnitude is going to take to change this trajectory of the planet, but another planet out to do it.
  356:   287:   74: You have four potential magnitudes of synaptic communication bits with micro vesical release you have you can either release. Zero vesicles, one vessel. Two vessels are three vessels. And that basically, for example might contain 2000 atoms of dopamine. Yeah. I mean 2000. Yeah. 2000 narrow transmitters that like don't remain or something and I mean if they add them so these are but don't mean.
  357:   292:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  358:   297:   9: # The magnitude of the wave, determined by Potassium (see Synaptic Unreliability article a0221z.md) is passed via duration (calcium channels open longer)
  359:   302:   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  360:   307:   11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal. 
  361:   312:   67: The maybe there's that, like the gate synaptic gate opening. I don't know. I don't know. Like like how, how much variation could there be in the cycle windows? When do the gates open? And when do they close? There is one thing that opens the gates or something else. I close the gates, but the thing that opens the gates does that have a different magnitude, or spatial pattern.
  362:   317:   495: Magnitude response that's like okay, it's like what's the magnitude response like oh or whoa, whoa, I guess the magnitude of response right one, two, three different levels or nothing.
  363:   321:   785: So they're not big and exactly the same space there, they're just slightly apart and there's a trillion trillion of them. And you're not a mat you're not like you're not gonna imagine like the literal like visualization of trillion. Say this right because I did here is that I mean, you could you could but the idea is that any any magnitude if information could be represented by having representations behind other representations, so it's any representation.
  364:   326:   1810: Or the spin that generates the magnitude in the brain or the current that that that's going through in the brain so basically because current actually generates the magnetic field so the you can I mean either so there are two sources right they actually the same source but macro one is macroscopic and one is microscopic so macroscopically you have current let's say neuron conducting the is is there's a current going through neuron and then it will generate.
  365:   329:   1813: Magnetic field and then the others probably they I don't know about the biology so so I am just saying in principle physics, so if there is a kind of a magnetic like spin like the the the molecules if the electrons going around the the the market if they they line up they're no more producer magnitude, but.
  366:   332:   1816: But most likely I think it's the current going in the brain that generates the inlet magnetic field so basically very clear that you you can back out from detecting the magnitude you get back out the current dense, so the distribution of the current location and strength of the current but yeah, I think in principle if you just detect the magnitude outside the brain and it will suffer the same short for the, Detecting the electric field outside the brain because basically you can have two distributions let's say the just two distribution two different distributions of electron but they they charge but generates the same electric field which is measured by the EEG so that's why you you have a the further away you detected the the lower the resolution would be and then the same thing happens with the magnetic field but, He did the degree to which degree of the the low resolution or the none uniqueness of the solution is different but I don't know that the the the specifics but in principle you you'll have this non-specification or non-uniqueness of the solutions for the the distribution of the charge and the distribution was current so so that's why I think but that's why.
  367:   337:   1103: A quarter of a million dollars so trying to break it down a few orders of magnitude is actually quite possible again through a bunch of tricks that are more machine learning bass, but basically doing something similar to computational photography where you leverage machine learning to increase the resolution or resolution capability of a low-cost sensor by training in tandem with a high resolution sensor.
  368:   342:   217: Time. So how close were you able to get to measuring like single neuron spikes? And I asked that because I guess one of the major differences that people have been saying about neural links is that when you measure single neuron spikes you're talking about a new order of magnitude of resolution potentially for medical imaging.
  369:   346:   307: So it's like is like orders of magnitude more neurons and you're able to place them precisely so that the Utah array was like I said like a flat sheet of like a hundred recording electrodes and you get whatever you get when you implant it where's the neural link is like precisely implanting three thousand individually so that's it and two clarified.
  370:   351:   178: So, We would not typically do any EEG at the same time as a functional MRI with the magnitude of encephalography really we are mapping out brain activity. And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.

So you cannot do that many mature scars and then still end of interesting physics going on a little devil. And so, I think that the lactic that we are in basically identity is just because of that relatively high.

S in the world how does your theory deal with behavior as potential spotlight consciousness shifts towards not whether something is sufficient in its magnitude to recruit consciousness awareness but whether it is of salience, let's say in the simple case to survival right so in many cases that might be sufficient to have a generalized picture of the world and it's causing economical and dissolving sense, but what about the instance where you need to pay there?
  379:   393:   177: Have learned if you have to reduce it to a single you know on or off (1 or 0) then then potentially you're losing a lot of information and later on they made an adaption to where you know, it's it's um like it it can there's like, um, if it crosses if it's it's on but above a certain threshold then you can you can have like a vector that represents the the magnitude above that threshold, so they expanded the the depths of of what a single neuron could do what a single artificial neuron could could transmit.
  380:   397:   184: it's a one or zero in terms of whether it's activated but then beyond that artificial neuron has is represented by a vector which is just greater or or less than the it was either closer to to zero or closer to one in in terms of so it's sort of gives some sort of magnitude to the to the neural network.
  381:   401:   200: The presynaptic k potassium modifies the action potential (magnitude) or apsin which determines the strength of the synaptic signal including the (magnitude) of the postsynaptic response and then that leads to how many vesicles can be released per action potential which is between usually between zero and three.
  382:   405:   251: So, I think that's what you're talking about with the by messing with the k the k currents the k channels. The potassium channels you're you're changing the shape of the spike (magnitude) which you didn't mention but that's basically the result of that and by making the shape of the spike more spread out (duration) it allows enough time for its not just one vesicle to get released but like a bunch of (vesicles) get released over that much time.
  383:   410:   46: More than twenty years later after my Grandmother passed away, as an adult, I would find myself living in my Grandfather's house for a time, it felt like months not years, I don't remember exactly how long. Although I don't recall him mentioning the tv show "Get Smart" by name he would sometimes refer to me as 99, or Maxwell Smart's sidekick from that 60s tv show. He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them. 
  384:   415:    13:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  385:   419:    50:   12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  386:   420:    51:   14: Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.
  387:   424:    59:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  388:   426:    61:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  389:   430:    83:   32: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  390:   432:    85:   40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?
  391:   436:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters, 
  392:   440:   118:    11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?
  393:   441:   119:    15: (relevant to the question of whether we can replace the word amplitude with magnitude in EEG Studies, because the wave shape is really magnitude, a combination of amplitude & duration)

  407:   493:   105:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.  
  408:   497:   139:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  409:   501:   308:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.

  412:   514:     22:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  413:   518:    108:   12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  414:   519:    109:   16: Mass is the Magnitude of many volumetric frequencies (particles) oscillating together. With the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency defining spacetime at all scales, from galaxies, to EEG powerbands, to nmda spikes & soma bursts, to particles.
  415:   523:    118:   11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as 
  416:   527:    125:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  417:   529:    127:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  418:   533:    181:   32: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  419:   535:    183:   40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?
  420:   539:    198:   93: Today I practiced imagining myself quantity my sources of stress as circles streaming out of people, and the quantity, frequency, magnitude & scale of those circles represented a quantification or the delta of stress from that particular person, from that casual body, this inner visual metaphor of my environment with people inside it provided for me, and for brain which I think of the environment for the rendered self and the rendered ecosystem a new program from which I was able to understand my sources of stress and my responses to those sources of stress better. As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.
  421:   543:    260:    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
  422:   544:    261:    7: as the particle/wave increases in magnitude / mass it decreases in frequency / speed. As it increases in speed / frequency it decreases in mass / magnitude
  423:   546:    263:   11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?
  424:   550:    279:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.  
  425:   551:    280:   58: Can we say that space time is magnitude is inversely proportional to frequency 
  426:   555:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  427:   559:    315:   41: I mean the sensory input neuro path ways are creating phase shifts that have via the duration of calcium channels opening & varying numbers of vesicle bodies a magnitude signal difference in terms of the quantity of neurotransmitters per interval of firing (frequency).
  428:   563:    330:   24: With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass)
  429:   567:    357: ⟪ 1504 characters skipped ⟫ event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  430:   571:    417:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  431:   572:    418:   17: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
  432:   574:    420:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  433:   575:    421:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  434:   579:    430:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  435:   580:    431:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  436:   584:    446:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency
  437:   585:    447:   15: both the mass/energy or magnitude/frequency or amplitude/pitch or weight/occurance rate
  438:   589:    579:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  439:   593:    584:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  440:   597:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  441:   601:    664:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  442:   605:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  443:   609:    698:    9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  444:   610:    699:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  445:   614:    748:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  446:   618:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  447:   622:   1090:   105:   27: Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of as the fractal of a neural network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.
