# Taste & Hearing: Sensory Input Quantification

(taste, sight, hearing, smell, touch, feeling, balance, emotion)

(connected with note a0053z:The Phasic Tonic Relationship)

Cellular Oscillating Tomography means that the multiple activations of receptors & the subsequent cascading intracellular reactions & the signals that leave cells to affect other cells bind together via oscillation, and the changes in those oscillations create sensory patterns that we taste, hear, smell, see, feel, or sense in any other way.

This article below that makes the case for multiple receptors being useful for Umami detection is a great example of the concept I am describing with Cellular Oscillating Tomography, and also with Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, multiple cell receptors are describe as being involved in the spatial & temporal detection of flavor & texture patterns over time.

The incoming patterns cause particular multiple receptor activations that constitute coincidence detections, the foundation of pattern detections, and cause cascading intracellular reactions, allowing the information to be first detected, as the protein morphology of the cell will respond only to certain patterns and only to certain patterns in certain ways, and then allowing the unique cellular responses leaving an array of cells to pass signals onward to other sets of cells in the oscillating cell assembling which acts like a collective sensor/transmitter awareness system through the oscillatory binding of distributed patterns.

# "Taste receptors for umami: the case for multiple receptors" 

"umami taste detection may involve multiple receptors expressed in different subsets of taste cells. This receptor diversity may underlie the complex perception of umami, with different mixtures of amino acids, peptides, and nucleotides yielding subtly distinct taste qualities."
"Given the chemical and combinatorial diversity of umami tastants, it is reasonable to consider that the perceptual complexity of umami may be similarly encoded by multiple taste receptors."

"Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and a RNase protection assay, we identified mRNA for a variant metabotropic glutamate receptor (taste-mGluR4) that is expressed in rat taste cells"

"Biochemical and biophysical measurements further suggested that, in fish, glutamate and other amino acids may be detected via ionotropic receptor proteins, ie, ion channels that are gated open after binding of amino acids (7). In mammals, however, taste detection of glutamate (and presumably other amino acids) seems primarily to involve G proteinâ€“coupled receptors."

It is interesting to think that my taste buds depend on specific proteins inside metabotropic receptors. It's like wow metabotropic receptors can taste chemicals if they have the right proteins in them?

I think what this article does not explore is how the glutamate receptor activations might contribute to either neurons or glial cells firing. Most the work that I have done explores how ionic channels activate neurons, and specifically how variances in the quantity of potassium may change the duration that calcium channels are open for changing the number of vesicles releases and thus the valence of the activity being emitted from the nerve cell.

Although I have learned recently that glial cells can also spike, and transmit signals like a neuron, I do not know yet know how glial spiking might be different.

There was a recent article from Jon Lief M.D. about how the definition between ionotropic receptors & metabotropic receptors is blurring

# The cAMP cascade in the nervous system: molecular sites of action and possible relevance to neuronal plasticity
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2445527/

It seems that the metabotropic receptors might modulate the ionotropic receptors via the cAMP cascade, perhaps releasing potassium from the cell faster, and that is how they modulate the phase signal output of the neuron.

It is interesting to ponder next whether the output of individual exit terminal synapses might be individually modified so that the neuron could output even more complex patterns. I've been going on the assumption that the exit terminal outputs might be identical, but pattern distribution would multiple if each synaptic output was specially modified.

I need to understand a bit more about the differences between excitatory synapse & inhibitory synapses and whether cAMP cascades can selectively inhibit or excite these synapses.

"Our results indicate that CAN currents in Helix burster neurones are modulated by cyclic AMP-dependent membrane phosphorylation. They suggest that the physiological transmitter that induces this second messenger action is serotonin."

Serotonin triggers cAMP which triggers CAN channels.

"The dual control of CAN channels by two second messengers, namely Ca2+ and cyclic AMP, has important functional implications."

Dual control.

"While Ca2+ activates these channels which generate the pacemaker current in these neurones,"

The pacemaker current aka the tonic oscillation

"cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation down-regulates them, thereby resulting in modulation of neuronal bursting activity."

Bingo!

# "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate"
"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway."
"cAMP is a second messenger, used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. It is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels and a few other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as Epac1 and RAPGEF2."
"Cyclic AMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase located on the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell."

In essence what your neurons are tasting can affect the potassium channels changing the neurons phase output duration, (described in my article & notes on synaptic unreliability) but also it seems they can directly effect calcium channels which means in theory the outputs of individual synapses could be modified (excited or inhibited to release more or less vesicles when the action potential fires)

So the complexity of the pattern output of neurons is increased I hypothesized a few paragraphs above before looking up the research. (Humor).

Folks have been telling me that neurons can't self regulate, but via cAMP they actually can.

# a0272z.spring
# "New mechanism responsible for controlling auditory sensitivity"
"The gating spring, a tiny, nanometer-scale protein structure which mechanically opens and closes an ion channel in sensory hair cell cells in response to sound vibrations, can act directly as a controller of the channel's activity."
"The mechanism discussed in the study works by modifying a physical property of the gating spring, its stiffness, which is responsible for controlling how much the channel opens and closes in response to sound vibrations that enter the inner ear. The researchers studied the properties of the gating spring and the resulting activity of the channel in single sensory hair cells, and found that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a specific type of signaling molecule, reduced the stiffness of the gating spring and decreased the channel's sensitivity -- which is the first time a physiological mechanism for controlling gating spring stiffness has been identified."
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/07/220722184825.htm

Interestingly combined with the research above note, points to the idea that as the hairs in your ear respond to sound vibrations, they cause the Gating Spring to move, which causes cAMP to possibly modify potassium channels, which changes the duration of the action potential, which causes the calcium channel duration on the exit terminal side to change, which causes variation in the number of vesicles released in the exit terminal, which changes the phase pattern that the neuron passes on to it's exit terminal array.
