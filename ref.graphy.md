  91  # In 2014 I called this the Neurons are transmitting their shapes theory.
  92: My conjecture back then was: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topopology is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topopology is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.
  93  
  94: In 2014 I argued that you could store infinity in a curve, in the curves of the morphology of a neuron, in mathematics you can, but can the protein structure of a neuron represent the infinity of a curve? and what is transmitted is argued to be an SDR, a sparse distributed representation of the whole, a tiny statistical fraction of the vast amount of information that might be in the ever changing topography of a neuron!

    3: Cellular Oscillating Tomography
    4  

   21  
   22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   23  

   43  
   44: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   45  
   46: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   47  
   48: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   53: Discusses receptor learning with information theory. Which similar to what I argue with "Cellular Oscillating Tomography."
   54  

   61  
   62: Define new term: Cellular Oscillating Tomography 
   63  for understanding with information theory the messaging between cells is information, cells are forming memories with special receptor types & receptor configurations
   64  
   65: Cellular Oscillating Tomography: cell entropy (dissipative system) drives receptor threshold based learning in DNA (coincidence detection based computation in receptor configuration that evokes transcriptomic encoded learned responses or cellular functions).
   66  add to the discussion of the granularity of consciousness citing Jon Lieff, M.D.'s work.

   81  
   82: NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography includes communication with Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, T-Cells, Microglia, and basically any type of cell. NAPOT interfaces with all cells via COT Cellular Oscillating Tomography, because all cells exchange signals, and have receptors, membranes, and other structures to receive signals & detect information from temporal cascades of coincident activations.
   83

  105: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
  106  

  118  
  119: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
  120  
  121  # New theory of evolution
  122: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
  123  
  124: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
  125  
  126: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
  127  

  129  "When cells reproduce, the internal mechanisms that copy DNA get it right nearly every time. Rice University bioscientists have uncovered a tiny detail that helps understand how the process could go wrong. Their study of enzymes revealed the presence of a central metal ion critical to DNA replication also appears to be implicated in misincorporation, the faulty ordering of nucleotides on new strands. The observation reported in Nature Communications could help find treatments for genetic mutations and the diseases they cause, including cancer."
  130: "time-resolved crystallography to analyze the flexible enzymes called polymerase as they bend and twist to rapidly reassemble complete strands of DNA from a pool of C, G, A and T nucleotides."
  131  "All of the proteins involved in DNA replication rely on metal ions—either magnesium or manganese—to catalyze the transfer of nucleotides to their proper positions along the strand, but whether there were two or three ions involved has long been a topic of debate."

  145  
  146: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  147  
  148  # "A synthetic protein-level neural network in mammalian cells"
  149: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  40: Is the Hippocampal Entorhinal loop overstated? or understated? because it looks like brainwide input is interdependent on Hippocampal connections. Also the role that interneuons have on inhibiting dendrites directly impacts memory function in the NAPOT mode. Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography

  63  
  64: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

  2: (oscillat, field, array, , tomography, cortex) Neural Oscillating Array Tomography is the idea that 
  3  the brain consists of sequences of arrays, from the sensor arrays in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin, to each layer of cortex inside each cortical column. I had this idea and then I saw this paper which talks about overlapping edge communities in the brain "The diversity and multiplexity of edge communities within and between brain systems" https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01514-X

  5: Essentially what they are talking about in terms of edge communities, like vertices between dipoles of brain activity, I am arguing could be imagined as overlapping sensor/transmitter arrays that are doing neural oscillator array tomography.

They are taking from the open-source and taking from open source AI science research insights generated by other AI scientists, but they are not giving back in a way that establishes that they are contributing to the community.

  896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

   16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
   17  

   71  
   72: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.
   73  
   74: The other part of the argument is that Neural Array-Projection is like NeRF or like 3D Semantic Segmentation or like Plenoxels, or like the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or like Tomography as a general concept in that you have Neural Arrays projecting information in temporal & spatial sequences to other Neural Arrays that percieve, observe, and then create their own projections (as tempo-spatial phase patterns)

  124  We can pull your representations of you and the universe into a computer, and link to you to it, to create a black box recorder that can restore your mind into a new body after death.
  125  The output of the oscillations of the brain can be used to reconstruct the entire oscillating network at a moment in time, sort of like sending in sonar to probe and record the reflections
  126: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  127  

  130  
  131: Essentially we want to consider the fourier projection slice theorum, and concepts like tomography, electrical impedance tomography, holography, and diffusion tensor imaging as the model for how the brain's network might reconstruct sparse sensory input patterns into a representation of reality, with the tomographic intersections being the coincidences of phases differences in time & space, with those coincidences binding together via the principles of oscillation that signal glial cells & neurons to grow and remove network connections between cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
  132  
  133  and we could do this by creating a multi-modal 3D reconstruction of brain signals
  134: determine the locations of signal origins (eeg source localization) trace their paths (electical impedance tomography, and contrast this with openwater's infrared and ultra sound holographic reconstructions, as neurons expand when they fire,
  135  all of this topological data can be combined when combined when aligned to a time series with technology such as Tim Mullen's openpype or neuropype. (Intheon).

  144  
  145: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  146  

  157  
  158: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to György Buzsáki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.

a0123z.md:
  32  
  33: Direct connections are not the only means of influence and communication. If an electron can represent a snap shot of a unique topography (potential difference) then this topography (a spatial representation of number sets and functions, ie a program) can go anywhere it needs to go in the brain, regardless of whether it has a direct connection. So in this event the brain network can be redescribed as sort of internet of spacial temporal messages that are each a differential calculus represented by a whole neuron's changes, where the dendritic branch represents the change in Y and the synaptic branch represents the change in X, and the axon represents the division.
  34  

a0127z.md:
   16  
   17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

I haven't published it yet, but in researching that company I found some great new research (new last April 2017) on category theory encryption or category theory cryptography, there are so many cool ideas out there!

  3: Neural Array-Projection Tomography
  4  I am suggesting that a neuron is projecting its phase to an array of neurons connected to its exit terminal, and those exit terminal receiving neurons are simultaneously receiving phases from other neurons via other synapses, the neurons learn new patterns by adjusting their synapses, some synapses are told to speed up, slow down, fire, or become inhibited from firing, and they pass on one of each of these four signals to each branch of their exit terminal. Each neuron in the receiving array now represents how much of the pattern that it was receptive to was received by sending a phase that represents some indicator of how much it has seen.

   18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  106  # Main Point:
  107: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.

This is enough distinction to register an SDR of the topography of the entire neuron representing the distinct changes in dendrites and synapses of a single neuron, with a unique memory, to every other neuron in the brain.

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

  25: ⟪ 285 characters skipped ⟫ikely, as data comes in, that the key frequencies at issue for human and other animal consciousness is electromagnetic field resonance of various types. This is measured by tools like electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. By achieving a shared resonance, the bandwidth and speed of information flows increase remarkably, allowing far more energy and information to flow between the constituents. This will, all else equal, result in a new higher-level consciousness. Where before there was a lack of resonance and rather chaotic energy and information flows, now there is a smooth transfer of energy and information. We call this “the shared resonance conjecture” in our theory.

  31: What do boundaries even mean in the context of a seemingly immaterial thing like consciousness? What we’re referring to is the boundary of the physical energy and information flows that provide the content of consciousness. It’s something like axiomatic that for any information (like perceptions or internally-generated thoughts) to become part of consciousness, in each moment that information needs to reach the physical geography generating that consciousness. This would be the brain, in the case of humans and other animals (though not exclusively the brain, as we’re learning).

  55: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  185: # Cellulary Oscillating Tomography: Procedurally Generation New Biological Functions inside multi-cellular organisms.
  186  is not just about novel receptor growth that forms responses to novel new patterns, its about how cells inside an organism compute/generate new functions, or novel responses, to signals they have never seen before, such as how cell might respond to new types of inflammation, or new environments. The principle of natural selection should work in any multi-cellular body, allowing cells to adapt, mutate, computer future structures, and evolve inside a single animal. It would be like growing a third eye while you are alive, and then passing it down to your offspring if that meant surviving where two eyed organisms did not.

  206  
  207: Evolution gives us two big concepts, random mutation & natural selection, inbetween those two concepts the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" allows single cells & multi-cellular organisms, from bacteria to the entire animal kingdom including human beings to compute their future biological structure.

  222: The same principles of cellular oscillating tomography, coincidence & pattern detection, being stored in the physical configuration of receptors applies to dendrites, the soma, & whole neurons & oscillating groups of neurons, and clusters of neurons with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and other cells.
  223  

  229  
  230: Functionally the morphological distinctiveness of a neurons dendrite is analogous to the distinctiveness of cellular receptor & protein configurations that allow a cell to have distinct unique behaviors reacting to distinct & unique signal patterns. This is why Cellular Oscillating Tomography leads directly into Neural Array (Signal) Projection Oscillation Tomography.
  231  

  239  
  240: Pierre Janet in 1889 created a doctorate of science thesis that came with a graphical schema describing how he mapped his impression of distinct human personalities to different regions of the brain being activited. While this concept is simplistic if we scale up Cellular Oscillating Tomography to Cortical Column Oscillating Tomography we can imagine how at a large scale brain region activations map to different personality expressions.

  11: On top of that the concept of increasing or decreasing electrical valence maps directly to the concept of increasing or decreasing phase signals in NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. What is being projected from a neuron & a neuron array is a phase change, that phase change could also be described as a change in relative electrical valence. On top of that interesting connection, your behavior in effect is absolutely mapped to the phase changes or valences moving between your neural arrays (which including any neuron and any oscillating group of cells such as a cortical column or an anatomical structure like the amygdala)

  4  Could it be that patterns gain dimensionality when activated & transmitted? As if a flat pattern unfolds to become a 3D pattern when synaptic activity are magnified onto an oscillating array? The neuron is like a projector because it passes its phase pattern to an entire sensory array of neurons who are combining it pattern with the patterns remembered and projected by other neurons.

  14: Each "repeated" occurrence is a tiny change in the whole structure of a neuron. So it the total amount of bits that represents the whole electrical acoustic topography of a neuron were X, then with each new "memory imprinting occurrence" is like X +1. It doesn't matter at all that the overall structure is largely the same, because the SDR snap shot is going to be subtly altered because of the increasing changes to X as a whole. Including the synaptic changes, and the dendrite changes.
  15  So I did not misunderstand you, and you were perfectly clear.

  18  What if your dendrites only collected data, but never transmitted it? What if your synapses only collected data, but never altered the pulse that went out when the neuron itself fired? 
  19: If the neuron is X, and the dendrite registers a +1, then the whole topography of the neuron is X+1, but if the neuron fires and transmits X then it would be as if the dendrite did not register +1. The only way the information gets passed on is if when the neuron fires, it transmits X +1. ie it's topoi, an SDR (snapshop) of it's shape.
  20  Potentially this means you could fit an entire computer program into a single electrical pulse.

  55  Excerpt:
  56: "Hemo-EncephalographyIn 1999, the late Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh were awarded the US patent on HEG. HEG uses light to observe blood in the brain through the skull.In 2009, Hershel Toomim and I had the opportunity to discuss the wave. Had he seen it using HEG? His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.
  57: "Hemo-EncephalographyBut could it be a matter of filtering, i.e. very low frequency signals were being excluded? (The way we were able to see the wave plethysmographically was by eliminating the low frequency filtering of the state-of-the-art heart rate variability instrument.)Hershel and I agreed to consider it..He passed away in 2011 at age 95.
  58  "This year I learned that Jonathan Toomim, Hershel’s grandson had continued his HEG research.I connected with Jonathan via Skype, and learned that he had developed a research instrument without filtering."

  4  Neuronal Ensembles 2021 Webinar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzO8e_f2Hk8
  5: In this talk there is a slide called "Cortical-Wide Neuronal Assemblies" he has a chart to show where brain activity has changed, and these changes were tracked with MEG Magnetic Encephalography, but interesting the chart looks like a sparse distributed representation SDR but also it might remind you of information theory, because the number of changes are small, rare, or sparse, which means they are more meaningful because of their sparsity or rareness, the same idea works with a single cell, and it's receptors, a small percentage of its receptors might meaningfully identify a pattern that the cell has learned.
  6  In a slide about Data Processing he talks about extracting the amplitude from cortical current dipoles (assuming as measured with MEG, MEG dipoles are different from EEG dipoles) so he is talking about high level variations in points measuring dipole activity with MEG and that is what makes up his chart that reminds me of a sparse distributed representation, at a high level of abstraction variations in Magnetic dipole activity represent some sort of brain state change or memory state change at highest level of abstraction representing massive neural assemblies that include major brain areas, cortical colums, major junctions, but the important part to keep in mind is that this is just one level of brain state representation in a multi-scale heirarchical brain state. So what happens at the single neuron level or at the cortical column level matters for storing memory patterns that are not in focus at the moment. By looking at the macroscale brain activity with EEG, MRI, MEG or with some other tool you can begin to guess at what is happening at the microscale, ie which areas of the brain are more active, when this happens in EEG studies they call it "EEG Source Localization" EEG also captures high level dipole activity, but the source of that activity can be localized as deeply as the thalami, which is about is about as deep as anyone needs to go into the human brain.

  36: You can take any topography, any three dimensional surface area, and convert it into number sets and functions, a program that is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing. There is no difference between the version that is functions & number sets, and the actual three dimensional structure, it's just a conversation, so for numbers to not exist, is the same as saying that space doesn't exist

  6: If you want to know why your brain may be able to store infinite information, its because you can store infinite information in a curve, my current favorite hypothesis, is that a neuron's topography is a program, and it is shooting an electrical packet of data that represents its whole topography, this topoi is actually a program, like a computer program, because in category theory the topoi is a visual representation of sets (numbers) + function, therefore the spatial topography of a neuron is a program, with sets and functions represented by the shape of the neuron, and transmitted like digital music is transmitted, like an acoustic pattern in electrons.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

    7: In another note I proposed that the non-linear sequency of action potentials events in neural array-projection tomography could be considered as intervals in a Taylor series of polynomials that might include some sort of infinite summation, or estimate of infinite curves from learned action potential sequences, (which are transmitted as high phasic low amplitude signals between neurons that trigger waves of inhibited neurons in their respective exit terminal array).

   9: So now, tomography from synaptically captured patterns, makes sense. If you consider that for yourself, first, slice projection, theorem relies on the intersections between different 2D slices and order to an order for the computer to construct the 3D model from 2D slices. And so if so if you're able to combine multiple perspectives in algorithmic way, which the, which would which the combined abilities of like, if you if you took you had several dent rights and they each captured part of a picture a pattern and they each fired in a way that overlaid the pattern that they captured on other patterns, sort of like watercolor overlayed on top watercolor or you know, red pixels, combine combined with the pattern of blue pixels combined with the pattern of green pixels leads to the displays that we have or music actually consists of many frequencies combined together.

  45: Okay, I'll save the transcript. So you're looking at tomography and I was saying it was trying to explain why neurodemography really makes sense, that it is sort of like, watercolor or top of watercolor on top of an array that consists of a lot of other neurons. So it's like, it's I combining, you know, the pattern learned by by one neuron and the pattern learned by one.

That is capable of four. Dimensional tomographic, tomography, you say that each of the sensor raised are sort of capable of four dimensional tomography or at least collecting the signals of four dimensional demography.
  106  23:30
  107: Okay, and four dimensional tamography. Basically is like collecting all of the signals of of a four-dimensional phase field. So that the so that the brain can at some point but those signals together and construct, a four-dimensional phase shield to represent the modality. That's being studied to represent the the world that's being refracted by light to represent the details of sounds of where they where the sounds are coming from in that world and the details of what's being touched.

  13: But perhaps it could be also that early language was a little bit more like tomography similar to how the tomography of your brain activity puts things together for you. Where basically there's a repetition of the same pattern over and over and over again, with small deviation. So that the brain has the ability to consider the many different variations of the pattern, but the importance of the deviation in the sequence is magnified by it's rarity in the sequence.

   6: It was wrong and let's see if you have five, five them have any simultaneously, then they can sort of average each other out or the or the truth is like this Tomographic is some of the intersections that are true for true. Most of the time like like tomography my collector company's demography, you know, where it's like the intersection there's four year slice transport where you can take you can take we take a scientific 3d picture, I think take a picture if you know that treaty slice represents level through the object represents the midpoint to that 3D object.
   7  01:12
   8: And anyway if you have if you've pictures from all around the three object, where those images intersect, if you line them up correctly, give help to help you reconstruct. The original three dimensional image. And so, when and I'm really interested to see the combination of like yeah, deep learning, plus tomography, electric computer.

  61  15:02
  62: That are being where the patterns are being communicated across multiple lines. And let's those multiple lines are variations in the same pattern but they can be added up like the way you add up tomography look for the intersections or to find to define the object. This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

  57: And so you could do that another. There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.

The amazing features of that I guess are that you get a really nice high level non. I guess I don't know. Like would would have diffuse like if you can't capture the detail at the neuronal level with Magneto and self-loggery, With that being similar to applying like a diffusion like a diffuser filter over and image captured like putting and putting a diffuser on an image.

  15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?

  23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.

But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

So there's implanted electrodes and implanted electrode arrays, which are part of, which are also like grandparents. And then there's EG and ECOG which are also like grandparents and and basically you know anytime you're trying to measure voltage with a sensor that is sort of like that is electroencephalography which is the short word for EEG in tech and I think you know you could make an argument that the technically narrow link is the EG you could you could make that argument but that's not usually what people mean when they say EJ, they specifically mean like the scalp electrodes.

   302  
   303  59:02
   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
   305  
   306  59:37
   307: EEG or the firing speed of you know base basically the same the same rate that the neurons are firing just like what what? Neural link is doing but it's going to be able to you're going to be able to basically have this high resolution holographic image which can by a command's laser with functional air for spectroscopy or laser with doppler and you're you're doing holography you're reversing the refraction of light so you can you you're combining this with ultrasound to get greater depth so you can get all the way to the thalamus although to the core of the brain through completely through the neocortex and and then the idea is then that's that's just for the imaging part so we have well very precise imaging.

  166: Maybe you could delve a little bit deeper into the the right part. So certainly, you know, we've used a lot of neuroimaging techniques including EEG FMRI ECOG. Electrochronography and things like that successfully but when you say right so we haven't ever at least in the way that I understand, right?
  167  

  199  35:09
  200: And two photons stimulation you can direct light to individual neurons. Now that same problem that I mentioned earlier where you could actually stimulate axons too by stimulating that area was solved by engineering a optogenetic protein that only lives in the soma. So now you don't have so now in this very mutated mouth you have the ability to stimulate individual neurons in an intact awake mouse using a basically really cool holography.

   216: Oh I found I think I found it so um, there's a there's um, it's it's it's it's called the title is Colonel. Flow a high channel count scalable TD - F nearest system and it says kernel flow is a TD NIRS system has been designed but it includes an eight channel electroencephalography, so it includes the EG.

   605: And if it's not anxiety it's depression. So that's what that blood neuroscience is telling right now. I mean, it might be anger too. There's a lot of people with CTE electronic traumatic disulphography that just you know, they get really. Um so I mean how they've been I mean, they don't really some of them don't even report depression.
   606  01:34:03

  1075  
  1076: Um, but it's closer to like extreme x-ray crystallography it's not so much the communication information but just as the shape of the molecules know it's more of a resonance phenomenology, which is what we suspect so it's not only the weights like the, Spectroscopy it's not it's not similar to that it's a little bit different but it's like a you require an array of sensors to be able to detect these signals and then using something similar to a multi input multi-output array of sensors, you can make these kind of characterizations.
  1077  02:55:54

  1096  
  1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  1098  02:59:12

  1102  
  1103: A quarter of a million dollars so trying to break it down a few orders of magnitude is actually quite possible again through a bunch of tricks that are more machine learning bass, but basically doing something similar to computational photography where you leverage machine learning to increase the resolution or resolution capability of a low-cost sensor by training in tandem with a high resolution sensor.
  1104  

  1619  
  1620: It's just amazing and they're all they're all those like they're they're all have there's all like commonalities they're all basically like, you know coming down to vape in a in a vague in a vague way there's you know the way I think of of, you know, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  1621  04:32:38
  1622  
  1623: That belonged to that object in a 3d space has been captured with a camera but then but now we're like talking about okay, well, you know, we're gonna win a shine light into the brain with functional air for a spectroscopy and combining with ultrasound and basically reverse the refraction of of light which is holography which which is in but then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  1624  04:33:13
  1625  
  1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.
  1627  04:33:47

b0311y.md:
  1005  02:52:48
  1006: Maybe the most common and maybe like the bottom here but but the potential of f nurse is you know, like you know like you is is great there's also HD dot HD dash doT, it's another cool thing there's this company called open water that is is so again, they're they're using f mirrors and they're using ultrasound and they're they're using they're doing holography, so when you try and when you try and light through the brain so our brains are.
  1007  
  1008  02:53:23
  1009: Our brains and our bodies are basically two infrared light, they're basically transparent they're basically as transparent as jellyfish to infrared light so light just passes red light passes through the human body, and but it will fly it refracts a lot so it's so it it scatters right and but if you can if you could accurately reverse the refraction of the light, then then you're doing the the exact thing that that is holography that it holography is the reversion that reversing the reflection of Light and producing an image from from that reversal of light scattering and so with that technology you could recreate extremely detailed images of the human body, especially if you have a very fast and very big camera sensor or CMOS chip and so and and if you like you could use you can use ultrasound to also extend the depth of the of the lights and, I I wrote about this no no I'm saying that I wrote a you wouldn't recommend it.
  1010  

  1035  02:58:53
  1036: Interesting. Taking that potentially someday we may also do this wirelessly. This basically collects the same amount of data that we're collecting with our link. I'm not invasively with with holography and and functional narrative spectroscopy and an ultrasound. And that includes doing closed loop therapies. And in right in like, you know, when you know, I believe that that I think was max type mark that the guy who is leading the neural ink project that he.
  1037  
  1038  02:59:29
  1039: I believe he said something like there is no other possible way to to detect a neuron firing in real time, unless you're gonna stick an electro like right up next to it. Like you just can't do it from outside the brain but but but I think you can. If you if you can do holography, you can reverse the reflection of light and you can do that process it laser speed, you know, if you can do it as fast as I you know, 200 times faster than MRI or something like that, but but so maybe so 20 to maybe 20 years from now you have a you have a device that can do exactly what nearly does.
  1040  

  1062  03:03:34
  1063: Okay so shorthand for high density is used optical thermography for image income thank you and also what's your picnic what was your so you you mentioned so for me. I mean, hmm my gut feeling instead of for ultrasound this a mechanic mechanical signal would be slower than a light electromagnetic signals right, so they don't still depends on the the subject.
  1064  

  1168  03:17:28
  1169: Basically reverse tomography with electrical fields magnetic fields to stimulate different portions within the brain and also those same kind of that same kind of fabric could also be used for sensing as well. I'm talking like millions of kind of pixels across this fabric. I don't know how deep it could get into the brain you can definitely get cortical level at least well.
  1170  

  1174  03:18:18
  1175: I have to I say this idea ranks up there with open water and near a link it is yeah the super cool another project that exists is electrical impedance tomography combined with deep learning, so if you look up EIT and deep learning. That is another potential world-changing medical imaging technology, so now we have four right?
  1176  

b0313y.md:
  367  01:03:35
  368: There's a so that there's more stuff out there there's also there's there's work and you won't be you're not gonna be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with with electrical impedance tomography that they're seeing some huge medical imaging results therefore for especially for imaging brain imaging the brain that there there the the idea that we can do so MRIs are too slow they measure blood flow with a measured blood flow really slowly so the idea that we could we could speed that up with.
  369  
  370  01:04:10
  371: With. New with new faster chips to basically detect neuron firing basically by reduced by by reduced by reversing the refraction of light which is called holography and doing it fast enough so that we can notice the expansion and contraction of neurons as they're firing without enable us to basically read things as as fast as an early link is reading them as precisely as nervous as an early because reading them, but in a non-invasive way and and with ultrasound we could stimulate the brain also non evasively so this so this.
  372  

  397  01:09:08
  398: Oh that's great yeah anyone anyone of you guys you could just share some thoughts on geography where's all this happening. I mean with computing obviously the valley played a huge role in pushing things. Is this predominantly in the valley as well or are there other cities that are leading the charge?
  399  

b0314y.md:
   12  00:46
   13: I think this is actually put together buy a neurologist in Southern California and it addresses the the current problem that we have in the hospital sending of the unmet need of rapid expedited brainwave pattern detection. You know, if you look at the current mode of or the current model if you will the business model for getting electroencephalography in the hospital it is.
   14  

  121  26:20
  122: What's going on at the neural? Level. So it shines you wanted go ahead it's got if you want to. Alright, can I just clarify like are you asking what are the current cutting edge not invasive techniques to read out neural activity? Is that the question? Yes. Yes. Um, I could name a couple I'm sure other people could I I think so one thing that's using like sound or or something or is optical coherence tomography.
  123  26:52

  151  33:54
  152: So those are probably terms of at least what's available in clinical production from the therapeutic standpoint those are available. Only one day it looks like Carl left the group, but if he comes back he can let him know Micah that Magneto electrode cephalography probably is where he would be interested.
  153  34:14

  163  36:26
  164: Yeah, no good question. I see what you're asking. So basically with the magnetoon subflography, the the leads are are usually titanium. They're not as conductive as you know properly for example, but usually you get about the same quality of information. So it's not not even close to the kind of fidelity of EEG signal that you would get let's say from neural link.
  165  36:52

  171  38:11
  172: You were talking about mixing AEG and FMRI. How But but uh, what for my understanding Magneto electrons. Sethography is the it is like if that's the one where so with EEG it's better with to pick up signals from the sulcai I think and then with MEG it's better to pick at picking up signals from the gyri or admit it could be vice versa because once directly reading out the electric field and the other ones reading out the magnetic field, but I think, EEG makes it applies.
  173  38:49

  177  39:36
  178: So, We would not typically do any EEG at the same time as a functional MRI with the magnitude of encephalography really we are mapping out brain activity. And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.

  871  03:41:16
  872: Hi my name is Chris and thanks a lot. I am completely unqualified to comment on this discussion but I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it and I especially wanted to commend you Dexter on the rigorous typography of your profile, it's really it's really beautifully laid out so I gotta say just as a retired graphic designer it's probably much good that's fun thank you just me too for my former yeah, well I sometimes still do graphics design but, Yeah, thank you so much if you're a graphic designer of a certain kind of band right you look at a profound you're like, ah this bothers me type outfit it's not right and yeah that's something that sort of never leads you alone to come from art school time, so thanks for noticing oh well, I mean, you're you're credential I'm really just been satisfied to.
  873  03:42:15

b0318y.md:
  122  16:08
  123: Um so going back to what people said earlier it it's not really necessary if the if the electricity is a good strong enough poles for the sounds if the sound being converted into electricity is strong enough like for example in the in the case of electrical impedance demography, you don't need to amplify the electricity at all for to flow through neural tissue or through a tree it is it what might what would happen if the electricity signal is strong enough is that it will flow through, you know, different materials at different rates and and that's Sort of like how electrical pain is democracy works is you can work out that the images so you could um, use electrical impedance tomography specifically to to to measure.
  124  

  643  02:03:01
  644: To your point in physics, it turns out that you can actually look at the world in a different scale so if you look at it the human scale, you see the classical physics and then you can ask the question is there any meaningful questions that I can impose on this world to see if there's something else going on behind the scenes behind the, There is a theorem called homography.

  436: Because the, That would kind of go online towards a. I wouldn't say supporting the simulation but just adds more entry intriguing thoughts to that so I love that thank you is dependent on string theory being the fundamental kind of model. Of theoretical physics because holography as a mathematical model or a whole logger fee as a principal only really comes out if string theory is true or not, but a holography has been a way of us we stop.
  437  

  738  02:15:56
  739: So this is a subject of my research and I'm pretty cool that you brought it up. I have a paper that just came out called space-time paths as a whole and it shows that it's an internet journal quantum reports if you want to check it out it shows that as we've formulated it quantum mechanics and the path integral of quantum field theory actually has these properties of holography and I think it's important to sort of back away from the idea that you need a surface like the surface of a black hole like a physical surface or like some people imagine that the edge of the Most is like this two-dimensional screen that's projecting us as holographic people there's actually just this relationship and the relationship underlying holograms is actually much deeper which is a relationship between the frequencies or the frequency representation of things and in the physical world and you can represent everything in the physical world and in terms of its frequency representation and in that sense the source of that hologram is really just all around us.

  754: Power brain assimilates or assembles objects depths and color and the emotions of color. I'm currently working on a photography project. I'm an artist exploring blindness through photography processes, experimental photography processes and. What input data goes in through? You know, the photoreceptors can be flawed or marred or what you see.
  755  

  903  02:45:06
  904: I think I think the model is lacking there. So, I think that that, Is why it's useful to think about you know, I was talking earlier about this you take about photography and Adobe Photoshop. What's what's true about Adobe Photoshop images is that the information that. Composes them is distributed throughout the picture.

  79  What is a self-aware network?
  80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

   400:   5  In this talk there is a slide called "Cortical-Wide Neuronal Assemblies" he has a chart to show where brain activity has changed, and these changes were tracked with MEG Magnetic Encephalography, but interesting the chart looks like a sparse distributed representation SDR but also it might remind you of information theory, because the number of changes are small, rare, or sparse, which means they are more meaningful because of their sparsity or rareness, the same idea works with a single cell, and it's receptors, a small percentage of its receptors might meaningfully identify a pattern that the cell has learned.
   401    6: In a slide about Data Processing he talks about extracting the amplitude from cortical current dipoles (assuming as measured with MEG, MEG dipoles are different from EEG dipoles) so he is talking about high level variations in points measuring dipole activity with MEG and that is what makes up his chart that reminds me of a sparse distributed representation, at a high level of abstraction variations in Magnetic dipole activity represent some sort of brain state change or memory state change at highest level of abstraction representing massive neural assemblies that include major brain areas, cortical colums, major junctions, but the important part to keep in mind is that this is just one level of brain state representation in a multi-scale heirarchical brain state. So what happens at the single neuron level or at the cortical column level matters for storing memory patterns that are not in focus at the moment. By looking at the macroscale brain activity with EEG, MRI, MEG or with some other tool you can begin to guess at what is happening at the m

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2074     907: ⟪ 411 characters skipped ⟫ adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  2075:    908    83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

  4031:     32:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  4913:    16     40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
  4914:    17:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
  7071:    908    83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography.

And we're we're reporting magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout the brain and so you know, we're trying to do is is challenge a participant with a particular perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping to with the most activity electromagnetic activity.

  366    332:   1816: But most likely I think it's the current going in the brain that generates the inlet magnetic field so basically very clear that you you can back out from detecting the magnitude you get back out the current dense, so the distribution of the current location and strength of the current but yeah, I think in principle if you just detect the magnitude outside the brain and it will suffer the same short for the, Detecting the electric field outside the brain because basically you can have two distributions let's say the just two distribution two different distributions of electron but they they charge but generates the same electric field which is measured by the EEG so that's why you you have a the further away you detected the the lower the resolution would be and then the same thing happens with the magnetic field but, He did the degree to which degree of the the low resolution or the none uniqueness of the solution is different but I don't know that the the the specifics but in principle you you'll have this non-specification or non-uniqueness of the solutions for the the distribution of the charge and the distribution was current so so that's why I think but that's why.

  368    342:   217: Time. So how close were you able to get to measuring like single neuron spikes? And I asked that because I guess one of the major differences that people have been saying about neural links is that when you measure single neuron spikes you're talking about a new order of magnitude of resolution potentially for medical imaging.
  369    346:   307: So it's like is like orders of magnitude more neurons and you're able to place them precisely so that the Utah array was like I said like a flat sheet of like a hundred recording electrodes and you get whatever you get when you implant it where's the neural link is like precisely implanting three thousand individually so that's it and two clarified.

    8:   48: Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.
    9    52: I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.

   59    58: other neurons are able to track the phase changes happening to other neurons whether they are speeding up or slowing down, and long changes of these detects are mapped by many neurons or entire neural circuits simultaneously because exit terminals branch radially in every possible direction they can go.
   60:   60: If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

   91:   896: Well the way it would work is you would have a classical system feeding the quantum system, that's how it works now, so basically the classical system would index all the data, like a search engine indexing websites, and then in one swoop the quantum machine would construct all the indexed data into a topological map of linked patterns that map all the events with spatial topography enhanced for those things that are of greatest interest. It would be like combining a search program with a statistical relationship mapper.

  195    39: Current methods for space debris mapping are ground based, and use a combination of radar and 2d optical telescopes. The mapping is constrained by weather conditions, as well as lighting (cannot map during the day because of solar noise and at night because of lack of illumination). Short range mapping occurs with radar whereas the telescopes can only image at very long range due to the long integration times involved. Orbital mechanics principles and models are used to extract 3D data from from the 2D imagery, although these extrapolations suffer from from fidelity and precision issues. Atmospheric distortion further complicates the problem, with the result that earth based systems are unable to map objects less than 10 cm in diameter reliably and accurately. According to Digantara’s Chief Technical Officer, Tanveer Ahmed; “Digantara solves this problem by using LiDARs mounted on a constellation of CubeSats (small satellites, roughly shoebox size, with a 10 kg load carrying capacity). The use of active 3D imaging to obtain range information in addition to x-y location is a must - since passive imaging of fast moving objects at close ranges would require very large integration times, making the measurement useless. Additionally, LiDAR allows us to control the illumination period and wavelength, enabling significantly higher duty cycles of the mapping system. 3D Imaging in space allows for significantly higher signal-to noise (SNR) performance because of an absence of atmospheric losses and non-linear signal distortions”. The LiDAR is capable of imaging >1 cm size objects moving at speeds of up to 10 km/s at range of 100 km. Data compression occurs in the CubeSat prior to a RF based downlink to earth for further processing. A schematic of the Digantara system is shown in Figure 3.

You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

    55:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
    56:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
    57:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

    64:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
    65:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
    66:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.
    67    132: But I go a little bit beyond this paper by arguing that our evolutionary biology is far from something that develops with random mutations, rather it is computation, biological computation that is actual computation in the computer sense, that biological computation, inside one cell, and among many cells acting in coordination via oscillation is computing future structures for biology to evolve towards, such as the long beaks of birds that sip from flowers that require long beaks, the flower & the bird evolved together, like a computational symbiote.

   378    16: the transformed pattern, enlarged essentially retains an isomorphism to the original pattern, in that the cells that fire next at a higher level are representing components of a scaled up pattern, one that connects with other scaled up patterns which causes oscillators in the brain to integrate each others patterns, but also to scale down patterns, because 
   379:   20: The oscillator/oscillators essentially combines learned patterns with this neural tomography.
   380    24: So then oscillators are learning and recalling scaled up phase patterns, and these scales up phase patterns are the fabric of organisms internal representations, or its inner screens, because its what neurons everywhere in the brain are communicating, with pattern recognition at the synapse level scaled up to be observed as an effect on the global oscillator which is then observed by neurons the same way that the outside world is observed by neurons. The oscillators propogate an inner rendering to neurons deeper in the brain, but the signature of those oscillations may appear to be similar because they are scaled up patterns

   508    114: Essentially each of Hal's cartridge represents a different neural array. One array reading the previous and rendering something for the next array, and so one. Then if the system oscillates at the right rate the renderings become a picture the whole brain can sense.

   544     6: How do two neurons that are not connected form a connection after each of them has fired? It's not that they wire together, its that synchrononous firing, or firing within some window that might be a few milliseconds causes neurons to oscillate together, it's not that they are wired together, its that the synaptic tree that connects them aligns itself so that they will fire together when they both detect a pattern that they have learned together, but this also allows an entire set of neurons to possibly be the one neuron to fire in response to a pattern that many have learned, it makes patterns invariant to any single synapse or any single neuron and any neural circuit inside a cortical column oscillator because the oscillator as oscillator as collective has learned to represent the pattern invariant to its original firing location, the pattern can be transmitted across the brain, to entrain other similar patterns, but also to vote with, correct, and fix the representations collected by other neural circuits but also add to them, like the display I described the oscillator as being had many layers, like photoshop layers, but these are layers of interlinked renderings, at different scales, representing different sections of the screen at different times depending on head position & orientation & incoming sensory data.

   579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

   587      8: Further, these non-linear sequences of action potentials will be tracked, via their inhibited oscillatory waves, by whole oscillating cell assemblies, such as cortical columns, the hippocampus, or any oscillating neural circuit of any scale such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
   588:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
   589     21: "We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage."

   597     82: To go into more depth on how the physics of oscillations might manipulate information states, consider that information is not just a change in a phase pattern, but it's also a change in the synaptic pattern, and the phase patterns are not just electric, magnetic, chemical, there are also anything receptors are receptive to, such as mechanical vibrations, but the understanding the potential interactions of these phase based brain state transformations via the physics of oscillations will require some mathematical physics modeling.
   598:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography).

So I think the author is closing in on some good ideas, but it's also missing an explanation of the observer effect which is what my terminology "Neural Array-Projection Tomography" helps points to, with Neural Array-Projection Tomography, the neural phase projection, which aggregates into brainwave patterns that project at the cell assembly / cortical column scale, from one neural array to the next is projected by one array and seen by the next, and that subsequent array repeats the process, a brainwave consisting of temporally & spatially distributed phase changes cascades through Neural Arrays resulting in computationally rendered perception, and also pattern learning, or pattern representation, pattern activation, memory-prediction rendering & observation.
   600    108: I argue that the electric field and the magnetic fields in the brain are EACH relevant as attractor points in the brainwave oscillations (of tempo-spatially distributed phase changes), and these brainwave fields serve as attractors that drive oscillatory activities such as coupling, decoupling, synchronization, desynchronization, tuning, detuning, phase precession, and oscillatory phase coherence/decoherence (and my argument is that the phase differences are information states, like short term expectations, or attractors (that serve as information configurations) for short term memory oscillations)

   726     6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
   727:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.
   728    12: Their (the post-synaptic group of one exit terminal) group shared a common temporal oscillation (the LTD neurotransmitter event) so they fire together, and the next row then fires together, the whole oscillator simulaneously learns many versions of the same pattern everywhere, stored in the synapses, but magnified in the vertically oscillating cortical column, and magnified horizontally across the brains interneurons between pyramid cells, plus the other highly connective brain areas. Including the corpus callosum, the parietal temporal junction, the thalamic bridges and this high level horizontal pattern might be coordinated with help from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which may also have an oscillator that is magnifying learned firing sequences. I am preferential to the idea, written about in "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins" that the cortical column is actually functionally mimicking the grid cell and place cell everywhere in the brain. That's interesting especially if this idea of consciousness being a rendering or an image that has to exist somewhere now has to include some idea of how the results of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop connects to the thalamus in way that might bridge information with the neocortex otherwise

   847     5: In the human brain the 'cognitive' Tensors are phase variations between synapses. Entification or unification of these vectors/tensors (in otherwords a neural network object segmentation + neural network classification = a 3D semantic segmentation process in the human brain) happens via Oscillation of Phase Variations created by signals between cells in the brain creates the 3D canvas of reality.
   848:   15: What I am saying is that the math of the brain, like the math in a computer becomes a conscious object-segmented self-aware rendering via Neural Oscillatory Tomography. The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.
   849    17: But at a higher level, the oscillations of many neuronal outputs, like the outputs of many parallel instructions in a GPU, can be united, or entified, into graphical objects, that can have bodies of causation & a reality that exists in a simulated 3D environment.
   850:   19: # Tomodeck (Imagine a Holodeck, but replace Holography with Tomography, Neural Oscillatory Tomography)
   851    43: My conjecture is that the tonic oscillation brainwave pattern, embodied for example by Theta Waves (or other power band frequences) represents the short term memory structure that binds with incoming sensory inputs via the principles of oscillatory physics (that could be simulated in a game engine or with webxr)

   904    42: This is also key to the idea of why I think Quantum Teleportation works, in that I think a larger oscillation is carrying a signal between two smaller oscillations that are not directly connected.
   905:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
   906:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
   907    71: This new idea I have is about action potential path tracing (actually a better name for this is excitatory neuropathways from incoming senses), each phase interval represents a vector that is being modified like a taylor series polynomial function developing a non-linear pattern in a dynamic linear sequence. So that the waves of inhibition that follow the action potential sequence cause a next level of adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
   908:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

The entire oscillating group learns it together, and grows toward the learned pattern together. So the 4D vector field is being activated with a sequence of neurons firing, and the sequence implies a multi-scale vector that the brain can detect, and transmit across scales, from your big thoughts to your little memories. Yet the things that your brain has learned, as an oscillating cell assembling level, allow for knowledge to be virtual in your brain, for any part of your brain to be able to play back a known pattern, and any other part of your brain being able to play in a repeating oscillation over time (provided you have first learned the pattern). The whole reason your reality has some consistency from day to day is that the bigger more powerful oscillators in the brain are not likely to be easily overthrown by incoming data.

  2233    78: Then pair the notion of all your internal representations having space-time dimensional characteristics with the notion that your brain is like a super 3D graph neural / glial network with oscillating phase patterns being communicated between cell networks in your brain across the space & time of your brain.
  2234:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2419    72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  2420:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.
  2468:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2476     254:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.

  2478     276:   15: I am reading a book called Sync and he just spoke about how body temperature at the time someone goes to sleep determines whether they are going to sleep 15 hours, 8 hours, or 5 hours for example. This is a really interesting book about how oscillators work but he talks a lot about sleep, the circadium clock, and the synchronized timing of neurons firing, fireflies, and mathmodels with oscillator fluid dynamics.

One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures.

  2625     217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  2627     222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

  2660     509:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

  2770:     24:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2772:     28:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  2793:     92:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment.

  2800:    113:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2807:    136:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

  2830:    355:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2837:    442:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
  2838:    451:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2867:    501:     65:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2869:    505:     76:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  2897:    550:    257:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  2904:    563:    309:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

  2927:    676:    776:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  2934:    737:   1016:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.
  2935:    742:   1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

(If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  2979:    829:   1282:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  3007:    865:   1342:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  3014:    876:   1361:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3087:   1078:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3093:   1084:    19:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.

  3095:   1088:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.

  3123:   1124:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

  3130:   1135:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)

So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3368:    13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  3375:    22:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
  3376:    23:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

  3388:    52:    16: Micah: What I imagine when I see the above visualization is that it represents the tonic oscillation across the cell assembly, like a regular scan that the brain is doing on itself to ascertain where phase changes have happened in it's distributed sensor/transmitter matrix, in alignment with Neural Oscillatory Tomography Theory.
  3389:    53:    69: It supports part of the argument of Neural Array-Projection Oscillatory Tomography.

  3393:    58:   123: the TMS-EEG recordings are an example of artificial stimulus recording that is creating an image map from the brains responses, but with neural oscillation tomography we know that we are looking to reconstruct the synaptic structure at each moment in time by inference
  3394: ⟪ 325 characters skipped ⟫ cells, but it is the coincidences of phases in time & space that are bound by sync oscillation, or unbound by splay states (opposite of sync), that create the connections, the Neural Oscillatory Tomography, that the mind perceives as phenomenological consciousness,
  3395:    61:   142: Multiple-source localization for neural oscillatory tomography
  3396:    62:   155: What's interesting about the above article is that is an example of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, in that representations, by different areas of the brain, become active in temporal sequences, and according to Buzsaki 2006 the oscillatings bind & coordinate these signals or phase changes across the space & time of the brain, or "across spacetime" to be less verbose about it.
  3397:    65:    17: One additional thing we can do is apply the concepts of Cellular Oscillating Tomography & Neural Oscillatory Tomography, so that the organism is not just making random mutations, but is intelligently computing it's structure based on learned reactions to the real environment. We can make robots that are actually alive in the sense of real computational biology so they can evolve responses to the real world.
  3398:    66:    58: The reason I can apply Burstlet theory to the "Information Theory" applied cognition in Neural Oscillatory Tomography because of that 'key' finding
  3399:    67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

  3404:    83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.
  3405:    84:    97: These Phase Tensors are variations contain the information content of the rendered mind, as it is projected from one neural array to be observed by the next (Neural Array-Projection Tomography, or Neural Oscillatory Tomography). The variations in signal frequencies & durations along the lines of information theory, with rare information (action potentials) being more meaningful than tonic brainwave oscillations.

Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields points us to an analogy of how our brains, with Neural Oscillatory Tomography or Neural-Array Projection Tomography can render the graphics of a tomato, and render the taste of a tomato in our brains.

  3411:   102:   10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

The neuron does not experience reality by itself, the neuron is like a low dimensional cpu by itself, it receives input, it processes it, and it produces an output.

  3416:   133:   53: I think I have argued somewhere in my notes, more than once, that the human brain's neural network is infact a signal processor among other things. Signal processing is a key component of Neural Oscillatory Tomography, you have to process the signals in order to build up associations or detect coincidences that lead to pattern representations that the network has learned, and pattern recollections that appear in your rendered mind when you are thinking about a memory, or considering the future (a rendered memory-prediction, that a sequence of neural arrays is processing & rendering for other neural arrays)
  3417:   134:   69: # Action Potential Path Tracing as Taylor Series Polynomials for Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
  3418:   135:   83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

Imagine the 4dimensional phase space as like a watercolor painting with layers of paint, or similarly an oil painting also with layers of paint, but imagine that this is a 3D painting that encode position, orientation & velocity of memories (represented by phase transitions), renders live action in pieces with different parts of the brain constructing different parts of your reality at different moments, from the layers sprouting from exit-terminal activities to create decoherence patterns in an oscillating group of neurons, the decoherence pattern of inhibitions & excitations is containing in its phase changes the representations of what we see, hear, taste, feel etc, ie our qualia are patterns in the phase changes of the brains electromagnetic phase field, and the dendrites inside arrays or grids of neural networks read these phase changes which are our predictions driving our muscle movements, our words, and o

Basically the coincidence detection of a neuron, and the recognition of features in an artificial neural network, across many layers, at many scales, is essentially isomorphic to the process of tomography, or the Fourier Projection Slice Theorum, where the intersections of 2D slices of an image can reconstruct the original 3D image via the intersections which formulate the coincidences between 2D images allowing the brain to render a 3D world from tiny phase (frequencies) in the ganglia neurons of our sensor arrays in our eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc....
  3429:   185:   223: is a process. It is one process in this machine, not the whole machine, but one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception, the process of memory-prediction, the process of criteria causation, the process of coincidence detection and neural array-projection oscillating tomography.

  3433:   236:   80: It's like reality is rendered in frequencies, in a phase field, in your brain, by oscillators that are also detectors, detecting the oscillating renderings of other oscillators in your brain. So the whole brain detects its own oscillations, and the oscillating patterns emerge from the neural array-projection tomography, constructing an internal qualia representation from the compilation of coincidence detections, and the inhibitory amplification of fast phase patterns emerging from spiked neurons.

  3438:   275:   80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

   906:    756    1035:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  1226    2419:   72: Whereas the phasic neuron is going to be sending less neuro transmitters per synapse, so its effect will be lighter, it will trigger a smaller number of downstream neurons, but the signal will be faster, and so whatever receiving neurons are getting enough of the sparse but faster updates might fire, and it results in a more informative pattern, that is a chain more distinct phase changes that the slower oscillating neurons collectively track, just incase they might need to fire to dissipate their building charge.
  1227:   2420    80: Like a graph neural network a self aware network is rendering screens to itself, it scales up patterns encoded with synapses to be printed by the brains oscillators to be magnified and read by even more neurons, it does neuronal tomography on the incoming data to establish patterns between coincidences across temporal, spatial, scale, phase differentials in the brains oscillatory phase space.

   14:    22: This just blew my mind, this connects my research in 3 areas, vesicle function, cellular oscillating tomography, and neurodegenerative diseases in an unexpected way! Mind blown!
   15:    38: Cellular Oscillating Tomography is also about the study of how information, built from synaptic coincident detection unlocks cell functions via Transcriptomic activations
   16:    40: "Learning Outside the Brain: Integrating Cognitive Science and Systems Biology" cited above appears to be very similar in concept to the concept of "Cellular Oscillating Tomography" 
   17:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

   21:    90: # Recap: Cellular Oscillation Tomography, or Cell Tomography for short.
   22:   106: Cellular Oscillation Tomography means every cell can encode memory (LTP) in the information configuration of its receptors, recognize patterns via Hebbian learning, and execute functions computed by evolution, saved in protein configurations. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0011z.md
   23:   109: in addition to natural selection via random mutation, we can consider Cellular Oscillating Tomography, or Cell Tomography, as another pathway for the cell to calculate future changes to its structure.
   24:   111: cell tomography or cell computation via neuropeptide/receptor signalling might be the key component of evolution, rather than evolution by natural selection we could be looking st evolution by receptor/transmitter computation, since receptors represent a very basic (Hebbian) learning memory system.
   25:   113: Why is this a new theory of evolution? With natural selection random mutations can be stored in dna. With Cell Tomography receptors & neuropeptides can compute future changes to cell structure.
   26:   125: Note: Cellular Oscillating Tomography includes T-Cell & Glial interfacing with Neurons via Neural Oscillatory Tomography, the big difference is that Neural Oscillatory Tomography is specialized & optimized involving reinforcement learning via the stimulation of mitochondria via the electromagnetic wave emitted from the somatic burst or action potential. (If you search my notes you can read about Neural Oscillatory Tomography in more detail.)
   27:   128: Proteins are among the signals sent between cells, and in the Cellular Oscillatory Tomography theory I argued that regular cells function like neural networks, in part because receptors have thresholds, receptor growth changes those thresholds, and cells have states that trigger different learned genetic behaviors or information configurations that represent 3D biological structures that have a learned programming.

   87:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

This gives the chance for multiple lines of pattern replication to converge in a power band type of configuration, which, you know automatically takes the near the high instances of the same pattern, repeating as a greater likelihood that, that a pattern is a real pattern.

There's other ways to do neurofeedback with, you know, by capturing some representation of of, your of your brain activity, with with EG for example, or or function, or f nearest functional interference spectroscopy. There's, you know, I, I am dreaming of a day, when which we can, you know, sort of use electrical impedance tomography to create like a live 3D model of the, the molecular structure of your of, your of your head and in 3D that, that you can look at and watching real time as it as your as changes happen.
  219:   61: What electrical impedance tomography has done in combination with artificial intelligence to render your to render some representation of your of, your of your brain. I think that could be really fascinating and that's one of the, it's one of the brain computer interfaces that I want to build. Okay, let's go back to quantum physics, right?

  225:   15: That's not the only method, but there's also tomography. There's also, you know, if you look at the four year, slice transform, that's another tomographic like pattern recognition, machine, where you can take or bits of a pattern and then combine them together, you know, pretty good example. You know that like how to relate one set of data to another two?
  226:   23: So it's called overfeeding. So, this thing. So there's one thing about, you know, pointing at plus plus this because the data is the data being fed into the machine, it's possible that because it's more robust, because it's, it's 3d because there's like multiple angles that you could see with tomography.
  227:   61: So you could convert a peak that's in one data set to a peak another data set as long as both peaks happen at the same time. But then itself is kind of like the four years life is transforming that you can make a connection between one objects. And when once one slice of an object in another size of an object, and another size and object, because of where those slices intersect incoming sensory tomography, it's like with electric companies demography.

  244:   304: Impedance tomography to to get massively better results in massively massive improvements in in the image resolution with with deep learning combined with EIT, so another thing is I'm I just saw paper for laser Doppler holographic and of course, you know, everyone knows that merely Jefferson is working in laser holographic the laser part of that means that these that the camera sensor is going to be is enabled will enable the detection of single neurons at the firing speed of.
  245:   494: Active virus on you on your finger by blasting the virus with an electromagnetic wave and then that that interface is with the with the RNA and sends that and because his sensors his elect has his electrodes are arranged in a in an array it does he's doing something like tomography where he's figuring out the sort of the the letter arrangement of the RNA and so because he's able to cat.

  248:   1097: I that's that you know that reminds me a little bit of like electrical pedants tomography just a little bit because the electricity will flow through different materials or different speeds and if you take a lot of captures you can you can basically apply to grid and notice where the coincidences in slowdowns between electrical impulses happen and then from that you can you can apply it an image so it sounds like it's like a kind of democracy resonate in the 450 gigahertz frequency range and up and but you do have.
  249: ⟪ 257 characters skipped ⟫, when you are talking about collecting data with an array and then and using that right to figure out what's what I mean that, You know like I compared to EIT in terms of like it is kind of like tomography maybe I mean without it without knowing your secret sauce, it's it sounds like it's kind of like tomography and I would just say like that is it's like so we have tomography type of technology that is is related to you know, the the there's there's the four it was basically the projection theorem for your transform projection theorem then there's like, you know photogrammetry, you know, if you're gonna do if you're gonna like turn a 3d image and to a Biology and into into 2d slices that's the projection for etherium but then if you're gonna turn 2d slices from it from a camera into a 3d model that's photogrammetry and then and then we have like so now we have volumetric video and we have you know, we're doing we're doing semantics segmentation we're figuring out all the different like points that belong to the the different.
  250:   1623: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫ then but then we're gonna sort of like but then that but then like the technique of of like of of holography has to involve taking scans from many different locations, so again, we're coming back to tomography.
  251:   1626: And even like when you talk about like, you know what they do with MRI with the fusion tensor imaging and that that that's also like there's an analog back to tomography it's just like because you need to capture the the the brain for multiple different angles and and so those are so obviously diffusion tension imaging is a little bit old is older but but but yeah, but it's like it's the same principle yeah the same principle of basically like the four-year transport that projection slice for your transform.

Highly Spatial EEG from Switzerland and Germany: “Now, scientists at the University of Geneva Switzerland in collaboration with Cologne University (Germany) have investigated whether a non-invasive method — electroencephalography (EEG) — could be employed in tandem with mathematical algorithms to measure this brain activity externally.
   47  

   85  Excerpt:
   86: “Hemo-EncephalographyIn 1999, the late Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh were awarded the US patent on HEG. HEG uses light to observe blood in the brain through the skull.In 2009, Hershel Toomim and I had the opportunity to discuss the wave. Had he seen it using HEG? His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.
   87: “Hemo-EncephalographyBut could it be a matter of filtering, i.e. very low frequency signals were being excluded? (The way we were able to see the wave plethysmographically was by eliminating the low frequency filtering of the state-of-the-art heart rate variability instrument.)Hershel and I agreed to consider it..He passed away in 2011 at age 95.
   88  “This year I learned that Jonathan Toomim, Hershel’s grandson had continued his HEG research.I connected with Jonathan via Skype, and learned that he had developed a research instrument without filtering.”

   83: Let's say, let's take the topic of track target, which is usually assertion with MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to traditional courses of track photography. Is that you, you do, basically it MRI scan for multiple angles, at least three different angles and then you, then you combine the different. You like you have an X capture and why X capture and as you capture and you combine the different angles, the computer figures out the geometry of all the it's receiving the image capture from from different angles and is creating an image and three dimensions.
   84  14:59
   85: That's a great. If you want to control your computer, while sitting inside this giant MRI machine in the hospital, this is get around. So let them know. Secret is well, is that track? Tography is not is is sport, is tensor, calculus it doesn't, it's not limited to the domain of joining magnetic machine or MRI.
   86  15:20

   88  15:48
   89: Even with, you know, the limits of what you can do with MRI though are not really recently. MRI, you know, you're getting like the boxel size could contain, you know, like a thousand miles for example, or many more than that. And that's not the definition. We're going to need for neuroase, but if you're taking 3,000 images from multiple angles, right, and you're doing photography with them, massive, not images.
   90  16:13
   91: And then you're thinking about something to reality, which is called. People have made a try. There's, it's called photography where you can. There's an app on the vibe called realities, that I know where you can walk inside a virtual room that looks, it's photorealistic and you'll lean around. When I was a CS 2017.

  100  18:27
  101: So, the next step, then of course, is to take the basic the core of that video. Grammation process, which is photography and appliance medical imaging like a massive that language camera was amazing. It's massive and it's super expensive and it creates like, you know, that's light field is amazing but it's it's also a firehouse data so high.
  102  18:54

  110  20:21
  111: So instead of like focusing on the outside world, we turn this around and focus it on the inside of the world with. So we take three thousand, you know, images of the brain with track topography from different, and we're combining it with not photography video grammatry, right? And we're just a massive, you know, computational problem, but we we do that and now we can track like, you know, basically like, you know, everything going through, a specific region brain or in at some point, we're gonna be able to do the entire brain within about.
  112  20:57

  114  21:14
  115: So for research purposes that it has halfway there then we need to transmit the stuff back into the brain. That's that's the other half of it. What I'm saying with what I'm saying is that but there's all these so we have so when I'm working on is is new science for combining new forms of track photography, with foot, with technologies, like video grammatry to, to do the to figure out.

   34: I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T..
