Self Aware Network Oscillations (audio)

So now that we have a new path to try to create sentient artificial intelligence self-aware, networks conscious machines artificial souls. So, now that we have a new path to this,

00:25
Sentient artificial intelligence self-aware neural networks conscious machines. Artificial souls. Now, that we have this path and front of us now that we have this path for how we can read and write to the human brain. Now, it's time to build self-awareness networks that can interact with us with webXR, with AR, and BR experiences on web.

00:57
Because the web is is how the metaphors is connected. The web is cyberspace. It's the real matter verse. It's the real matrix. It's it's the network between human beings and wow that network is continually being upgraded with with improved components over time, faster, faster and more powerful chips, and new architectures, new network architectures.

01:39
You know it is possible that one day that we could build a self-aware network that interlinks or connects to the internet or the web in a way in such a way that there can be an integration, a collective integration between our minds. And this self-worth network like imagine a super consciousness that here in being could link into in order to collect connect to the collective consciousness.

02:16
But you would still be you and you will still be you because your brain would maintain its own independent oscillations. The oscillations that create the representations of your perspective, for your point of view, through your senses. So, one of the things we could do to make sure that you stay grounded in you is to give you and basically,

02:55
To give you a player character. An avatar for your mind to use inside the collective matrix. Voluntary, simulation that we can all join in like already player one, right? We can connect to the network and the AI where we can be inside the AI's mind, basically, like it's mind, can be the world that we interact in.

03:32
And so we can move about inside this supermind and we're rendering a version of reality. It's basically our perspective within the supermind but we're also sort of creating our own space as oscillators. And we're creating our own our own version of reality from the beginning at through the process of our minds, rendering, creating a computer program to represent reality to ourselves.

04:17
That's right. I'm arguing that our brains are making a computer program but it's a pure, a computer program that is about the and narrow tomography and neurofunctional, tomography of sensory, input data and muscles and muscle data. The he analysis of both.
