(hebb, oscillat, array, synap) from action potential to a new theory of gravity

working with EEG, and talking to Neuroscientist Morgan Hough for a year when I was hosting NeurotechSF event I had learned notion ingrained in me that there was a 1/f relationahip between amplitude and frequency in brainwaves

I learned in a neural lace podcast about light imaging with Kyle Matheson that neurons expand when they fire

when reading buszaki I thought more deeply about the 1/f relationship between amplitude and frequency, and the fact that neurons expand when they fire

how high frequency has low amplitude and low frequency has high anolitude

in Buszaki it became clear that this meant high amplitude affects more neurons and low amplitude reaches less 

from reading Buzsaki I dialed into the fact that frequency is the inverse of time.

I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically

then I thought about a news article I published on Silicon Valley Global News in which I mapped out the connection between potassium changes and action potential firing and mvr

then I talked woth F Scott on clubhouse and he helped me improve the theory, he speculated that additional neurotransmitters from mvr might reach more receptors on the other side of the synaptic cleft

There was a theory of SDR I had read about from Jeff Hawkins where neurons inhibited their neighbor

I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

I read the book Sync that all the neurons oscillate and I deduced that all the neurons  would feel every signal in some way, because they are all involved in dissipating that oscillating eneegy

like a single sensor, which goss back to Donald Hebb and his idea that neurons that fire together are acting like a single memory, but extended to be like they are a single sensor

so I had this idea from neuroscience that neurons were expanding on mass when they fired like an a action potential, which I also think of as like lightning, positive and negative charges between the sky and earth split so much fhere is a flash followed by a bang, light and sound, frequency and amplitude

the charges dissipate like a dissiaptive system like a vortx

but here on the table was
amplitude is inverse to frequency
time is inverse to frequency
mass is inverse to frequency
every mass at every scale (quantum gravity idea) has an inverted relationship to the spacetime around it

mass is 1:1 with spacetime increasing in scale
