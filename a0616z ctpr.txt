* bosons & fermions

* bad points & exceptional points
    * bad points: spacetime has no real area in summary, but rather area is relative to time
    * exceptional points: time dilation, and gravity, the surface area of a sphere like the earth represents and expansion of the number of possible directions that a particle can randomly travel towards, increasing the changes that it travels towards an exceptional point
* Thermodynamics
    * maximum entropy (convergent integration of information configuration (synaptic cohesion) in a harmonic resonance field)
        * the number of possible states range from a single oscillation, between existence and non-existence, between 0 and 1
    * maximum extropy divergent disspitative chaotic resonance
