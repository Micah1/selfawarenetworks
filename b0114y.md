Neurons Potassium Differences

00:00

You is literally different. Like and there's there's an electromagnetic reason for that actually. And it's that basically people are oscillators basically, they're were our reactions to one.

01:03

Another are literally oscillations, right? Literally we are oscillating in reaction to the information that we perceive and novel information has a greater impact, then let them less interesting information. So it so if 

01:37

02:45

03:58

04:32
Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 

 frequency spike and that sets, the pain that like the decay to the cave rate of that spike.
 
05:01

It's gonna set the pace of the, of all, the oscillators that it interacts with, like, because it's gonna, but it's basically it's gonna set the face because it's basically bumping up all of their they're voltages a little bit. And so that's going to result in basically, and increase chances of coincident firing, like, you'll have, like, like you have a whole row of neurons that go off, just because that one neuron went off just because they were close to firing.

05:42

And then you'll have another row of neurons that will

05:50

Like they they might now the next row might go off based upon what the first row did. So it's like a reaction row. Like the first one caused it. When it caused the next row to fire and the next row. Effected affected. Another row. Like it's like and so it's like is the neurons.

06:12

Go through these, the neural circuits in a cortical column would go through like sequences of of oscillatory firing. So like it's like a multi-stage, temporal spatial firing event and which you have which you have, but it's like so you have a row with individual neurons firing and then that when that rose done in another row you're going to have another arrangement of neurons that are going to fire because those are the ones that were close to threshold.

07:05

That also receives signals from the row beneath it. And, and so, the complexity of the patterns that are being generated, as you can imagine are quite intense, but it's like just imagine that you're, you're feeling up a computer screen, one pixel at a time. And then one line of the screen at a time, this is how it actually is done.

07:34

And then the second line and the third line, and then the fourth line and then when you get to the bottom, actually fill it all the lines. You start over the top again for the next frame of the image on your monitor. And it happens so fast that you it seems like like this smooth experience.

07:55

You don't notice the, the lines being created one at a time. And and that sort of like what I'm suggesting here is that we have we have a sort of like you have a sort of like monitor basically the

08:20

The neurons effectively function like LEDs at a monitor. Right? Why would you need a monitor? But it's just that like, you know, so so different kinds of patterns can be displayed there. So basically it's taking the input to be created that I'm sorry created there. So it doesn't it isn't necessarily that it doesn't mean that necessarily display there but the created there.

08:51

So we're taking this pattern. Okay, that consists of input and input and output for many different. Synapses the ones that were activated in the ones that were present the two features combined to sort of connect short-term memory with long-term memory.

09:19

And so, I mean, it turns out that the the this synapses are going to change the action potential because they're going to primarily because of the changes to the potassium channels. So when the potassium, if you have more potassium channels, open then the patented potassium moves faster out of the cell body and that could either inhibit the cell or it could repolarize yourself faster.

10:13

So effectively like the potassium helps, shut down the action until so the sodium opens up the action potential and I'm potassium sort of closes the action potential. And the idea is that the length of the action potential which can vary based upon the potassium channels changes the the multi vesicle release pattern so you have between zero.

10:40

You have four potential magnitudes of synaptic communication bits with micro vesical release you have you can either release. Zero vesicles, one vessel. Two vessels are three vessels. And that basically, for example might contain 2000 atoms of dopamine. Yeah. I mean 2000. Yeah. 2000 neurotransmitters that like don't remain or something and I mean if they add them so these are but don't mean.

11:14

This means that the quantity of dopamine or acetylchoine or GABA release can be ramped up or ramped down depending on the duration of the action potential.

# A new paper shows that dopamine levels influence when someone moves.
https://elifesciences.org/articles/62583
and
"whenever the movement occurred, the researchers found that it followed almost immediately after the rising level of dopamine in the fluid-filled space around neurons seemed to reach a certain threshold. When dopamine rose very quickly, the movement happened early in the response period; when dopamine rose slowly, the movement happened later."

11:24

Is going to. So, I mean, I, you know, it's going to travel across the synaptic cleft and the the electromagnetic and acoustic vibrations that are trout that are also traveling across the synaptic left might aid in in the, in the in pushing the the the the vesicle out. But also there's there's the, there's the

12:08

There's the action of the electrical potential, sort of pulling the, the pulling the, the vesicles across, I meant, I need to get more details and how that works. And the, the pressure. So, the pressure

12:39

The exit terminal, the fluids in the next terminal. I guess are increasing at that point. So when the best of goal when the vessel and the vesicle is going to land on, if it lands on a on a synapse, on the other side, that's going to add some some mechanical force and some mechanical force that leads to electrical stimulation and the the channel will allow sodium ions or out in or potassium ions out.

13:24

And I think that, so, I think that if you get like a really large action potential, you're going to that. I think that it's going to inhibit the next sound like as downstream self. I think it's gonna have it is downstream cells because it's gonna send out a like a number three, three micro vesicles all at once.

13:54

And that means that all that, that likely, that all of the potassium is opened up at once. All the testing channels are opened over once is basically going to inhibit the cell and that's scenario. And so, so like when you're on spikes really hard, it's gonna like a phase of spike, it's gonna open up all the potassium channels because is with the microgressive hole with a with the multi micro vessel release.

14:28

So basically like launching it's three, besticles maybe six thousand dopamine neurons. And so now, like all the neurons are like that. It's connected to are essentially storing a magnified representation of that firing event, so they've been magnified a signal and if you imagine that there's a group of neurons is inherited.

14:59

But let's say that that the that you know, neurons intersect was a couple in each layer that fire and then in the next there's a couple of each other image layer that part because it's like I'm going with this bar distributor representation theory, you know presented by that it was presented so well by Jeff Hawkings and the folks at momentum and many papers and two books and so I subscribed to this project distributed representation idea that has what the brand is doing and it appears to be correct.

15:24

And but you have yes, you have a couple and you have some neurons like a small number of neurons are gonna fire and one layer. And then at some point, a small number of neurons in another layer are gonna fire because they were close to threshold. And that the firing at the in the previous day, we're just enough to push those over the threshold.

15:44

They're threshold. And then that might then cause some other group of neurons somewhere to start hiring and but imagine that each stage you see, these neurons are firing in. In terms of as they move up, the hierarchy of of the cortical column, the neurons are firing in sequences and some of the sequences, you might see like a diagonal line or you might, you might be able to draw lines between them, that, like, have this sort of zigzagging almost vector like graphical quality, right?

16:24

It was like it's playing front like the firing goes from like one point and that over two. Another point is not necessarily gonna go to the in the direction that that the might be expected. A signal, could even travel on the opposite direction.

16:47

So what exactly happens is is dependent is depending on the particulars of the physics of that situation and the mechanical realities of that particular space marriage. Interesting to think that the human mind carries the, the building blocks of a huge number of past memories that are the human ancestors learned.

17:18

And I what I mean by that, is that as as the over time human beings have grown increasingly greater. Okay, so I am presuming as this is true, but I would presume that over time. Human beings have evolved to have an increasingly diverse, and increasingly genetically, diverse arrangement of, of neurons.

17:56

And of, you know, with different like electro, acoustical properties. And and mechanical properties and different like, you know, you can see an example of this. I guess if you look and how human dendrites are much longer than mouse bend rights, right?

18:19

You get that, that example, I was like, well, there's a lot of different configuration possibilities that can be navigated with natural selection like maybe some humans like evolved some neurotransmitters that allowed them to

18:42

Be better at, you know some kind of tasks or maybe they're adapted to certain kinds of foods that are local through their region of the world where they where they're people were pretend thousand years or something. And you know so tiny like genetic differences in our in our synapses might sort of like but also in our in our proteins everywhere these the proteins that make up you know, cell bodies like these tiny differences are the differences that made it possible.

19:25

The building blocks of of some, some lesson that made it possible for our DNA are DNA ancestors, who survive to survive The mutation that led to their survival became sort of, like, embedded in our proteins in shapes Our protein shakes. And so we have over time, I think has developed increasing quantity of novel, new protein shapes and protein types.

20:01

And so I expect that the theres an incredible amount of diversity in terms of the mechanical accused of acoustical, properties of different nouns and different parts of the brain. I mean, an interesting thing that there was this article about the pyramids, the pyramid of Giza, having electromagnetic properties, that they're going to use to make batteries or something.

20:31

And they, they're saying that the electromagnetic waves bounce off of these. The surfaces of the tetrahedron of the pyramid and that focuses. The focus is some electromagnetic energy in the center of the pyramid because of the because if we're at the panels are arranged, like a satellite, right? Like I said and then you know satellite has this like sort of upside down dome as sort of and so like imagine yes like a dome.

21:03

Like imagine like a dome it has because of its reflection because of its reflecting shape, if a dome was designed to reflect them electromagnetism, you know, maybe some very some, some kind of material that you make a dome out of, right? And then, so what would it be? Like then to like deliberately try to concentrate electromagnetism with with a dome that reflected energy very well.

21:35

That's an interesting. It's an interesting thought. I don't know. But like imagine that. So like your brain at your skull has, it's kind of like a dumb, you know, like your eyeball, like imagine your your brain and your eye are our fractals of one. Another like you're I mean you're your school like your skull is it is kind of like a it's on it's almost it's it's almost a dome you know it's round it encompasses your goes around your brain and protects it from every direction.

22:14

It's it's it's kind of a ball with holes for your eyes and you're and then you know there's there's your jaw just holes, where your nose goes and

22:32

Anyway, so we have. So we have this, so we have this dome and our head, and it's weird to like well, so what, so if our brain on some level is producing an electromagnetic phase field and in, I think I can make the argument that space time and tell this technically a face field.

23:05

And I'm arguing that basically is the best field. Is that particles are phases, particles are frequencies and they're frequencies between distances.

23:24

Yeah, and they and they're the frequencies between distances.

23:33

And that. And, and that is why they either had their, they either have a momentum or they have a position.

23:46

But sort of like not at the same time through the internity, sort of like another viewpoint on the insert. Any principle is that they are also is that that is space oscillating between being somewhere and going somewhere and it can't it can't land on either one that long has to keep oscillating back and forth.

24:14

And, but Anyway.
