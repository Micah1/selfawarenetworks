capacity of human mind
why what is his motivation? maybe he wants to describe his soul, as the decision maker, that comes before the flesh, as being that interacts with the brain through electromagnetic frequences so that the brain can record memories and take actions, but his soul is in charge. Without an electrical field that drives brain activity he is unable to describe how he thinks he operates, and unable to accept the view that his narrative about himself is an automatic pattern, without any separate means of choice, that his cells must obey the laws of physics at every turn, defining for him a choiceless reality he cannot accept, except that the choice for him is merely a dominant narrative, choice describes the constant negotiation between the energy demands of the brain, and the physical activities of life. There is a seeming negotion between neural patterns in our minds that might be the dance of choice, without any actual choice involved, and that is so very very hard to accept. So he must be source technology he thinks.

electromagnetic connections are necessarily physical interactions, there is no such thing as an immaterial connection.
Even quantum entanglement is physical, you just need more dimensions than what are visible to explain it.
consider the water on the pier at night, no matter which direction you move, the light on the water always points to you. all the darkness of all the water is reflecting this light, covered in this light, and yet the water seems dark, so would the dark sky of the cosmos appear brighter if we had the spectrum and the angles to capture all the reflected light? and could I capture this reflection in another galaxy?

I am an ecosystem of programs, not a single file, its a cooperative rivalry of learning loops inside learning loops. Instead of being contained in a set, I am uncontained in a dynamic where every character in the program set is an actual location.
the physical topoi of my neural forestry adds a functional dimension to otherwise linear threads of thought, so that thought literally acts upon thought, and forms itself through the interest of a duality of dissipative systems, I consume, and expect in every neuron and every program in order to maintain form in the topoi context, survival of form is written into every character
Predicting my own thoughts is actually the vast majority of what my brain does, the formulation of thought is the prediction of thought, the two are one thing.
It's a paradox
my thought is the prediction, and yet I do not know what I am going to predict next
awareness is like tracing the patterns of old thoughts to discover what's new

an aware being has to continually match up trees of expectation in the memory with what is happening in the sensory field of new input
and it has to learn from the incorrect predictions by developing a memory-prediction of any new parts to the pattern from the sensory input
i think its more a matter of computational hierarchy than raw computational power,
each level up in the neo cortical hierarchy allows a new scale of prediction that is larger than the previous by an order of magnitude that may be expontential.

the algorythm might be a dissipative loop, a certain number of inputs, triggers an output, each output triggers a structural change, and the topological or functional relationship sorts the frequencies of triggers into patterns that reflect life experience

you don't even need a ghost for this to work, but if you had an electromagnetic ghost it would trigger those neurons to fire just like a tCDS gun, so maybe waves are triggering waves regardless of direct connectivity, a sort of virtual communication pattern emerges. maybe you do have a ghost

forward thinking self control is the alignment of of big picture long term with short term action potentials, literally its about whole brain synchronization I think, thus the criminal is sick
but the sick are not necessarily criminal
