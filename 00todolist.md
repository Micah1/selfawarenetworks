00todolist

is like the abstract bump, but while the abstract bump is meant to be cleared regularly, the todo list is for lists of things I can't finish today, that I want to remember to do next time. This is not for storing links to external articles. That's the link review list. 00linkreviewlist

One of the things I want to do is to sort the contents of each note into semantic sections.

# 00todolist.sections
If you search the repo for a0018z.twostreams you will find a section title that says a0018z.twostreams, and conveniently it's inside note a0018z.

This is convenient because I can refer to both a note and a section of a note at the same time. Also I can move content around inside a note and still keep it's section name, which is searchable.

I can keep the section name and move it to a different note, because the section name is now a world space coordinate at the system level (macro scale) At that point the number part of the name just represents it's lineage, parent, or origin. The todo list item therefore is to give each title a section name, a word that reflects the aggregate semantic meaning of the section differented by the parent note, similar to the a0018z.twostreams example.

b0071y "(I think I can describe the sensory input path better than this)" This is a bigger project, a major focus for my book, to map the sensory paths from each sensory input, right now I have a partial model, I want to get a lot more detail in my mental map of the flow of information in the brain.

I want to get an improved transcription of each neural lace podcast, see if the audio from the one with Shashkes can be improved by a sound lab.

work on breaking down all the content in a0213z, and adding all unsorted links (across the entire repo) to the new 00linkreviewlist

work on developing new sections for 
a0053.metatron
a0001z.Milstein
a0288z.refined
a0288z.volume
a0288z.genesis
