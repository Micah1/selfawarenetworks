# 00todolist

Todo: sort the contents of each note into semantic sections.

Notenumber.SectionName

00todolist.sections

If you search the repo for a0018z.twostreams you will find a section title that says a0018z.twostreams, and conveniently it's inside note a0018z.

# Update Priorities
Move the newer notes to the github.

b0071y "(I think I can describe the sensory input path better than this)" This is a bigger project, a major focus for my book, to map the sensory paths from each sensory input, right now I have a partial model, I want to get a lot more detail in my mental map of the flow of information in the brain.

b0309y, (related to NAPOT Revision 3 on brainwaves)

a0213z, Breaking down content in a0213z.

work on developing new sections for 
a0053.metatron
a0001z.Milstein
a0288z.refined
a0288z.volume
a0288z.genesis

The goal is to write a succint contrast between Self Aware Networks theories and each of the major theories of consciousness out there, plus a contrast to each of the major books out there on Consciousness.

Move all unsorted links (across the entire repo) to the new 00linkreviewlist

These are the remaining notes that mention Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, Attention Schema Theory, Higher Order Thought Theory, & Recurrent Processing Theory.

Searches have not been done for notes with Predictive Processing/Predictive Coding, Sensorimotor Contingency Theory

"In neuroscience, predictive coding (also known as predictive processing) is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment. The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input."

Global Workspace Theory or Attention Schema or Integrated Information Theory

b0163y - another disagreement I made with IIT, consciousness is a multisensory rendering like a computer rendering, but for all sensory modalities not just visual, I speculate about a dogs language / vocalization area but research citations are needed to fix my musings.

# Update Book Structure on Note a0005z and clean out anything that doesn't belong, move stuff out of it that isn't related to book structure.
