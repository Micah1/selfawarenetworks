(LTD, oscillat) I want to expand on how an oscillator is like a photocopier?

because following a single neuron depolarization a larger set of neurons is inhibited all at once. So the neuron that fired magnified it's effect by inhibiting many nearby neurons (and exciting some neurons in the next set). Whether a neuron is fired or inhibited it's phase has changed relative to the normal oscillation, this causes a change that ripples through the entire brain as oscillations synchronize over time or sometimes they don't synchronize but they still affect other oscillations through signals.

The first neuron that fired, inhibited a bunch of neurons from firing creating a network inception representing the memory of the neuron that fired by it's learned connections (reflecting on neurons that were inhibited) then another set or array of neurons percieves this pattern in its receptive field, triggering some 2nd neuron to recognize a pattern and fire phasically, then another set inhibited by the phasic firing of this 2nd neuron,

and so that first set of inhibited neurons is to going to oscillator together, and the second set of neurons is going to oscillate together in a step right after the first set, and these groups of oscillations are now upsetting (feels like a pun) the oscillations of the rest of the brain in a step by step sequence similar to what I outlined in the two previous paragraphs, but at the scale of oscillating groups with new phase patterns pulling on other oscillating groups in the brain, continuing to magnify the activated memories, like the cascading ripples from a stone skipped across a pond, the entire brain & body transmits signals this way, in a wave rippling manner. 

The neuron firing results in an inhibition of nearby neurons, which binds those neurons together in an tonic oscillation,

the tonic oscillation difference probably dissipates with time and or distance, losing its energy without losing its shape, so active memories fade, but remain somewhat consistent as they fade

the dissipative process for forgetting in active memory is connected to LTD long term depression or long term forgetting, because the local binding of inhibited neurons is perhaps untangling the connections between those inhibited neurons from their previously learned connections.

So the memories that do not activate atrophy as cellular connections grow between activated memories, and atrophy (and or are removed by glial functions that were activated to change the configuration of receptors to use the material of the brain to grow connections between synchronously active cells)

The neurons that are inhibited are being put into an LTD process with neurons they are no longer oscillating in sync with (because the inhibition changes their firing rate)

When neurons are inhibited together they oscillate together, but they also begin de-synchronization with neurons they were previously oscillating with that were not inhibited at the same time. 

how is LTD a mechanism for oscillation? The decay or removal of synaptic connections what memories that neuron is most sensitive to, and thus affect its firing potential relative to it's local neighbor of nearby connected neurons, affecting its timing and the timing of its oscillating group.

Buszaki said something to the effect that the decay rate of the action potental became the gamma oscillation for a group of neurons. (need to find a quote)
