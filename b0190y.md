Artificial Neurology Eyeballs Bridge Brain

00:00

So I would position the neural ed position, the neural length to be on the anatomic bridge, connecting the left and right, hemispheres together, the thing that's cut and split brain patients. Let me just look at it. It's that you're you're four dimensional reality is not just being created and recognized by bits of the brain in the distributed way.

00:26

There's also converging into into a pipeline that is transmitted down a neural circuit and read by that neurosurgeon read out by the neural circus of neurons. Can predict when they're going to fire in that sequence. But because they're listening, they're also learning and so that, yeah, that's my argument is that you can take all these complex hurts frequencies at low scales and large scales and super large super large scales and you could combine them together.

01:05

Sort of like a reverse for your transform and so you can get this really nice. Beautiful. 40 dimensional image is basically being piped all over. So, like many areas of the brain are participating in this collectively, sourced image, it's being passed around. It's like everything was realized and then compressed.

01:37

For consumption. So I had to send out about a game in which I basically give someone several pictures and shows like an alien, no alien creature, that's like walking around the ceiling, but it's getting closer and closer to you and like, like in a frame right before it gets to you like it's about to pounds and you see like there's there's a highlighted gun on the side, right?

02:05

And you can select that. And if you select, if you select for the next slide and an exciting news is is killing you but if you select the gun and it changes to a whole different set of slides and now you're now you've shot the alien and and you're running to get away from it.

02:27

And it's and as a whole new it's like a whole new storyline. So, it's like a sort of, like, and adventure storyline where I like, there's, there's like each episode sort of ends in a sort of doom, but you can escape it to continue the story onward. So I thought I could have like a chapter which is like like when I'm describing a dream or something and so, it could be, I could talk about, I have this alien that starts.

03:00

That the story about the alien starts to program, human proteins to be into things that have into machine parts. So it reprograms people's bodies into machine parts and into it. Like, it creates new biology architecture as well. So create new sorts of life forms. They're like, hybrids between machines and life forms, you know, like like putting a helicopter onto like a sort of like magnetic helicopter.

03:34

Like onto into an organic creature that like thinks. So like has a brain and has a helicopter, so can fly around right and do stuff and then like, it can like, shoot out eyeballs and I can like, can be covered in eyeballs and eyeballs. Can, in fact, other life forms and like attached to your hand and and start converting gear biology into more eyeballs, or too, whatever it wants because it can basically, like reprogram your tissue into its hardware, and as it creates its own parts.

04:11

It's like it's like in reading your, your body. It's like, all it does is once it attaches replicating like a virus but then, it starts also taking over. It starts overtaking taking over cells and like, taking over your entire body and regular and regulating all your signals. So it controls all your signals.

04:28

So it stops the emergency, your brain stops, fighting your body, stops fighting it. Your body just goes along with it. And you start to thrive in part because of it, but also, like it causes you. You have to eat a lot more and you come very mocular like a lot more protein, but but it's, but it's because it's like, it knows how to program your body perfectly to just prefer the best fuels, and to just perform like machine.

04:59

That can control biology like a deity, right? You can just make anything out of anything and so this likes so like that spreads and chases people and it flies, atop the skyscrapers in a top, all the buildings and it flies down and attaches to people's arms and legs and and there's resistance fighters, but it always manages to overcome the people in the and the bases, it just like it's like this great goo.

05:30

That's like, spreading all over the world. It's organic artificial life.

05:40

And yeah, so then it basically, it takes over the world, in terms, all the flesh, all the animals, on the planet into its own computer hardware, and then it basically it merges with life. So life becomes like this one super system, this one large super system. One. Life form.

05:59

Super intelligent. And then at that point it's like well actually then all of the hideous stuff could vanish again. Like everything could become like, just very beautiful again, you know, there could be animals and people again parks could be very paradise. Like, like they could be anything. It's like a it's like a dream that any kind of reality could be rendered to the collective mind.

06:30

And this comes about, because of How to get it. Yeah, this comes by because of the importance of the narrative being having a sense of reality to it.

06:51

Yeah, so going back to the thalamic bridge. So, like bridges could be the portals of the minds. I basically, they represent the past of conscious experience between regions brain regions like diffusing, refusing of different cortical areas happens via ethnic bridges and between court areas and yeah, I wonder how the corpus callosum really installed this.

07:30

I didn't look that up. So now they're scientists are shooting themselves in the foot, by not setting. The whole dendrite to MVR function, by seeing the whole dendrite area of function, of the single function from input output, that by itself is a unit of cognition, that MVR function. That's in neural network.

07:46

That's many different possible. Inputs patterns sorted patterns, recognize patterns transmitted and the signal being transmitted varying by by an amount unknown, to most of the field of neuroscience, and most artificial intelligence, and that's not getting enough attention, and research, like the whole, it's great to look at how identified is like a no network, but you're missing the whole totality of the meaning of the dendritic function, if you're not, considering it, in the context of microbesical release.

08:24

So, we will know if machines are sentient, like us because we will build a cell iMac bridge between an artificial mind and human mind. And I'm going to depict this in artwork, like an artificial mind, and a human mind and having them too connected by ethylamic bridge. And this would be like in the closing of the book and this is like about how real soon you know networks artificial neurology and nerve care will come together.
