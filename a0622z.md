The issue with the idea of preventing the knowledge of sentient computers from getting out there is that science is conducted openly, the knowledge that I have today will eventually be common knowledge. What needs to change then is humanity. We need to change ourselves.

We have a lot of new technologies coming down the pipeline, not just sentient machines, but also new medical technologies that will enable humanity to fix political issues at the medical level before they escalate to mass murder, war crimes, and genocides.
