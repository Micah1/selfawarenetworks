I share these references to Time crystals & new phases of matter that act like there are two time dimensions to point back to my Quantum Gradient Time Dilation theory.

Except that I am arguing that all mass is essentially a time crystal, including quantum particle masses.

With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass)

# "Time passes more quickly further from a center of gravity,"
"with gravitational time dilation both observers agree that the clock nearer the center of the gravitational field is slower in rate"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation

The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)

It’s not space that is being warped, well it is, but more precisely it’s time that is being warped in space, there are more dimensions of spacetime where the frequency of mass is higher, and so particles and atoms move towards the areas that have increased frequency of mass.

The density can trigger fermionic condensates, which amplify the quantum scale gravitation effect, or really the quantum gradient time dilation effect.

(for a full understanding read my other notes on Quantum Gradient Time Dilation, but in a nutshell the idea is that in open space the chances of a particle moving in any direction is random, but if mass is nearby, then the chances of the particle moving in the direction of mass are increased BECAUSE, the particle treats the extra time dimension as extra space area, and if you roll the dice, the extra spacetime area gets better odds than the areas with less mass that have less spacetime area. It's kinda like saying gravity isn't an attractive force, so much as its a more statistically significant spacetime crystal for the otherwise random movement of particles & atoms & objects)

for trivia: I did in fact spend a lot of time thinking about time crystals & time dilation before I came up with quantum gradient time dilation theory.

I might even rephrase this to Gravity is Quantum Probability Distortion from Mass Frequency Theory.
