# “Time crystals were first proposed theoretically by Frank Wilczek in 2012 as a time-based analogue to common crystals — whereas the atoms in crystals are arranged periodically in space, the atoms in a time crystal are arranged periodically in both space and time.”

I share these references to Time crystals & new phases of matter that act like there are two time dimensions to point back to my Quantum Gradient Time Dilation theory.

Except that I am arguing that all mass is essentially a time crystal, including quantum particle masses.

With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass)

# "Time passes more quickly further from a center of gravity,"
"with gravitational time dilation both observers agree that the clock nearer the center of the gravitational field is slower in rate"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation

The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)

It’s not space that is being warped, well it is, but more precisely it’s time that is being warped in space, there are more dimensions of spacetime where the frequency of mass is higher, and so particles and atoms move towards the areas that have increased frequency of mass.

The density can trigger fermionic condensates, which amplify the quantum scale gravitation effect, or really the quantum gradient time dilation effect.
