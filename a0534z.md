Great Science Fiction Stories about brain computer interfaces and artificial cognition.

Fiction about brain computer interfaces:
The Nexus Trilogy by Ramez Naam
Sword Art Online, a Japanese Anime
The Kiln People by David Brin
Neuromancer by William Gibson
The three stigmata of Palmer Eldrich by 
I am a strange loop by Douglas Hofstadter

There is a little known book series called the Nexus Trilogy by Ramez Naam. They inject nano machines that attach themselves to neurons to create a two way wireless transmission of thoughts, feelings, and memories to other people who also have nexus.

Artificial telepathy.

There is an Japanese Anime series called Sword Art Online that has spin off series, and a movie that revolves around a bci technology they call nervegear, people put it on like a VR headset while they are sleeping and their minds are transported into a VR game sort of similar to the Matrix movie concept.

By implication SAO's nerve gear is non-invasive, I can imagine that could be like Laser-doppler holography tech combined with ultrasound, or Laser fNIRS with Holography (Openwater.cc). 

While the Matrix Trilogy tech could be closer to Neuralink, in terms of brain surgery being required.

Also every bci enthusiast should know of this commercial for Playstation 9 that appeared in 1999 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IyPQVsdCuRk

Augma: Augmented Reality Nerve Gear

The Sword Art Online movie "Ordinal Scale" featured an update to nervegear called Augma https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online_The_Movie:_Ordinal_Scale

"Unlike its predecessors, the «NerveGear» and «AmuSphere», the Augma is capable of sending signals to the brain while the users are awake,[1] and is thus primarily used as an Augmented Reality"

"Sword Art Online's Nerve Gear was elaborated in Accel World as a precursor to the implants seen in Accel World." Accel World is another anime series that uses nervegear/augma to create augmented reality experiences through a brain computer interface.

One of the book series that helped inspire the science fiction movies series called The Matrix was the Sprawl Trilogy was including Neuromancer by William Gibson https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy 

Other books that were inspirations for the Matrix series included:
"Simulacra and Simulation" by Jean Baudrillard, "Out of Control" by Kevin Kelly, and "Introducting Evolutionary Psychology" by Dylan Evans.
