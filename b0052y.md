So the reason I ask people to read the book sells by John Leaf is is that the the book specifically outlines the fact that that it is specifically described the extraordinary things that sells to that scientists have sounded actually clarified it describes just some of the things that cells do that and and scientists don't really understand how cells can do these things in terms of how they can communicate.

00:45
For example, this when, when a white blood cell finds its way from his origin point to the side of a wound there is a there's a communication happening back and forth constantly between the that the neuron that sent that white blood cell that guides that white blood cell to its target and the in the white blood cell literally moves through the tissue with something that seems analogous to limbs.

01:23
Like it's like it's almost like walking through your tissue right? Stepping over thanks and it changes his body to that. So it's like you have one style that's coordinating with districts of another cell to send it to a wound that that's what it looks like. And I would say that the coordination is

02:01
Wow, because see that because see the point of the wound is going to be sending a lot of signals. It's a crisis point. And that's going to be triggering a lot of other cell activity because it's a, it's a, it's both a mechanical, and a chemical and a heat based oscillatory signal.

02:42
So it's that. So the woman itself is transmitting like a constant signal, right? And,

02:59
And then the cell that responds is also sort of like sending a constant signal that is

03:14
And it almost initiated by the wound. But then the wound I would say, okay I think maybe the wound and the cells responding to the wound are both firing in a way. That's that's helping to helping the white lights out to get to the origin point of the wound.

03:43
That's our net from the origin, point to the world and of where it was admitted. And that seems like that could work via the sort of like the same principle of the path. Integral theory and gravity, right? Where we're basically creating the

04:20
So interesting. Okay, but let's revisit this but the okay. Okay, so we're gonna finish that white blood cell 30 later. But the the point is that this got this cuts to the idea that maybe neurons can do more than what we think they can. And this, in this, this connects the deep learning because

04:51
The the the question is so if you see, if you look at the perceptron, right? So the preceptron is like, a simplified is the, perceptron is an artificial neuron. It's the mobster, it's the model of an artificial neuron. That was created to be simulated in computer in order to adapt some of the properties of a neural network and bring them into a computer.

05:20
They tried to just say, what's the most, what is the most functional way of looking at a neural network? What is it, what is the, the basic functionality of a neural network? And it was at the time that the perception was created. There was this idea that whatever inputs and neural network was whatever inputs the brain received to a neuron that it would be summarized in an output like like a one.

05:56
Or is there like either fired or didn't fire? And and so that sort of analogies like oversimplified. So I was like it's like a neuron is connected to a bunch of other neurons and either fires it doesn't fire and and somehow that that is going to, I'll wait it, it's gonna become a weight.

06:23
It's gonna come weighted by the fact that it fired.

06:30
The buying represents a lower level coincidence that they, that the neuron detected from its from a sensor array which could, which could be a lower could be the input data, or could be just the the layer of neurons beneath it and by hiring it's representative that coincidence that as a learned thing and then so once it's been trained, then you you pass it new data.

07:03
And the trained general network will will multiply that new data by the by the vector that represents. It's it's learned weight based upon learning patterns and

07:25
Anyway, so it's it's a long story, but it's longer story than that, but the, but the, but the idea is that we want to see if there is, there is, in fact, a greater level of detail that can be captured by a neuron, and then transmit it from a neuron in a real biological sense.

08:02
Because it is, and it is in one sense about the. So, there's just ideas that a dendrite could function as a neural network. You can look that up in a search engine and so some people have proposed that a dendrite could be similar to a two-layer neural network. I think there was someone mentioned to me that there was a, some sort of paper that I didn't write could be a five-layer similar to a five-layer.

08:34
Neural network, it gets really interesting where you consider the complexity of perimeter neurons. And they have the dendrites. There's like there's there's it's it's the body of a pyramid on their own is different from other neurons and that there's like there's just Soma area that's distinct from the dendrite area.

09:01
And then, the dendrite might have multiple

09:12
Sort of sub areas that can each fire. It's like, it's like the, it's like having multiple dendritic arbors and multiples. So somatic arbors connected to a single neuron, right? So like instead of a neuron having like one dendrite that leads directly to the soma. It's like, you can separate the soma and the dendrite into two different areas so that their charges could be adjusted independently.

09:49
And you can have and you could have independent, basically sort of areas where charge in a pyramidal neuron can collect and diffuse, which just really it just really complicates the The number of things that can cause a the number of ways. The number of pattern, the number, the number of ways that a pyramidal neuron could be connected and the number of ways to cause a pyramidal neuron to fire.

10:28
And then number of patterns, that a pyramidal neuron could fire or respond to and in a dynamic and in dynamic way. Because it's like, it's like, it's like, well, maybe an a paramil could detect multiple patterns, right? And then make a decision, whether or not to respond to those multiple patterns, by, by the, by the way, it set up.

11:08
And. And and so the pyramidal neuron is just really really fascinating from from a neuro architecture standpoint in terms of, you know what if we captured that? But one of the things that I want to sort of bring up are some of the some of the many ideas that I've sort of fallen into the wayside of how neurons could communicate.

11:41
And so I have some new ideas but I also have some ideas about how to integrate some old ideas together. And so that's that's a that's part of the the book. So so I need to talk about like the grant the the capabilities of neurons, the ways they can talk to each other, the kinds of things they can do.

12:06
Part of that is from drawn leaves book but part of that is from from sort of like considering what a an artificial known network can do but then expanding on that if you had the additional structure and features of the of the, what's going on and in a neural network, it's in any human neural network.

12:30
One of the things that is really interesting is that the explanation for what's happening in a, in a real or an artificial known network in terms of like I think it's not, I think it's it's it's it's not really clear to people what's happening. And so I have some new thoughts there in terms of have what's happening in and and so that's about looking at how one How one edge community is is is perceiving and then representing patterns to another edge community, which is then perceiving and representing patterns to another edge community.

13:34
And then you have basically that's at some point in the brain. You have cortical columns that are also receiving and learning virtual representations of information. And we can describe this as as as akin to holography. But but also the, this is the key to why the human brain is is has awareness and has and why it generates self-awareness.

14:16
And in part of that comes from, you know, connecting what your your muscles are doing and what you're to what you're sensing. And there's really interesting neuropathways that are just for the senses and neuropathways that are just for muscular movement. And and the fact that and the thing is these is these are, these are neuropathways that run, you know, from your head, down to your fingers, down to your toes, you know, throughout your entire nervous systems how your entire body.

14:51
But what's really interesting is that they is the idea that these these, these these signals not only not only do they have a path but they are. I think colliding with something, and that's what makes that's what makes a really interesting because you think they have to, they have to collide with something in order to be detected, right?

15:15
They have to decide into detectors. Basically, and that's, that's, that's a big part of what this book is about. What? Those detectors are how they work, how they communicate and how they produce a conscious reality and then how that that is. And then we have to look at the observer effect, okay?

15:40
And we have to look at the answer effect and then we have to, we have to look at space time because because we have to be able to it because if you can, if you to properly, explain what is happening in terms of how your brain can make consciousness.

16:02
We also have to understand the observer effect and we have to understand space time and that's why this leads to a new theory of of gravitation and and some new ideas on the Higgs field and special relativity. And,

16:29
Some new ideas for bringing computer interfaces.
