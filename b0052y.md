# 2. Audio Summary:

The text discusses the extraordinary capabilities of cells, particularly neurons and white blood cells, emphasizing that their complex communication methods are not fully understood by scientists. Using John Leaf's book "Cells" as a reference, it explores how white blood cells navigate to wounds through intricate signaling, potentially involving principles akin to the path integral theory and gravity. The conversation then shifts to the limitations of artificial neural network models, like the perceptron, in capturing the full functionality of biological neurons. It highlights the complexity of pyramidal neurons, which may function as multi-layer neural networks capable of detecting multiple patterns and making dynamic decisions. The author suggests that understanding these complexities requires integrating new and old ideas about neuron communication, and proposes that concepts like the observer effect and spacetime are essential to explaining consciousness. This exploration leads to proposing new theories of gravitation and insights into the Higgs field and special relativity, with implications for advancing brain-computer interfaces.

Key Arguments:

Extraordinary Cell Functions: Cells, especially neurons and white blood cells, perform complex tasks and communicate in ways that are not fully understood by current science.

White Blood Cell Navigation: White blood cells reach wound sites through constant communication with neurons and signals emitted by the wound itself, involving mechanical, chemical, and heat-based signals.

Analogy with Physics Principles: The process of white blood cells navigating to wounds may be analogous to the path integral theory and gravity, suggesting a deeper connection between biological processes and physical laws.

Limitations of Artificial Neural Networks: Traditional models like the perceptron oversimplify neuron functionality by reducing outputs to binary decisions, failing to capture the detailed information processing of biological neurons.

Complexity of Pyramidal Neurons: Pyramidal neurons have intricate structures with multiple dendritic and somatic arbors, allowing them to function like multi-layer neural networks and detect multiple patterns simultaneously.

Dynamic Decision-Making in Neurons: The advanced architecture of neurons enables them to make complex decisions based on various input patterns, indicating a higher level of information processing.

Holographic Processing in the Brain: Cortical columns may receive and learn virtual representations of information in a manner similar to holography, contributing to consciousness and self-awareness.

Signals Colliding with Detectors: Neural signals might involve collisions with certain detectors within the brain, a concept crucial for understanding how conscious reality is produced.

Role of Observer Effect and Spacetime: Explaining consciousness necessitates considering the observer effect and spacetime, potentially leading to new theories in gravitation and physics.

Implications for Brain-Computer Interfaces: These insights could revolutionize brain-computer interfaces and offer new perspectives on the Higgs field and special relativity.

Side note: I had the word birefringence saved in the original version of this note so I did a second Summary around it.

So, the reason I ask people to read the book, Cells by John Leif, is that the book specifically outlines the fact that it specifically describes the extraordinary things that cells do,
that scientists have, I should clarify that, it describes just some of the things that cells do, and scientists don't really understand how cells can do these things, in terms of how they can communicate.
For example, when a white blood cell finds its way from its origin point to the site of a wound, there is a communication happening back and forth, constantly, between the neuron that sent that white blood cell,
that guides that white blood cell to its target.
And the white blood cell literally moves through the tissue with something that seems analogous to limbs, like it's like, it's almost like walking through your tissue, right, stepping over things.
And it changes its body to do that.
So, it's like you have one cell that's coordinating logistics of another cell to send it to a wound.
That's what it looks like.
Um, and I would say that the coordination is, um, wow.
Because, see, because, see, the point of the wound is going to be sending a lot of signals, right?
It's a crisis point.
And that's going to be triggering a lot of other cell activity.
Because it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's both a mechanical and a chemical and a heat-based oscillatory signal.
So it's that, so the wound itself is transmitting, like, a constant signal, right?
And, um, and then the cell that responds is also sort of, like, sending a constant signal that is almost initiated by the wound.
Um, but then the wound, I would say, I would say, I think maybe the wound and the cell that's responding to the wound are both firing in a way that's, that's helping to, um, helping the, um, white blood cell to get to the origin point of the wound.
I'm sorry, not from the origin point to the wound.
Um, and, um, of where it was emitted.
And, um, it seems like that could work via the sort of, like, the same principle of the path integral theory and gravity.
Right, right, where we're basically creating the, um, so interesting.
Um, okay, but let's revisit this later.
But the, um, okay.
Okay, so we're going to finish the white blood cell theory later.
But the point is that this cuts to, um, the idea that, uh, maybe neurons can do more than what we think they can.
Um, and this, um, and this connects to deep learning because, um, the, the, uh, the question is, um, um, so if you, so you, if you look at the perceptron, right?
Okay, so the perceptron is, like, a simplified, is, is, the perceptron is an artificial neuron.
It's the model, I'm sorry, it's the model of an artificial neuron that was created to be simulated in a computer in order to, um, adapt some of the properties of a neural network and bring them into a computer.
Um, they tried to just, uh, say, what's the most, what is the most functional, um, way of, uh, of looking at, uh, at, uh, of, of a neural network?
What is it, what is the, the basic functionality of a neural network?
And, um, and it was, at the time that the perceptron was created, um, there was this idea that, um, whatever inputs a neural network, uh, whatever inputs the, the brain received to a neuron, that it would be summarized in an output, like, uh, like a one or a zero, like either fired or didn't fire.
Um, and, um, and so, that sort of analogy is, like, oversimplified, so it's like, it's like a neuron is connected to a bunch of other neurons, and either it fires or doesn't fire, and, and somehow that, that, um, is going to, um, weight it.
It's going to become a weight.
It's going to become weighted by the fact that it fired.
Um.
The firing represents, uh, a lower level coincidence that the, that the, um, that the neuron detected from its, uh, from a sensor array, which could, which could be, um, a, uh, a lower, could be the input data, or it could be just the, the layer of, of neurons beneath it.
And, um, and by firing, it's representing, uh, that coincidence that, uh, as a, as a, as a learner.
And then, uh, as a, as a learner.
And then, uh, as a learner.
And then, uh, so once it's been trained, then you, uh, you pass it new data, and the, uh, trained neural network will, um, will multiply that new data by the, uh, by the vector that represents its, its learned weight based upon learned patterns.
And, um, uh, anyway, so it's, it's a, it's a, it's a long story, but, um, it's a longer story than that.
But the, but the, um, but the idea is that, um, we want to see if, um, there is in fact, uh, a greater level of detail, um, that can be, um, captured, uh, by a neuron, and then, um, transmitted from a neuron.
Um, in, in, in, in the real biological sense.
Because, um, it is, in, it is in one sense about the, so, so there's this idea that a dendrite could function as a neural network.
You can look that up in a search engine.
And, uh, so some people have proposed that a dendrite could be, uh, similar to a two-layer neural network.
I, I think there was, uh, someone mentioned to me that there was a, uh, some sort of paper that a dendrite could be a five-layer, similar to a five-layer neural network.
Um, it gets really interesting when you consider the complexity of pyramidal neurons, and they have, um, the dendrites, uh, there's, like, there's, there's, it's, it's, it's, the, the body of a pyramidal neuron is different from other neurons.
And that there's, like, uh, there's a soma area that's distinct from the dendrite area, and then the dendrite might have multiple, um, uh, sort of sub-areas that, um, can each, um, fire.
It's, like, um, it's, like, the, it's, like, the, it's, like, having multiple dendritic arbors and multiple, so, um, somatic arbors connected to a single neuron, right?
So, like, instead of a neuron having, like, one, um, dendrite that leads directly to the soma, it's, like, you can separate the soma and the dendrite into two different areas
so that their charges could be adjusted independently, and you could have, and you could have independent, basically, um, uh, sort of areas where charge in a pyramidal neuron can collect and diffuse.
Um, which is really, it just really complicates the, um, uh, the number of things that, um, can cause a, the number of ways, um, the number of patterns,
the, the number of, the number of ways that, uh, a pyramidal neuron could be connected, and the number of ways to cause a pyramidal neuron to fire,
and the number of patterns that a pyramidal neuron could fire, um, uh, or respond to, um, in, in a dynamic, in a, in a dynamic way, um,
cause it's, like, it's, like, it's, like, well, maybe, uh, um, a, uh, a pyramidal neuron could, could represent, could detect multiple patterns, right?
And then make a decision whether or not to respond to those multiple patterns by, by, um, by the, um, by the way it's set up.
And, and, and, and, um, so the pyramidal neuron is just really, really fascinating from, from a neural architecture standpoint in terms of, um, you know, what if we captured that?
But one of the things that I, uh, want to sort of bring up, um, are some of the, uh, some of the many ideas, uh, that have sort of fallen to the wayside.
Of how neurons could communicate.
And, um, so I have some new ideas, but I also have some ideas about how to integrate some old ideas together.
And, um, so that's, that's, uh, that's part of the, the book.
Um, so, so I need to talk about, like, the, the grant, the, the capabilities of neurons, the ways they can talk to each other,
the kinds of things they can do, part of that is from John Leaf's book.
Um, but part of that is from, from, um, sort of, like, considering what a, an artificial neural network can do,
but then expanding on that if you had the additional structure, um, and features of the, of the, of what's going on in a neural network,
in, in, in a human neural network, um, one of the things that, uh, is, is, um,
really interesting is that the explanation for what's happening, um,
in a, in a real or an artificial neural network, in terms of, like, I think it's not, I think, I think it's, it's, it's, it's not really clear to people what's happening.
Um, and so I have some new thoughts there in terms of, of, um, what's happening.
And, and, and, and, and, and so that's about, um, looking at how one, uh, how one edge community
is, is, is perceiving and then representing patterns to another edge community,
which is then perceiving and representing patterns to another edge community.
And then you have basically, um, at some, at some point in the brain, you have cortical columns
that are, um, also receiving and learning virtual representations of information.
Um, and we can describe this as, um, uh, as, as akin to holography.
Um, but, um, but, but also this is the key to why, uh, the human brain is, is, um, has awareness
and has, and, and why it generates self-awareness.
And, and, and part of that comes from, you know, connecting what your, your, uh, muscles are doing
and what you're, to what you're sensing.
And there's really interesting neural pathways, um, that are just for the senses and neural
pathways that are just for, um, muscular movement.
And, um, and the fact, and, and the thing is these, is these are, these, these are neural
pathways that run, you know, from your head down to your fingers, down to your toes, you know,
throughout your entire nervous system, throughout your entire body.
Um, but what's really interesting is that they, um, is the idea that these, um, these,
these, um, these signals, not only, not only do they have a path, but they are, I think,
colliding with something.
And that's what makes, that's what makes it really interesting because you, you think they
have to, they'd have to collide with something in order to be detected, right?
They have to collide into detectors, basically.
And that's, that's, that's a big part of what this book is about, what those detectors
are, how they work, how they communicate, and, um, how they produce, uh, conscious reality.
And then how that, that is, um, and then we have to look at the observer effect.
Okay.
And, uh, and, uh, we have to look at the observer effect.
Um, and then we have to, we have to look at space time.
Because, because we have to be able to, because if you can, if you can, to properly explain
what is happening in terms of how your brain can make consciousness, we also have to understand
the observer effect, and we have to understand space time.
And, and that's why this leads to a new theory of, of gravitation.
And, and, uh, some new ideas on the Higgs field, and special relativity, and, um,
some, some new ideas for brain-computer interfaces.
Thank you.
