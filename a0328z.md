a0328z My Initial thoughts on Adaptive Resonance Theory.

December 8th 2022

I was listening to this Brain Inspired podcast episode that someone linked on twitter.

BI 100.2 What Are the Biggest Challenges and Disagreements? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDkzeXGmjz4 

When I came across the work of Steve Grossberg who spoke at 36:55 and who created the Adaptive Resonance Theory.

A google search led me to the following links. I decided to review Adaptive Resonance Theory to understand how it compared to Self Aware Networks: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography Theory.

BI 082 Steve Grossberg: Adaptive Resonance Theory

"Adaptive resonance theory: The primary intuition behind the ART model is that object identification and recognition generally occur as a result of the interaction of 'top-down' observer expectations with 'bottom-up' sensory information. The model postulates that 'top-down' expectations take the form of a memory template or prototype that is then compared with the actual features of an object as detected by the senses. This comparison gives rise to a measure of category belongingness. As long as this difference between sensation and expectation does not exceed a set threshold called the 'vigilance parameter', the sensed object will be considered a member of the expected class. The system thus offers a solution to the 'plasticity/stability' problem, i.e. the problem of acquiring new knowledge without disrupting existing knowledge that is also called incremental learning."

My first note about this is that the idea that events are driven from the top down and from the bottom up is a key component of Self Aware Networks NAPOT theory. In addition SAN:NAPOT describes lateral functionality at multiple scales.

However ART seems to be focused on describing how an artificial neural network can work to have these features where as my focus with SAN:NAPOT is on precisely how the human brain accomplishes its top down, bottom up, and lateral functions at all scales.

I write about the tonic oscillation being the ground of being, or baseline that incoming sensory information as phase wave differentials is compared against, this is a similar concept to ART theory, but SAO:NAPOT is specific about the neural mechanisms involved in the comparison.

I think of György Buzsáki's book "The Brain from Inside Out"

To paraphrase and simplify I think György Buzsáki thinks that the error of AI is that the human brain begins as a blank slate, like a notebook (Alan Turing quote) and it leads to catastrophic forgetting.

György Buzsáki's The Brain from Inside Out book has a brain centric view, where the brain has pre existing patterns, instinctual Rhythms, tonic oscillation patterns, inherent connectivity bias, and this provides the stability against which incoming sensory patterns must interact with. 

For György Buzsáki brain activity is a process of matching preexisting patterns, the data encoded in the natural Rhythms of the Brain, with events outside in the world, that disturb, perturb, modify, and shape the brain like molding clay.

György Buzsáki's viewpoint is almost also a match for ART Adaptive Resonance Theory. 

For György Buzsáki the brain's primary preoccupation is trying to maintain its existing dynamic, and that is what provides it's resiliance against the catastrophic forgetting seen in the Deep Learning Neural Networks of yesterday.

Listen to a quote from György Buzsáki (Also for this note reference 31:49 minute mark – György Buzsáki via https://braininspired.co/podcast/100-2/ )

There is a data comparison happening between layers in ART, but it is not clear what the analogy, but in NAPOT:ART I'm arguing that the data comparisons are not just differences between layers of neural arrays, but that in the brain

The components of renderings that are bound together across layers across networks of the brain in phase wave differential rhythms, that transmit through phase matched functionally connected brain regions, inside oscillating feedback loops are comparisons to the existing multi-dimensional tonic oscillation brainwave patterns which for example in the Hippocampus would be low frequency Theta oscillations. That's what I mean by comparisons, and that is a bit different from how comparisons are described in ART, but the basic idea, which is the brain does comparisons between internal values and incoming sensory inputs is there.

In SAN:NAPOT I argue that exit terminal or the Apical Dendrite is an inceptive field, and these inceptive fields send information to receptive fields which are represented by basal dendrites or the input side (the primary dendrite) of the neuron.

(Side Note: Although synapic communication is bidirectional the direction of signal transmission along the axon, during an action potential event, is mostly towards the exit terminal or the apical dendrite as far as I have read. So it's fair to describe neurons as having an input side that is opposite the exit terminal)

I don't want to go much deeper in to comparing SAN:NAPOT to ART because to me ART is like an exercise in trying to take intuitive and somewhat obvious observations from Psychology and trying to make them work in an Artificial Neural Network.

I think Buzsaki's book the Brain from Inside Out is a good match for the basic ideas of Adaptive Resonance Theory, but not for the specific implementations of ART in Artificial Neural Networks none of which appear to be biologically plausible.

I think that there is a great opportunity for Stephen Grossberg and György Buzsáki to have a long recorded dialog together about the intersections of their work, and I would love to be in that conversation someday to talk with them about SAN:NAPOT.
