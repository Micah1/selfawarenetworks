"We know that birds can only sense magnetic fields if certain wavelengths of light are available - specifically, studies have shown that avian magnetoreception seems dependent on blue light."

"This seems to confirm that the mechanism is a visual one, based in the cryptochromes, which may be able to detect the fields because of quantum coherence."

"The fancy eye protein is called Cry4, and it's part of a class of proteins called cryptochromes - photoreceptors sensitive to blue light, found in both plants and animals. These proteins play a role in regulating circadian rhythms."

The exact degree to which the brains neural firing is affected by electromagnetic waves is unclear, but showing that the firing of neurons actually is affected by magnetic field waves implies that human beings can become aware of magnetic fields. Infact the same proteins that allow birds to detect magnetic fields (to fly north or south seasonally as birds do) may also allow human beings to detect magnetic fields. So why is it that not everyone we talk to seems to be perceiving electromagnetic waves? I do think it is in part because of the Perception-Action Cycle is a requirement for any organism to become conscious of a pattern. I would expect that people who pay a lot of attention to the sky, the way birds do, people in occupations such as Air Traffic Controllers, that these people would be more likely to develop a sense of the earth's magnetic field. Out of any group of people, I would expect sky watchers to be the first people to learn to see/perceive large scale electromagnetic fields.
