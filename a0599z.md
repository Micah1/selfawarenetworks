Adrian and Peter Tse
if the tonic firing truly had no information the firing would eventually cease, therefore it

each and every quantative variation in your volumetric 3D + 1D representation of time such as between a box and a wall, or one side of a box and another side, or one color and another, is going to be a relative phase pattern deviation from a tonic baseline oscillation, positive or negative, with amplitudinal (or combinational) properties (meaning that oscillating phases deviations or differentials can combine to create larger objects in your perception or they can decrease in their amplitude if you move farther away, or increase in relative frequency(phase) if they accelerate, and for each entity that is being tracked by your vision and each of your other senses is going to also have some specific oscillatory correlation in brain activity that is effectively maintaining the conscious representation of the properties of that phase state which represents your internal qualia and is your internal qualia.
