Brain Tentacle Receptors

00:00

Interesting. They think about what if each arm of the octopus, had its own identity, as if each octopus tentacle had with its own brain, he talked tentacle has his own brain, it's a just, it's like an animal with a distributed brain system. But what if he's typical, has its own identities, own sense of self.

00:22

As I am this animal, but me, it's like, I understand this animal, but I'm also like, but I am only one of this animal like. That'd be like, is if each of your fingers had their own sense of self, right? Like, if each of your fingers had their own sense of self, like I am Micah's thumb, I might as index finger.

00:51

I am Micah's. Middle finger and my customers ring finger and make a spin key. Hey, this is five five of me in each any chance. And they're all like alive and doing things now, there isn't there isn't unfortunately a brain in each of my fingers. But for the octopus, there is each of its tentacles has a brain of it.

01:22

And so the question is yet, is it distributed mind that is network as one mind or does it function? Like like there's a separate animal, we need to tentacle. Does these tentacle operate at the zone animal? I mean, you can see that when the tentacle is separated that it tries to feed itself, the tentacle becomes separated, it tries to feed it, tries to put food.

01:54

Where the where the body is to be but it doesn't know, it doesn't. It doesn't it's not able to do anything beyond that. Like that's the limitation because it's just a tentacle floating in the water. The only thing you can try to do is try to put food back into where the body used to be, that's a sort of limit.

02:22

So it's it's it doesn't seem like this distributed but it seems like maybe it doesn't really have its own sense and direction. It doesn't contain and unfortunately it doesn't continue to live after suffering from the octopus. That'd be great. If it like grew another head, right? And more legs and more octave more tentacles.

02:59

I mean, I'd be awesome, unfortunately.

03:09

That's really the system.

03:17

But then people ask about what about the enteric brain or the brain in the gut or the enteric? Yeah, the entire system. It's has a lot of neurons say is is is there is any kind of like sensory processing happening down there? Any sort of thought or thinking is that?

03:38

Is that a conscious being down there in the gut? Is it under? Is it like another animal like another tentacle? Is my got a person also, but we'll kind of person without eyes, right? It doesn't have access to my eyes. It doesn't need eyes. It doesn't need any relationships with anybody.

04:11

It's a, it's it's, it's can just be, you know, maybe it's, it's, it's a bit more like a computer and doesn't have awareness. I think we could figure out if it has awareness or not, let me think are the neurons, we'd have to see. Okay, so if there are neurons that are, what are they doing there?

04:38

Guess they're gonna be learning patterns. That's interesting. What if you're in tech? Brain could speak. What would it say? Why would it say anything?

04:57

Or if we could talk to the entire brain to learn about your health, next in your life.

05:09

That's amazing. It seems that we're scientists can now say, from looking at the, the impacts of vaccine on the virus including data with the Delta virus is that those groups of people who do not consume the vaccine for whatever reason will perish in greater numbers than people who did consume the vaccine for whatever reason.

05:47

Um, if you didn't, if you're in a group of people who didn't take the vaccine and you catch the virus, your odds are worse. You're more likely to suffer and you're more likely to perish, but you're also more likely to have what's called long covid.

06:20

And that's like even after the virus passes from your body that you continue to have bad symptoms for a long time and they could, it could be new symptoms. You could develop symptoms after people have reported, you know, after some months of recovering from covet that they developed really bad symptoms in a way, I think of, I think of, I think of what's happening to your body is similar is it's like a lot of oxidative stress, a lot of with long covered.

06:59

I think that was happening is a lot of oxidative stress, and a lot of inflammation is prematurely aging people and whatever diseases they were developing and accelerated. Like if there was a disease that you were slowly developing, that would have killed you. By the time you were 60, it's been except like the timeline has been accelerated and in some cases, you know, with the that.

07:28

Also that data, that that idea fits with like, what was all when covenanting first appeared on this on, on the scene and we still see to this day was that there's a lot of comorbidities, a lot of deaths are related to comorbidities which means that the patient died of more than when disease.

07:45

At the same time a specifically at least covenant. In this case, we're talking about the, you know, the patient dying of something like heart disease or cancer. Stroke maybe even passing away from Alzheimer's, there's any number of diseases, but also passing away with covid-19 with a covent 19 infection at the same time and that fits with the idea that hey, this is this is a promoting the the factors that actually ages which is a lot of oxidative stress or it's it's either it's either oxidative stress or it's mimicking.

08:23

Oxidative stress enough to be the equivalent of oxidative stress. It's oxidative distress right by but it and unconventional and unconventional form of oxidative stress I guess. And it's a it's inflammation. This is what the virus does. It attaches to the AC receptors and those those receptors are all throughout your NDA.

08:49

Theo. The endothelial lining of your cells agree, blood vessels and, including some simply as cells in human brain. And so there's a plant there's a lot of opportunity for for cells that have a lot of H2 receptors to to receive an extreme amount of damage and that releases the damage to cells.

09:18

Of course, can release fluid into your lungs and what in, at least one, and in one manifestation of potential outcomes, at least one potential outcome is, is that it causes, you know, people to have really have a lot of trouble breathing in a lot of trouble like without with the oxygen and it can cause along the fill up of fluid as another thing.

09:56

So, that's not all. I mean, it can cause heart attack and stroke because at the core of it, like, you know, it is about it. This virus is because it's so powerful. It's just like a, it's like a blender that drops up your, your AC receptors. But they AC receptors have to balance out your ACE1 receptors and two types of receptors do ops things.

10:22

These two receptors they diet, they dilate your your your blood vessels and AS1 receptors. They constrict your blood vessels. And so the and so if they're not balanced out then you're gonna have you're gonna have too much ice one. That's too much constriction and so there's too much tricks to your blood vessels are getting tighter with covid-19.

10:42

They're getting in it's like it's like this is sort of like parallel to what happens when you age you when you age your blood vessels are getting tighter right. So now you understand it's making your blood vessels, tighter in a long-term way by showing them with inflammation and destruction in the form of oxidative stress.

11:01

There's a lot of, there's a lot of particles playing around because it's just literally destroying cells as a debris, your, your body's being hit with the brain. It's like it's like a Star Wars, battlefield ship being destroyed and ships are flying into other ships, start where there's Star Trek battlefield, there's lots of ships in space and all shooting each other, that's sort of like there's debris in and that means that broken ships are hitting, other ships.

11:27

And some ships are gonna be destroyed by other ships. It's just, it's like a war zone, right? And that war zone is targeting is fucking up the angio 10 system which is you know the Indian intensive system is the Ace 1 and HT receptors balancing each other out. Okay?

11:45

That's so that's causing your your blood vessels to get constricted which is the same thing that happens. When you you know, your blood vests are getting tight, that's a biomarker of aging. They're getting constricted. Yeah, that's that's a symptom of aging, right? That's does. That's I mean that's an association of withaging is that.

12:04

There's just too much, too much stress and too much oxidative stress and too much inflammation for the body to handle anymore. It's been fighting for a year's and it's it's gradually. Your body's gradually losing the battle. That's, that's why we all it's. So why we all kill over in the end for news battle against entropy our bodies too.

12:30

And So I mean, maybe there are going to be some smart strategies and one of the things that I wanted to talk about was, you know, what? If we could talk, you know, creative communication, between a computer and the entire brain in your gut, okay, with with Neurylink? What if we would, if we plug nearly into you're into the, the brain, that's in your gut.

12:56

And and we connected that to the computer and and we began to to to what I want to do is I'm going to, I want to connect the gut in the brain together so there can be like some, I don't know. I mean in a in a neat way, not a gross way.

13:19

I mean I'm thinking maybe and we can visualize what the god is doing on a computer. And so, in that, in that way, we're connecting the, the brain to the guy, I guess, because you can watch the 3D visualization of what the guide is doing. And in, maybe, maybe you got like, I mean, I since, you know, my like, sometimes I sense, oh, I'm full or oh, I'm hungry and maybe there's a lot more that I can become a lot more feelings that, my God is making that I can become conscious of as being from my gut.

13:58

If I begin to visualize, it's it's activity in 3d and this could be the feet. Just gonna be part of the future of medicine where we are, basically not just like thinking about connecting computers to our brains, or to our to our limbs. But also, you know, we're thinking about connecting the computer's to novel areas of the body that haven't been thought of in the same sort of with the same focus.

14:33

I guess we can. I guess we can broaden their focus with with the democratization of neural link and narrow gaseous. Neural ink neural lace and nerve care technology with a democratization of next generation brain, computer interface and brain machine interface technology. They can be. That means that like anyone can make them and and and perhaps they can be mass produced at an inexpensive price and science can be open and everyone can learn and and and we can in, you know, and hopefully we can figure out how to how to fix the big problems in the world.

15:24

I think that a lot of the I'm learning, I'm learning a lot about, you know, how text is difficult. And we need to listen to people to think with their to think. First of that, my mind can sync with your minds that we can feel normal about other people.

15:46

And, and so hearing, I think hearing people actually speak so you can tune in engage in in speaking to them, like, to be like having conversations sinking is about conversations. You know, I believe it's it's a parallel to what to the fact that that it's, it's, it allows us to extend.

16:15

Basically our thought process, when you connect two people together, their thought process in your process can can align. But this one I think it's only possible. Like, I find. Like, if I look back that basically all the relationships that fell apart with, they all had in common was, I think that we 
were relying too much on on using texts the primary way to communicate and the relationships that didn't fall apart.

16:48

Like, it's, it's because we made more of an effort to talk to each other so that our brains could actually sink. Like the text-based communication just made us in some cases it makes people more suspicious of one another and and because because your brain is not sinking with that person, you're just getting this abstract bits of information and it's kind of disconnected from reality.

17:18

It's disconnects you from reality and so you start to feel weird about the other person. If you're only, if you're only talking to them with text, but if you're talking to them with voice and you're syncing with them, then you can feel normal, then you can feel normal about them and they can feel normal about you.

17:36

And I think this is an essential part to how speaking in connecting with people and syncing with them is essential part to to solving some of the problems that the world faces. And this is about, this is about.

18:04

Making it possible. This is, this is about. I mean, there's part of it. I think that's part of it. I think it's not just talking. I mean, I think that you have to people have to get over their egos to some extent, they have to realize that, you know, the ego's is everywhere, you know, in a way I mean, they have to like imagine that it's everywhere sort of like help their minds to to to

18:36

To find it, you have to imagine that. It's everywhere to help your mind. Find the ego. So you can you can you can you can understand it understand and face it and know it know what it is.

18:55

It said, you know, it's the thing that's that's everyone in no one, right? It's everyone and no one.

19:12

It's kind of, like,

19:18

And it's also it's also you know, someone it's everyone is no one. It's someone, that's all you go.

19:34

And I I don't know how to say this, but, you know, in, But your hand is a dendrite and is a type of dendrite in a way that the the parts of the fingers are connected to is the soma in the fingers, themselves are the dendritic, branches, right? And then, the long arm is, is the axon.

20:08

It's just that humor, but I think that's a interesting metaphor. Like are you your hand is basically at the fractal of a dendrite basically.
