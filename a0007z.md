Dendritric morphologies & synaptic connections represent learned memories. Memories activate when preferred patterns (the memory) are detected, this causes cells to create a selective transmission or a projection to other cells (neural arrays). In this note I am looking at Layer 6 & Layer 5 Pyramidal cells, to learn how the Apical Dendrite, or the Exit Terminal, is contributing to the rendered projection of that learned memory to the rest of it's network. The main idea that I am exploring is that the signal transmitted from the exit terminal is not uniform along all branches, but instead is modified synapses by synapse, and that the memories in the exit terminal also transmit backwards to play a role in multiple seconds long coincidence detections involving back propagating action potentials from the exit terminal or Apical Dendrite to the Soma, that when combined with the Basal or sensory input dendrite can cause a coincidence detection that creates a special type of action potential event called burst firing.

# "Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites" 

"All pyramidal neurons so far investigated have displayed active propagation of action potentials (APs), from the soma along the apical dendrite supported by voltage-gated dendritic Na+ channels (Spruston et al., 1995; Stuart et al., 1997; Waters et al., 2003), modulated by dendritic K+ channels (Bekkers, 2000; Johnston et al., 2000; Korngreen and Sakmann, 2000; Schaefer et al., 2007), and accompanied by influx of Ca2+ ions (Markram et al., 1995; Larkum et al., 1999a; Barth et al., 2008). Another prominent feature of pyramidal neurons is the ability of the apical dendrite to generate local spikes with voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels (Kim and Connors, 1993; Schiller et al., 1997; Golding et al., 2002; Gasparini et al., 2004) as well as NMDA receptor channels (Schiller et al., 2000; Larkum et al., 2009)."

"Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer
1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas."

"We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including

1. generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition

powerfully block dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Buzsa´ki et al., 1996; Miles et al., 1996; Pe´rez-Garci et al., 2006; Larkum et al., 2007; Murayama et al., 2009)."

# "Physiology of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex: Coincidence Detection through Bursting" 2015

"L5 pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical cell type with dendrites reaching all six layers of cortex, casting them as one of the main integrators in the cortical column."

"100 tuft and 175 basal NMDA/AMPA synapses are distributed randomly across the apical tuft and basal dendrites of a multi-compartmental L5 pyramidal neuron model."
"(b) Simultaneous tuft and basal inputs triggers a burst of somatic APs and a dendritic Ca2+ spike
"(c) basal inputs alone evoke only a single" somatic spike."
"(d) Apical tuft inputs alone do not evoke somatic spiking"

An interesting thought about the cyclic nature of Layer 5 pyramidal cells, is the idea that the process of the dendrite being a sensor, like an eyeball or an ear appears to apply to both sides of the neuron, on the way in, and on the way out. So the Apical dendrite, as a neural network, is learning from incoming sensor stimulus, but the Soma burst is one of the incoming sensor stimulai, with models of soma burst waveforms becoming part of what the Apical Dendrite has to contend with.

I think of it as like the basal dendrite is learning to respond selectively to certain patterns, the apical is learning what patterns it responds to.

My intuition is that the apical is learning it's own cell's response's, and through feedback loops, with itself and with other pyramidal neurons the cell is going to make predictions about it's own patterns of causation, what patterns it responds & how it reacts or responds. With the Apical Dendrite perhaps symbolizing a more complex response that is connected to more complex learning. (compared to other types of neurons)

The fact that bursting (bursts of somatic AP) results from the coincident activity of basal + apical, but not from either one separately is a different coincidence detection mechanism from the leaky integrate-and fire model of a neuron which explores coincident synaptic inputs, leading to coincident dendritic activity, which leads to the phasic action potential from just the south side of the Soma.

In the leaky integrate & fire neurons, and the Hodgkin & Huxley Model there is very little thought to the concept of the Soma burst spiking being a coincidence detection from both sides of the neuron. But if it's true for Layer 5 pyramid cells, then we ought to know if there is a greater role for the exit terminal in all other types of neurons.

So perhaps we can think of the axon, with it's different types of action potentials, different durations (wave shapes, magnitudes), and different burst rates, as a analogous to a lens, a lense that is creating a summation signal that the exit terminal is learning as it's learned response.

The idea is that our sensory inputs are sort of encoded in the input dendrite (or the basal dendrite) and our motor outputs are sort of encoded in the exit terminal (the Apical dendrite), and through cyclic looping activity our input learning (sensory in the bottom dendrite) is being mapped to our output learning (motor in the output exit terminal, or the Apical Dendrite)

So every neuron represents an actor, one that learns to respond selectively to certain patterns, and encodes in it's exit a response action.

The meaning of the main somatic signal is like the summary pattern of what the dendrite (basal) has detected, a magnitude + a frequency rate, and the exit or Apical is more about having a highly coordinate response.

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md

It's interesting that a place field, in place cells, can begin with a somatic spike. (see note b0232y on behavioral time synaptic plasticity) but it results in burst firing the next time the organism encounters the same place. Perhaps that first spike comes from the Dendrite, and then the Exit Terminal learns to predict it, based on the wave shape (duration & frequency), so that the exit terminal is sending it's prediction backwards, a back propagation spike, at the same time that the mouse encounters that same place again. That would make both sides of the neuron like timers, timers that learn when they are going to fire, and the dendrite is learning a pattern, encoding it in a timer signal at the axon, with the exit terminal learning the different timing signals, and responding with it's own backpropagting signals, to create burst spiking that leads to an organism taking actions based on it's memories.

"This line of research has shown that pyramidal neurons in different cortical regions contain voltage-gated Na+ channels along the dendritic trunk which support the backpropagation of action potentials (APs) from the soma into dendrites [6], as well as voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that support spiking in the apical dendrite"

"Using a detailed multi-compartmental model, we show this physiological setup to be well suited for coincidence detection between basal and apical tuft inputs by controlling the frequency of spike output. We further show how direct inhibition of calcium channels in the dendrites modulates such coincidence detection."

"Because past studies have found that dendritic electrogenesis depends on calcium channels in the apical dendrites, and that sag and dendritic resting potential and input resistance is dependent on Ih conductance, we were able to manipulate only dendritic calcium and Ih conductance parameters, by hand, to fit to our experimental results."

1. Coincidence detection between basal & apical dendrites via the frequency of the spike output.
2. Synaptic Efficacy: Inhibiting calcium channels modulates the coincidence detection between the basal & apical dendrites.
3. This is going to allow for multi-second pattern learning. Or Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) in the cortical columns of the neocortex. I share notes about the documentation of BTSP in the hippocampus in note a0232z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md

I've read about back propaganding action potentials from the post synaptic membrane (traveling backwards) to the presynaptic membrane. That's where the idea of individual synapses being up regulated or down regulated might be like setting up the individual letters of a printing press (the old fashioned kind that prints newspapers) with the action potential event printing that pattern to it's exit terminal network, or the receiving neural array.

"We find that mouse L5 pyramidal neurons in V1 support backpropagating action potentials (bAPs), and dendritic Ca2+ spiking."

However the combination of the research on BTSP in the Hippocampus, with back propaganding action potentials from the Apical dendrite towards the soma in Cortical Columns is for me a new mechanism of coincidence detection across the whole brain, and it ought to lead to studies that explore whether much smaller neurons also have burst spiking that is triggered by the combination of back propagating signals from the exit terminal direction + forward propaganding signals from the dendrite that represents sensory input. This is not the Hodgkin & Huxley model of neuron. It's not the leaky integrate & fire neuron, or perhaps I ought to say it is more than the classic model of neural firing.

"We show how concurrent input into the perisomatic and electrically remote apical tuft regions switches somatic action potential output from low to high frequency. Thus, high frequency bursting indicates coincident input into different parts of the dendritic structure."

"We further explore regulation of this coincidence detection scheme by blockage of the voltage-gated calcium channels on which this computational principle depends on. We ultimately show that such single-cell computation can be conceptualized as a composite of sigmoid functions."

"A phenomenological model"
"To conceptually address the single-neuron computation that this biophysical setup performs, we establish a phenomenological model. We compare three models: a composite, multiplicative, and an additive model"
"Each of these models uses two sigmoidal functions to perform intermediate computations, and is justified by the existence of the two separate (one dendritic and one somatic) spiking zones in the neuron."
"The interaction of the sigmoids in the composite model is justified by the experimental results suggesting that the result of dendritic electrogenesis is to lower the threshold for a high-frequency burst at the soma."
"The multiplicative and additive models have two independent sigmoids, one of which takes tuft (apical) synapses as input, and the other which takes basal synapses as input. "
"The composite model outperforms both the multiplicative and additive models, though less so when Ca2+ conductance is decreased by 75%, suggesting that the inability of the multiplicative and additive models to represent the input-output relationship depends on dendritic electrogenesis"
"The effect of tuft input (The Apical Dendrite or Exit Terminal) is to increase the maximum possible output frequency (Fig. 5D left) and decrease the threshold of basal input needed to elicit high frequency firing (Fig. 5D right)."
"Thus, the sigmoid that relates tuft input to burst-firing threshold is decreasing (since more tuft input decreases that threshold, Fig. 5A red sigmoid), while the sigmoid that relates tuft input to somatic output frequency is increasing (since more tuft input increases the output frequency, Fig. 5A blue sigmoid)."
"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

Should we multiple two sigmoids (from both sides of the neuron) together, should we add two sigmoids each representing (inputs from each of two sides of the neuron together, or should we have a single sigmoid that composite that is modified on each end?

"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

"How might such single cell computation be involved in visual processing? To explore tuning properties of cells employing a variety of mechanisms, we used circular distributions (von Mises distributions, see Methods and Fig. 6 and S5) to model inputs as a function of stimulus orientation. We compared four different mechanisms (Fig. 6A). A composite sigmoid as described previously, a purely multiplicative where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply multiplied to arrive at output, a purely additive, where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply added to arrive at output, and a single sigmoid mechanism, where either the tuft or the basal input is put through a sigmoid function to arrive at the output."

# "Coincidence Detection in Pyramidal Neurons Is Tuned by Their Dendritic Branching Pattern" https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00046.2003.

This study (link & name above) backs my assertion that a memory is both the synaptic connections, and the dendritic morphology (an assertion found in the NAPOT Whitepaper as well as other places.)

(from the above study) "Is morphological variation a bug that arises from intrinsic biological variability or a feature that extends the computational capabilities of a neuron?"

(from the above study)  "We conclude that variation in dendritic arborization may be a key determinant of variability in coupling (49 
17%; range 19–83%; n  37) and is likely to outweigh the contribution made by variations in active membrane properties. Thus coincidence detection of inputs arriving from different cortical layers is strongly regulated by differences in dendritic arborization."

"Here we focused on variations of the dendritic branching pattern within one class of cells, thick tufted neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons. This cell type is one of the largest found in the mammalian cortex. Its prominent apical dendrite extends vertically 1.3 mm from the soma and gives rise to a tuft of dendritic branches in layer 1 and oblique dendrites spreading horizontally in layers 2/3 and"

"4. The detailed branching pattern varies considerably between individual cells. L5 pyramidal cells also display 2 major types of regenerative events: First, sodium based APs (Na+-APs) are initiated close to the soma and propagate back into the dendritic arbor [backpropagating AP (bAP); Stuart and Sakmann 1994];"

"second, long-lasting, mainly Ca2+ mediated depolarizations (Ca2+-APs) are initiated predominantly in the distal regions of the
apical dendrite (Helmchen et al. 1999; Schiller et al. 1995, 1997) and can be evoked by strong distal synaptic input. It was recently shown that a bAP can lower the threshold for initiation of a Ca2+-AP, thus enabling L5 pyramidal neurons to couple synaptic inputs from different cortical layers if they coincide within a short time window [Fig. 1; backpropagation activated Ca2+ spike firing (BAC firing); Larkum et al. 1999a,b, 2001]."

Dendritic arborization & branching (or dendritic morphology, including between Basal & Apical Dendrites) is one of the ways neurons selectively tune into certain criteria for memory-prediction while ignoring other criteria (the components of patterns). Individual parts of the dendrites & individual synapses are able to excite (up regulate) or inhibit (down regulate) based on coincident detections across the cell membrane, thus allowing the brain to carefully define its own internal mental models of reality, and to actually fine tune those mental models of reality.

The article documents an effort to model or simulate dendritic morphology.

"Dendritic fingerprint captures variability of simulated coupling. The dependence on dendritic arborization in simulations suggests that it should be possible to extract geometric parameters that contribute to this variability."

"a more detailed dendritic fingerprint (Fig. 4) of L5 pyramidal neurons: it consisted of 1) one- and 2) two-dimensional branching densities, 3) the width of the dendritic tree, and 4) diameter distributions for the apical and 5) basal dendrites, as well as 6) the number of basal
dendrites, 7) somatic diameter and length, and 8) the maximal length of the nonnormalized apical dendrite."

I'm surprised there was not more emphases on the lengths of each dendritic branch, because one of the major differences between Mice & Human brains is the length of the dendrite. (search this note for lengthreference1)

"The most profound difference in the branching parameters of the strongly and weakly coupling cells was in the branching densities in the tuft"

This goes back to the question of how a ganglian neuron in the eyeball is able to selectively respond to only patterns that move from left to right, and not patterns that move from right to left or from top to bottom or bottom to top for example. The dendritic morphology means that patterns triggered from the left to the right arrive together in time to trigger that neuron to fire. That is what led me to the concept of HOW the dendritic morpology, along with synaptic connections, both their location & quantity define LTP in the physical morphology of the cell. This concept contributed to my "Neurons are transmitting their shapes" theory in 2014 that I shared on social media via an alias, but you can find in not a0008z

# Visual Responses of Ganglion Cells https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11550/

"Different cells become selectively tuned to detect surprisingly subtle "features" of the visual scene, including color, size, and direction and speed of motion. These are called "trigger features"."

# "On Contrast Sensitivity Functions and the Difference of Gaussians Receptive Field Model"
""Contrast" is the difference in brightness between the light and dark phases of the pattern. In this receptive field characterization, contrast is reduced until the ganglion cell just barely responds to the introduction of such a stimulus into a featureless field. This is the threshold. The process is then repeated for patterns with different bar widths, or "spatial frequencies" (the reciprocal of the number of bright- and dark bar-pairs per unit distance). The sensitivities (the reciprocals of contrast thresholds) are plotted as a function of spatial frequency. The net result is a curve (Fig. 8), which demonstrates that in ganglion cells there is an optimal spatial frequency of stimulation."

# "On Directionally Selective Ganglion Cells"
"Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells respond to stimuli moving in a preferred direction and are inhibited by stimuli moving in the opposite or null direction."
"In addition to a preferred direction of movement these cells have preferred speeds of movement, some prefer slow movements, whereas others prefer rapid movements."
"Directionally selective ganglion cells, stained after microelectrode recordings, have a distinctive dendritic morphology with many apparently closed, or nearly closed, loops, giving the appearance of anastimosing dendrites (Fig. 13, Fig. 14). ON-OFF directionally selective ganglion cells are bistratified in the inner plexiform layer (Fig. 13), whereas ON-type directionally selective cells are monostratified, close to ganglion cell bodies (Fig. 14). None of these morphological features hints at the orientation of the null/preferred axis, however."

# "On Color and Spectral Responses"
"Ganglion cells respond to colored stimuli in one of two ways: color opponent responses and luminance responses. "
"Goldfish are an animal model with color vision and have provided much information on the way in which vertebrate retinas process color."
"In this animal, it was first realized that individual cones express only one each of three genomically available cone photopigment types (colloquially, red, green, or blue cones; technically, long (L), mid (M), or short (S) wavelength types). This supported at least part of Thomas Young's (48) 19th century "trichromatic" theory of color vision. "

# "Tonic and Phasic Ganglion Cells of Primate Retina"
"Tonic cells of the parvocellular pathway respond best to stimuli with high contrast and fine grain, whereas phasic cells respond to stimuli with very weak contrast, covering larger areas (58)."
"Tonic cells respond to light stimuli in a steady maintained manner. Receptive field centers are extremely small, about 15 μm on the retinal surface (~4' of arc, about 10 cm at 100-m distance). Tonic cells are often called "midgets" because they probably represent recordings of midget ganglion cells described by Polyak (54) (see below). They occur with a density distribution across the retina comparable to, anatomically, midget cells (55)."

"Phasic responses originate with morphologically larger ganglion cell types with fast optic nerve fiber conduction velocities (~4 m/s) (56)." 

# "X and Y Receptive Fields"
"One of the assumptions of the DOG model (18) is that ganglion cells linearly add signals from both center and surround mechanisms for all points in space. This suggested that ganglion cells be tested for spatial linearity. Some cells (X-cells) pass the test, whereas others (Y-cells) do not, despite the fact that all receptive field data are well represented by the DOG model."

"In Fig. 11, impulse firing rate is shown for different positions (or spatial phase) of the sine wave stimulus with respect to the receptive field center. To change the spatial phase, the pattern is shifted right and left by incremental amounts. For the X-cell (Fig. 9A), when the pattern is positioned so that the transition from light to dark passes directly through the center of the field, a "null response" is produced. Introduction of the stimulus produces no effect on firing rate. The tendency of the bright bars to excite the cell is exactly compensated by the tendencies of the dark bars to reduce the firing rate."

# "Ganglion Cells That Are Involved in the Circadian Clock"
"Certain large-field, sparsely-branching ganglion cell types are known to project to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain (Fig. 49). The latter nucleus is the primary circadian oscillator in mammals and is essentially the biological clock, allowing reseting of bodily functions to local time. The ganglion cells involved in entraining the circadian clock project from the eye to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) (Fig. 48). They apparently contain the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PCAP), as well as glutamate."

# "THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIRECTION-SELECTIVE RETINAL GANGLION CELLS BY JINYUE LIU"

"Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (DSGC)"
"Starburst Amacrine Cells (SAC)"
"The ON-OFF DSGCs (ooDSGCs) each detect motion in one of four cardinal axes"
"the ON DSGCs detect movement in the dorsal, ventral and nasal directions"

"By correlating physiological responses of each ooDSGC with structural evidence, from serial block-face electron microscopy, of putative synapses on these same cells, they showed that the SACs on the null side of ooDSGCs make more inhibitory synapses onto ooDSGC dendrites compared to SACs on the preferred side. In particular, individual SAC dendrites that are oriented antiparallel to the null direction of the ooDSGC contribute to the majority of these inhibitory synapses (fig.10). Hence, an increase in the number of SAC-ooDSGC inhibitory synapses, rather than the strength of individual ones, accounts for the direction-selective responses of ooDSGCs."

An increase in the number of inhibitory synapses, rather than the strength of individual synapses, accounts for direction selective responses (in the dendrites of individual neurons)

# "Individual SAC dendrites are direction-selective"

"Each SAC can wire to multiple ooDSGCs and contribute to their direction-selective responses. This is possible because each SAC dendrite is an independent direction-selective unit (Euler et al., 2002) (fig.11). When a stimulus is presented in a centrifugal direction, moving from its cell body out to the distal tips, the SAC dendrite inhibits the ooDSGC that it connects to. Therefore, each SAC dendrite responds best to motion in the opposite direction relative to that preferred by its postsynaptic ooDSGC (fig.12)."

The inhibitory inputs from the direction selective (SAC) Star burst Amacrine Cells cause pattern selectivity to happen in the more common On-Off Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (ooDGSCs)

By themselves the SAC cells are direction selective but through inhibitory signals they confer pattern selectivity to the more common ooDSGCs.

"On the other hand, SACs on the preferred side contribute relatively little inhibition."

"each SAC dendrite responds best to motion in the opposite direction relative to that preferred by its postsynaptic ooDSGC"

But the SAC is connected to the ooDSGC in a way that sets a pattern detection preference. (like is this cell going to activate when it sees pattern A (left to right movement), or Pattern B (dorsal to ventral movement (top to bottom))). 

This paper is talking about Direction selectivity, but underlying that is the concept of pattern selectivity, and this is at the root of how memory works in the NAPOT theory. That long term memories are stored in the physical configuration of cells, with the synaptic connections & dendritic configurations, allowing a cell to respond preferentially to certain types of memories, so it activates when it sees what it has grown to look for, and it ignores (inhibits) patterns that do not match it's grown criteria. This is part of how long term learning grows in your mind. Cells learn to preferentially respond to certain patterns, and they learn to inhibit other patterns.

Inhibition then, (and we might apply this concept generally to inhibitory interneuron circuits) inhibition is like a second carving tool for the sculptor that is your brain rendering the mind, some of the patterns in your mind are rendered through excitatory circuits, but those patterns are improved & refined with inhibitory circuits. With inhibition what might otherwise be a rough & wacky hallucinatory experience becomes instead a refined reality, with more accurate pattern representation, and clearer thinking.

This concept also provides a clue to how Dendritic Inhibition might shape your active memory, by causing a cell to respond more or less to something in your receptive field.

What would it mean to apply the inhibitory concept to artificial neural networks such as Stable Diffusion?

# "Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells suppress luminance responses during natural viewing" https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35708.pdf

It is shown that inhibition helps a direction selective cell to ignore stationary behavior. (or patterns that almost match, but do not actually match what the memory-prediction criteria that the cell is seeking to activate in your mind)

"Directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells of the retina report the direction of motion by spiking robustly to movement of an object in one direction (preferred) and sparsely to movement of the same object in the opposite (null) direction1–3. It is somewhat surprising therefore that such cells also spike robustly to changes in luminance without corresponding motion1–5 as responsiveness to two different visual features raises questions of how downstream circuits interpret the meaning of individual spikes, e.g. does a given spike convey information about motion or about luminance?"

"Responsiveness to multiple features by DS cells has been largely ignored in the feature detector literature, curious given that the identification of directional selectivity helped shape the feature detector hypothesis"

^ hmm hmm

"We find that responses to changes in luminance are strongly suppressed in favor of a response that reliably reports direction of motion."

^ Inhibition

"Coupled with the suppression of the response to luminance, this reduction of motion responses results in spike generation for only a single feature: motion of an object in the preferred direction. Responsiveness to only a single feature allows for unequivocal interpretation of transmitted spikes by downstream circuits and makes DS cells a true ‘feature detector.’"

"This finding is in contrast to the results of a recent study in which direction coding was not strongly affected by wide-field inhibition19. Although the changes to the DS index in our study were modest, they arose consistently when the surround inhibition was blocked and thus highlight the importance of natural scenes for extracting certain characteristics from visual neurons"

Layer 5 & 6 Pyramidal Cells

"receive multiple inputs to 2 types of dendritic trees: basal and apical."

It's interesting that only pyramidal cells receive this description when back propagating action potentials happen to all neurons. Really the smaller neurons are smaller functional fractals of the larger neurons, so we ought to see backprogating action potentials from the post synaptic membrane to the pre-synaptic membrane in all neurons, and glial cells, and also back propagating signals from the exit terminal branches (pre-synaptic) towards the soma. The same functions in larger pyramidal cells ought to appear in smaller neurons, because they are functional fractals of their larger cousins, meaning same functions at a smaller scale.

# "Dendritic Morphology Affects the Velocity and Amplitude of Back‑propagating Action Potentials"
back-propagating action potential (bpAP)
"The back-propagating action potential (bpAP) is crucial for neuronal signal integration and synaptic plasticity in dendritic trees. Its properties (velocity and amplitude) can be afected by dendritic morphology. "
"We found that the velocity of bpAPs was not uniform in a single dendrite, and the bpAP velocity difered among distinct dendrites 
of the same neuron."
"The velocity of a bpAP was positively correlated with the diameter of the dendrite on which it propagated." 
"In addition, when bpAPs passed through a dendritic 
branch point, their velocity decreased signifcantly."
"Similar to velocity, the amplitude of bpAPs was also positively correlated with dendritic diameter, and the attenuation patterns of bpAPs difered among diferent dendrites."
"The amplitude of a bpAP may determine the strength of subsequent postsynaptic depolarization and afect the induction of plasticity. The velocity and frequency of bpAPs  infuence the timing of postsynaptic activity and the chance of potentiation. Therefore, the properties of bpAPs have a critical infuence on the integration of synaptic input and the induction of synaptic plasticity"
"The average velocity of bpAPs in granule cell dendrites is 150 μm/ms (150 micro meters per millisecond) which is slower than their velocity in pyramidal cell apical dendrites (500 μm/ms) and basal dendrites (200 μm/ms)"
"The marked difer￾ences among bpAPs on the dendrites of diferent neuronal types inspired us to investigate the efect of morphology on bpAPs, with a focus on how the diameter and branch pattern infuence bpAP velocity and amplitude." 

# Medical Imaging Tech
"To overcome this limitation, recent studies have applied optical recording via genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) or genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators [21, 22]. Here we used a previously developed all-optical electrophysiological method using a GEVI [23] to record the membrane voltage in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons."

"The results clearly showed that the bpAP propagation velocity in dendrites fuctuated (Fig. 1H)."

"After classifying the analyzed neurons into diferent types, we found that there was no signifcant difference in the average velocities of bpAPs in pyramidal neurons (190 μm/ms) and granule cells (202 μm/ms) (Fig. 2B)."

"we designed experiments to determine whether the volume of the cell body and the number of dendrites infuences bpAP propagation."

"This fnding indicated that the volume of the cell body and the number of primary dendrites have little infuence on bpAP propagation."

"We found that 62% of dendrite pairs showed a positive correlation between the relative initial amplitude ratio and the diameter ratio, and this positive correlation became more signifcant as the diameter ratio increased (Fig. 4C). This fnding indicated that bpAPs on dendrites with rela￾tively large diameters are likely to also have relatively high amplitudes."

# "Synapse-Specific Regulation Revealed at Single Synapses Is Concealed When Recording Multiple Synapses"
"Synaptic transmission and its activity-dependent modulation, known as synaptic plasticity, are fundamental processes in nervous system function. Neurons may receive thousands of synaptic contacts, but synaptic regulation may occur only at individual or discrete subsets of synapses, which may have important consequences on the spatial extension of the modulation of synaptic information."
"We have investigated how well-known synapse-specific short-term plasticity, where some synapses are regulated and others left unregulated, mediated by astrocytes and endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling can be assessed at different observational levels."
"We show that eCB-induced depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) and astrocyte-mediated synaptic potentiation can be observed when monitoring single or few synapses, but are statistically concealed when recording the activity of a large number of synapses. These results indicate that the electrophysiological methodology is critical to properly assess synaptic changes occurring in subsets of synapses, and they suggest that relevant synapse-specific regulatory phenomena may be experimentally undetected but may have important implications in the spatial extension of synaptic plasticity phenomena."

# "Synaptic efficacy refers to the strength of communication between neurons, and mainly depends on the probability and amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic neurons and the number of postsynaptic receptors activated"
"Therefore, three parameters define synaptic transmission properties in a single synapse: the probability of neurotransmitter release, the synaptic potency (i.e., the number of postsynaptic receptors activated), and the synaptic efficacy that results from the combination of them (del Castillo and Katz, 1954; Hessler et al., 1993; Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997; Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002)."

I think this next quote adds to the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory even though it's about neurons, the principle ought to hold true for other types of cells. Meaning that the more receptors on a cell that are triggered by the same stimulus, the greater the cells response, because the cells morphological structure is inevitably going to sum up the aggregation of it's receptor activations, and that ought to effect the cells reaction (a logical prediction based on an understanding of how physics works).
"minimal stimulation activates a single fiber to observe the contained processing of a single synapse. Increasing fiber stimulation recruits synapse ensembles to study the aggregation of synapses in a cell, summing along dendritic arborization."

# "Synaptic Input and ACh Modulation Regulate Dendritic Ca2+ Spike Duration in Pyramidal Neurons, Directly Affecting Their Somatic Output" https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/7/1184
"Nonlinear synaptic integration in dendrites is a fundamental aspect of neural computation. One such key mechanism is the
Ca2+ spike at the apical tuft of pyramidal neurons. Characterized by a plateau potential sustained for tens of milliseconds,
the Ca2+ spike amplifies excitatory input, facilitates somatic action potentials (APs), and promotes synaptic plasticity."
"we explored the plateau and termination phases of the Ca2+ spike under input current perturbations,
long-step current-injections, and variations in the dendritic high-voltage-activated Ca2+ conductance (that occur during cho￾linergic modulation)."

"We found that, surprisingly, timed excitatory input can shorten the Ca2+ spike duration while inhibitory input can either elongate or terminate it. A significant elongation also occurs when the high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (CaHVA) conductance is increased"

This finding is not surprising to me because there is an inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency. Excitatory input has higher frequency, so the magnitude (amplitude & duration) ought to decrease. It is natural for an excitatory (frequency) signal to have an inhibitory (duration) effect and visa versa, an inhibitory signal (frequency) might increase duration (part of magnitude) because of the inverse relationship.

"These Ca2+ spikes generate a huge depolarization in the dendrites, which lasts for tens of milliseconds and is accompanied by a significant influx of Ca2+ ions into the cell. The dendritic depolarization associated with the Ca2+ spike often affects the somatic region and leads to a short burst of axonal APs (Leleo and Segev, 2021). Functionally, Ca2+ spikes were shown to play a central role in the transmission of higher-level top-down sig￾nals, the coupling between the soma and the apical tuft, and the modulation of synaptic plasticity "

"Because of the relatively long duration of the dendritic Ca2+ spike, various manipulations and synaptic input perturbations may alter its stereotypical voltage waveform. Thus, each of these manipulations can directly affect local plasticity, the communica￾tion between the soma and the nexus, and the overall output of the cell. "

See Figure 1 "The Ca2+ spike can be divided into three phases: (P1) initiation, (P2) plateau
potential, and (P3) termination. D, Quantification of the variability in trace shape for each

In a nut shell: individual synaptic back propagation, from another cells dendrite, or from this cells dendrite, is going to affect the Ca2+ Calcium back propagation waveform, which will affect whether the Basal & Apical Dendrites will jointly produce a coincidence detection leading to burst firing from the Soma, shooting a memory prediction back out the Apical Dendrite to other neurons, with individual messages connected to each Apical Synaptic branch, allowing for a sparsely coded memory to be upload from this one cell to the neural array defined by it's exit terminal.

# "Rapid Arrival and Integration of Ascending Sensory Information in Layer 1 Nonpyramidal Neurons and Tuft Dendrites of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons of the Neocortex" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14960597/
"Remarkably, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses is as short as ∼5-7 msec in layer 1 neurons and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In addition, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses in tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is ∼1 msec shorter than that in somata. These results indicate that ascending sensory inputs arrive in layers 1 and 4 concurrently, which provides a neural mechanism for rapid integration and coincident detection of salient sensory information."
"However, this dendritic coincident detection mechanism requires the concurrent arrival of sensory inputs in layers 1 and 4 which is contradictory to the customary view that sensory inputs to layer 1 are relayed primarily by the secondary sensory ascending system, in which neurons respond to tactile stimuli and convey information sluggishly"

The fact that the thalamus routes information to multiple layers simultaneously is explained with the need for multi-layer dendritic coincidence detection (dendrites have a leaky membrane, so signals have to arrive within a short time window, or all at once, to trigger the cell to fire)

# Neuroelectric Tuning of Cortical Oscillations by Apical Dendrites in Loop Circuits https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00037/full

"Many layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons are connected to thalamic neurons in loop circuits"

"It is proposed that a major function of the apical dendrite is to produce sustained oscillations at a specific frequency that can serve as a common timing unit for the processing of information in circuits connected to that apical dendrite."

"Synchronous pulse outputs from the circuit loops containing apical dendrites can tune subthreshold membrane oscillations of neurons they contact. When the pulse outputs are finely tuned, they function as a local “clock,” which enables the contacted neurons to synchronously communicate with each other. Thus, a shared tuning frequency can select neurons for membership in a circuit. Unlike layer 6 apical dendrites, layer 5 apical dendrites can produce burst firing in many of their neurons, which increases the amplitude of signals in the neurons they contact. This difference in amplitude of signals serves as basis of selecting a sub-circuit for specialized processing (e.g., sustained attention) within the typically larger layer 6-based circuit. After examining the sustaining of oscillations in loop circuits and the processing of spikes in network circuits, we propose that cortical functioning can be globally viewed as two systems: a loop system and a network system. The loop system oscillations influence the network system’s timing and amplitude of pulse signals, both of which can select circuits that are momentarily dominant in cortical activity."

"The prevailing view of the main function of the apical and basal dendrites of a pyramidal neuron is the integration of incoming electric pulses at the tens of thousands of synapses which dot the dendrite surface (e.g., Häusser et al., 2000; Spruston, 2008) The result of this integration is a train of output pulses in the single axon which exits at the base of the soma."

It exits the base of the Soma to the Apical Dendrite right???

"Here, we propose that a major function of the long apical dendrite in pyramidal neurons is the production of a stable oscillation at a specific frequency."

"When apical dendrites in corticothalamic loops oscillate, their oscillations are copied to networks of pyramidal neurons, and all network pyramidal neurons that are contacted will oscillate at a common carrier frequency into which messages of temporally coded spikes may be inserted."

"Only neurons whose membranes oscillate at the specific carrier frequency will accept the spike signals: spike signals carried on other frequencies will be blocked."

This confirms for me the concept I have that the synchronously oscillating group is learning together, and that oscillatory synching between different oscillating groups is how the brain relates information to other parts of the brain, the concept that I said was similar to Neuropype technology (by Intheon CEO Tim Mullen) relating unstructured heart data to unstructured eeg data, or any kind of sensor stream data with a time code. I think the brain works the same way and this note seems like evidence for the idea.

One of my general arguments seems to be that the function of synchronous oscillations can be compared to the function of noising in a Stable Diffusion neural network. It's allowing the neural network of the brain to absorb the high phasic spikes across the oscillating cell assembly, so each cell is learning it's own variation on the received pattern, each cell is capable of participating in a learned sequence recall that involves many cells firing across many layers of cortex inside a cortical column, or across cortical columns in the regional networks that span multiple cortical columns & the thalamus.

"The corticothalamic loops operate as a clock in a computer, which assures that electric signals in different locations within a connected circuit of neurons change at the same time. In the present theory, different bundles of apical dendrites can oscillate at different frequencies, and therefore their connected circuits of neurons can run on different clocks."

The main concept of NAPOT applied to phase changes between large oscillating groups basically amounts to changes in the clock speed of one corticalthalamic loop, that is absorbed by the rest of the cortical thalamic loops, via the physics of oscillation, and those differences in clock speed are the phase changes created by the aggregrates of phase wave spiking, and this is how signalling works at the macroscopic scale in the brain between large clusters of oscillating cell assemblies.

The medial or mesoscopic brain activity is about how layers of neural circuits within cortical columns & within the hippocampus talk to each other.

"The axons of pyramidal neurons of layers 2 and 3 form an information bridge from one minicolumn to other minicolumns at locations both near and far. Axons of layer 5 pyramids contact minicolumns near and far, so that oscillations of the long apical dendrites positioned vertically at the center of a minicolumn can be synchronized with oscillations of neurons throughout a broad network of neurons. When membranes of network neurons oscillate in synchrony the wave peaks of these oscillations are separated by a constant time interval; so it can be said that these neurons bind together and “talk to each other” (Fries, 2005, 2015; Womelsdorf et al., 2007)."

"To summarize this section, the oscillations of layer 5 and 6 apical dendrites drive the output pulses of their pyramidal axons, which are copied to the thalamus and sent back to the same apical dendrite, forming a loop circuit. The thalamic axon also sends these pulses to other neurons to which it is connected, some located nearby, some located remotely. In this manner, oscillations of the same frequency as those in the initiating apical dendrites can be spread across the cortex."

"The modeling of oscillations at any given location along the apical dendrite is represented theoretically by a distribution of resonance frequencies, which is visually depicted as a resonance profile. Two features of the profile are evident and of main interest: its peak and its spread. The peak frequency of the resonance profile is customarily called the resonant frequency. As it is most generally used, the term resonance denotes the ability of a system to oscillate most strongly at a particular frequency. It may be noted that the existence of resonance in this biophysical model does not require inductance, in contrast with most classical electrical circuitry that is tuned to a specific frequency."

"Both the peak resonance frequency and the progressive narrowing process are assumed to be influenced by many features of the membrane, but chief among these features is the inward flow of positive sodium ions by spines, the consequent outward flow of positive potassium ions around the spines, the passive outflow of potassium ions by the leak current, and to a lesser extent the activities of many other types of channels in the dendritic membrane. The initial surge of charge consists of action potentials which are delivered by a thalamic axon at the top of the apical dendrite"

"Thus, the present model predicts that the rate of outward potassium flow through the apical dendrite membrane determines the peak frequency of the dendrite’s oscillations."

^ This quote above is consistent with NAPOT theory about the role of potassium changing the magnitude & it's inverse which is the frequency (because magnitude & frequency have an inverse relationship)

# Medical Imaging tech note:

"Measurements of these oscillations can be obtained from the local electric field potentials that they produce; and as the field potentials of clusters (bundles) of thousands of apical dendrites radiate to the scalp their combined voltage can be measured as EEGs."

ie EEG Electroencephalogram electrodes on your scalp are detecting voltages from the electric dipoles (that represent the combined voltages of thousands of invidual apical dendrites.)

"Peak Frequency as a Function of Rate of Ion Outflow
Four equally spaced frequencies in the 0–100 Hz range were selected, 20, 40, 60, and 80 Hz, and the outward flow of potassium ions, gr, was calculated for each frequency using Equation [1] of Kasevich and LaBerge (2011), which is based on a single compartment. Iterative calculations converged to a value of gr that maximized the energy transfer from one compartment to the next compartment. Appropriate geometric parameters of the underlying leaky cable theory and electrical parameters of the membrane were obtained from the relevant literature and entered into Equation [12] of the Kasevich and LaBerge (2011) study."

"The measure of energy transfer was transfer impedance. The relationship between the obtained gr conductance and each of the four frequency points is graphed in Figure 6."

See figure 6 in the above link (in the title) "FIGURE 6. Simulated relationship of profile peak frequency as a function of the rate of outward conductance of potassium ions. The obtained outward potassium conductances were 105, 310, 627, and 1056 nS for the curves with peaks at 20, 40, 60, and 80 Hz, respectively. The resonant frequency in radians per second is approximately the radial conductance divided by the radial capacitance. For a constant radial capacitance the peak frequency is directly proportional to the potassium ion leak conductance. [Adapted from Kasevich and LaBerge (2011)]."

# ^ This means that the amount of potassium ions in the neuron when the action potential fires determines the frequency that neuron will create
"20 (Beta), 40 (Gamma), 60 (Gamma), and 80 (high Gamma) Hz"

(note the frequency of muscle movement 20–300 Hz)

"If we assume that neural noise at each synapse, on average, adds a constant amount of impedance (opposition) for each frequency across the 1–100 Hz range, then each synapse will dampen or flatten the shape of the oscillation frequency profile."

An observation consistent with the NAPOT concept that oscillatory synchrony is noising (the opposite of denoising) and absorbing high phasic bursts through oscillatory dissipation of the high phasic (action potential or action potential burst sequence) phase wave differential.

"While every cycle of the corticothalamic circuit adds noise to flatten the shape of the profile curve, the next cascade through the apical dendrite compartments narrows the shape of the profile."

An observation consistent with the NAPOT theory regarding modelling each high phasic action potential as a tensor in a Taylor Series, that can learn a curve or a shape as signals are passed through successive neural arrays.

"Therefore, increasing the number of compartments in the apical dendrite provides a means for effectively offsetting the synaptic noise in the corticothalamic circuit.

"Hence, longer apical dendrites (e.g., in primates) should produce more narrow frequency profiles, while very short apical dendrites (e.g., in mice) should show a limit on the narrowness of the resonance profile. For a comparison of apical dendrite lengths of layer 5 and layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons across five mammalian species see Figure 1 in LaBerge (2005)."
