"Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites" 

"Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer
1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas."

"We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including

1. generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition
"Inhibitory control of calcium electrogenesis. Dendritic inhibition has been shown to
powerfully block dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Buzsa´ki et al., 1996; Miles et al., 1996; Pe´rez-Garci et al., 2006; Larkum et al., 2007; Murayama et al., 2009)."

2. voltage-dependent support of backpropagating action potentials

3. timing-dependent dendritic integration

4. distally located Ih channels

5. frequency-dependent Ca2+ spike activation

6. NMDA spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite.

"Corticocortical versus corticothalamic neurons. L6 pyramidal neurons can be divided into two categories based on the projection of their axonal arborizations: corticothalamic (CT) and corticocortical (CC) projecting neurons (Zhang and Desche`nes, 1997; Kumar and"
