# "Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites" 

"Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer
1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas."

"We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including

1. generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition
"Inhibitory control of calcium electrogenesis. Dendritic inhibition has been shown to
powerfully block dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Buzsa´ki et al., 1996; Miles et al., 1996; Pe´rez-Garci et al., 2006; Larkum et al., 2007; Murayama et al., 2009)."

2. voltage-dependent support of backpropagating action potentials

3. timing-dependent dendritic integration

4. distally located Ih channels

5. frequency-dependent Ca2+ spike activation

6. NMDA spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite.

"Corticocortical versus corticothalamic neurons. L6 pyramidal neurons can be divided into two categories based on the projection of their axonal arborizations: corticothalamic (CT) and corticocortical (CC) projecting neurons (Zhang and Desche`nes, 1997; Kumar and"

# "Physiology of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex: Coincidence Detection through Bursting" 2015

"L5 pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical cell type with dendrites reaching all six layers of cortex, casting them as one of the main integrators in the cortical column."

"100 tuft and 175 basal NMDA/AMPA synapses are distributed randomly across the apical tuft and basal dendrites of a multi-compartmental L5 pyramidal neuron model."
"(b) Simultaneous tuft and basal inputs triggers a burst of somatic APs and a dendritic Ca2+ spike
"(c) basal inputs alone evoke only a single" somatic spike."
"(d) Apical tuft inputs alone do not evoke somatic spiking"

An interesting thought about the cyclic nature of Layer 5 pyramidal cells, is the idea that the process of the dendrite being a sensor, like an eyeball or an ear appears to apply to both sides of the neuron, on the way in, and on the way out. So the Apical dendrite, as a neural network, is learning from incoming sensor stimulus, but the Soma burst is one of the incoming sensor stimulai, with models of soma burst waveforms becoming part of what the Apical Dendrite has to contend with.

I think of it as like the basal dendrite is learning to respond selectively to certain patterns, the apical is learning what patterns it responds to.

My intuition is that the apical is learning it's own cell's response's, and through feedback loops, with itself and with other pyramidal neurons the cell is going to make predictions about it's own patterns of causation, what patterns it responds & how it reacts or responds. With the Apical Dendrite perhaps symbolizing a more complex response that is connected to more complex learning. (compared to other types of neurons)

The fact that bursting (bursts of somatic AP) results from the coincident activity of basal + apical, but not from either one separately is a different coincidence detection mechanism from the leaky integrate-and fire model of a neuron which explores coincident synaptic inputs, leading to coincident dendritic activity, which leads to the phasic action potential from just the south side of the Soma.

In the leaky integrate & fire neurons, and the Hodgkin & Huxley Model there is very little thought to the concept of the Soma burst spiking being a coincidence detection from both sides of the neuron. But if it's true for Layer 5 pyramid cells, then we ought to know if there is a greater role for the exit terminal in all other types of neurons.

So perhaps we can think of the axon, with it's different types of action potentials, different durations (wave shapes, magnitudes), and different burst rates, as a analogous to a lens, a lense that is creating a summation signal that the exit terminal is learning as it's learned response.

The idea is that our sensory inputs are sort of encoded in the input dendrite (or the basal dendrite) and our motor outputs are sort of encoded in the exit terminal (the Apical dendrite), and through cyclic looping activity our input learning (sensory in the bottom dendrite) is being mapped to our output learning (motor in the output exit terminal, or the Apical Dendrite)

So every neuron represents an actor, one that learns to respond selectively to certain patterns, and encodes in it's exit a response action.

The meaning of the main somatic signal is like the summary pattern of what the dendrite (basal) has detected, a magnitude + a frequency rate, and the exit or Apical is more about having a highly coordinate response.

It's interesting that a place field, in place cells, can begin with a somatic spike. (see note b0232y on behavioral time synaptic plasticity) but it results in burst firing the next time the organism encounters the same place. Perhaps that first spike comes from the Dendrite, and then the Exit Terminal learns to predict it, based on the wave shape (duration & frequency), so that the exit terminal is sending it's prediction backwards, a back propagation spike, at the same time that the mouse encounters that same place again. That would make both sides of the neuron like timers, timers that learn when they are going to fire, and the dendrite is learning a pattern, encoding it in a timer signal at the axon, with the exit terminal learning the different timing signals, and responding with it's own backpropagting signals, to create burst spiking that leads to an organism taking actions based on it's memories.

"This line of research has shown that pyramidal neurons in different cortical regions contain voltage-gated Na+ channels along the dendritic trunk which support the backpropagation of action potentials (APs) from the soma into dendrites [6], as well as voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that support spiking in the apical dendrite"

"Using a detailed multi-compartmental model, we show this physiological setup to be well suited for coincidence detection between basal and apical tuft inputs by controlling the frequency of spike output. We further show how direct inhibition of calcium channels in the dendrites modulates such coincidence detection."

"Because past studies have found that dendritic electrogenesis depends on calcium channels in the apical dendrites, and that sag and dendritic resting potential and input resistance is dependent on Ih conductance, we were able to manipulate only dendritic calcium and Ih conductance parameters, by hand, to fit to our experimental results."

1. Coincidence detection between basal & apical dendrites via the frequency of the spike output.
2. Synaptic Efficacy: Inhibiting calcium channels modulates the coincidence detection between the basal & apical dendrites.
3. This is going to allow for multi-second pattern learning. Or Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) in the cortical columns of the neocortex. I share notes about the documentation of BTSP in the hippocampus in note a0232z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md

I've read about back propaganding action potentials from the post synaptic membrane (traveling backwards) to the presynaptic membrane. That's where the idea of individual synapses being up regulated or down regulated might be like setting up the individual letters of a printing press (the old fashioned kind that prints newspapers) with the action potential event printing that pattern to it's exit terminal network, or the receiving neural array.

"We find that mouse L5 pyramidal neurons in V1 support backpropagating action potentials (bAPs), and dendritic Ca2+ spiking."

However the combination of the research on BTSP in the Hippocampus, with back propaganding action potentials from the Apical dendrite towards the soma in Cortical Columns is for me a new mechanism of coincidence detection across the whole brain, and it ought to lead to studies that explore whether much smaller neurons also have burst spiking that is triggered by the combination of back propagating signals from the exit terminal direction + forward propaganding signals from the dendrite that represents sensory input. This is not the Hodgkin & Huxley model of neuron. It's not the leaky integrate & fire neuron, or perhaps I ought to say it is more than the classic model of neural firing.

"We show how concurrent input into the perisomatic and electrically remote apical tuft regions switches somatic action potential output from low to high frequency. Thus, high frequency bursting indicates coincident input into different parts of the dendritic structure."

"We further explore regulation of this coincidence detection scheme by blockage of the voltage-gated calcium channels on which this computational principle depends on. We ultimately show that such single-cell computation can be conceptualized as a composite of sigmoid functions."

"A phenomenological model"
"To conceptually address the single-neuron computation that this biophysical setup performs, we establish a phenomenological model. We compare three models: a composite, multiplicative, and an additive model"
"Each of these models uses two sigmoidal functions to perform intermediate computations, and is justified by the existence of the two separate (one dendritic and one somatic) spiking zones in the neuron."
"The interaction of the sigmoids in the composite model is justified by the experimental results suggesting that the result of dendritic electrogenesis is to lower the threshold for a high-frequency burst at the soma."
"The multiplicative and additive models have two independent sigmoids, one of which takes tuft (apical) synapses as input, and the other which takes basal synapses as input. "
"The composite model outperforms both the multiplicative and additive models, though less so when Ca2+ conductance is decreased by 75%, suggesting that the inability of the multiplicative and additive models to represent the input-output relationship depends on dendritic electrogenesis"
"The effect of tuft input (The Apical Dendrite or Exit Terminal) is to increase the maximum possible output frequency (Fig. 5D left) and decrease the threshold of basal input needed to elicit high frequency firing (Fig. 5D right)."
"Thus, the sigmoid that relates tuft input to burst-firing threshold is decreasing (since more tuft input decreases that threshold, Fig. 5A red sigmoid), while the sigmoid that relates tuft input to somatic output frequency is increasing (since more tuft input increases the output frequency, Fig. 5A blue sigmoid)."
"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

Should we multiple two sigmoids (from both sides of the neuron) together, should we add two sigmoids each representing (inputs from each of two sides of the neuron together, or should we have a single sigmoid that composite that is modified on each end?

"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

"How might such single cell computation be involved in visual processing? To explore tuning properties of cells employing a variety of mechanisms, we used circular distributions (von Mises distributions, see Methods and Fig. 6 and S5) to model inputs as a function of stimulus orientation. We compared four different mechanisms (Fig. 6A). A composite sigmoid as described previously, a purely multiplicative where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply multiplied to arrive at output, a purely additive, where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply added to arrive at output, and a single sigmoid mechanism, where either the tuft or the basal input is put through a sigmoid function to arrive at the output."
