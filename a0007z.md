"Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites" 

"Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer
1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas."

"We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including

1. generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition
"Inhibitory control of calcium electrogenesis. Dendritic inhibition has been shown to
powerfully block dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Buzsa´ki et al., 1996; Miles et al., 1996; Pe´rez-Garci et al., 2006; Larkum et al., 2007; Murayama et al., 2009)."

2. voltage-dependent support of backpropagating action potentials

3. timing-dependent dendritic integration

4. distally located Ih channels

5. frequency-dependent Ca2+ spike activation

6. NMDA spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite.

"Corticocortical versus corticothalamic neurons. L6 pyramidal neurons can be divided into two categories based on the projection of their axonal arborizations: corticothalamic (CT) and corticocortical (CC) projecting neurons (Zhang and Desche`nes, 1997; Kumar and"

"100 tuft and 175 basal NMDA/AMPA synapses are distributed randomly across the apical tuft and basal dendrites of a multi-compartmental L5 pyramidal neuron model."
"(b) Simultaneous tuft and basal inputs triggers a burst of somatic APs and a dendritic Ca2+ spike
"(c) basal inputs alone evoke only a single" somatic spike."
"(d) Apical tuft inputs alone do not evoke somatic spiking"

An interesting thought about the cyclic nature of Layer 5 pyramidal cells, is the idea that the process of the dendrite being a sensor, like an eyeball or an ear appears to apply to both sides of the neuron, on the way in, and on the way out. So the Apical dendrite, as a neural network, is learning from incoming sensor stimulus, but the Soma burst is one of the incoming sensor stimulai, with models of soma burst waveforms becoming part of what the Apical Dendrite has to contend with.

I think of it as like the basal dendrite is learning to respond selectively to certain patterns, the apical is learning what patterns it responds to.

My intuition is that the apical is learning it's responds, and through feedback loops, with itself and with other pyramidal neurons the cell is going to make predictions about it's own patterns of causation, what patterns it responds & how it reacts or responds. With the Apical Dendrite perhaps symbolizing a more complex response that is connected to more complex learning. (compared to other types of neurons)

The fact that bursting (bursts of somatic AP) results from the coincident activity of basal + apical, but not from either one separately is a different coincidence detection mechanism from the leaky integrate-and fire model of a neuron which explores coincident synaptic inputs, leading to coincident dendritic activity, which leads to the phasic action potential from just the south side of the Soma.

In the leaky integrate & fire neurons, and the Hodgkin & Huxley Model there is very little thought to the concept of the Soma burst spiking being a coincidence detection from both sides of the neuron. But if it's true for Layer 5 pyramid cells, then we ought to know if there is a greater role for the exit terminal in all other types of neurons.

So perhaps we can think of the axon, with it's different types of action potentials, different durations (wave shapes, magnitudes), and different burst rates, as a analogous to a lens, a lense that is creating a summation signal that the exit terminal is learning as it's learned response.

The idea is that our sensory inputs are sort of encoded in the input dendrite (or the basal dendrite) and our motor outputs are sort of encoded in the exit terminal (the Apical dendrite), and through cyclic looping activity our input learning (sensory in the bottom dendrite) is being mapped to our output learning (motor in the output exit terminal, or the Apical Dendrite)

So every neuron represents an actor, one that learns to respond selectively to certain patterns, and encodes in it's exit a response action.

The meaning of the main somatic signal is like the summary pattern of what the dendrite (basal) has detected, a magnitude + a frequency rate, and the exit or Apical is more about having a highly coordinate response.

It's interesting that a place field, in place cells, can begin with a somatic spike. (see note b0232y on behavioral time synaptic plasticity) but it results in burst firing the next time the organism encounters the same place. Perhaps that first spike comes from the Dendrite, and then the Exit Terminal learns to predict it, based on the wave shape (duration & frequency), so that the exit terminal is sending it's prediction backwards, a back propagation spike, at the same time that the mouse encounters that same place again. That would make both sides of the neuron like timers, timers that learn when they are going to fire, and the dendrite is learning a pattern, encoding it in a timer signal at the axon, with the exit terminal learning the different timing signals, and responding with it's own backpropagting signals, to create burst spiking that leads to an organism taking actions based on it's memories.
