Dendritric morphologies & synaptic connections represent learned memories. Memories activate when preferred patterns (the memory) are detected, this causes cells to create a selective transmission or a projection to other cells (neural arrays). In this note I am looking at Layer 6 & Layer 5 Pyramidal cells, to learn how the Apical Dendrite, or the Exit Terminal, is contributing to the rendered projection of that learned memory to the rest of it's network. The main idea that I am exploring is that the signal transmitted from the exit terminal is not uniform along all branches, but instead is modified synapses by synapse, and that the memories in the exit terminal also transmit backwards to play a role in multiple seconds long coincidence detections involving back propagating action potentials from the exit terminal or Apical Dendrite to the Soma, that when combined with the Basal or sensory input dendrite can cause a coincidence detection that creates a special type of action potential event called burst firing.

# "Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites" 

"Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer
1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas."

"We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including

1. generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition
"Inhibitory control of calcium electrogenesis. Dendritic inhibition has been shown to
powerfully block dendritic Ca2+ electrogenesis in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Buzsa´ki et al., 1996; Miles et al., 1996; Pe´rez-Garci et al., 2006; Larkum et al., 2007; Murayama et al., 2009)."

3. timing-dependent dendritic integration

4. distally located Ih channels

5. frequency-dependent Ca2+ spike activation

6. NMDA spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite.

"Corticocortical versus corticothalamic neurons. L6 pyramidal neurons can be divided into two categories based on the projection of their axonal arborizations: corticothalamic (CT) and corticocortical (CC) projecting neurons (Zhang and Desche`nes, 1997; Kumar and"

# "Physiology of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex: Coincidence Detection through Bursting" 2015

"L5 pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical cell type with dendrites reaching all six layers of cortex, casting them as one of the main integrators in the cortical column."

"100 tuft and 175 basal NMDA/AMPA synapses are distributed randomly across the apical tuft and basal dendrites of a multi-compartmental L5 pyramidal neuron model."
"(b) Simultaneous tuft and basal inputs triggers a burst of somatic APs and a dendritic Ca2+ spike
"(c) basal inputs alone evoke only a single" somatic spike."
"(d) Apical tuft inputs alone do not evoke somatic spiking"

An interesting thought about the cyclic nature of Layer 5 pyramidal cells, is the idea that the process of the dendrite being a sensor, like an eyeball or an ear appears to apply to both sides of the neuron, on the way in, and on the way out. So the Apical dendrite, as a neural network, is learning from incoming sensor stimulus, but the Soma burst is one of the incoming sensor stimulai, with models of soma burst waveforms becoming part of what the Apical Dendrite has to contend with.

I think of it as like the basal dendrite is learning to respond selectively to certain patterns, the apical is learning what patterns it responds to.

My intuition is that the apical is learning it's own cell's response's, and through feedback loops, with itself and with other pyramidal neurons the cell is going to make predictions about it's own patterns of causation, what patterns it responds & how it reacts or responds. With the Apical Dendrite perhaps symbolizing a more complex response that is connected to more complex learning. (compared to other types of neurons)

The fact that bursting (bursts of somatic AP) results from the coincident activity of basal + apical, but not from either one separately is a different coincidence detection mechanism from the leaky integrate-and fire model of a neuron which explores coincident synaptic inputs, leading to coincident dendritic activity, which leads to the phasic action potential from just the south side of the Soma.

In the leaky integrate & fire neurons, and the Hodgkin & Huxley Model there is very little thought to the concept of the Soma burst spiking being a coincidence detection from both sides of the neuron. But if it's true for Layer 5 pyramid cells, then we ought to know if there is a greater role for the exit terminal in all other types of neurons.

So perhaps we can think of the axon, with it's different types of action potentials, different durations (wave shapes, magnitudes), and different burst rates, as a analogous to a lens, a lense that is creating a summation signal that the exit terminal is learning as it's learned response.

The idea is that our sensory inputs are sort of encoded in the input dendrite (or the basal dendrite) and our motor outputs are sort of encoded in the exit terminal (the Apical dendrite), and through cyclic looping activity our input learning (sensory in the bottom dendrite) is being mapped to our output learning (motor in the output exit terminal, or the Apical Dendrite)

So every neuron represents an actor, one that learns to respond selectively to certain patterns, and encodes in it's exit a response action.

The meaning of the main somatic signal is like the summary pattern of what the dendrite (basal) has detected, a magnitude + a frequency rate, and the exit or Apical is more about having a highly coordinate response.

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md

It's interesting that a place field, in place cells, can begin with a somatic spike. (see note b0232y on behavioral time synaptic plasticity) but it results in burst firing the next time the organism encounters the same place. Perhaps that first spike comes from the Dendrite, and then the Exit Terminal learns to predict it, based on the wave shape (duration & frequency), so that the exit terminal is sending it's prediction backwards, a back propagation spike, at the same time that the mouse encounters that same place again. That would make both sides of the neuron like timers, timers that learn when they are going to fire, and the dendrite is learning a pattern, encoding it in a timer signal at the axon, with the exit terminal learning the different timing signals, and responding with it's own backpropagting signals, to create burst spiking that leads to an organism taking actions based on it's memories.

"This line of research has shown that pyramidal neurons in different cortical regions contain voltage-gated Na+ channels along the dendritic trunk which support the backpropagation of action potentials (APs) from the soma into dendrites [6], as well as voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that support spiking in the apical dendrite"

"Using a detailed multi-compartmental model, we show this physiological setup to be well suited for coincidence detection between basal and apical tuft inputs by controlling the frequency of spike output. We further show how direct inhibition of calcium channels in the dendrites modulates such coincidence detection."

"Because past studies have found that dendritic electrogenesis depends on calcium channels in the apical dendrites, and that sag and dendritic resting potential and input resistance is dependent on Ih conductance, we were able to manipulate only dendritic calcium and Ih conductance parameters, by hand, to fit to our experimental results."

1. Coincidence detection between basal & apical dendrites via the frequency of the spike output.
2. Synaptic Efficacy: Inhibiting calcium channels modulates the coincidence detection between the basal & apical dendrites.
3. This is going to allow for multi-second pattern learning. Or Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) in the cortical columns of the neocortex. I share notes about the documentation of BTSP in the hippocampus in note a0232z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md

I've read about back propaganding action potentials from the post synaptic membrane (traveling backwards) to the presynaptic membrane. That's where the idea of individual synapses being up regulated or down regulated might be like setting up the individual letters of a printing press (the old fashioned kind that prints newspapers) with the action potential event printing that pattern to it's exit terminal network, or the receiving neural array.

"We find that mouse L5 pyramidal neurons in V1 support backpropagating action potentials (bAPs), and dendritic Ca2+ spiking."

However the combination of the research on BTSP in the Hippocampus, with back propaganding action potentials from the Apical dendrite towards the soma in Cortical Columns is for me a new mechanism of coincidence detection across the whole brain, and it ought to lead to studies that explore whether much smaller neurons also have burst spiking that is triggered by the combination of back propagating signals from the exit terminal direction + forward propaganding signals from the dendrite that represents sensory input. This is not the Hodgkin & Huxley model of neuron. It's not the leaky integrate & fire neuron, or perhaps I ought to say it is more than the classic model of neural firing.

"We show how concurrent input into the perisomatic and electrically remote apical tuft regions switches somatic action potential output from low to high frequency. Thus, high frequency bursting indicates coincident input into different parts of the dendritic structure."

"We further explore regulation of this coincidence detection scheme by blockage of the voltage-gated calcium channels on which this computational principle depends on. We ultimately show that such single-cell computation can be conceptualized as a composite of sigmoid functions."

"A phenomenological model"
"To conceptually address the single-neuron computation that this biophysical setup performs, we establish a phenomenological model. We compare three models: a composite, multiplicative, and an additive model"
"Each of these models uses two sigmoidal functions to perform intermediate computations, and is justified by the existence of the two separate (one dendritic and one somatic) spiking zones in the neuron."
"The interaction of the sigmoids in the composite model is justified by the experimental results suggesting that the result of dendritic electrogenesis is to lower the threshold for a high-frequency burst at the soma."
"The multiplicative and additive models have two independent sigmoids, one of which takes tuft (apical) synapses as input, and the other which takes basal synapses as input. "
"The composite model outperforms both the multiplicative and additive models, though less so when Ca2+ conductance is decreased by 75%, suggesting that the inability of the multiplicative and additive models to represent the input-output relationship depends on dendritic electrogenesis"
"The effect of tuft input (The Apical Dendrite or Exit Terminal) is to increase the maximum possible output frequency (Fig. 5D left) and decrease the threshold of basal input needed to elicit high frequency firing (Fig. 5D right)."
"Thus, the sigmoid that relates tuft input to burst-firing threshold is decreasing (since more tuft input decreases that threshold, Fig. 5A red sigmoid), while the sigmoid that relates tuft input to somatic output frequency is increasing (since more tuft input increases the output frequency, Fig. 5A blue sigmoid)."
"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

Should we multiple two sigmoids (from both sides of the neuron) together, should we add two sigmoids each representing (inputs from each of two sides of the neuron together, or should we have a single sigmoid that composite that is modified on each end?

"The composite model describes a coincidence detector between basal and tuft input, since only when both input streams are active in sufficient amounts is the resultant output high frequency."

"How might such single cell computation be involved in visual processing? To explore tuning properties of cells employing a variety of mechanisms, we used circular distributions (von Mises distributions, see Methods and Fig. 6 and S5) to model inputs as a function of stimulus orientation. We compared four different mechanisms (Fig. 6A). A composite sigmoid as described previously, a purely multiplicative where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply multiplied to arrive at output, a purely additive, where the number of tuft and basal inputs are simply added to arrive at output, and a single sigmoid mechanism, where either the tuft or the basal input is put through a sigmoid function to arrive at the output."

# "Coincidence Detection in Pyramidal Neurons Is Tuned by Their Dendritic Branching Pattern" https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00046.2003.

This study (link & name above) backs my assertion that a memory is both the synaptic connections, and the dendritic morphology (an assertion found in the NAPOT Whitepaper as well as other places.)

(from the above study) "Is morphological variation a bug that arises from intrinsic biological variability or a feature that extends the computational capabilities of a neuron?"

(from the above study)  "We conclude that variation in dendritic arborization may be a key determinant of variability in coupling (49 
17%; range 19–83%; n  37) and is likely to outweigh the contribution made by variations in active membrane properties. Thus coincidence detection of inputs arriving from different cortical layers is strongly regulated by differences in dendritic arborization."

Dendritic arborization (or dendritic morphology) is one of the ways neurons selectively tune into certain criteria for memory-prediction while ignoring other criteria (the components of patterns).

This goes back to the question of how a ganglian neuron in the eyeball is able to selectively respond to only patterns that move from left to right, and not patterns that move from right to left or from top to bottom or bottom to top for example. The dendritic morphology means that patterns triggered from the left to the right arrive together in time to trigger that neuron to fire. That is what led me to the concept of HOW the dendritic morpology, along with synaptic connections, both their location & quantity define LTP in the physical morphology of the cell. This concept contributed to my "Neurons are transmitting their shapes" theory in 2014 that I shared on social media via an alias, but you can find in not a0008z

# Visual Responses of Ganglion Cells https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11550/

"Different cells become selectively tuned to detect surprisingly subtle "features" of the visual scene, including color, size, and direction and speed of motion. These are called "trigger features"."

# "On Contrast Sensitivity Functions and the Difference of Gaussians Receptive Field Model"
""Contrast" is the difference in brightness between the light and dark phases of the pattern. In this receptive field characterization, contrast is reduced until the ganglion cell just barely responds to the introduction of such a stimulus into a featureless field. This is the threshold. The process is then repeated for patterns with different bar widths, or "spatial frequencies" (the reciprocal of the number of bright- and dark bar-pairs per unit distance). The sensitivities (the reciprocals of contrast thresholds) are plotted as a function of spatial frequency. The net result is a curve (Fig. 8), which demonstrates that in ganglion cells there is an optimal spatial frequency of stimulation."

# "On Directionally Selective Ganglion Cells"
"Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells respond to stimuli moving in a preferred direction and are inhibited by stimuli moving in the opposite or null direction."
"In addition to a preferred direction of movement these cells have preferred speeds of movement, some prefer slow movements, whereas others prefer rapid movements."
"Directionally selective ganglion cells, stained after microelectrode recordings, have a distinctive dendritic morphology with many apparently closed, or nearly closed, loops, giving the appearance of anastimosing dendrites (Fig. 13, Fig. 14). ON-OFF directionally selective ganglion cells are bistratified in the inner plexiform layer (Fig. 13), whereas ON-type directionally selective cells are monostratified, close to ganglion cell bodies (Fig. 14). None of these morphological features hints at the orientation of the null/preferred axis, however."

# "On Color and Spectral Responses"
"Ganglion cells respond to colored stimuli in one of two ways: color opponent responses and luminance responses. "
"Goldfish are an animal model with color vision and have provided much information on the way in which vertebrate retinas process color."
"In this animal, it was first realized that individual cones express only one each of three genomically available cone photopigment types (colloquially, red, green, or blue cones; technically, long (L), mid (M), or short (S) wavelength types). This supported at least part of Thomas Young's (48) 19th century "trichromatic" theory of color vision. "

# "Tonic and Phasic Ganglion Cells of Primate Retina"
"Tonic cells of the parvocellular pathway respond best to stimuli with high contrast and fine grain, whereas phasic cells respond to stimuli with very weak contrast, covering larger areas (58)."
"Tonic cells respond to light stimuli in a steady maintained manner. Receptive field centers are extremely small, about 15 μm on the retinal surface (~4' of arc, about 10 cm at 100-m distance). Tonic cells are often called "midgets" because they probably represent recordings of midget ganglion cells described by Polyak (54) (see below). They occur with a density distribution across the retina comparable to, anatomically, midget cells (55)."

"Phasic responses originate with morphologically larger ganglion cell types with fast optic nerve fiber conduction velocities (~4 m/s) (56)." 

# "X and Y Receptive Fields"
"One of the assumptions of the DOG model (18) is that ganglion cells linearly add signals from both center and surround mechanisms for all points in space. This suggested that ganglion cells be tested for spatial linearity. Some cells (X-cells) pass the test, whereas others (Y-cells) do not, despite the fact that all receptive field data are well represented by the DOG model."

"In Fig. 11, impulse firing rate is shown for different positions (or spatial phase) of the sine wave stimulus with respect to the receptive field center. To change the spatial phase, the pattern is shifted right and left by incremental amounts. For the X-cell (Fig. 9A), when the pattern is positioned so that the transition from light to dark passes directly through the center of the field, a "null response" is produced. Introduction of the stimulus produces no effect on firing rate. The tendency of the bright bars to excite the cell is exactly compensated by the tendencies of the dark bars to reduce the firing rate."

# "Ganglion Cells That Are Involved in the Circadian Clock"
"Certain large-field, sparsely-branching ganglion cell types are known to project to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain (Fig. 49). The latter nucleus is the primary circadian oscillator in mammals and is essentially the biological clock, allowing reseting of bodily functions to local time. The ganglion cells involved in entraining the circadian clock project from the eye to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) (Fig. 48). They apparently contain the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PCAP), as well as glutamate."

# "THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIRECTION-SELECTIVE RETINAL GANGLION CELLS BY JINYUE LIU"

"Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (DSGC)"
"Starburst Amacrine Cells (SAC)"
"The ON-OFF DSGCs (ooDSGCs) each detect motion in one of four cardinal axes"
"the ON DSGCs detect movement in the dorsal, ventral and nasal directions"

"By correlating physiological responses of each ooDSGC with structural evidence, from serial block-face electron microscopy, of putative synapses on these same cells, they showed that the SACs on the null side of ooDSGCs make more inhibitory synapses onto ooDSGC dendrites compared to SACs on the preferred side. In particular, individual SAC dendrites that are oriented antiparallel to the null direction of the ooDSGC contribute to the majority of these inhibitory synapses (fig.10). Hence, an increase in the number of SAC-ooDSGC inhibitory synapses, rather than the strength of individual ones, accounts for the direction-selective responses of ooDSGCs."

An increase in the number of inhibitory synapses, rather than the strength of individual synapses, accounts for direction selective responses (in the dendrites of individual neurons)

# "Individual SAC dendrites are direction-selective"

"Each SAC can wire to multiple ooDSGCs and contribute to their direction-selective responses. This is possible because each SAC dendrite is an independent direction-selective unit (Euler et al., 2002) (fig.11). When a stimulus is presented in a centrifugal direction, moving from its cell body out to the distal tips, the SAC dendrite inhibits the ooDSGC that it connects to. Therefore, each SAC dendrite responds best to motion in the opposite direction relative to that preferred by its postsynaptic ooDSGC (fig.12)."

The inhibitory inputs from the direction selective (SAC) Star burst Amacrine Cells cause pattern selectivity to happen in the more common On-Off Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (ooDGSCs)

By themselves the SAC cells are direction selective but through inhibitory signals they confer pattern selectivity to the more common ooDSGCs.

"On the other hand, SACs on the preferred side contribute relatively little inhibition."

"each SAC dendrite responds best to motion in the opposite direction relative to that preferred by its postsynaptic ooDSGC"

But the SAC is connected to the ooDSGC in a way that sets a pattern detection preference. (like is this cell going to activate when it sees pattern A (left to right movement), or Pattern B (dorsal to ventral movement (top to bottom))). 

This paper is talking about Direction selectivity, but underlying that is the concept of pattern selectivity, and this is at the root of how memory works in the NAPOT theory. That long term memories are stored in the physical configuration of cells, with the synaptic connections & dendritic configurations, allowing a cell to respond preferentially to certain types of memories, so it activates when it sees what it has grown to look for, and it ignores (inhibits) patterns that do not match it's grown criteria. This is part of how long term learning grows in your mind. Cells learn to preferentially respond to certain patterns, and they learn to inhibit other patterns.

Inhibition then, (and we might apply this concept generally to inhibitory interneuron circuits) inhibition is like a second carving tool for the sculptor that is your brain rendering the mind, some of the patterns in your mind are rendered through excitatory circuits, but those patterns are improved & refined with inhibitory circuits. With inhibition what might otherwise be a rough & wacky hallucinatory experience becomes instead a refined reality, with more accurate pattern representation, and clearer thinking.

This concept also provides a clue to how Dendritic Inhibition might shape your active memory, by causing a cell to respond more or less to something in your receptive field.

What would it mean to apply the inhibitory concept to artificial neural networks such as Stable Diffusion?

# "Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells suppress luminance responses during natural viewing" https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35708.pdf

It is shown that inhibition helps a direction selective cell to ignore stationary behavior. (or patterns that almost match, but do not actually match what the memory-prediction criteria that the cell is seeking to activate in your mind)

"Directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells of the retina report the direction of motion by spiking robustly to movement of an object in one direction (preferred) and sparsely to movement of the same object in the opposite (null) direction1–3. It is somewhat surprising therefore that such cells also spike robustly to changes in luminance without corresponding motion1–5 as responsiveness to two different visual features raises questions of how downstream circuits interpret the meaning of individual spikes, e.g. does a given spike convey information about motion or about luminance?"

"Responsiveness to multiple features by DS cells has been largely ignored in the feature detector literature, curious given that the identification of directional selectivity helped shape the feature detector hypothesis"

^ hmm hmm

"We find that responses to changes in luminance are strongly
suppressed in favor of a response that reliably reports direction of motion."

^ Inhibition

"Coupled with the suppression of the response to luminance, this reduction of motion responses results in spike generation for only a single feature: motion of an object in the preferred direction. Responsiveness to only a single feature allows for unequivocal interpretation of transmitted spikes by downstream circuits and makes DS cells a true ‘feature detector.’ This finding is in contrast to the results of a recent study in which direction coding was not strongly affected by wide-field inhibition19. Although the changes to the DS index in our study were modest, they arose consistently when the surround inhibition was blocked and thus highlight the importance of natural scenes for extracting certain characteristics from visual neurons"
