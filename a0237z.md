Not incidentally I do have a hypothesis for representational drift, part of my forthcoming book https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/619145/	

connect memory rotation to representational drift to virtual memories to david eaglmans gangsters to functional tensegrity to information carrying soliton waves

we are metal robots really, need to revise that article https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf6707

neurons are more capable than people know

why do the coinjoined twins still have two separate minds? because their minds have different attractors (oscillation patterns that bind their minds)

If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.
