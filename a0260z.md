(dendrite) the brain has two hemispheres of hierarchies, each hemisphere is conscious, and can exist indepent of the other

Wow! Anand! That was awesome! Why don't you distort each image, prior to making it sparse, by 10hz, or 10 degrees, to give it two eyes or two ears? Then you have a hierarchy that is all about matching two eye or two ear hierarchies. The hierarchy to unite the two sense hierarchies is the time hierarchy. It's job is to build a representation when there are close synchronicity between the two sense hierarchies. So that their is a timeline association of sensory data, when new data comes in. The timeline association data becomes like a google search

sending that data to v1, it might create a visual concept of a funny cat, that is now associated with the words "cats are fun!" and the 

each eye in v1 + timeline representation is creating a sort of temporal and spatial representation of all the bits of data coming in at each level.

so we have spatial/temporal representations of the lower bits (not knowing what's in those lower bits, what's in them is the job of the v1 alone for example)

and spatial/temporal representations of each higher level of the hierarchy (again without knowing the data in that hierarchy, it's filled in by the hierarchy, the spatial/temporal association is built by the frequency of activity in each sector.

or you could store the timeline locally, on the actual hierarchy, like a dendrite. each node in the hierarchy has nodes that count the frequency in which they become part of a representation identified by the upper level or lower level.

The program can share what it's representations mean by doing google searches, to find things that are similar to what it has learned, and in so doing, it can build representations of it's representations and associate words, and pictures with it's internal representations, a sort of out put channel, communication
