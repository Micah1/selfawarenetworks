One of the key mathematicians/physicists for my book shares one of my hobbies, but he wasn't the only one, so while looking for references that talked about his hobby, I found another guy who shares the same hobby, and he created information theory.

A formula for how time increases dimensions at the quantum scale

in other words

a masstime equation for particles

the idea is that mass is pinching time at the quantum scale
the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter

I'm trying to argue that there are more intervals of space when there are fewer intervals of time

the question is about how to describe how time is increasing space from a particles perspective, and thus changing the direction that mass moves in on average, changing the shape of space

I need to measure quantities of time as vectors in higher dimensional space

models of the mind

a human being is abc
a man is abc+d
a fractal functional isomorphism in category theory is like the set of abc is inside object a, object b and object, but 

mass space is extra

slowing intervals of space & time over time by increasing the surface area of spacetime at the same time 

I want to for example predict with the equation for quantum gravity the mode of tau particle decay

and to shown why the mass of gluons does not add up to the mass of the proton

kinetic energy pushes intervals of time into the future, slowing down time in the 3rd dimension
because vectors of space are being pushed into expanding intervals of time

so time as we experience it in time dilated space as time dilated space seems to move faster in the sky and slower in the earth

the synaptic connection state is represented in the oscillation state which represents the item when it's being predicted tonically to represent the expectation net that receives the incoming phasic.
the attractor state representing the item andor the color red on the item is oscillating in memory with a neural circuit firing pattern, but other signals from other items and colors threat to disrupt and or change that item in memory, perhaps changing its color for example.

fear is the angular momentum to the kinectic energy of frustration as both lead to anger

You don't get web3 because 1. you don't need money outside the central banking system? 2. you don't need digital assets? 3. you think the dollar will always retain its value? 4. you haven't noticed the rise of rightwing_fascists in every country (they will take physical property)

I had a dream that I was living in an infected world with alien parasites taking over human bodies, and human minds, but what made it interesting to me was that the parasite infected were not smarter or dumber than regular humans.

They acted like normal people up until an infected person was in close proximity to an uninfected person. Then it was about biting you to spread the infection, but otherwise like terminators they could pretend to be people to get close to you.
