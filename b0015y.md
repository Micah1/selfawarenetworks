Micah
Why are we keeping old memories? Well, it's like your brain learned to create really long, through evolution, really long strings of memories going back your entire life because of the survival advantage of it. Like you're able to make better predictions by incorporating old information with new information. The more information you have, the better your predictions, the better your life, the more your genes can replicate.

A.C.
Is it still we need this lifestyle to keep old memories?

Micah
You can totally decide. I mean, you can decide, and you will decide. Like when you think about it enough, your mind will expand your awareness around it, and you'll realize there's some stuff you can let go of because you don't need it anymore or some stuff you don't care about anymore.

A.C.
I remember my memories like they are images, right? Yeah. So how is it happening that the same image I can replay again and again in my brain?

Micah
Do you mean like PTSD? Or just the same image happening over and over again? You don't like this memory or something?

A.C.
Or I like it, but how is it recorded, with what? With the brain like a sim card?

Micah
No, it’s not like a sim card.

A.C.
So, storage?

Micah
I feel what you're saying. It's like your memories are stored in the connections of your brain. So when your neurons fire together, they form connections, and those connections represent the patterns that have been learned previously. They represent sequences of patterns, and neurons detect sequences. They're coincidence detectors.

Micah
A coincidence is like, okay, if you see something and hear something—like if you see lightning and you hear lightning, and they always happen in close proximity, right? Sometimes, if it's really close proximity, that means the storm is right above you, and you see lightning and hear thunder at the same time. But if you see lightning—because light travels faster than sound—and then a little while later you hear thunder, you know the center of the storm is off in some direction; it's not right above you. The greater the distance between lightning and thunder, the further away the center of the storm is from you.

Micah
And that's sort of like... I forgot what the point was.

A.C.
Remind me, it was about memories.

Micah
Yeah, memories. Okay.

A.C.
(Laughs) How is the brain keeping all these images?

A.C.
Is it in the dreaming state when we dream that we can see?

Micah
If you have... If something has multiple correlations, like... your brain wants to...

Micah
What's the right way to phrase this, um...

Micah
Your brain wants to maintain equilibrium. It's a physics-based system, and it has to intake—it's a dissipative system that has to intake, like a vortex, it has to intake new energy, like food, and export increasing chaos to the surrounding environment, increasing entropy because entropy has to always increase according to the second law of thermodynamics.

Micah
So your body always has to maintain its equilibrium or try to maintain life. But it's happening at every cell’s level, and the whole body is made up of cells, right? And the same thing with organs—it's all about physics-based systems maintaining their equilibrium. Ultimately, that's the driver of behavior. But then on top of that, that's a basic driver of why you need to eat every day and why people need to go to the restroom every day.

A.C.
Do you think that people will ever find a way to evolve and live without eating, sensing a different energy source?

Micah
Do I think people can sense a different energy source?

A.C.
Yeah, like get energy not from food, just stop eating. Or do they still need these whole elements?

Micah
Yeah, okay. So, like, imagine a hurricane. A human being is just a dissipative system, right? If you cut off all the heat to a hurricane, it will die because it is cycling. Its existence is as a cyclone of reality. So it's like a human being is, in a sense, a vortex in reality, like a hurricane.

Micah
So we are reality spiraling, essentially, on some level. That is a valid way to see it. It's a valid viewpoint. It's not the only valid viewpoint; this is also real, but that's another valid perspective on it, right? And yes, we are, in essence, like this fractal functional funnel. Isomorphic... I mean, when I say fractal and I say isomorphic, those are almost saying the same thing. Those are like a self-repeating pattern, right? But it's like you have an isomorphic function, and you have like an isomorphism of functions. What I mean is, like, if you say, okay, you're going to describe how something changes over time—like this is going to go from here to here.

Micah
Okay? And so this is point A, this is point B, and how it goes from here to here is a function. In this case, some movement, right? That movement is taking something from here and putting it over there. But it is something that transitions from this state to that state, right?

Micah
And so that’s... that's a function. That means that something changed. If suddenly you played music, that’s your playing music function. That means that somehow something happened where there was no music, and now there was music. And what happened in between was the function: someone turned on the music, right? And that’s how programming is. Programming is basically functions—like, okay, this button is now going to do this, so we write that in the language that the computer understands.
