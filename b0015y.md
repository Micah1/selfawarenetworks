# Micah
Why are we keeping all memories?

Through evolution your brain learned to create really long strings of memories going back your entire life, because of the survival advantage of it, like you're able to make better predictions by incorporating old information with new information.

00:30

The more information you have the better your predictions, the better your life, the more, your genes can replicate it.

# A.C.
Is it still we need this, this lifestyle to keep old memories?

# Micah
You will decide, if you think about it enough (the right amount), then your mind will expand your awareness around it, and you'll realize there's some stuff you can let go of because you don't need it anymore or some stuff

01:00

# Micah
you don't care about anymore.

# A.C.
I remember my memories like they are images right?
Yeah. So how is it happening that same image I can replay again & again in my brain?

# Micah
Do you mean like PTSD? Or just the same image happening over and over again. You don't like this memory or something?

# A.C.
Or I like, (the question is how is it recorded, with what, with brain like sim card?)

01:23

Mainly call bring work sim card.

# Micah
No

# A.C.
Storage.

# Micah
I feel what you are saying. It's like your memories are stored in the connections of your brain. So when you're neurons fires together, they form connections and those connections represent the patterns that have been learned previously. They represent sequences of patterns, and neurons detect sequences, they're coincidence detectors.

02:11

A coincidence is like, okay, if you see something and hear something, like if you see lightning and you hear lightning and they always happen in close proximity, right?

Like sometimes if it's really close proximity, that means the storm is right above you, (if) we see lightning and (hear) thunder at the same time, but if you see lightning because light travels faster than sound, and then a little while later you hear thunder, you know the center of storm is off in some directions, it's not right above you.

02:38

It's somewhere else, and the greater the distance (between the lightning & thunder). The further away, the center of the storm is from you. And that's sort of like I forgot what the point was

02:58

Remind me of my words.

# A.C.
About memories.

# Micah
Yeah, memories. Okay.

# A.C.
(laughing) how the brain keeping all these imagines)

03:18

# A.C.
Is it dreaming state, when we dream, we can see?

# Micah
If you have. If something is, if there's multiple correlations like, your brain wants to

03:37

# Micah
What is the right way to phrase this, um...

03:44

# Micah
Your brain wants to maintain the equilibrium. It's a physics-based system and it has to intake uh... It's a dissipative system that has to intake, like a vortex, it has to intake new energy, like food and export, increasing chaos to the surrounding environment, increasing energy, because entropy has to always increase according to the second law of thermodynamics.

04:11

So your body always has to maintain its equilibrium or try to maintain life but it's happening at every cell's level and whole body is made up of cells, right? And the same thing with organs, it's all it's about physics-based systems maintaining their equilibrium.  Ultimately that's the driver of behavior,

04:35

but then on top of that there is like that is that's a basic driver of

04:48

why you need to eat every day and why people need to go to the restroom every day.

# A.C.
Do you think that people will ever find a way, evolve a way, to live without eating, to sense a different energy source.

05:19

# Micah 
Do I think people can sense a different energy source?

# A.C.
Get energy not from food, just stop eating. Or they still need this whole elements?

05:36
# Micah
Yeah, okay, so like imagine like a hurricane, a human being is just a dissipative system, right? If you cut off all the heat to a hurricane, it will die, because it is cycling. Like it's existence is as a cyclone of reality. So, it's like a human being is in a sense of vortex in reality, like a hurricane.

05:58

So we are reality spiraling, essentially, on some level. That is a valid way to see it as a valid viewpoint. It's not the only valid viewpoint. This is also real, but that's another valid perspective on it, right? And yes. So it's like, yeah, we are in essence like this fractal.

06:21

Functional funnel. Isomorphic, I mean that's you know, when I say fractal and I say, isomorphic, those are (almost saying the same thing) Those are like a self-repeating pattern, right. But it's like you have a, you have an isomorphic function and you have like an isomorphism of functions. What I mean is like if you have, you say, okay, you're gonna describe how something changed over time, like, this is gonna go from here to here.

06:54

Okay? And so this is point a, this point b, and how it goes from here to here, is a function, in this case, some movement, right, that movement is taking something from here and putting it over there, but it is something that transitions from this state to that state, right?

07:10

And so that is, that's, that's a function. That means that something changed. If suddenly you played music that, that is your, that's the playing music function. That means that somehow something happened, where there was no music. And now there was music and what happened to between, was the function, someone turned on the music, right?

07:32

And that's how programming it's like, programming is basically functions. Like okay, this button is now going to do this. So we write that and the language that the computer understands.

PAUSE RECORDING here (The recording goes on but nothing interesting is said.)

I never answered her question but the answer is that like a hurricane our bodies will die if not given new energy to feed on. The human body does not live without eating.
