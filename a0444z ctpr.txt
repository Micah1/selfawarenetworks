waves theta waves are overlapping inhibitory patterns that eflect action potential sequences patterns in a roboust overlapping way

the brain could be an energy efficient rendering engine where most of the tonic oscillations are like shadows of recent patterns, ready to fire because they represent cyclic stuff you think about daily

so if you think about the brain's cycles over the day it makes sense that your neurons might have likely thought & behavior strategies sort of encoded as active tonic scripts in the background awareness of your mind ready to shift into activation

but with Theta and other tonic power bands I think observation is sort of always on represented by the theta oscillation developing over the course of the day. It's interesting to then think of Thresholds of the Mind in terms of how your brain activity, over time can result in major brain changes, break downs and reorganization of data.

the cosmos is also a finite state machine

with off off being able to happen once in infinity 
because there is an on on state which is all possible states on. and inbetween are two opposite on/off or off on states, and these states of the cosmos are composed of all the possible states of the cosmos between off off and on on

those states consist of a wave at maximum density compression & kinect energy

and the same wave at maximum scattering amplitude dissipation and angular momentum

from the perspective of base for the off off & on on are 50 percent of the possible states, but I supposed that inreality each possible instance of off on or on off state where some part of the cosmos is in a mass & time amplitude crunching state while some part is in a high frequency expanding mass dissipating state.

however the harmonic oscillator feature of space means that oscillators will clump together, being attractors to other oscillators, or being sometimes attractors to more organized oscillator states.

So the cosmos goes through the same process of natural selection that organisms go through with oscillators combining in novel ways developing increasing more complex information configurations overtime.

space that oscillates together stays together until it is forced to oscillate apart, ie quantum entanglement. measuring one gives you the spin of the other because they were oscillating together in a splay state.
