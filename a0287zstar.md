# NAPOT Revision 3 The Anti-Spike: A negative soliton wave

# "Frequency-specific neural signatures of perceptual content and perceptual stability" doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.18.484861
"Combining multivariate decoding and neural state-space analyses, we found frequency band-specific neural signatures that underlie the content of perception and promote perceptual stability, respectively. Across different types of images, non-oscillatory neural activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range supported the content of perception. By contrast, perceptual stability is influenced by the amplitude of alpha and beta oscillations"

Actually a twist on the way I think about NAPOT but consistent with my prediction of inhibition being a code underneath the tonic oscillation. Inhibition therefore is like an anti-particle or anti-matter, or anti-spike, meaning your brain notices it. because it expects the tonic oscillatory synchrony, and this paper backs the idea I think of inhibition defining patterns in the brain. They document stable high magnitude tonic oscillations at 20hz and below (and above 5hz), but in this paper, instead of a high phasic spike causing a neural signature, its the lower sub <5 Hz non-oscillatory (inhibitions or negative spike or silent plateau firing) search notes for silent plateau & link here. Which means that in the 6th layer of cortex & thalamus, a delta frequency resulting from inhibition or silent plateau is like an inverted spike to the theta frequency. Awesome!

This is the beginning of NAPOT Theory Revision 3.
"The modern theory of antimatter began in 1928 in a paper by Paul Dirac. The Schrödinger wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons. Discovered in 1932 & named positrons."

"we applied time-resolved multivariate decoding to whole-brain MEG data (for details, see Methods). We tested three components of neural field potentials — slow- cortical potential (SCP, < 5 Hz), alpha-band amplitude (amplitude envelope of 8-13 Hz filtered data) and beta-band amplitude (amplitude envelope of 13-30 Hz filtered data) — in their ability to distinguish between the two percepts that are alternatively experienced for each ambiguous figure. The SCP activity corresponds to the low-frequency component of the broadband, non-oscillatory (i.e., aperiodic) activity (He et al., 2010; He, 2014), while the alpha and beta bands have prominent oscillatory activity (Figure S1 A-B)."
"Decoding accuracy in the SCP band was highest in the first second after image onset and then drops to a lower level (likely due to neural adaptation). The higher decoding accuracy in the Unambiguous condition as compared to the Ambiguous condition is likely due to the differences in sensory input that coincides with different perceptual contents, as well as consistent timing across all trials (all image presentations last 5 seconds, as opposed to variable percept durations in the Ambiguous condition). Lastly, as in the Ambiguous condition, the SCP decoder of perceptual content generalized well across time in the Unambiguous condition (Figure 2D, right column), suggesting that the underlying neural code is stable over time after the very initial image onset-related activity."

Stable information over time implies the SCP is a soliton wave. YESSSS!!!!!!

"Together, these results show that perceptual content information is decodable from SCP activity, but not from the amplitude of alpha or beta oscillations, regardless of whether sensory input is ambiguous or not."

because information theory the rare signals have high information (SCP) and the common signals (tonic alpha & beta) have low information

It's a song of fire & ice.

"Together, these results show a frequency-band separation of information related to perceptual content and perceptual stability, with the former encoded in raw fluctuations of low-frequency SCP activity, and the latter primarily influenced by the amplitude fluctuations of alpha and beta oscillations."

I will have to add to the note on the Phasic Tonic Relationship the 'SCP (Inhibited) Tonic Relationship', because its the inverse relationship.

The article below is evidence for what I call Soliton Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP) or (Anti-matter) Negative Action Potentials

# "Ultra-rapid axon-axon ephaptic inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells by the pinceau"
"Excitatory synaptic activity in the brain is shaped and balanced by inhibition. Because inhibition cannot propagate, it is often recruited with a synaptic delay by incoming excitation. Cerebellar Purkinje cells are driven by long-range excitatory parallel fiber inputs, which also recruit local inhibitory basket cells. The axon initial segment of each Purkinje cell is ensheathed by basket cell axons in a structure called the pinceau, which is largely devoid of chemical synapses. In mice, we found at the single-cell level that the pinceau mediates ephaptic inhibition of Purkinje cell firing at the site of spike initiation. The reduction of firing rate was synchronous with the presynaptic action potential, eliminating a synaptic delay and allowing granule cells to inhibit Purkinje cells without a preceding phase of excitation. Axon-axon ephaptic intercellular signaling can therefore mediate near-instantaneous feedforward and lateral inhibition."

"Compared to other multivariate analysis methods, the neural state-space method has specific advantages and is well-suited to addressing the questions investigated herein. First, compared to multivariate decoding, the state- space method extracts multivariate neural activity patterns relevant to multiple behavioral metrics simultaneously, as opposed to investigating neural correlate of one behavioral metric at a time. Second, compared to automatic dimensionality reduction, such as PCA and similar techniques (Churchland et al., 2012; Cunningham and Yu, 2014; Baria et al., 2017), the state-space approach directly identifies the neural activity pattern (i.e. neural sub-space) relevant to a particular behavioral metric, as opposed to being behavior-agnostic."
"While perceptual content is encoded in the activity pattern of low-frequency neural activity in the SCP band, perceptual stability and perceptual memory are influenced by the fluctuations of alpha and beta oscillation amplitudes."
"Neural state-space analysis: To work out the relative contributions of different behaviors to neural activity patterns, we developed a novel multivariate analysis method to extract the neural sub-space relevant to each behavior, following the approach used in (Mante et al., 2013). While perceptual content is clearly an important aspect of behavior, there are other aspects of behavior which account for the perceptual switching dynamics (Ambiguous condition) and perceptual memory (Discontinuous condition). For the Ambiguous condition we defined 4 behavioral metrics for each time point that occurred between button presses for the two percepts (i.e. not for time points preceded or followed by an unsure button press). The 4 behavioral metrics were:
• Type, a binary variable indicating the current percept.
• Duration, a continuous variable which takes the same value throughout a percept and is
normalized within subject (i.e., 0 for the shortest percept reported, and 1 for the longest percept).
• Switch, a continuous variable that was 0 at the time of a button press and 1 at the midway point
between button presses, indicating the relative temporal distance to perceptual switches.
• Direction, a binary variable indicating whether the current percept is stabilizing (i.e., timepoint is
in the first half of its duration) or destabilizing (i.e., in the second half of its duration)."
"Significant temporal clusters of image/percept decoding exist in the SCP range throughout image presentation, but not for alpha/beta amplitude. (Right) Temporal generalization matrices showing significant generalization across a large proportion of the image presentation duration."

Functional fractal pattern of heterogeneity at the person level and at the neuron level, but perhaps this is means each neuron has an identity or an address that represents a specific memory through its learned connections and a specific pattern to its exit terminal network when its action potentials (of different scales) fire (transmitting phase waves differentials with neurotransmitters).

The following is an example of a recurrant neural network model that rediscovers the concept of coincidence detection (humor) but the model also backs the concept of excitability (phase wave variation) for linking memory sequences over time, backing NAPOT theory.
"Intrinsic neural excitability induces time-dependent overlap of memory engrams"
"Our results suggest that the temporal linking of memory engrams arises from co-activation of different neural ensembles, mediated by the interaction of time-varying excitability and synaptic plasticity. Our model makes testable predictions about how the balance among inhibition, feed-forward inputs and excitability is crucial for determining the extent of overlap among engrams of temporally close events."

This paper shows the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency, exactly what NAPOT theory predicts, when you decrease frequency magnitude (spatial area effect) increases. 
"We recorded LFPs[local field potential] via macro-contacts and discovered that RF[Receptive Field] sizes estimated from low-frequency activity (LFA, 0.5 – 30 Hz) were larger than those estimated from low-gamma activity (LGA, 30 – 60 Hz) and high-gamma activity (HGA, 60 – 150 Hz)." https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.28.505627v1

I like this article on PCA Principle Component Analysis
"Variance is information." This quote is exactly in alignment with NAPOT, variances in Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography is the information that neural arrays are rendering to other neural arrays that when oscillated becomes the canvas of the mind

Maybe I should add data scientist to my resume.

In the rendering + tomography section that is where I combine notes on the Holographic Brain/universe with neural coding, and tomography

Consider a wave, the height of the wave is the amplitude, and the width of the wave is the duration, if you increase the frequency then the magnitude must decrease (the magnitude is the additive combination of amplitude & duration) in EEG measurements the amplitude appears to have an inverse relationship with frequency. (EEG frequency/hz is sampled at regular intervals such as 256hz per 1 second of time). If duration is consistent and frequency is changing then there has to be an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency. If Amplitude is consistent (such as with all or none action potentials) and frequency is changing then duration has to change (which is part of how I connected in my mind that magnitude (via the duration of the Action Potential) has to be changing with frequency, and thus frequency cannot be the only thing that a neuron passes onward, I didn't discover this fact but I knew to look for it in the research because of my understanding of waves.) 

EEG Sampling rate explained
"The sampling rate describes the number of times that the signal is measured per unit of time, usually given in Hertz (Hz) = 1/second (Figure 1). Notice that although the EEG is an analog signal (continuous in time), it has to be converted into a digital signal (discrete in time) in order to be processed by the computer" 
"Generally, sample rate selection works as follows. For neuroimaging research, the minimal acceptable sample rate is 256 Hz.  For more challenging scenarios, 512 Hz is typical, but this can be increased up to 1024 Hz, which is considered a very high frequency for EEG data. In real-time neuroscience (neurotechnology and biomedical applications) or mobile applications, 256 Hz is usually the standard as the data need to be transferred and processed in near real-time."

The point is that because magnitude is inverted to frequency, if frequency changes then either the amplitude changes, or the duration changes, or both the amplitude & duration changes. This is true for all waves at all scales of the cosmos, from gluons to Ganymede to Gamma ray bursts, if the frequency increases the sum magnitude decreases, and if the sum magnitude increases the frequency must decrease. (That is why if you fly faster you get heavier and for you time slows down. You are also a wave and if your frequency increases, your magnitude must decrease, which usually means that either you get smaller in area (experiencing greater gravitational force) or time for you slows down (Reference Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation in my notes aka Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation.)

"Multimodal Object Representations Rely on Integrative Coding"
"Combining information from multiple senses is essential to object recognition. Yet how the mind combines sensory input into coherent multimodal representations, the multimodal binding problem, remains poorly understood"

Actually I defined this concept in NAPOT theory that predates your paper.

"Our novel paradigm decoupled the learned multimodal object representations from their baseline unimodal shape and sound features, thus tracking the emergence of multimodal concepts as they were learned by healthy adults"

Your novel paradigm (humor)? Your paradigm describes part of NAPOT. Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography. Which is my thesis. (Lets be friends though.) I will cite your paper in my book.

"Critically, the representation for the whole object was different from the combined representation of its individual parts, with evidence of an integrative object code in anterior temporal lobe structures."

"Intriguingly, the perirhinal cortex, an anterior temporal lobe structure, was by default biased towards visual shape, but this initial shape bias was attenuated with learning. Pattern similarity analyses suggest that after learning the perirhinal cortex orthogonalized combinations of visual shape and sound features, transforming overlapping feature input into distinct multimodal object representations. These results provide evidence of integrative coding in the anterior temporal lobes that is distinct from the distributed sensory features, advancing the age-old question of how the mind constructs multimodal objects from their component features."

Great work! 

"One theoretical view predicts that multimodal objects are built from component 16 unimodal features represented across distributed sensory regions.2 Under this view, when a child 17 thinks about “frog”, the visual cortex represents the appearance of the frog whereas the auditory
18 cortex represents the croaking sound. Alternatively, other theoretical views predict that objects 19 are not only built from sensory features, but that there is also an explicit integrative code distinct 20 from the features (i.e., the whole is different than the sum of its parts).

"We found that multimodal object concepts were represented as distributed sensory-
4 specific features along the visual and auditory processing pathways, as well as explicit
5 integrative combinations of those features in the anterior temporal lobes."

This confirms high level sparse distributed memory or sparse distributed representation (SDR, Numenta)
