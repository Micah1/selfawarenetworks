"Combining multivariate decoding and neural state-space analyses, we found frequency band-specific neural signatures that underlie the content of perception and promote perceptual stability, respectively. Across different types of images, non-oscillatory neural activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range supported the content of perception. By contrast, perceptual stability is influenced by the amplitude of alpha and beta oscillations"
Actually a twist on the way I think about NAPOT but consistent with my prediction of inhibition being a code underneath the tonic oscillation. Inhibition therefore is like an anti-particle or anti-matter, or anti-spike, meaning your brain notices it. because it expects the tonic oscillatory synchrony, and this paper backs the idea I think of inhibition defining patterns in the brain. They document Stable high magnitude tonic oscillations at 20hz and below, but in this paper instead of a high phasic spike causing a neural signature its  the lower sub <5 Hz non-oscillatory (inhibitions or inverse spike or silent plateau firing) search notes for silent plateau & link here. Which means that in the 6th layer of cortex & thalamus, a delta frequency resulting from inhibition or silent plateau is like an inverted spike to the theta frequency. 
Awesome!
"we applied time-resolved multivariate decoding to whole-brain MEG data (for details, see Methods). We tested three components of neural field potentials — slow- cortical potential (SCP, < 5 Hz), alpha-band amplitude (amplitude envelope of 8-13 Hz filtered data) and beta-band amplitude (amplitude envelope of 13-30 Hz filtered data) — in their ability to distinguish between the two percepts that are alternatively experienced for each ambiguous figure. The SCP activity corresponds to the low-frequency component of the broadband, non-oscillatory (i.e., aperiodic) activity (He et al., 2010; He, 2014), while the alpha and beta bands have prominent oscillatory activity (Figure S1 A-B)."
"Decoding accuracy in the SCP band was highest in the first second after image onset and then drops to a lower level (likely due to neural adaptation). The higher decoding accuracy in the Unambiguous condition as compared to the Ambiguous condition is likely due to the differences in sensory input that coincides with different

Lastly, as in the Ambiguous condition, the SCP decoder of perceptual content generalized well across time in the Unambiguous condition (Figure 2D, right column), suggesting that the underlying neural code is stable over time after the very initial image onset-related activity."
Stable information implies the SCP is a soliton wave. YESSSS!!!!!!
"Together, these results show that perceptual content information is decodable from SCP activity, but not from the amplitude of alpha or beta oscillations, regardless of whether sensory input is ambiguous or not."
because information theory the rare signals have high information (SCP) and the common signals (tonic alpha & beta) have low information
It's a song of fire & ice.
"Together, these results show a frequency-band separation of information related to perceptual content and perceptual stability, with the former encoded in raw fluctuations of low-frequency SCP activity, and the latter primarily influenced by the amplitude fluctuations of alpha and beta oscillations."
I will have to add to the note on the Phasic Tonic Relationship the SCP (Inhibited) Tonic Relationship, because its the inverse relationship.

"Compared to other multivariate analysis methods, the neural state-space method has specific advantages and is well-suited to addressing the questions investigated herein. First, compared to multivariate decoding, the state- space method extracts multivariate neural activity patterns relevant to multiple behavioral metrics simultaneously, as opposed to investigating neural correlate of one behavioral metric at a time. Second, compared to automatic dimensionality reduction, such as PCA and similar techniques (Churchland et al., 2012; Cunningham and Yu, 2014; Baria et al., 2017), the state-space approach directly identifies the neural activity pattern (i.e. neural sub-space) relevant to a particular behavioral metric, as opposed to being behavior-agnostic."
"While perceptual content is encoded in the activity pattern of low-frequency neural activity in the SCP band, perceptual stability and perceptual memory are influenced by the fluctuations of alpha and beta oscillation amplitudes."
"Neural state-space analysis
To work out the relative contributions of different behaviors to neural activity patterns, we developed a novel multivariate analysis method to extract the neural sub-space relevant to each behavior, following the approach used in (Mante et al., 2013). While perceptual content is clearly an important aspect of behavior, there are other aspects of behavior which account for the perceptual switching dynamics (Ambiguous condition) and perceptual memory (Discontinuous condition). For the Ambiguous condition we defined 4 behavioral metrics for each time point that occurred between button presses for the two percepts (i.e. not for time points preceded or followed by an unsure button press). The 4 behavioral metrics were:
• Type, a binary variable indicating the current percept.
• Duration, a continuous variable which takes the same value throughout a percept and is
normalized within subject (i.e., 0 for the shortest percept reported, and 1 for the longest percept).
• Switch, a continuous variable that was 0 at the time of a button press and 1 at the midway point
between button presses, indicating the relative temporal distance to perceptual switches.
• Direction, a binary variable indicating whether the current percept is stabilizing (i.e., timepoint is
in the first half of its duration) or destabilizing (i.e., in the second half of its duration)."
"Significant temporal clusters of image/percept decoding exist in the SCP range throughout image presentation, but not for alpha/beta amplitude. (Right) Temporal generalization matrices showing significant generalization across a large proportion of the image presentation duration."

The following is an example of a recurrant neural network model that rediscovers the concept of coincidence detection (humor) but the model also backs the concept of excitability (phase wave variation) for linking memory sequences over time, backing NAPOT theory.
"Intrinsic neural excitability induces time-dependent overlap of memory engrams"
"Our results suggest that the temporal linking of memory engrams arises from co-activation of different neural ensembles, mediated by the interaction of time-varying excitability and synaptic plasticity. Our model makes testable predictions about how the balance among inhibition, feed-forward inputs and excitability is crucial for determining the extent of overlap among engrams of temporally close events."

In the rendering + tomography section that is where I combine notes on the Holographic Brain/universe with neural coding, and tomography

Consider a wave, the height of the wave is the amplitude, and the width of the wave is the duration, if you increase the frequency then the magnitude must decrease (the magnitude is the additive combination of amplitude & duration) in EEG measurements the amplitude appears to have an inverse relationship with frequency. (EEG frequency/hz is sampled at regular intervals such as 256hz per 1 second of time). If duration is consistent and frequency is changing then there has to be an inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency. If Amplitude is consistent (such as with all or none action potentials) and frequency is changing then duration has to change (which is part of how I connected in my mind that magnitude (via the duration of the Action Potential) has to be changing with frequency, and thus frequency cannot be the only thing that a neuron passes onward, I didn't discover this fact but I knew to look for it in the research because of my understanding of waves.) 

EEG Sampling rate explained
"The sampling rate describes the number of times that the signal is measured per unit of time, usually given in Hertz (Hz) = 1/second (Figure 1). Notice that although the EEG is an analog signal (continuous in time), it has to be converted into a digital signal (discrete in time) in order to be processed by the computer" 
"Generally, sample rate selection works as follows. For neuroimaging research, the minimal acceptable sample rate is 256 Hz.  For more challenging scenarios, 512 Hz is typical, but this can be increased up to 1024 Hz, which is considered a very high frequency for EEG data. In real-time neuroscience (neurotechnology and biomedical applications) or mobile applications, 256 Hz is usually the standard as the data need to be transferred and processed in near real-time."
https://www.bitbrain.com/blog/eeg-amplifier

The point is that because magnitude is inverted to frequency, if frequency changes then either the amplitude changes, or the duration changes, or both the amplitude & duration changes. This is true for all waves at all scales of the cosmos, from gluons to Ganymede to Gamma ray bursts, if the frequency increases the sum magnitude decreases, and if the sum magnitude increases the frequency must decrease. (That is why if you fly faster you get heavier and for you time slows down. You are also a wave and if your frequency increases, your magnitude must decrease, which usually means that either you get smaller in area (experiencing greater gravitational force) or time for you slows down (Reference Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation in my notes aka Quantum Gradient Time Dilation.)

"Multimodal Object Representations Rely on Integrative Coding"
"Combining information from multiple senses is essential to object recognition. Yet how the mind combines sensory input into coherent multimodal representations, the multimodal binding problem, remains poorly understood"

Actually I defined this concept in NAPOT theory that predates your paper.

"Our novel paradigm decoupled the learned multimodal object representations from their baseline unimodal shape and sound features, thus tracking the emergence of multimodal concepts as they were learned by healthy adults"

Your novel paradigm (humor)? Your paradigm describes part of NAPOT. Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography. Which is my thesis. (Lets be friends though.) I will cite your paper in my book.

"Critically, the representation for the whole object was different from the combined representation of its individual parts, with evidence of an integrative object code in anterior temporal lobe structures."

"Intriguingly, the perirhinal cortex, an anterior temporal lobe structure, was by default biased towards visual shape, but this initial shape bias was attenuated with learning. Pattern similarity analyses suggest that after learning the perirhinal cortex orthogonalized combinations of visual shape and sound features, transforming overlapping feature input into distinct multimodal object representations. These results provide evidence of integrative coding in the anterior temporal lobes that is distinct from the distributed sensory features, advancing the age-old question of how the mind constructs multimodal objects from their component features."

Great work! 

"One theoretical view predicts that multimodal objects are built from component 16 unimodal features represented across distributed sensory regions.2 Under this view, when a child 17 thinks about “frog”, the visual cortex represents the appearance of the frog whereas the auditory
18 cortex represents the croaking sound. Alternatively, other theoretical views predict that objects 19 are not only built from sensory features, but that there is also an explicit integrative code distinct 20 from the features (i.e., the whole is different than the sum of its parts).

"We found that multimodal object concepts were represented as distributed sensory-
4 specific features along the visual and auditory processing pathways, as well as explicit
5 integrative combinations of those features in the anterior temporal lobes."

This confirms high level sparse distributed memory or sparse distributed representation (SDR, Numenta)

Neuroelectric Tuning of Cortical Oscillations by Apical Dendrites in Loop Circuits
"Many layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons are connected to thalamic neurons in loop circuits"
"Synchronous pulse outputs from the circuit loops containing apical dendrites can tune subthreshold membrane oscillations of neurons they contact. When the pulse outputs are finely tuned, they function as a local “clock,” which enables the contacted neurons to synchronously communicate with each other. Thus, a shared tuning frequency can select neurons for membership in a circuit. Unlike layer 6 apical dendrites, layer 5 apical dendrites can produce burst firing in many of their neurons, which increases the amplitude of signals in the neurons they contact. This difference in amplitude of signals serves as basis of selecting a sub-circuit for specialized processing (e.g., sustained attention) within the typically larger layer 6-based circuit. After examining the sustaining of oscillations in loop circuits and the processing of spikes in network circuits, we propose that cortical functioning can be globally viewed as two systems: a loop system and a network system. The loop system oscillations influence the network system’s timing and amplitude of pulse signals, both of which can select circuits that are momentarily dominant in cortical activity"
"Here, we propose that a major function of the long apical dendrite in pyramidal neurons is the production of a stable oscillation at a specific frequency. When apical dendrites in corticothalamic loops oscillate, their oscillations are copied to networks of pyramidal neurons, and all network pyramidal neurons that are contacted will oscillate at a common carrier frequency into which messages of temporally coded spikes may be inserted."

Properties of Layer 6 Pyramidal Neuron Apical Dendrites
" All pyramidal neurons so far investigated have displayed active propagation of action potentials (APs), from the soma along the apical dendrite supported by voltage-gated dendritic Na+ channels (Spruston et al., 1995; Stuart et al., 1997; Waters et al., 2003), modulated by dendritic K+ channels (Bekkers, 2000; Johnston et al., 2000; Korngreen and Sakmann, 2000; Schaefer et al., 2007), and accompanied by influx of Ca2+ ions (Markram et al., 1995; Larkum et al., 1999a; Barth et al., 2008). Another prominent feature of pyramidal neurons is the ability of the apical dendrite to generate local spikes with voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels (Kim and Connors, 1993; Schiller et al., 1997; Golding et al., 2002; Gasparini et al., 2004) as well as NMDA receptor channels (Schiller et al., 2000; Larkum et al., 2009)."

"Postmortem studies of synapses in human brain are problematic due to the axial resolution limit of light microscopy and the difficulty preserving and analyzing ultrastructure with electron microscopy. Array tomography overcomes these problems by embedding autopsy tissue in resin and cutting ribbons of ultrathin serial sections. Ribbons are imaged with immunofluorescence, allowing high-throughput imaging of tens of thousands of synapses to assess synapse density and protein composition. The protocol takes approximately 3 days per case, excluding image analysis, which is done at the end of the study. Parallel processing for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a protocol modified to preserve structure in human samples allows complimentary ultrastructural studies. Incorporation of array tomography and TEM into brain banking is a potent way of phenotyping synapses in well-characterized clinical cohorts to develop clinico-pathological correlations at the synapse level. This will be important for research in neurodegenerative disease, developmental diseases, and psychiatric illness."
