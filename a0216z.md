(hebb, perception, oscillat, field, qualia)
It is very significant. You know an oscillation is about a thousand neurons, they get going together, and they oscillate some distinct pattern over and over again, it could be something in your field of vision that is an oscillating bunch of a thousand or more neurons. Hallucinated into perception because of the cyclic impact on the whole of the brain.

Putting together a bigger picture. Internal representation, aka qualia as "tiny phase changes" in brainwave oscillations (apply information theory to explain how phase changes can be information and computational rendering to explain how information can be a rendering of 3D art, 3D sound, touch, taste, smell that each part of your brain is experiencing like a sequence of eyes, or layers with perception being bound together by the oscillations, entified, the mental illusion of Daniel Dennet Hallucinated as Anil Seth puts it), large cyclic waves from distinct hebbian learned patterns, formulating a thought prediction as collected energy resulting in a surging action once enough energy has been accumulated to begin a bigger oscillation http://www.hhmi.org/research/neural-basis-decision-making-and-cognition
