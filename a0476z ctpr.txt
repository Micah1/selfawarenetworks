I disagree with the notion that this would ever cause body image issues, which to me sounds similar to the wrong headed idea that violent videogames will cause a rise in violence when the opposite has happened. This app may reverse body image issues and provide folks with relief from dysmorphia

A lot more research is needed but the general notion is that almost any "medication" can be harmful if not used correctly, inducing placticity in the brain is a strong thing. I think that if we don't give females or full bodied persons the option to represent themselves in a environment in VR we are at best increasing social stigma and at worse creating a platform for eating disorders and dysmorphia.

Micah Blumberg
Your point sounds similar to the idea that certain fashion magazines can cause an eating disorder because they showcase only an idealized version of a feminine body and not a real body. You could be right.

Micah Blumberg
My counter argument point is a different point, I am not arguing against that kind of point but instead arguing that if the structure of our minds is like HTM Hierachical Temporal Memory outlined in Jeff Hawkins On Intelligence book then we are fundamentally dividing all sensory representations of the world into hierarchically sorted categories which makes intelligent systems like humans uniquely and inherently good at making distinctions, such that overall humanity is not going to be confused by or mentally disturbed by VR avatars or by video game violence for the same exact reasons. Intelligence is good at making distinctions, inherently, so I'm not afraid that Facebook Spaces will cause dysmorphia

Micah Blumberg this is a misunderstanding of this theory best example is rubber hand illusion. When two singlas statisticaly match your brain creats a model that the rubber hand is yours. Same with VR avatars and very different in computer games that don't have this statistical match between sight and propioception.

Micah Blumberg
The rubber hand theory suggests that you can temporarily fool the brain into thinking that the rubber hand is your real hand. It does not suggest that having been tricked by the rubber hand delusion will cause hand dysmorphia in either the short term or the long term.

like i said more research is needed but the fact that it is easy to trick the brain should be taken into consideration... if you are looking for long terms effect of these type of "tricks" mirror box therapy and research regarding treatment of anorexia using vr avatars is out there... and like i said what ever can cure can likely do damage if used in an inappropriate way.

I remember this story, similar to the rubber hand effect, that was highlighted by a guy named V.S. Ramachandran, about how creating a box with a mirror, to make the participant think that their left hand was their missing right hand that had been restored, caused relief from phantom pain, when they were able to pretend move their right hand, by moving their left hand, and seeing it in the mirror. To me this suggests that illusions that fool your brain can have therapeutic benefit, cause pain relief, and perhaps other neurological benefits. I also think about how some users of psilocybin, a form of medicine that can trigger hallucinations, can cause depression relief. Both topics to me suggest that tricking your mind, whether with mirrors, rubber limbs, virtual reality, or with medicine may have a therapeutic benefit, and that until we have further research we might be optimistic about the possibility that avatars in Facebook Spaces may in fact relieve body dysmorphia and possibly pain and depression around the self image concept.

Micah Blumberg the difference between banana avatar and an avatar that is very similar but only different in one thing is rooted in the hierarchical context dependent way your brain creates models watch our next show on monday i will try to explain more

Micah Blumberg
Sure, the hierarchical context may indicate that the content under discussion may be in two very different spatial locations the brain's neo-cortex, http://gallantlab.org/index.php/publications/
I would guess that you might propose that the location of a concept in the brain's tempo-spatial hierarchy is related to its emotional weight within the mind of that person, an idea that could be true for some people and not true for other people.

I would think that the emotional weight that someone attaches any concept, including the concept of self, is going to change overtime, and perhaps change based upon factors like the individual's cultural metaphor, the spatial metaphor of self understanding which may change, grow, shrink, or otherwise become altered in its properties over time. So that emotional weight for the self concept, or for any other concept, would vary drastically for that same person measured at two different times in their life, that could mean measurements comparing when they are a teenager to when they are an adult, or measurements between the morning and the afternoon, or measurements before and after a meal. The degree to which an illusion can affect the self may vary wildly depending on the conditions that are true in that person's life, or their stomach, their age, or even the time of day.
