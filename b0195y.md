There was this time that I took this completely legal, psychedelic drug called salvia dividendorum and I I lost the ability to temporarily for about 15 minutes. I lost the ability ability to to just to make distinctions between different objects. Which means it's like that's like the whole room becomes one sort of object.

00:29

Like nothing is noticing between like a couch and the floor or between the sky and the ground. It's just completely like space is this undifferentiated? Sort of smoothness? It's that the only time I've experienced this sort of representation of reality. There was a, there is another time with the I was doing what I called this.

00:58

This Neo mindset about my brain waves were driving a light and sound patterns that I was seeing hearing with LED glasses. And it was isochronic beats and audio and there was and so that my brain was would drive changes to light sound effects and you would definitely notice that.

01:21

If the EG stopped, you notice it right away. It's like falling out of it had this credit impression like you're just dropping out of an airplane, the same dropping out of the sky from an airplane. It's just like this. Like when you, what you can feel a representation of your own brainwave activity.

01:42

Driving changes the light and sound effects. You're seeing here, in a sense, creating a representation of your own brain activity and you can get a sense of how your thoughts and feelings are changing the light and sound effects after a while. And so that was just incredible experience and that I was doing in 2011 and then I moved to San Francisco to open up a salon.

02:04

So I could do the Neo minecycle salon where that was my business. Whereas like EG driving brainwave and trainment experiences. And but I got to a point where I, I besides doing that I said, okay, well I'm also gonna take some psychedelic medication and and it did and I experienced I first tried to visualize the universe as a series of frames and, you know, like if you see one, if you see, like right now in one moment, you're it's like you're saying one frame at a time.

02:50

But if you saw two frames, simultaneous thing, then they, you would see, like two of every person you felt through, if you solve, if you double that you you see four of every person for everything and it's, it's just, it's a, at some point if you keep doubling that perspective.

03:14

So don't using, you know, eight of everything and 16 of everything, and 32 of everything, 64 of everything, 128 of everything, 500, and 12 of everything. And so I keep doubling and when you double numbers they get pretty big pretty quick and so pretty soon. It's like 128,000 of everything, right?

03:34

But the and then, you know, then you're into turn of 56,000, everything and 512 of everything and so on when you're into huge numbers pretty quickly. But what what changes is instead of the visual being like this sort of like really choppy hard to distinguish anything? I turned into like a smooth and creamy blur where there's there's no real distinction between one thing in the next you are just you no longer making just, you know, longer distinguishing one moment of reality here are sort of seeing that at some level at the highest level, the everything begins to blur together, maybe smooth creamy colors and then everything becomes black and silent.

04:33

Make the sounds all sounds cancel each other on all frequencies eventually cancel each other out.

04:41

You know, I guess it, I guess I don't know because it doesn't have to be black, I guess it could be. Maybe I'm just completely white like, adding all colors together, but I did went black from me in my, in my experience, like, everything is. I'm some point. It was smooth and premium light and then completely dark like space and it was this ever present and there there in that darkness then then the light came on and it was this it was the beginning of time as beginning of time is something that's outside time because time is a spectrum from from point.

05:24

Eight at point B. It the beginning in the end of time. But then but then if you could conceptualize every frame of time then beginning to the end and add them all up together and create a symbol to sort of represent all of those frames and say like, okay, well the physics of every single frame of time is bound and connected.

05:47

Not not in a way that we see in a daily basis, but in a real sense, the space time is

05:57

That and everything in space times anchored by everything else. Everything in the future is anger by everything in the past and vice versa and the gravitational effects of of one idea was planets. And, and galaxies. And and the curvature space is all sort of because the past and the future pollen, each other.

06:25

Because she, because the future events, hey, it's just an interest in an idea that everything. And because you know in in quantum physics everything is that there was a side. There's a sign YouTube lecture about how the rare witness of quantum physics. Is that everything is is related. Everything is relative to everything else.

06:56

Everything is defined by everything else and everything. Define everything else to find everything.

07:06

That I have to pull that quote. But yeah, getting back to the the thing is like, if you're going to, if you're going to be a human, if you're in a say, okay, well, how has a human being, you know, take some moments in time and space time and convert them into a conscious experience At some point, you know, we can we can look at the human the study if of human neuronatomy and, you know, photons, don't they don't go into your brain from your eye, they bounce off the eye, they bounce, they cause proteins to flip and that creates cellular activity, the transmission of neural signals.

08:06

And that, that the have they have, they have effects that they go deeply, reaching into your brain from your eyes long, the optic nerve to the thalamus, to the opposite of loads. And so on, and the back of your head. And we have to sort of like say okay well you know your eye has a lot of different cones and it has this blue cone receptors just that they just sort of like they're just for light and there's certain like it's like it's like there's it's not like it's one.

08:47

It's not like an eyeball is one camera it in a sense it's like there's a lot of different cells in there. And each of the cells is being sort of independently affected and some of the cells are going to firearm if they're seeing if they're noticing something moving from the left to the right or from up to down.

09:08

And so that's their, their job is they're only going to be looking for certain criteria for certain patterns to happen and the cells are going to reject other kinds of patterns. So the goal is the cell. Doesn't want to only become an activated from stimulation. It wants to only become activated from information from the detection, a certain patterns and the rejection of other patterns.

09:35

I don't match, they do not match what it's what's being sent sent in. And this is, we're talking about the, the sales, the nerve cells in the eyeball, gangly neurons. And so on and so forth. And so the, so I guess what we have to do then if what was being taken into the brain is a lot of different points of signal points.

10:04

Okay? So it's not like, we're piping in the the exact like it. It's not like a camera where there's like one lens. It's like, it's a whole bunch of different sensors. And the sensors are like, you know, it's like an array of sensors. I can rate camera sensors in the eye.

10:24

If we're just making an analogy or comparing the eye to an array of camera sensors and they're used to tech and little points of light of where a photon hit. And then from there, you're your brain, is the job of your brain is to reconstruct a picture. So that if you look at it and a bottle of of medicine and and it hits your, the light from that medicine, it's your, your eye.

10:51

And those signals I'm actually travels here. I'm simple to loads and the back of your head and your brain reconstructs that picture and the, in, in the physical cortex for. So it's believed from a city of neuroscience. And so, there's the, the idea is that your brain has to take all of these different points.

11:16

All of these different signals that are received from surface of the eye and reconstruct and image. And it was also interesting, is that it all has to reconstruct the thing. It's like, it's not not. Every person knows that the eyes covered and and blood vessels that are blocking your vision.

11:40

They're not 100% blocking. Your version was like, it's through the blood vessels but they're blocking some of your vision. In fact there's a there's a blind spot that you can detect by holding up the pencil in front of your eye with a certain with a certain distance away and you look straight at it, you can't see the tip of the pencil because that's where your blind spot is, but you don't see your blind spot because what you're you're you don't see the blood vessels there that are covering your the sensors in your eye, these your brain is just taking the points that it can detect.

12:12

And from those points, it's recon. It's constructing a picture, which is a representation internal representation of reality. And so my argument with this book is that that you are going to have. So there's, it's like, if we could, if we could see the brands of 3d sort of 3d nail network, like, like point net, or like deep learning to the point net plus, plus, is a deep learning on network for 3d classifications segmentation.

12:51

And this is a something that you can you can create point clouds. It's, you know, one way that's commonly used one classes with the light are and there's so you can use it. You can use a depth camera or two cameras that are arranged at a certain distance apart to capture depth data and construct a point cloud from that depth data.

13:19

The point cloud is just a lot of points in space that quote that, you know, if you look at this point cloud, you might be able to proceed the image of a mug or a table, or a car, but your computer. They're just points in space. The computer doesn't buy itself.

13:39

See a mug or a table or a car and just use. It's just there's no perception. It's just points in space, but a computer like, with, with pointing at plus, plus a computer can perform operations on this cloud of points to try to I classify. What? Which points belong is it it's a sort of, like, sort of, you know, there's object was called objects segmentation, say, all these points belong to one object, because they're in close proximity to each other.

14:22

And the classifications, like clear least points are that belong to this object, of course, bond to a mug. These points that are with this object of correspond, to a table, and these points that correspond to this object, point to a car. And so the computer has to figure out which points belong to which object and then what that object, of course, spawns to in terms of classifying images.

14:50

So that in that sense you can use like labeled data labeled images. We're in a computer to make comparisons to you know basically you would take like one perspective on that cloud of coins and compared to images until you find. Something that is shares enough similar features that the neural networks as well as is an 80% chance that the mug and 70% chance.

15:16

That's the table. And in addition, you know, the more, you know, the point, the point cloud can can identify. Well, these are the wings of an airplane. This is a the tail of an airplane that can do. So it's called part segmentation and semantics segmentation, you know, like okay.

15:35

Well there's here's the floor, here's the walls. Here's the lamps and the ceiling and it's taking apart the entire room. And you know just basically it's it's able to basically do object, it's combining object segmentation and parts segmentation and and in classification into one process and we call that semantic segmentation and that's really the goal of point.

16:04

Net is 3d semantics segmentation. But the argument is that that I'm making, which is not what it is, is is in part that our brains are doing. Basically three deciment, segmentation to reconstruct the, the images that were saying like that bottle of medicine. And then what happens is while the, well, that that actually, that that is, it's there's a temporal component where you'll have a group of neurons that will represent.

16:54

Because, you know, there's like, when you think of your there was this screen analogy, think your mind is like a movie for a second. Just doesn't, this is just an analogy. It's like a movie has frames. So each each moment we with well, we'll say, just imagine each second like, a movie could be 60 frames per second each second.

17:16

There's 60 frames. Okay? And we're gonna, I'm gonna argue that that. And each of those frames 60 frames per second. There's going to be a different set, is just a thought experiment. I don't know what the actual frame rate of the brain is probably a lot more than that, but we'll just say that in each.

17:40

We'll just save for the sake of the thought experiment, that there's 60 frames per second happening, okay? And and on the and the level of the brain, it's it's a brand activity is happening at the perhaps, that the millisecond level. So, maybe there's there's, you know, you know, a thousand frames per second or something, but it could be even faster.

18:07

Because you know, you could have basically, you know, there's so many neurons that you could have while individual neurons can be. So if you have a lot of them, you could do, you could be doing operations much faster. Because I basically, you know, having one so one set of neurons might go off in one millisecond but and and then in the next millisecond, that happens a whole different set of neurons could be going off.

18:43

And you might have many different, it could distribution. Could be that you have that sort of subdivide. So, you have, if you could have 60 different sets of neurons going off every every millisecond, just because the each set of neurons is located in a different place in the brain, you have.

19:05

So you have 60 neurons per second per millisecond. I mean 60 groups of neurons oscillating per millisecond just because they're in different parts of the brain because there's so many neurons. So thinking kind of could be much faster because it's it's is happening in a larger scale. Now, I'm not sure about the actual situation where I don't know, if the brain can how fast the brain is actually operating?

19:37

That's a good, it's a good open question. There's lots of opportunity for for more research, there could be hundreds of years, more research that would be done on the brain. After after this book, many hundreds of years, it depends on, you know, how how, how fast technology is going to continue accelerating.

20:01

If we think of technology in a sort of linear acceleration, then we're, you know, then I guess that might inspire us to think that there are really many hundreds of years left of of neuroscience research before we figure out every everything about the brain. But if we're thinking about technology accelerating along an exponential curve, then the neuroscience may actually reach a sort of rapid conclusion where we where science it just advances so quickly that we that it, everything that there is no about.

20:42

The brain may be discovered sometimes soon with the aid of the end of computers that well, how help accelerate the rate of discovery of new technologies. And, and, and new features of of brains, and so science, may accelerate in quite extraordinary rate ways. And but I think at the point now where we can make arguments about what is, what is fundamentally happening and the brain that causes human experience.

21:18

And so it's it's so going back to it's it's like there's there are enough frames. Okay. That as you think about 10 seconds of your own experience and you slice it up, say okay, well my eyes traveled from which is I'm just making it up to the story. But my eyes traveled from the left side of my computer screen over to the right side of my desk, where I saw the medicine bottle again, and then they traveled back to the left side of my computer screen.

21:56

Again and so that was, if you say okay that's the movie. Now you could you felt, you could feel that with a camera or depth camera. So you move your camera, you could found from the left side of the computer screen past this, the edge of the computer screen over to the medicine bottle and move the camera back and you've created a movie.

22:18

And in each frame with the movie, the frame is a little bit different and the idea is that you're you're going to have a sequence of neurons that's going to fire to represent each one of those frames. Okay? And the neurons are going to be the neural networks and you're going to be sort of learning a sequence so that they can know when they're going to fire.

22:44

They're going to predict that. There's a theory out. There called prediction. Prediction coding or coding. Yeah, predictive coding. That's what it is. And it's also sort of the same as similar ideas, is founded. A similar idea to predictive coding is found in the book on intelligence by day of hocking is where the idea is that you are, your brain is making predictions of the world, and those predictions are how it models the world.

23:19

And and so when you adjust one of draft of hawkings and you talk about intelligence, one of his examples was if you reach out and grab something like the medicine bottle and you and you you touch it. And suddenly, you hear a chicken, a chicken screaming, you'd be very surprised because you're is, you're not expecting the ball to sound like a chicken.

23:48

You're expecting the bottle to sound the way of bottle would sound. If it makes any sound, you're expecting to feel the way, a bottle would feel you had the point as you have expectations about the sensory properties of the bottle, what it feels like what it looks like, how it moves, what it's going to do.

24:10

If you take the cap off, how the cap is going to feel, when you're unscrewing it same thing, when you reach out for a door handle, this was the door handle one was was one of the ones in Jeff Hawkins book on intelligence, you reach out for a door handle, you have this prediction, your mind is going to feel and if it felt very different, it'd be a surprise and the fact that would be surprised points to the fact that you are prediction are app that you're making predictions about the world.

24:40

And and that you're representations of everything around. You are, in fact, sensory predictions. There are predictions encoded in in light patterns, and sound patterns that your brain is accepting and and reacting, but they're also encoded, they're also temporarily encoded in sequences and spatially encoded. So when you look from, let's go back to the example.

25:05

If you look from the left of your monitor to over to the medicine bottle and then back to the left of your monitor then. And I mean, my from the left of the monitor force, right of the monitor, towards medicine ball. So, and then, from the medicine bottle towards, right?

25:20

The monitor chores are left of the monitor, okay? So that's the method bottom, this series actually on the right side of the monitor. Okay, what is that? Wasn't I guess it wasn't made clear earlier. But but the point is that your brain is making sensory predictions of a reality and what's missing from this pictures, is what, where is the observer who's watching us?

25:49

Is there a little man inside the head? Where's how does this information become conscious? How does this become something that we think about? That's I think that's what I can add to the picture a little bit and so we know so you know this is a scrapbook called rhythms of the brain by the key I think is how you pronounce anyone.

26:11

I'm sure but I guess this book is spoken. But anyway, so he the book is really worth reading. It's probably mandatory for neuroscientists and neurologists to read definitely covers a lot and he's a newer book out. It's also sort of mandatory reading the brain from inside out. And but what I'm getting out of, so we have sensory predictions but we also we should look at you know, how look at the example of a point now, plus plus, and how these your brain is as a 3D null network is going to be able to do at least the same sort of operations that point net plus plus does, which is where it's your brain is going to go is okay.

26:59

Well, all the points in space connected to that medicine model to find the object of the medicine model. And I have this sort of perspective which I don't know if everyone has but I because I'm tried solving a dividend, I know what it's like not be able to distinguish the medicine bottle from the table.

27:17

Okay. I know what it's like when I can't tell one object from the next and so I know that. Yeah. My my brain is doing an object segmentation and then semantics segmentation simultaneously. It's doing that kind of deep learning operations, albeit with a different sort of, you know, does operate exactly the same.

27:39

But even though it operates in a different way, from how poignant plus plus operates, the, the guiding principles of the guiding operations of a neural network that is going to notice that, you know, these these points belong together. These features belong together. These lines belong together. These lines represent letters on the bottle.

28:13

Okay, at some point. You know, if you remember do you remember back when you first learned to read? Which I don't know, for some of you was second or third grade I actually died. I don't remember when when I first learned how to read a matter of men and kindergarten, right?

28:29

Go sharing one letters, seems like a kindergarten thing, learning letters. But the, but the point is like some point letters are indistinguishable. You can see this. When you see a language that you haven't learned get another language out there that you haven't learned and you don't know how to interpret those letters because you don't know what the letters are.

28:53

You don't have a way to distinguish. What what or what, what the shapes are of in some other language. And so you may not recognize that you're looking at a letter that you see in a lot or or a letter that is our symbol. You know, that that is very common or simple as very rare.

29:16

You may not know, probably don't know if it's language you haven't learned and and what are the associations, you know, with that symbol or that letter? What are the kinds of words or ideas that are evoked by that character? Okay. What is the contacts? What is this? Social.

29:45

Reality contacts of those symbols that you are encountering. Okay. That that actually that matters. And so, without that, without that context, it is a, it's a, it's it's it's, you know, if you are if you haven't learned Chinese and the medicine while those Chinese characters you on, at you, you may not know what medicine is in that body.

30:13

Meaning, you may not even know that it is a medicine bottle, you know? Unless someone tells you, right? I could be anything but but you, you might, you might know if you if you see the of course that an English version of the same bottle next to like, if you're any, if you're an English beauty speaker and you see an English version of the bottle and looks very similar to the Chinese version of the bottle, you might infer that the Chinese version of the bottle is the same thing as the English version, especially, if you look at on the back and the numbers representing the amount of medicine in each castle are are the same.

30:53

Maybe they both say 500 milligram or 500 something, you know, on the back and but the beginning to getting to the thing is, is was interesting about marine, is that you're, you're neuron activity. Not only has to have an in sequences where you have neurons that are basically there in the dent and dendrite area.

31:30

They're receiving signals. And in the dendrite, in some areas, receiving signals from different nearby neurons. And that is causing the the neuron, the neuron firing rate to increase or decrease. So the thing that it's not really like sort of, like explained clear clearly in and like computational neuroscience 101 is, is that neurons or basically, it's not really clearly explaining the sort of temporal reality of neurons.

32:04

So they're basically always firing it, like tonic rates. They're always trying it. They're always firing tonically like sort of like a gaussian or random sort of pad and or basically with with a with an oscillator, with a group of neurons that are all sort of firing tonic at the same rate, okay?

32:24

But in order to have a sequence where as you look from the left of the monitor towards the right of the monitor, towards the bottle, from the bottle, towards the, right and monitor towards left of the monitor, you have to have a sequence of neurons, that is going to fire for, for each sort of like place placement of, where your eyes are in, a given span of time.

32:51

Let's say, you're, you're looking from the left into the right over and over again, at whatever's in front of you. Okay? And your your eyes are moving from left into the right and you are feeling that and so that you can say, okay well this is 10 seconds of my conscious experience.

33:10

I'm going to divide this and then advice into milliseconds. So so millisecond is a thousand milliseconds. In one second, this 10,000 milliseconds and each one of those frames, then could have different neurons that are being affected in that in that moment and each one of those frames. So 10,000 milliseconds is each one of the different group of neurons that fire to react to represent that one moment.

33:40

So it's like if we go look at point net and the point, net is going to recognize. Well, this is a table and this is a chair. And this is a floor and this is the lambda. This is a ceiling. This is a desk. This is a coffee cup.

33:53

It does cement 3D semantics segmentation. Well it's as if you're going to have an entire group of neurons that are going to be doing that and each mouse second for, for 10,000 milliseconds, were 10 seconds. And what's happening is that the neurons that aren't firing are listening for when they're going to fire?

34:21

But so that they can predict when I want to fire but the thing is is that they're also they're not just in it. We're arguing that the prediction of when they're going to fire is part of how you're creating over the representation. So it's predicting a neuron is going to predict like it's like before you reach out for the medicine bottle, you have this prediction of what it's going to feel like when you before you grab in your hand, okay?

34:49

And so that is like those are dendrites being activated in your brain, just matters it. Interests are the first part of a neuron and this proceeding signal and it's predicting that it's going to that your hand is going to close around the bottle and it's predicting when the ball is going to feel like it's the bottle doesn't feel like a bottle of it.

35:10

Feels like a chicken's head or a bug's head where you reach out and grab the bottom sudden you're holding a road that's going to be very surprising and that's a prize is generated because you have this prediction in your brain which is certain neurons are expecting the fire but different neurons fire instead and that creates a surprise because you're saying it didn't go as expected.

35:31

So, you had these predictions, that weren't correct. And and so you get novel experiences in vineyard, you know, you're you're gonna notice that I'm a little bit more because it's getting like a novel activity pattern, it's creating something for your brain to pay attention to which escapes the normal sort of expectation.

35:54

But I what I'm saying is like, okay. So you so you have, you know, your brain activity happening in multiple stages or multiple steps or multiple frames, you have neurons that are firing listening from when they're going to fire so they can fire correctly in the right sequence. So you so that when you're way, when you're moving the your eyes from left to the right, you're not experiencing things in the wrong order because you're neurons are firing in the right order, right?

36:20

If you experience the right side of the screen on the left side of the screen, and the left side of the screen, on the right side of the screen, then then your neurons will be firing in the wrong order. That's kind of, that's the kind of weird. You know, thing that can happen.

36:32

When people are hallucinating, is they see things that are not? Not there. There's not rendered correctly. Yes, seeing them correctly. You're saying, you know, patterns on top of things you're seeing the shape of reality change. Certain hostations will take you to other worlds. And and, you know, or make you see aliens talk to aliens because your brain activity is being confused by the medication which which, which I believe is may possibly be very healthy sort of medication in certain contexts there's definitely a, it's not, it's a negative to confusion your brain with psychedelic medication or definitely, that could be very creative thought and to yes.

37:29

Like Steve Jobs, was it was a fan of LSD said, one of the best things that he ever did was to take out the. And I think that, you know, that's one of the reasons silicon valley has sort of like see looking Valley has become like a leader leading, the representative as a the sort of like the beginning of the computer industry is associated with Silicon Valley, you know, in Apple computer and and and of course you know, later on Google and other companies.

38:05

Other tech companies, Microsoft, Microsoft I guess is more redmond but but a lot of tech companies, a lot of computer companies sort of got their start and silicon Valley. But another thing about Silicon Valley was that there was a lot of it's a place where you can get LSD.

38:22

There's a lot of psychedelic medications, there's a lot of basically you know, it's just you're you're your brain is is supercharged, overcharged creatively inspired. And you have amazing visions that go on to revolutionize the world. It's the psychedelic medication can be the door. It's called the doorways of perception by the doorway of perception.

38:57

All this huxley phrase. It, I think he coined that phrase. The story of reception all this honestly. And, but what I'm saying is, is that

39:14

If you go, if you go as step further and you know, we can look at, you know, your brain is listening to your brain, your most of your neurons don't have contact to your sensory organs. So you've got these got neurons that are in your eye and those are collecting sensory data.

39:39

But after that, you know, after your sort of primary excitatory neurons, then you have your, you know, you love your brain. You the neurons that don't have direct connections to to sensory inputs or direct connections. A sensory outputs like motor entry motor outputs and in those are the interns and the intern neurons.

40:07

And internal inhibitory system is the system that I I think it's like, you know, there's all these different ways of signals can travel, right? And you've got, you've got features. You've got, you know, basically patterns coming into the brain and let's say that you have this representation of a cat and a cat's tail.

40:36

But you don't see how to cat in a cat sound connected because the cat is hidden by an adult. Well if you've seen cats before then you know this tail is part of the cat. So you've never seen the cat in the cat's tail. You know, never seen a cat's tail on a cat before It's possible.

40:52

You could be confused paint into into what the tail is or that or the fact that the tail is connected to the cat. If you don't see that it's connected to the cat. If all you see is a tail on one on one side of the pole and the cat in the other side of the pole that tail could belong to a different animal.

41:10

I make that argument because, you know, computers you know, can make that mistake computers that are tasked with computer vision and then and there's this thing called that with the happens a lot with two dimensional, convolutional neural networks called where where you're the, it's called overfeeding, you know where you have use a process, like, reading descent or or drop out to, to randomly delete some of the data.

41:43

And, you know, I make this drug. It's like, you know, when you're killing your brain cells with alcohol, they're randomly deleting some here, so your brain data but that could have a beneficial effect and that it forces your brain to say, okay, well, we'll shit, we're missing the data that connects the cast tail to the cat, but because we're missing data a lot.

42:08

The we have to learn to make more creative connections between things that seem to be separate because we can't because there's a pole between the cat and the cat's tail from your perspective because the cat is behind the pole. But because you're, you're your brain, or because the computer is a dropout, you know, grading the set is, is able to make that creative connection to say, okay?

42:40

Well, even though there's, there's a clear gap between the cast down the cat. There's enough feature similarities with similar fur colors similar, you know, they're both moving. Nothing else is moving that it can make a sort of creative sleep and say, okay well maybe even though they're not physically connected, these two things are are actually connected and maybe it can be into say, okay?

43:04

Well, there's something in front of the cat, that's this blocking the connection between the tail and, and the cat. And that I think, is the sort of value of psychedelic medication, which can do weird things to your brain. But those where things may cause you to have leaves and creativity creative genius, which is, which can lead to the creation of like, Apple computer, as the result of psychedelic medication.

43:31

Use and, you know, certain consents, maybe, maybe I would say, well, the results of alcohol use happened. Been as impressive this psychedelic use like we, you know, psychedelics people invented, computer companies with alcohol, they invented dictatorships. Right? So so maybe the alcohol is a little bit too aggressive for the human brain.

43:56

It's hard to say dictatorships. I mean, like, you know, church, okay Cathedrals and just imagine that, you know, like a giant cathedral and rises high up into the sky with inspires but all around the landscape. There's, there's just little houses. So the church just like physically dominates space. And anyone who visits a church just knows that the ultimate power and dictatorship is there and that building and everyone and anyone and everyone else is to pee on compared to, you know, sort of headquarters of the church.

44:39

This is what kind of like, you know, architectures, that it's creative, but it might be more sort of, it's not as genius as a computer company, you know, a computer company, right? That's genetic that, that is sort of like a much maybe a much better way to tease your brain into and to the kind of work that will revolutionize the world.

45:05

And I I've really enjoyed for me personally, I've enjoyed psychedelics since I was about sick age 16. When I, I was in high school and I, I tried someone gave me LSD, and I took it in class, not really knowing that much about it. And I remember telling your girl in front of me, in class said, I'm on LSE right now.

45:29

She said no, where I don't believe you and just thought that was funny and I believe that was at Magnolia High School.

45:43

Took the last year Magnolia has got when I was a student there but been moving on, I think that the point is that he we saw this sort of like question, okay, so I've got this idea of if the brain is a 3d nail network then it should be able to do at least the kinds of operations that point net plus plus does point.

46:09

Net is by the way, still, even though it is a, it does 3d semantic. Segmentations reduce 3d objects segmentation 3d classification on point sets. It does those things but it is not a 3D neural network in terms of its substrate in terms of how it's constructed. So at 2D computational process.

46:32

But in the human brain, the human brain is is an actual 3d neural network which means that that, you know, a cortical column both. The neuron and a cortical column, which is several, which is men neurons. There is the receiving information from from every direction from from above and from below from the left into the right from Ford.

47:02

And from back, it's sending and receiving information. It's, it's a bidirectional fixed off neural network, right? And it in the intern neurons, right? In the neural columns and the center of your brain. They never have any contact with you with the real world dirty, in the middle of your brain.

47:22

So all they get is the information. You got to see it from the from the cortical columns point of view, all they get is the information from the neurons. So they have to listen to other neurons to predict when they're going to fire in a sequence. So that what when you move your eyes from left into the right?

47:38

The stuff that's on your left stays in your lab to set us on your right? Just this goes here right? There's this one time outside. You had the story where I experienced reality out of the correct time sequence. Where I was I was taking LSD at at home and I was still in high school.

47:58

The time I think I was still 16 and I, I walked down the stairs and outside, because my parents had called me for some reason. And then I walked back inside up the stairs and into a lounge area. And then when I was in the lounge area, I experienced myself.

48:22

Walking up the stairs. It was in fact like my brain was playing back the climb up the stairs in the wrong order. So I saw I experienced myself having climbed up the stairs after I was already upstairs. So like you brain. It's like, that's when you're neurons are firing out of order, okay?

48:43

That's something that that can happen on psychedelic medication and so that. So that's the thing is, is you your brain has to the nerves have to fire in the right, or that means they're listening for when they're supposed to fire. They're learning temporal sequences. There is a so that they can find writers that you experience time in the right order.

49:08

Otherwise you'd have a lot of trouble navigating reality if you weren't experiencing time in the correct order, that would be very dangerous for you. There's also such things that go wrong with your interception but not to get too far down that road, I experiencing time in the wrong orders is one thing.

49:32

But and I was interesting, is there, this is, this has been depicted in fiction and science fiction. Definitely remember episodes at Star Trek, where Captain Picard was experiencing time and in the wrong order where he could heat experience the past in the future right after one another, especially some of the, the later episodes, the final episodes of the original Star Trek.

50:00

Next Generation series. He was, he went to the future, his his version of the future, and then he went to the past and he was traveling back and forth between the past and the future to try to fix some catastrophe. And and his future self has some sort of terrible disease.

50:22

That's gonna be, that was pretty serious and not something he can get out of, but, but maybe he could go back in time and and fix something. And I freaked with that was that he was gonna fix because they had because I haven't seen that a long time ago, but it's interesting that that sort of like experiencing reality out of order is has also made it into stories and fiction and and I've had a experience like that and and that is and so so I'm just mastered like making this point to say, well your brain actually has to learn sequences.

51:00

This is a reality so that your neurons can fire on the right order to represent each stage of reality. And the order that you're experiencing it and not in the wrong order and predictive codings, sort of gives us part of the template of how, this, how of, how this sequence can't happen because if a neuron doesn't actually fire at like, so let's say that to create the representation, the neuron handifier.

51:35

But before it creates the representation, it creates a prediction by having a smaller firing event. It's called a forward. Dendritic action potential. There's also even smaller possible events. Like, there's a sentence, there's a synapse action, potential event, sort of like a sentence firing. So, synapses individual, synapses or receptors on the, on the dendrite.

52:05

So the dendrite is like, if you look, if you look at your hand and imagine that your fingers are or the branch, or the branches of a dendrite and where you touch your fingers, each of those points where you touch fingers, like these points. It can't eat speech points of contact in your skin.

52:22

Just imagine that that is represented by is representative of the

52:34

The synapse. All right, so if you touch your finger and anywhere in different places, touch different fingers and different places. Like imagine that when those touches those are, those were like, synapse. Those are like your synapses receiving little chemical little packets of chemicals and and where you've been touched in your fingers, when you're touching your fingers, with other fingers that you're creating the sort of analogy of synaptic synapses.

53:05

And now, imagine that you, clap clap, all your fingers together, okay? And that is like, when you clap all your fingers together. Imagine that is that's that's closer to you're creating a much bigger signal on your hand. And that, that could be, you know, closer to like the dendritic forward, the Android action potential or forward spike strongly.

53:30

Not really, I think. AP is actually the wrong word is think of the is the sort of electrical spec from the dendrite and the electrical space from the dendrite. They go to the Soma, right? And you need to have a certain number of these arriving, was in a certain frequency to, to represent a pattern that has been that, you know, that that the that it means that neuron has detected a certain pattern.

54:01

Thanks, if you get enough of these dendrites then a certain pattern has been detected. And in the cell, has a sort of duty to sort of, like, only fire when receives a certain kind of pattern within a certain millisecond range, you know, and, you know, like, it's like that cell on your eye.

54:20

That like only fires when something's moving from left to right in your vision. Well, that is a pattern that's all set to look for and it's like, okay well each of your each of your bend, right? To set to look for a certain patterns based upon previous patterns. So the previous patterns that it received help.

54:40

Help to set up, what it's going to be looking for, okay? So if it sees what it's been looking for, then it fires also has to, you know, not fire when it receives signals that it hasn't been looking for. So, so there's this, this process where the anyway, long story short is that, is that it is at some point, you know, you clap your fingers together and then, and that's a lot of signal happening versus, you know, just touching one of your fingers, one at a time.

55:15

That's a bigger sort of forward spike. And then now, the poem doesn't matter. That the poem of your hand is like this summer. And the summer is so your fingers are like the dendritic branches, and that the but they all ended in the palm of your hand. The ends of your fingers, come to the palm of your hand.

55:37

That's that's like the soma of a neuron and if you get enough signals from each of your fingers, right? That the then what could happen then is the soma can fire and the so much can fires. Like imagine you, take your two hands and you clap them together, so you're making even bigger signals.

55:56

Clap your two hands together loud. Bam, that that's like a soma firing event. That's a big event, okay? And that event is when the big that's, that's the real action potential. And in see the thing is, the thing is, I think was not, clearly explained, sort of, as a temporal reality of action potentials in it.

56:23

It's explained in neuroscience, but it's not necessarily explaining computational neuroscience 101. Because we, because it, because the computational residents is about one sort of step of over neuron function, but they're not. There is they're thinking about a single moment of a neuron function, not about how the neurons changing over time.

56:45

So so when neurons fire a tonically, they're all firing same time, big and big clusters, but it doesn't really seem like like that may contain that much information. If you just have large amounts of neurons and all firing the same time tonic firing, doesn't seem like it and and may contain information.

57:08

It might, but it'd be like, using a whole bunch of neurons. So do a little whole whole little. It's like if they're all firing, they're all basically have the same information and you're using a whole bunch of neurons to do something. Very simple, some art. So so how is it that if you have an individual neuron is designed to look for one pattern, right?

57:35

But all of that, like basically it could fly, it might flyer and it might change the firing rate of that. Neuron, the fine rate could increase the decrease, but even if that happens, the rest of the oscillation of that neuron pulls, that neuron back into Austin, but back into tonic oscillation with the rest of neurons.

57:51

So even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired it sooner or later than it normally fires, that's just this temporary pattern but this actually what we want. Because like imagine that when you move from the left to the right, not only is it the case that neurons need to fire.

58:15

You know, when you're looking as you move your eyes from what to rain, you're gonna need to fire in the right order. Like your piano. I am but like, like, you know, you play piano notes but you also don't want to be firing. You don't want to continue to be firing constantly.

58:39

It's like, they'd be like hearing a piano note that never stops that piano note needs to die away. So the next piano note can be heard and that next piano note needs to die away. So the next note is we heard. So we kind of need the so if a neuron differentiates from the rest of the group that needs to be a temporary thing in order for the transition of perception to change, they say well so no now.

59:08

Where's the observer works little man in your head deserving. All these patterns well I just so happens. The predictive coding gives us a sort of gives us a distributed man inside your head. It's it says okay well you have neurons that are listening. You've interns it don't come in contact with the outside world, but they are listening to other neurons.

59:32

So you have neurons that wait, for their turn. You see, there's this example and EEG, where you can put connect to people. The EG separately in separate rooms and measure their, their the brain. They're power spectrum. The brainwave frequencies off of beta. Theta does algebra and alphabetically that Indiana, alphabet, delta, and Yama.

01:00:01

So you can see what power spectrum is dominant in the brain. Now, you bring these two people together and you have them start talking you in. What you'll see is that their brain waves become in sync with one another. You'd also see this in birds and other animals in versus especially when births are communicating, they're brain lands, become in sync.

01:00:20

You have without even measuring their brain waves. You can notice that one bird will be silent while the other bird trips and then the other bird trips, where the other bird remains silent. So, they take turns talking to each other, but the argument is that this is happening. Also inside your brain, right, where there's this sort of where, you know, going back to the piano analogy, to play a piano music, you need to have a tone that plays, and then another tone and then that's home.

01:00:51

But then because your neurons need to know when they're going to fire. They need to predict when they're going to fire so they can play a sequence like a piano sequence. That means you're neurons are listening to other neurons firing. So it's like, when two birds are listening, one word of speaking chirping.

01:01:08

The bird is not tripping. It's like that's in sort of analogous. What's happening inside your brain? If once it have neurons firing, you have other sets of neurons listening. And then the next iterance fire and other sets of neurons listening one neuron fires, others are inhibited, one neuron fires, others are inhibited.

01:01:26

When they're on fires, others are inhibited and they sequences of firing, inhibitions happen in cascading patterns. And then so then you're you brain, can create temporal and spacial representations. So you can notice, when you move your eyes from left into the right, you have a temple. You're having a temporal end.

01:01:47

Spatial a recognition. You recognizing spatially? What is what objects are there? All these points belong to this object, like this medicine bottle, and all of these, you know, or that's my monitor. That's the last time I monitor. That's the right side of my monitor and in and as I move my eyes from left to right, the stuff that's on our left stays in the left except it's on the right season.

01:02:09

Alright. And I can tell that the medicine bottle is not separate is separate from the table because I'm doing a semantic segmentation. But my brain is doing the temporal separation, right? Because if it was all because I wasn't doing a temporal synthesis separation, semantics a temporal semantics. I would segmentation in addition to a spatial semantic segmentation then then I would see two bottles at the same time or four bottles or eight bombs or I would see all the space time is blur.

01:02:41

So my brain is really doing both a temporal anticipation segmentation it's noticing that there's one bottle, it's not taking them past memory of of that bottle and putting it on top of the same bottle. Like, you might see, you know, if you had too much drink, you might see two, how many fingers am I holding up, okay?

01:03:03

Because that phrase, how many fingers my holding up? If you don't. If like, if you're holding up two fingers. And someone says four, they have double vision because they've drank they've drunk too much. Okay. So double vision is like, yeah well the temporal sequences your brainer or not operating correctly, that person is drunk but it is it points to the fact that your brain is doing temporal sequences in the first place.

01:03:32

The fact that, you know, that there's just two fingers and someone else is seeing four because they're drunk. So we have these representations of sequences of the world around us and I'm saying that, you know, we've got Jeff Hawkins book and we've got predictive coding on intelligence. So we've got predictive coding, that point us to, you know, a method for how the brain could be making templates.

01:04:07

Patient. Frequencies as it had a brain. Can be connecting the dots in in terms of recognizing template, spatial patterns from incoming streams and data. Okay? So this is a, this is a something that that's why part of the point. Net is is definitely a useful to if you listen to like YouTube lectures on a point now plus plus yeah if you find a good one then you'll get an idea, you get a good and analogy of how a computer within neural network can turn a representation of points and it's received into the recognition of an object and classify that object.

01:05:04

It's a classify those points and that's semantics segmentation, if a computer neural network can do that, then it's really a human neural network. Can and I, so I've actually seen friend of mine a while back, I won't mention his name, he wouldn't want it to, he would not meet me to tell you who he is because because, you know, the government is a conspiracy and all that, right?

01:05:29

But he created a three known network in in unity. And he, I won't tell you how how he built it. I know, but it's it's not my place to talk about his his work and exposes work. But what I'll tell you is that he is just three new networking in unity.

01:05:54

You need is a 3D game engine. And the neural networking soft was was consisting of objects inside this 3D game engine. And what he did was he connected depth cameras like the Microsoft deserved death depth cameras to this neural network. And it took the representations from those depth cameras and created sort of like the neural network matched.

01:06:23

The representations of those cameras. So we thought we saw what I saw was a three dimensional representation of the data from the depth cameras that the three, you know, network was making. And it was so easy to just take a camera data and turn it into a and in apply it, send that data into a 3D neural network and have it output over representation of the camera data.

01:06:54

And I thought, well if we if you can do this in unity, you know what I mean? Like, what I just point to is that. Yeah. If you if our brain, if we think about rains, the three to now network and all of our brands have to do is is sort of like accurately reconstruct pattern that that matches, what we are seeing then, then the parts of the brain that are listening to that pattern can make the connections between the points and being represented and so the learning of an object, a 3D representation of an object can be extracted from from 3D points.

01:07:46

From from, from the points received from your sentences so your brain can learn 3D planes. Now we still haven't got to the part of like how this becomes conscious information or what the observer effect is.

01:08:04

And so, so my hope. So going back to rhythms with the brain bysaki, what we have in, you know, of course and predictive coding and the workment on intelligence. And so on we have is neurons that are listening to other neurons in temporal sequences to figure out when they're going to fire.

01:08:33

So they're making predictions we have this knowledge set. Basically when you're, when you have this prediction of how the bottles may feel that representation, it may be consisting of sort of like dendritic forward potentials towards biking potentials but not the action potential. So it's like the neuron is collecting all those data for a long time which is predicting what it's going to fire, okay?

01:09:05

And the physical collection of that data up into the point that it fires rubbers is the sort of manifest representation of you of what a door handles going to feel like before you touch the door handle and at the moment that you touched the door handle and it has exactly like what you thought it was gonna feel like that's the moment when you're neurons fire to represent the feeling of door handle in time and space but up until you touch.

01:09:33

The door handle that representation exists as activity in the dendrites and an activity and below threshold activity in the summer. So, so the neurons so it's like, yeah, you're gonna have neurons that are gonna represent that door handle both before and during you touching the door handle. And so that's how you have these, like, pretty so.

01:09:59

But what that means is that is that, you know, going back to the birds is, you know, when one word, turps and other bird listens and then the other bird trips the first breath listens. And so you have these sort of alternations in the oscillation. So the oscillations brainwave oscillations are alternations and neural firing.

01:10:21

And when one group of neurons are firing another group of neurons is listening, and this is the analogy of, you know, when one person is speaking in another person's listening and when two people are speaking back and forth, their brain starts to the power bands spectrum of the brains.

01:10:36

It's measured. The EG starts to synchronize because they're both on the same wavelength during that conversation. And and so the oscillation see this is, this is the key. I think it is that for not, a neuron is not just a receiver or center of information. It's also transmitter information.

01:10:58

Every single neuron is receiving information and it's transmitting information, so receive around transmitter and you have these, you have neurons firing a different one neurons when one neuron is firing other neurons are inhibited because they're in their listening. So most. So it's it's some it's that most of the time you're neurons are listening and they're not firing if they fire tonically, they fired regular rings and then when they fire because of because they have heard a patent that they recognize.

01:11:30

Okay? Because they recognize well hey it's my time to fire and I'm going to represent what this person is experiencing right now. Okay. That's like a louder sound than a neuron. Can make when the action potential fires from a soma and someone bursts. Okay. That's that said, in the moment representation of something that's happening right now, baboon.

01:11:52

This is the event baboon, I don't know if that's right. Maybe that's something I sound but but that is a, that is a different. It's not a tonic frequency, that's a phasic frequency, it's a phasic pattern. It's phase of frequency pattern and so you can say it, we can go into.

01:12:12

Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.

01:12:49

It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.

01:13:11

It dissipates. So the next sound period. All right, so it's it's a it's designed to the hidden piano key boom. There's got to fade out. So the oscillation pulls it down, but the oscillation itself by pulling it down, means that every other neuron in the oscillation is noticing it.

01:13:31

Because odd, because of the dynamics of power dynamics of the oscillation, it's, it's, they have to the whole group of neurons has to reach a sort of equilibrium. So you have a neuron, the fires out of order, it's either faster or slower, the rest of the group, can feel the rest of your consents, that one neuron.

01:13:50

So, the whole so that firing pattern, that happens is notice not by, not just by one neural simultaneously. But by the entire oscillations, I'm obviously it's like the oscillation is the it's like when I'm arguing. It's like the oscillation is like the the canvas and the the phase pattern is the ink on the canvas.

01:14:20

So the canvas of perception or the, or the the canvas of of consciousness or we can't the canvas of mental workspace and the ink on network space is the deviations from the canvas, the distinctions from the campus, right? So so it's like the ground of the ground of being which is just raw, perception, raw awareness.

01:14:43

That's the oscillation in the objects, in the mind that you recognize it. Those are deviations from the ground of being from the pure awareness. So it's like that. The and there's that using some mystical language but it's it's kind of like there is this canvas of consciousness and then there's objects that are painted on that kind of the canvas and the object are painted or what are what's being collected by the neurons that are listening in predictive coding, but the deep.

01:15:22

But and in so those are creating temporary etchings and the oscillations are erasing them like making the tones that are played by the piano go away, so that newtons can be played. So the brain isn't continually moving to be in a ready state to receive more notes to play.

01:15:38

More knows to represent more. Thanks. Okay, but then so it's like the brain. The brain is playing music to itself, right? So the notes go off and one area, like one bird chirping while the other bird listens, but like once I've neurons fires, another set listens. So, the brain is receiving and transmitting data, but it's like one group of, it's like one, it's like, the, it's like one group is creating a pattern, and other group is observing a pattern.

01:16:16

So you have this sort of, well, that is, that's what I'm saying is, that's basically qualia. It's basically an internal representation and an observer. The observer is one group of neurons, observing another group of neurons firing and that is the basis of. It's, a basic idea of of consciousness, is that you're gonna have one group of neurons.

01:16:41

That's listening to another group of neurons fire. And what's, what's firing? It has includes patterns that are temporal spatial and phasic and phasic in terms of like you know, these are these are frequencies that go beyond it, the go beyond the physics as opposed to tonic. So faceobok is exotic which is like slow and regular signals and answers a slow and regular time consolation.

01:17:19

That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that faceobok firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.

01:17:38

That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.

01:18:04

And, and so the, so my argument is also, the brain is, brain is a finite state machine. And that the total the finance state machine is, the total summary of all the patterns between point zero zero to hurts and six hundred hertz that could possibly happen in the brain and in all spatial regions of the brain.

01:18:32

And in basically from synapses to dendrites, to action, potentials to, to oscillations, no matter what size, the hurts signal is coming from, whether it's coming from something really small, like a synapse or something. Really large like a dipole. Then what happens is you've got different scales of phasic ratonic oscillations that are playing out with temporal patterns and they're playing out with I'm sorry.

01:19:15

You've got different scales of physical tonic frequencies in oscillation that are playing out between at different scales of tonic frequencies or phasic frequencies in oscillation that are playing at a difference. Different scales from from synapses to dendrites, to Soma to, you know, the activity of a small neural circuit, to the activity of like a large cortical column to the activity of a brain region and a dipole.

01:19:59

The dipole representing the brain. You know, a magnetic moment or electromagnetic moment or electric moment for for a large reason of brain activity or for a large oscillator such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. And so, we've got these

01:20:22

Frequencies which, you know, there's that. They there they're these are frequencies of, you know, they had there's we can consider them in terms of just like frequencies that are encoded with sound, like Soliton, waves or encoded in, you know, sort of like, like a magnetic wave. And it's a very sort of thickest day will information containing sound and that can travel, it can travel and ricochet through the brain.

01:20:59

And so there was actually, there's one time. When I I, I tried to mess you in. I tried to ate a lot of not parity but some pedroactists the mask when many times but there's there was this one time that I felt that I could hear my voice inside my head as a series of discrete moments when different neurons were firing as if.

01:21:27

Imagine if a neuron is a, is a long cable, and along this cable, there's a, there's a bunch of different points which sounds are are, being are appearing. And so, like, like the sound could be like, just part of the voice could be just part of a word. And if you, if you progress like going back to like, a movie like a time, like a, like if you look at, you know, 10 seconds, if you're of your mind, if you go back and in see your mind is like a movie now, just think of your voice is a movie, just like an audio track, right?

01:22:07

And different parts of the audio tracker represent this phrase, different parts of the auto track. The represent this phrase different parts of the audio track represent this phrase. Each part of the audio cats is going to be a different set of neurons and fires. Just like, you know, looking from the left into the right each moment in that frame or in the audio track is going to be represented by different set of neurons.

01:22:33

And as the neuron fires through as the as the as the brain fires through through like here we go to through each stage. When I, when I'm speaking, you can hear a different vowel or different sound here. Different sound in each moment and all the sounds together. Add up to words and sentences.

01:23:04

And, but the idea is that in each moment, there's there's a different in that pipeline, that's, that is, that is a neuron, there's a disorder, that's many neurons and the pipeline of neural activity as as if we follow a neural circuit among across, many different nouns. Each each one of those neurons is firing in that sequence of neural activity.

01:23:27

It's going to represent that one part of that, one person's voice, okay? And so that is it's like, here your brand saying okay, well I'm gonna represent your thought, I'm gonna play your thought back to you as a sequence of bits and the sequence of frequencies, we listen to your, if you listen to your voice, or someone else's voice, like, if you just like pause on one, sound on one sound just pronounce the word just pronounce the letter d, really silly.

01:24:01

The right. That is a frequency. It's a frequency and has a spatial characteristic, too. Where is it sound coming from how loud? Is it? How big is the sound? How quiet is a sound? 

01:24:23

But it has spatial. It has sound, doesn't just have a frequency. It has associated characteristics. Has spatial characteristics. Where's the voice coming from? Does it come from this room? It's coming from the next room. Is it coming from yourself? Is coming from somewhere else? Just spatial characteristics, the sound has.

01:24:44

So I want to argue yeah everything has spatial characteristics and temporal characteristics and physic characters like you're feelings feelings. They have a peak moment, you know, it's like you feel this amount when something great happens and you feel great for a moment. So that moment when as the high and that comes down and you and then there's a low and then there's like, you know, people sometimes they'll drink the hub drink and they'll feel high when they're drunk or when they have some other drug, they feel high for a while and then and then maybe the brain comes down and they feel low for a while.

01:25:25

And like the next day I went to those people feel very like sometimes people have hangovers after drinking the night after drinking alcohol and they feel really low in the morning. So they felt high that night before and they feel very low in the morning and they're grumpy in the morning because they're having a hangover and their brain, the brain went high, but then their brain went low and the low feelings might aspire them to drinking again because they want to feel good again.

01:25:50

Even though the feeling bad was caused by by them, you know taking the thing that made them feel good. So they keep drinking like, oh, it felt good when I was drinking and that feels bad. So, I want to drink again to feel good, but even now that it's, but it's the drinking that's causing them to feel bad.

01:26:13

And if they just gave it up then the brain is like it is and it's more, you're just like imbalancing. So stretching the brain, you know, for all the highs, the people get with alcohol, there below those come later on. As a result of, as the price of that high, sort of been that the befores of has the physical and functional forces of 10 saggy, what we have information, as a, physical and functional force of 10xy and information where you can have basically a moment where I'm gonna say about, you know, like the there's a dialectic or conflict between two different ideas where if you have like if you push again if one culture pushes against another it builds its own sort of dialectic opponent, you know if you have an element of government saying okay well we we don't like that.

01:27:50

They that that is creating a sort of pushback, sort of dialectic opponent sort of functional 10 segregating where the the information which is like simultaneously faceobok. But also electromagnetic is being generated to sort of push back against that force being pushed on the rest of humanity. And that's what that is the reason why authoritarian regimens eventually topple because they're creating their own opponents and their opponents keep growing because there be because they're behavior is is you know, creating too many negative ways and those ways come back, it's this sort of like principal of opposing forces in it.

01:28:46

Confines space. Eventually the eventually the if there are tensions will who are pushing to change other people's change human culture, to be what they see, it ought to be well will experience the push back that they don't expect it will come into unexpected ways and so that could that could involve some sort of revolution.

01:29:23

I don't know. I don't know what how that would manifest and it could be. It could be not a revolution, but but just a another kind of unexpected change in the future.

01:29:39

That I don't know. Maybe we're who the people in charge of the country might be different people, but it might be a sort of non non non-revolutionary revolution, certain transition, I guess to a different group of people in charge who a little bit more enlightened and and and progressive thinking.

01:30:09

But you know, but then there's there's this, let's not go too far into that. So yeah. So this is some things that you're going back to, you know, we've got your brain is capable of creating really complex, representations of sounds and images. And we know that your brain is it's listening to your brain to you know, neurons are listening to the neurons.

01:30:41

So that's the observer right there. That's the distributed man inside your brain. You've got part of your brain. This is going to part of your brain and, and when you put it together, that's pretty simple that, you know, consciousness or conscious perception at least, involves this component of your brain, listening to your brain's representations of reality.

01:31:06

And that's how that's how you your brain is part of how your brain is building. Qualia a lot of other things, you know, especially with the studies of, you know, anesthesia in terms of what gets turned off and in pyramidal cells. And was it ever seen and waking rain and a sleeping brain?

01:31:30

There's instead of the anesthesia, it's also great stuff but there's also the

01:31:40

You know, the question of. Well, what's the difference between conscious information and information? That's not conscious like, your brain is collecting stuff. It's listening for firing patterns but it's not like your conscious of everything simultaneously and then that is in part because, you know, your brain has to in order for one thing to be paid to be in focus.

01:32:05

And one moment of time, it might have inhibits something else. It's like you've got to turn off a lot of switches in order to turn the light on to thing you're focusing on. So there's always going to be a sort of like you know in order to in order to for there to be in order for brain to make differences between one type of pattern and none other, you've got to turn off the patterns that are not relevant while you're turning on the patterns that are relevant and that that is where the the internet inhibitory system especially comes into power, sort of, it's sort of like a live real-time.

01:32:46

I think that the internet enter neuron inhibitory system as sort of live real time back propagations system. And it's kind of like, okay, well I see a cat's head and I'm expecting to see a cat's tail, but if I don't see a cat's tail, then the expectation of a castale needs to become inhibited because there's no cast out.

01:33:17

Maybe here, the cat doesn't have a tail, right? Or maybe it's not a cat. Maybe it's actually a rabbit. I'm never seen a rabbit before and I just mistook it for a cat. So rabbits have very different tails. It's like bushy. It's like a bushy short bushy thing or is the cast out along longer thing and and not as bushy.

01:33:43

And so if I so at that point, you know, hopefully the representation of a long cast tail is not something and I see I might see dealing with the only way I see it. A cat's tail on a on a rabbit probably would be, if I was, you know, doing some really hard to hallucinations right because there's not there's no cats telling a rabbit, but if you're bringing functioning correctly, you're going to have, you know, maybe maybe you start out with this prediction that you're looking at a cat, but then you notice it's a bushy tail.

01:34:12

A small bushy town instead. And so instead of representing the cats tail, which you get is, is some of the features of an animal. The brain is going to represent some of the features of an animal and those features are going to They're gonna require some changes because you because it's because the features of it of a bunny are different for the features of a cat.

01:34:39

So we don't want to give you brain doesn't want to give you the memory of a cat wants to represent the bunny accurately. So to order to accommodate those changes what happens is we've got what I what I think it was the train track train track system of intern the internet on inhibitory system.

01:34:56

So the so the train tracks, the train tracks. Get thrown. And and instead of seeing, you know, because there's no cats tail, there's a bunny tail and that means a different feature that and and what was expected has been seen. And so now, the representation is inaccurate. Representation of a rabbit.

01:35:19

You tell this was quite different from the previous representation of a cat, okay? And, and so, you can have the same sort of neurons that fired the same odds. The same oscillatory network that fired to represent a cat. Has now been changed because of inter neurons because it does though they're they're causing inhibitory changes and how the signals are flowing and that same oscillator how the signals are flowing in that moment so that that that the pattern has merging where in area where the cat was is now no longer no longer representing a cat pattern and representing a bunny pattern or rabbit pattern with a ram.

01:36:05

It was a ponytail especially bunny tap bush a bushy ponytail. And so the this is a, this is this, this means that basically like a the idea is that you can have an also toy network can represent completely different sets of patterns like you know, and thanks the internet on system so you can have you can you can say okay well your brain is right now, your brain is gonna represent the bunny and the same neurons that represent the bunny.

01:36:44

Now, they're gonna represent a cat. Now that group of drone is gonna represent a dog because different patterns get turned on and off because because of the inhibitory neurons that system so it's not like you're just, it's not like you're on, they're just excited to really activating some preexisting, you know, hard learned pattern, the pattern is can change.

01:37:06

Basically every time but it's not as possible. Like, you know, the points to the fact that that, you know, when you have multiple brain regions, if you if you have your members are like tapping in a distributed way where maybe you'll see like a dog and a house. And if you look at jackalance, work, you know, the semantic map that he created through, with MRI of where, you know, he saw, you know, a lot of brain, activity of people looking at pictures of houses.

01:37:37

And when people looking at pictures of cars, people, looking pictures of cats and dogs. There was a court, a temperatures, a spatial correlation in brand activity in certain areas where the dogs in cats were being noticed by your brain in terms of where the blood flow is flowing afterwards and correlations between, you know, where, you know, houses and motorcycles were being noticed by your brain that where the houses in the motorcycles would be closer together in the dogs and cats would be somewhere else, but closer to each other.

01:38:06

And so, the computer could then guess, or if the person is like, looking at a motorcycle, or looking at a dog based upon where the increase in blood, flows happening in the brain as measure by MRI and that, that's the jackalance. Labs, semantic maps that his experience were pretty awesome.

01:38:27

Berkeley experience.

01:38:33

And but the thing is like, okay. Well, now, what if you see a dog and has the same time, right? So idea, is that not only, you know, so we have these these patterns that. Yeah, the basic patterns is like when phase of pattern flat is when a neuron fires out of at a much higher frequency than the usual tonic frequency.

01:38:59

You get a bunch of neurons and different areas all firing at a time frequency and they all have. And then there's this. Some there's there's some of the internal so they've got neural columns. You've got no micro micro columns. You've got large columns, you've got small, neural circuits or just groups.

01:39:20

There's no neurons firing and in temporal firing patterns that may be really responsible for short-term memories and it may be long-term memories are our you know that the result of sort of like new proteins being generated that sending receiving of long-term memories are involved new protein synthesis that will modify the

01:39:56

The the patterns that are the different neurons are going to expect and so you can have this sort of like a sort of like the short-term memory is is what's happening, you know. Right. You know, went the sequence of patterns firing in a neural circuit, but in in that sequence is sequence of patterns, is modified by the internal system.

01:40:24

Like you can have constantly have new patterns emerging in any area of the cortex. You have. Any of the core, any area of the cortex can be remapped to, to take on the duties of any other like in, for example, if someone loses a hand and the parts of the brain that were being used to, for their hand, then to start to become used for by the by the other regions of the brain, right?

01:40:51

And so. So, in that situation, you get, you got basically this, you know, if David Eagleman talks about that how like, you know, if you if one, if one, if person was a limb, then the rest then that part of their brain sort of is taken over like a competition of of a competition of rivals or a cooperation of rifles, but basically it's like each of your, you know, your visual cortex is, is taking out a huge amount of your brains resources or service signed with to do visual related tasks visual, cortex would include the occipital lobes, and some extent to parietal lobe stretching into the into this Madison Street cortex, a little bit, but the business entries more about touch, but there's a lot of you don't hand eye coordination happening.

01:42:05

So there's a lot of, like, reasons for the activity in, in the touch air touch areas. Your feelings tactile sensations to be flooring back into the visualization in the his visual areas for correlations. So so the visual cortex is, is maybe two-thirds of your brain activity, but that might be intermixed with a lot of there.

01:42:30

Might be a lot of multimodal patterns traveling back and forth, and, and that's what it's kind of. I think. That's what we see in the brain. Is that, you know, and neuron neural. Columns doesn't know if it's the visual. It wasn't, it doesn't know if it's an individual cortex, or not, it is now since recording.

01:42:52

So now all it knows is the patterns is receiving from, from the adjacent sets of is receiving and sending to the adjacent sets of neurons to the left into the right and front and back and above and below. And so you know, if there are, if someone starts to have if someone loses some of their eyesight or they lose an eye, then then you're going to have the then, you know, in theory, you're gonna have like parts of the brain that were processing.

01:43:26

I don't have an answer for that. Is there something else? Stop. There's nothing to stop here. Siri turn off find network Siri, turn off.

01:44:25

Pride dammit. Anyway, so

01:44:37

Yeah. So, the idea is that, you know, the parts of yours amount of sensory cortex will be talking to your parts, your visual cortex your particular prior to lobes, and vice versa. That are like it's like you know, it's part information that is from you know, tactile sensations and part information that's from visual data.

01:45:06

It's intermixing and then you're going to have, you know, like there's the audio cortex and then but there's audio pathway without your input pathway from from your ears to the old brain and the traveling up the old brain in tours and towards the thalamus. And the neocortex and that pathway is it's your grading and extent and audio pathway but that is also going to at some point.

01:45:36

Those signals are going to be intermixing with, with where, where the visual cortex encounters, that the audio cortex and where the, the audio cortex encounters the smartest cortex and where the visual audio, and it's Madison's records. Use the three primaries and three courtesies connect with the prefrontal cortex and all the regions of the brain, you know, there's I guess joke is there's a motor.

01:46:08

There's there's even others like it was called the motor strip or the motor. Cortex is not really a motor report text because all because more modern analysis of neuron anatomy, is that basically all the, all the, you know, cortical columns have since have have an input and a motor output and so everything, I'm, you know, all the time like I as I'm speaking, there's some part of me that's listening and so there's that's the listening is like input.

01:46:43

And the speaking is motor output. And even thinking for me to pass on a thought, from from one part of my brain to another, to pass, a single form partners by writing to another. It's like us. There's a soliton wave, that's traveling. So from visual cortex, right? Because think information has to travel, and to get to the product, to get, to the prefrontal gloves, because there's no sensory input to the preferential loads.

01:47:11

And in most of the neural columns are consistent neurons, which are neurons that don't have a connection to, to sensory implant the nurse, mostly nursing, your brain have no connection to the outside world. And so because of that patterns have to be able to travel. Because if I can't get a pattern to travel from my eyes, to the back of my head in a way that's like consistent and enough that I can reconstruct a pattern of reality, then then I've got a real problem because it's, it's like, well then all the patterns, you have to be represented in the first like by the first cells, right?

01:47:55

If in the rest of the brain wouldn't be able to be used or anything. So patterns have to be able to travel. And that's why the concept of salts on waves is really interesting is a kind of wave like a mechanical wave or a magnetic wave that can contain information.

01:48:11

It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.

01:48:47

Is that, you know the that's the those things. There's like the principles of oscillators of the physics of oscillators not just in the brain, but the physics of oscillators apply to the brain. And so, you know, you can have a phase of signal, a magnetic solution wave, basic signal oscillator.

01:49:14

And if it enters a big group of neurotic group of of tonic slower, oscillators then then the whole group is going to slow down that faster oscillation and make it come into sync. So it's going to like and I have described that again is it's like the piano note fading away.

01:49:35

So the next note can be played but it's also at that moment when it's being taken away, is also the moment when those other neurons that are antonic, oscillation are listening and perceiving that pattern, that was played. And so you have a pattern when you have a sequence of phasic oscillations that are different frequencies, that are like different tones, different piano tones, like you imagine each piano key I guess played in the sequence, is a different phasic tone, okay?

01:50:09

And if we're talking about 3D audio, we've got different basic tones happening in different places. And you've got large groups of neurons that are listening to all of this because they're firing it sort of like a time pattern. So they're always ready to fire in a physic pattern. If they see if they come into contact, they're always ready.

01:50:28

It's by the finding a time pattern, but that, but then they're able to notice because the principles of oscillators, when one or more members of their group is not firing and in a regular pattern and because of the, you know, how interns can basically multiply the number of patterns, that each oscillator can represent or that you there, enter interneurons enter and inhibitor networks.

01:50:57

Can multiply the number of patterns that can be represented by physic firing neurons inside tonic firing oscillators made of lots of neurons. Then we have a system where and the the mental image or mental sound can be listened to by the rest of the brain. And that's what I think the observer of our perceptions of is going to be, is going to be the large oscillators oscillating at, tonic frequencies and the content of awareness.

01:51:37

So, the the tonic oscillation is the ground of being or pure awareness or consciousness. Just obviously just being the observer and the patterns that arise in that place of your observation are the physic firing. Those are the distinctions from nothingness. Those are the distinctions between you know, if you if you have if everything in your brain was firing simultaneously, there'd be no distinction between anything distinctions like the desert between light and darkness.

01:52:15

It means that.

01:52:19

That's something that's different. And if you have an oscillator where everything is firing at the same time, nothing is different. Which you get with basic part firing patterns, is you get a difference? The temporary difference because it is oscillator will erase the difference that that temporary difference is a distinction that your mind is noticing and listening to, and a physical way.

01:52:43

And that's why, you know, I sort of argue, like, I don't know, I don't know. And what I just said is, I don't know if I've actually introduced any new ideas, I think that's science. Itself has solved consciousness and I'm just sort of like writing a narrative of how the different, how I think the different blocks fit together.

01:53:06

I think there's sort of like, you know, there's a, it's a global workspace component that is, it's, it's you get you. I don't want to think it's not an integration of information theory, but it is an association of information in sequence patterns, or, and also touring and, and it's a self-aware also for a network or a, so, for network and oscillates.

01:53:44

But the he is that the sovereign network that oscillates is conscious because it's it's listening to its own representations and it's listening to changes and it's unrepresentations. But these representations because they manifest as physic it's all time, waves that travel and they need to travel, otherwise, most of your brain would be useless in pattern need to travel deep into rain.

01:54:18

So your brain is not, you know, it's largely, most of your brain is not connected to the outside world. So patterns need to travel into your brain, and that's sort of means that you're conscious patterns are. It's like, it's like, think of your brain is like, as like what you have all over the place in your brain are piano keys that have been tuned to certain kinds of representations.

01:54:47

And these these piano keys are tuned to certain representations, they recognize certain patterns and they ignore certain patterns like we recognize what, you know, like it's only gonna fire, you gonna have some patterns only gonna fire when you see a mockup of apples, new air of your headset. You know, are some patterns, only a fire when you see an apple sometimes only gonna fire when you see a mouse or a computer mouse or real mouse and, or maybe a roach or maybe maybe a joint.

01:55:24

So plan words, and but the but these patterns are location variant. These are virtual virtual patterns, they're patterns that travel through the brain and they have to travel to the brain because you have, you know, multiple stages of analysis. You have this prediction of what the the message bottles gonna feel like, and then you have this, then you and then when you feel it, it's like does it feel the way you predict it?

01:55:53

Or is it different? Oh this is different than I thought it was gonna feel like I was expecting one thing and it was not what I expected or it is what I expected because I have multiple multiple levels of representation of predictions about how something is going to feel.

01:56:10

And then there's the actual moment feeling which is when that you've got those pianos are being planned. When you have the big action, potentials firing if higher physic frequencies. This is the thing that happened right now, that's the highest frequency before we land. The neurons are like listening, seems like multiple scales of data collection from from synapses to dendrites, to the summer, to be that to the activity output of an entire neural column to to an intern neuron that travels between neural columns like a long distance, internal that receives that that basically allows patterns to travel from one region of another so that you can connect incoming audio data temporarily with incoming visual data.

01:57:08

So that you what you can make a connection in your mind between something you're hearing and what you something you're seeing. So if you see lightning and you hear thunder, you can make a connection between lightning and thunder and the lightning and thunder are in close proximity happening. In close proximity.

01:57:26

Then you know that's a source of the storm is close to you but it's the lightning happens in the thunder. Yeah. And there's a long time before you hear the thunder. Then, you know that the storm is away is off as farther off, can maybe be, it could be miles away because the lightning is, is the light travels much faster than the sound.

01:57:49

And so, if the storm is farther away, you'll see it to see the lightning flash long before you hear it. So you can kind of tell the difference where lightning is how close lighting is from yourself. But yeah, if you're hearing and seeing lightning simultaneously, that means it's having right above you, right?

01:58:08

That's that's it's really interesting to experience. Lightning storms and in Texas and visited my parents out there. Mining storms are really interesting out there because a little bit different from from, you know, I don't have that kind of experience out here and in California. It's a little bit more mystical out there in Texas that be in a rain, lightning storm.

01:58:38

And to fact that this guy is partially alive, it's the sky anyway. So, let's see.

01:59:01

So yeah, so you making a brain is making association between sensor data that's coming into your ears and since you're dating, that's coming to your eyes, this is just and your brain is that's you know, it's a lot of travel, a lot of distance between stuff that's coming into your eyes, something that's coming to your ears.

01:59:18

But thankfully there are intern neurons that link different brain regions together so you can have part of brain that creates representations of lightning visual cortex starting the opposite of loves. And those representations have to connect with the representations of the thunder, which is where your audio cortex is going to be representing because, but it's like, piercing, it's like what's happening though.

01:59:47

I think, is that the audio cortex gets start gets sort of used to representing the particulars of thunder and sounds of thunder and the visual cortex gets used to representing the particulars of lightning and it doesn't matter if the same pattern never happens. Twice. It, it's, it's not that you're brain is creating fixed memories.

02:00:14

It's that your brain is creating. It's getting tuned to to to be expecting certain kinds of patterns or different regions of your brain are getting tuned to expect certain kinds of pattern to look for certain kinds of patterns and to ignore certain kinds of patterns and which means that when they fire their plant they're playing backs are in kinds of patterns that other parts of the brain are listening to is you have this, the thunder comes in and the first layer of your audio cortex is repenting that sound, and then beyond that.

02:00:47

Whatever part of your brain is receiving that sound as representing that pattern, had this representing that pattern plus the patterns that is receiving from other groups and around. So like, if you see, if you see that, there's a cortical column in between the visual and audio cortex, it's like exactly like 50%, it says, 50% mark.

02:01:16

It's it's it's at the halfway point between the audio cortex and the visual cortex That cortical column is halfway at at the 50 yard line between the audience visual cortex is going to my, that might be receiving. This, let's just say for the safe sake of a thought experiment, that is receiving 50% of the of data from the audio part of the brain.

02:01:42

And 50% of the data from from the visual part of the brain. Right? And so now it has to now has to create patterns that are half audio and a half video, right? And I'm only making an argument to say well to say that, you know, how does the brain going to integrate your audio?

02:02:04

Well, first of all, it's, you know, stuff travels from one quart of column to the next because you have these long distance interns that connect the different cortical columns together. There you have these, you know, rich club networks or default load networks or large scale long distance networks, connect different brains together, so different.

02:02:26

So that means that you can have 10 spatial and temporal synchronicity in the firing of lightning and thunder that you can consciously notice. And and so the apical dendrites, especially in the sixth layer of the upper layers of the neocortex are going to be really part of the key of sort of like integrating information, from multiple lower level data collections.

02:03:01

So when a whole, so an activity of a whole column sends the signal, now it gets activated with with a pattern, not so the pattern that that whole column represents could be a unique pattern every single time but that pattern gets sent up to the to, to the, to the pyramidal cells, and it gets into the, the intern neuron network to the bridge club network and it becomes a higher level pattern.

02:03:34

It gets it's it's it's a representation of the lot of lower level patterns connected together. It's like a bundle of waves that are different every time but it allows the patterns to sort of travel and to to join up and groups and to become part of any bigger collection of patterns and it becomes what you pay attention to.

02:03:58

Your brain is activating around where your brain on a largest scale is activating around that has to be known as by even larger oscillations. And that's when you get to, I think, you know, that sort of like the stuff that you know, why is it that when someone is is when they when they take anesthesia and their the basically part of the function of the the then the the apical neurons is inhibited.

02:04:40

Then the the brain isn't able to create those like high level representations that are integrating lots of lower level representations and so the sort of like the integrating the apical neuron is that the point in which information becomes integrated into large-scale, conscious representation from the surrounding global workspace, of cortical columns and and individual cells, and dendrites and enter the branches.

02:05:32

So so, so that's what I'm saying is like we have the, you know, the the global workspace is the whole brain but the integration of information is into consciousness is through the, the rich clubs that that are represented by the apical neurons, in the super, in the rich in the rich club networks that cross multiple reasons of the brain.

02:06:10

So that patterns from multiple sensory regions that, you know, basically large scale patterns that incorporate low scale patterns. So what that means is like, you know, if you look at a keyboard, there's lots of little letters, you know, or characters, there's a SD1234, you're in dollar sign percentage sign at sign star symbol.

02:06:41

And so, you know, some point you learn letters and those are low level features. And then at some point, you know, when you integrate, if you when your brain answer is all those patterns until here. There's a keyboard and the keyword has lots of symbols on it. It's a high level representation and then there's there's an office.

02:07:01

Okay. Now, so you have imagine in office and there's a table and there's phones and there's computer monitors and and all that stuff is is made of a bunch of tiny representations. But when you consider all these tiny representations at a higher level of your trunking up to higher level, it includes all of these things on the table and each thing on the table has a incredible amount of detail.

02:07:27

And the idea is that. So you have any trunk up to a bigger picture that bigger picture is that's when you get to like, that's the stuff you're conscious of right now. It's the sort of like the as a picture that includes stuff. You can see stuff, you can hear stuff, you can feel, you can feel your body, you can detect your hand, your face, you knows everything in the room.

02:08:02

That's the high level stuff of consciousness, where you have this pattern of of one thing is in the context of everything else. The pattern of a pencil is in the context of a room. The pattern of a person is in the context of everything else in space. The context of, you know, so we're defined by everything else, right?

02:08:27

The quantum weirdness of it of your hearting, that everything is defined by everything else. And and so that's when you have this, that's when there is, that's when there is consciousness, that is human level. When all of these lower level representations that are seen by small oscillators and large, oscillators of, you know, individual neurons fire representing aspects of individual patterns.

02:09:03

Those patterns that are sort of, they can be represented by, in theory, by any part of the brain because the brain is a general learning algorithm but the brain becomes tuned to look for certain types of patterns. So if you play tetras for six hours, as some people have done, you may start to see the shapes of tetras when you close your eyes, when you're trying to sleep, because still see the game when you're playing it, I'm going to try to sleep.

02:09:29

You can still see as if you were still playing the game because because your brain starts to get used to representing those patterns so much. It continues to represent them even when you close your eyes, and that's what I'm, that's sort of. Like, my argument is, is that, you know, my argument is, is it's someone else's argument.

02:09:48

The brain is a general learning algorithm, that all the basically, all the areas of the brain are capable of representing anything. And if you take one sort of like, you know, David talked about this to Hawkins talked about this. If you if you, if you take, if you take and I out of a rat's eye socket and you plug that I into visual cortex, the rat's visual cortex will learn to see because because the brain is really a general learning.

02:10:15

I really mean if you put an electric strip and someone's tongue and connect it to a camera so that the so the pixels in the camera are going to stimulate different parts of the person's tongue based upon whether they're receiving light or not. And what frequency that light is and that person would be able to see via the signal sense of their tongue.

02:10:37

Even if they don't have eyes, this has been this has been demonstrated because because the brain, basically is a general learning algorithm, you can see give it any kind of signals and it can, it can represent those signals you can plug in. So this is from David Egan, you can plug in stock data into your brain.

02:10:53

Eaglemen. He you're saying yeah you could plug in extra cameras, you can fucking stock data and the brain is going to learn to represent at new brain activity. It's going to learn to create sensory representations of any patterns that you give it because it's a general learning algorithm. And but then also means that, if you, if you take patterns from, you know, from from one sensory input and you just, you send them into a bunch of neurons and then those patterns represent those patterns and the next set of neurons that receives those patterns are represented, the first set of patterns, they're also going to have those patterns and you're going to have, you know, this patterns are going to like, basically ricochet through the brain, and that means that you can have different areas with the brain representing the same patterns.

02:11:50

It means like, basically it's like that. It means it basically, we are virtual beings that the representation of my hands and my face. Now, my body and myself, it is a virtual pattern and it's like, it's like, think of your think of the different groups of neurons, like piano, and they can play music, or the piano can play light, or the piano can play sound, or a complaint movies.

02:12:18

It's a it's like a piano to complain movies or it can play feelings. You can play that spatial and temporal characteristics feelings. Emotions of any sensation, any part of the brain can do anything, because it's all. These are all uncomfortable, spatial patterns and coated in between 0 and 0.02 hurts and 600 hertz temple on special physical, and tonic patterns.

02:12:54

I say there are temple and spatial phasic patterns on top of tonic patterns that's actually more accurate on top of tonic awareness Temple and spatial phasic differentials on top of tonic awareness. So what we have is like an oscillatory differential neural network or so for network is an authority differential network

02:13:26

And so, Wow.
