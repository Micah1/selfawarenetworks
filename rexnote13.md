SANSTAR1 The Physics of Oscillation

The Phase Wave Differential of one neuronal cell body is going to cause the whole oscillating group of cells to notice, and that comes down to the physics of oscillation that connects to Steven Strogatz's work in the book Sync when he talks about fireflies & neurons & clocks.

SYNC - Explain from Strogatz book with citations how two metronome clocks affect one another and synchronize. References to fireflies, Steven Strogatz work, Buszaki's work, and search for "Oscillat" in the book notes at the Self Aware Networks Institute on Github.

The physics of oscillation allow your neuron's high phasic spikes to cause inhibitory effects to other neurons that the whole cell assembly will feel, as the energy is dissipating across the oscillating group over time, the energy which is also information in effect is a sharp wave rippling across the oscillator (a cortical column might be a good example of an oscillating group of cells) & between networked oscillators (networked cortical columns) across the whole brain.

So the neuron that spikes causes inhibitory effects that the whole cell assembly & the brain will feel, via the principles of oscillatory sync, where oscillators essentially dissipate signals to one another, this process allows your cells to basically act as a single sensor, your body becomes an entified sensor array, that can bind together sensory information, on a collective scale, because the incoming signals are felt by the entire network, as signals are passed in phase changes, dissipating the information as energy across the collective cell assembly of your brain & body. So signals are dissipated everywhere.

High Phasic signals are disbursed more widely, pushing more components to react simultaneously, synchronization is the absorbtion of phasic signals into the tonic oscillation.

When I came up with the idea of Consciousness as a single unified & fractal sensor/transmitter system consisting of smaller sensor/transmitter systems, I was thinking about Stephen Strogatz's descriptions of fireflies synchrony, and clock sync and his descriptions of neurons as oscillators that synchronize via signal transmission

A central part of my argument is that a group of oscillating fireflies act as a single sensor, unified via oscillation, so that if one of them is excited by food, or eaten by a frog, that disturbs the oscillating firing pattern of the entire hive or flock of fireflies, in other words they all notice, via oscillation the fireflies are entified,

I argued, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.

What is the survival advantage of fireflies oscillating together?
well they can become a sensor array effectively, since they are all timed the same they can all simultaneously observe through expectation when all of the others will fire because the light pattern is repetative, if one of them goes dark, because it was eaten by the tongue of a toad the entire group is aware of it instantenously and flies away rapidly from that location. If one of them finds food it begins to oscillate faster or brighter than the rest, and so they converge attracted literally by the excitement signals which are either brighter or more rapid or both.

Each firefly contains an oscillator, sync occurs through mutual cuing, each one is continually sending and receiving signals, shifting the rhythms of others, dissipating the energy of the signal over time until all the fireflies are firing in lockstep. The same process occurs with lifeless oscillators. The rotation of the moon for example is in sync with the movement of the earth. The electromagnetic fields of the earth & moon are knocking on one another, and that is enough, to even without gravitational particles, cause the orbits & the rotations of the planets to synchronize.

My argument is different in that I argue that it is differentiation, from phase wave differentials, (not from electrical spikes, and not from electric fields inherently, but from signals passed via the electromagnetic spectrum that encompasses all types of wave shapes at all scales), that difference or phase wave differential acts as the ink of distinction making for a conscious entity from a brain, to a collective of fireflies, because I thought about how in Steven Strogatz's example of fireflies if one firefly vanished because a frog had snatched it out of the air with it's tongue then the whole hive of fireflies would notice because their collective signal synchronicity would be off put by the vanishing of that one fire fly.

This same concept led me to believe that when a cell fired or was damaged in the brain, or the body, the entire body would eventually feel it, because the signal would change all of the signals of all the cells of the entire being via the principles of oscillation.

This would change the organism's expection, or the conscious expectation of a collective of fireflies, because all of their signals would literally be changed by the change in one of them.

Rephrasing: Normally a neuron is going to fire regularly at a tonic rate, but it might fire phasically faster at an irregular interval that is both different & faster than the tonic firing rate. Irregular intervals provide a contrast to the regular intervals, and their irregularity implies that they have information value (in the context of Claude Shannon’s Information theory) and the irregular intervals affect the clock cycles of every other neuron in it’s synchronous assembly via the physics of oscillation that apply to everything including clocks & fireflies

SANSTAR2  Biological Implementation: Neural Arrays
How neurons act as oscillators
How neural arrays sync like fireflies

It's like imagine that, it's like where's the inner, it's like you said the question is where's the inner screen that is representing the world, and what's observing the inner screen? Because if you just had an inner screen and an observer inside your head, well, how does that that observer work because it's like this is a smaller observer it's just shrinking the problem right so the idea is where is the inner observer and where's the inner screen and the idea is that all the different cells of your brain all the different parts of your brain there are each inner screens that are also observing.

They're each producing an image that other parts are observing.

 And so you have cells in your eye will receive an image and they all detect what the image is and they all output signals to other cells.

 And so you have the first the first set of cells that receives the image is the first neural array, and their output is like a TV screen blast to the next set of cells, and the next set of cells is now also an observer.

It's observing the signals that came to it, and it's outputting something to the set of cells behind it.

So you have many, many different arrays of cells that are each detecting and broadcasting.

So each cell is a detector and a broadcaster, or a sensor and a transmitter.

So you have a distributed sensing and transmitting.

Neural Arrays: Each array consists of neurons acting as both sensors (receiving external information) and transmitters (sending processed information). These arrays process sensory inputs—vision, sound, touch, etc.—which are encoded in phasic waves (high-frequency, low-magnitude waves).

Each neural array contributes a small piece of the overall perceptual puzzle. 

Essentially the excess charge, quantified by the potassium ions, is sent via a variation in the number of neurotransmitters released to downstream neurons.

This is how one neuron transmits it's excess charges to the next neural array: The vesicle release of neurotransmitters through the synapse to the dendrite of another neuron.

The delta of vesicle or neurotransmitter release is the next neural array's new topographical distribution of electrical charges (via the stimulation & opening of receptors on the post synapse) AND then it reflects this information to other neurons

The cell body shape (morphology)(morphological changes to dendrites, and new proteins resulting from reactions, and new spines all of which change the responsive properties of the cell)

Connections (synaptic connections define what a neuron response to and what it doesn't, synaptic connections are a cell's learned memory response. The physical pattern it has grown to respond to.) connections

Connection morphology or the types of connections matter, when potassium receptors are anchored together with ankeryn repeats they become mechano sensitive or sensitive to mechanical waves like touch.

A variance in it's electrical charge density (from lost or gained neurotransmitters before the some burst or action potential event.)

oscillator state (what part of it's oscillation cycle it's in.)

the state of each of it's receptors (whether it's receptors are active, inhibited (blocked) etc.)

All of which result in distinctly new signals, with new frequencies, magnitudes, and oscillation phase changes disbursed through the brain.

Distributed via a new path of connections which change as electrical thresholds are reached in specific areas.

The neuron is transmitting it's phase change, but the meaning of that phase change comes down to what the neurons in it's exit terminal have learned to respond to. It's as if the neuron is a blinking LED to all of the neurons in it's exit terminal. 

SANSTAR3 NAPOT Framework & Neural Array Projection
Complete explanation of Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography
How neural arrays project and receive
Phase differentials and wave patterns

Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) is the main thesis of the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind. There are 10 revisions of NAPOT and each builds on the previous one.

Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) What is it? NAPOT argues that high phasic high frequency low magnitude traveling waves flow through neural arrays inhabited by high magnitude low frequency tonic waves (ground of being), creating both excitatory chains of (perception) action potentials, and sequences of inhibitory (memory) waves. These neural arrays are both seeing & projecting sensory representations to subsequent arrays, and the entification of all these oscillations creates an observer inside a person or an organism that can observe it's own internal renderings, through the sequences of sensing & transmitting neural arrays in oscillating feedback loops. 

Entification and Internal Observer**: A core aspect of NAPOT is the concept of 'entification', where the combined effect of these oscillatory activities leads to the higher level dynamic of an 'observer' within the brain. This observer is capable of experiencing and interpreting its internal renderings, essentially forming the basis of consciousness and self-awareness.

Oscillating Feedback Loops**: NAPOT emphasizes the importance of feedback loops in neural activity. These loops allow for continuous interaction between sensory input, neural processing, and the projection of internal states, leading to a dynamic and ever-adapting system of neural activity.

To expand on this idea read notes on Neuron Transmission, Vesicles, Calcium duration, APD Action Potential Duration & more. The Essential Point is that the phase projection, between one neural array and the next is via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation. This phase change you can imagine like the literal paint of the mind's internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer, and that observer is the oscillating group of cells that is you, but each unit of oscillating cells is a unit of observation.

Self Aware Conception & Perception: What is Oscillation Tomography

Oscillation Tomography is the collective entification of phase patterns transmitted between neural arrays - These phase changes, passed between neural arrays, become part of the tomography of the picture of the sensed, felt, smelled, touched, lived in experience of reality. A tomography is an experience built from entified phase patterns passed between neural arrays rippling across the whole brain intersecting & defining the tonic oscillation pattern.

What is meant by Oscillating Tomography.
b0153y "Neural Oscillatory Tomography (not Holography)"
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/b0153y.md

I want people to think about Holography, like Holographic images, but it's not Holography, it's Tomography. So when I say Tomography I want you to imagine a Hologram (just via a different process) but it's a tomogram. Your mind is making Tomograms by producing phase changes. It's also perceiving its own Tomograms with its receptors & dendrites.

Artificial Conscious Perception: The Oscillator is a unit of Sentient Observer
This part essentially covers the concept that the oscillator is the perceiver, the oscillating group of cells as a collective is an observer.

A neuron is a sensor, transmitter, it's the group that is perceiving. The group of cells that is oscillating together is storing the memory. This is an important concept because that neuron could be inhibited from firing at some interval of time when the new pattern comes in and some other neuron has to respond to it instead. and that is possible because it's actually the group that is learning the memory, the group of cells, so any part of that group of cells can receive the signal and the rest of the group can react to it, and in fact they do physically react to any pattern that they receive as a collective, like the fireflies in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.

When I say that a neuron is mechanically listening to other neurons. I mean that a neuron is physically reacting, in a mechanical way to the signals from the previous array of neurons.

The argument that I am making is that every neuron is a sensor, and a transmitter, every nerve cell has the dendrite which is the sensing part of the neuron and every cell has the exit terminal which is the transmission or broadcasting part of the neuron. So every neuron is sensing part of the picture and transmitting part of the picture, and through the physics of oscillation all of the different pictures are bound together in a whole image and that is how the human brain makes the conscious mind, and that's my book, but also I go deep into the neurophysics of like what is actually happening at the physical level of the neuron and how memories are formed via synaptic connections, and how they have to scale up? How does a memory go from something that tiny, that is stored in synaptic connections, to something that your whole brain is aware of?

So imagine that what you are seeing & experiencing as reality is a Tomographic Rendering constructed from phase signals ()

You are seeing the Tomography (not holography) of your brain wave activity (detected by oscillating dendrites) when you see anything, reality is rendered in the phase variances of your brainwave activity, but it's not you that is seeing anything, it's your neural arrays, the layers in your cortical columns, and the observers are the oscillating groups of cells: the neural circuits & the cortical columns, and any oscillating cell assembling defined as body by a synchronously firing group (of cells in the brain) each neural array is seeing part of this picture, and in time the parts of the picture are bound together in your volumetric experience of reality.

SAN’s framework offers a clear parallel: the entified observer in NAPOT represents the brain’s ability to monitor its own internal states through recursive oscillations. This is more than just metacognition (thinking about thinking); it’s a deeper, continuous awareness of what the system knows about its own knowledge, perception, and memory.

Remove duplicate sections about "what is the entity that is you"

If man is a neural network representing features in his brain, who is the observer inside the man who is looking at these features?

I first coined the phrase Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography on August 3rd, 2022, which explains the inner eye, or the observer inside the brain as entified neural array projections.

Essentially the screen of your mind is 

NAPOT Dendrite Redness
"Science has known for a hundred years that Conscious Experience is Correlated with Neural Activity. But what is the Redness itself?"

My theory answers this question, the main thesis is called NAPOT. Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, in part it means the phase differentials (the contrasting wave forms) are the units of neural rendering, a stable diffusion network is a type of neural rendering.

What is the redness inside human experience? 

It's a rendering. The front of a neural array observes signals, the back projects signals to the next neural array. The projection is the rendering, the dendrites in the 2nd array see the rendering, and then they project their own rendering to the 3rd array and so on. All the different renderings are part of the picture of what you are seeing now, temporal & spatial oscillation binds them into your lived in experience.

Write how an oscillating group of cells becomes an observer that can see redness.

There at the root of sensation is distinction, any distinction between one thing and another thing. Implied in observing this distinction is an observer, or another distinction. A conscious observer who is observing this distinction.

I realized that to represent the observer you need an additional point. So there's actually like three points, or maybe four. There's A which is one pattern, B which is the second pattern that is distinct from A, and there is C which is the observer of the distinction between A & B. The distinction of an observer could be a third point, or a fourth point, perhaps the distinction between A & B is also a distinct point.

3D Signal Processing and Neural Arrays
The concept that the brain processes signals along six axes (front-back, left-right, up-down) aligns with the Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) theory from SAN. In NAPOT, the brain's neural arrays not only process signals but also project sensory representations between arrays. This aligns with the discussion in your note about how the brain processes sensory information in multiple dimensions.

The observer is this you have a temporal, you have a temporal oscillation and the supercheus net in superchasematic nucleus, that's 20 million neurons. But a lot of the brain has these big groups of of neurons oscillating that I'm going to argue, is the observer. And what's being observed are the different, or the differentials that that that happened to individual neurons in the observer in the oscillator, so that the differential.

Temporal oscillators to fire out of the normal sequence, a bunch of a bunch of micro. So like all to see, when you have a neural oscillator, you have a lot of neurons that are all oscillating together and when you have a something significant happening like a red t-shirt, then what happens is you're going to get to a point where I your causing a disturbance from the norm and the oscillation of a sac oscillating themselves and some of those cells are going to have their temporal firing patterns become misaligned with the group.

And that causes all the neurons in that group to recognize that pattern because the act of recognizing that we can because they're all physically altered by that pattern. Because what happens is, the group has to pull that the diversion oscillator neuron back into equilibrium as a whole. So, if the group is oscillating at like 20,000, if a group of neurons, is operating at, let's say it's 20.

Let's say the groups neurons system is oscillating at 20 hertz. Okay? And then you have what you have is you have a red shirt and the red shirt cost us a small number of neurons to have an oscillation deviation of approximately three milliseconds. So they become three milliseconds out of sync with the oscillating hole now, because the oscillator has to, there has to be an equilibrium between the neurons that that were two or three milliseconds out of sync with the normal oscillation and the normal oscillation.

So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.

It's what I'm arguing is, I'm arguing that when an oscillating when oscillator gets out of sync, right? Because of a trigger. The whole oscillator. Brings it into sync again, but the the, the journey. So what I'm saying is like, in order for that to come and sink, you have to have energy in the higher oscillator that's dripping down into the lower oscillator.

I think so. I think it's gonna be like instead of, instead of it's gonna be like 20. And so, let's see. The all the neurons are oscillating at like 20 Hertz. Well then if you have one that goes up by three milliseconds it's it comes out of alignment by a matter of milliseconds, you know, five milliseconds, 10 milliseconds, two milliseconds, whatever, it becomes out of alignment.

I think between the micro oscillators and the macros layers or there's any, there's an equilibrium that's being sought but that would change that which change in my new way. It's a total oscillating pattern, but whether it does or doesn't, maybe everything gets back to 20 hertz, okay? Maybe it doesn't change that much.

What is the entity that is you? I argue that the "you" is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction  with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

Oscillatory Feedback Loops and Brainwave Patterns
The idea of the brain functioning in oscillating loops and how signals follow specific paths with feedback mechanisms is core to SAN's focus on oscillatory feedback loops. The SAN theory discusses how these oscillatory behaviors create an internal observer through entification, which mirrors the processing loops mentioned in your note.

Signal Paths and Specialized Oscillations
The mention of distinct paths for motor signals, sensory signals, and specific oscillations (like beta in the hippocampus or delta in the thalamus) connects with SAN's concept of entification via oscillation. In SAN, different oscillatory patterns in various brain regions are responsible for specialized functions like memory and perception, echoing the note's discussion about the different signal types and their respective paths.

Oscillations and Brain Signal Interpretation
The note references how certain brain oscillations, like alpha waves for sensory input or higher frequency waves, could be key in understanding brain signals, which mirrors SAN's focus on how oscillatory patterns help the brain process sensory input. Specifically, SAN explores the phasic-tonic relationship and how oscillations create stable representations (tonic waves) while facilitating active perception (phasic waves).

The Dendrites are the observers of signals, the Exit Terminal Burstlet is like a television display pixel for the next array of dendrites, and the physics of oscillation are binding the picture together at the cell assembling (or oscillating body of cells) scale.

When brains (cortical columns (neurons (dendrites))) receive neurotransmitters, or fire because of an imbalance between positive and negative ions, the result is topological change,

The concept of oscillations leading to observers through a process of 'entification' can indeed be extended to the physics of the universe at various scales, though this idea is more speculative and theoretical in nature. In this context, 'entification' refers to the emergence of entities or systems with distinct properties or consciousness-like qualities from interactions of simpler, oscillatory components.

Although we are entified & unified via oscillatory synchronization it is the desynchronization or differences or the tiny variations in the tonic brainwave frequences of Delta, Theta, Beta, Alpha, and Gamma waves that represent our unconscious beliefs, expectations, and sensory space configurations ready to model whatever we expect to encounter, the higher frequency lower magnitude phase wave differentials or traveling waves or sharp wave ripples help set the tiny variations in the tonic frequency bands, via the action potential duration which establishes the minute details encoded or carved in the tonic brainwave record or clay. The interaction between the high phasic and the low tonic brainwaves is how our neural renderings are tracked and integrated into the phenomenologically conscious observer.

Oscillatory Synchronization and Desynchronization
**Tonic Brainwave Frequencies**: The tonic brainwave frequencies like Delta, Theta, Beta, Alpha, and Gamma represent a baseline state of brain activity. These frequencies are associated with different states of consciousness and cognitive processes. They form a foundation for our unconscious beliefs, expectations, and preparedness to model sensory experiences.

**Desynchronization and Variations**: Desynchronization, or the differences in these tonic frequencies, reflects the brain's response to new information or changes in cognitive state. These tiny variations in the tonic brainwaves are indicative of the brain's dynamic processing capabilities, constantly adjusting to new stimuli or internal thought processes.

**Higher Frequency Phase Wave Differentials**: The higher frequency, lower magnitude phase wave differentials (like traveling waves or sharp wave ripples) are superimposed on these tonic frequencies. They represent more transient, specific neural activities associated with sensory processing, cognitive tasks, or memory recall.

Action Potential Duration and Neural Encoding
**Role of Action Potential Duration**: The duration of the action potential plays a critical role in determining the nature of these high-frequency differentials. It influences the strength and timing of synaptic signals, thereby affecting the pattern of neural activity that is propagated through the brain.

**Encoding in the Tonic Brainwave Record**: The interactions between high phasic activity and low tonic brainwaves can be seen as a process of encoding or imprinting details onto the broader, more stable tonic activity. This process is akin to carving minute details into a malleable record, where the tonic brainwaves serve as a canvas for these intricate neural inscriptions.

### Integration into Phenomenological Consciousness
**Tracking and Integration of Neural Renderings**: The interaction between high-frequency phase wave differentials and low-frequency tonic brainwaves is crucial for tracking and integrating neural renderings. This integration is what allows for the formation of a coherent and continuous stream of consciousness.

**Emergence of the Conscious Observer**: The dynamic interplay between these different types of brainwaves contributes to the emergence of the phenomenologically conscious observer. This observer is the unified entity that experiences, interprets, and responds to the world, shaped by the continuous flux of neural activity.

**Phase Wave Differentials and Tonic Oscillations**: We then connected these ideas to the concepts of Dominant Phase Wave Differentials and Tonic Oscillating Observer Components. Under the influence of psychedelics, there is an increase in brain activity and production of phase wave differentials, leading to profound changes in consciousness. This heightened neural activity disrupts the usual processing and integration of sensory information, leading to a more vivid and complex phenomenological consciousness.

**The Brain as a Rendering Engine**: The mind, particularly under the influence of psychedelics, can be likened to a multi-dimensional rendering engine. This engine is responsible for creating our phenomenological conscious experience, integrating various sensory inputs, emotional responses, and cognitive processes. Psychedelics enhance this rendering process, leading to experiences that are far more vivid and complex than those in normal consciousness.

SANSTAR6 Oscillation Mechanisms

The brightest flash of the firefly, or the strongest pulse of the action potential going to cause the most number of fireflies or upstream cells to react at the same time. Sync is a coincident oscillator reaction to broadly distributed high amp low freq signals of any modality type

To have the global sync oscillation altered by the collective action of a neural circuit with different size oscillators might result in a global pattern generation like turning small signals into a flashing image on a screen that down stream neurons receive as an image or a sound or tactile sensation or a feeling which is then observed by another layer

As if the brain is replicating the images it sees outside and the sounds of what it hears outside in the collective signal generated by the oscillator reacting to 

Registering an observation to other layers of the network and an observation to the thalamus, the neocortex can function as a tv for the thalamus, like a 32k or human retina display for a virtual reality experience. With the thalamic bridges running its signals to the neocortex and receiving the output of the neocortex on the other side of the cortical columns allowing it to observe, learn from, and coordinate activity pattern learning on each column of neocortex, allowing the whole brain to be in spacetime holistically aware of every part of itself. As frequency patterns in the brain play out across time, space, at at multiple scales. 

The inhibited wave created to mark the APD Action Potential Duration causes the oscillator to act like a photocopier in a sense because its pattern is defined by action potentials decay rate setting the phase of inhibition for large groups of neurons, who are expecting to fire because of the signals they are getting from that neuron that fired, but since different neurons have different voltages they end up firing in sequences, so neural oscillators have temporal sequences that adhere to or map to novel neural phasic firing, this takes a small pattern and it magnifies it so it can be seen by another layer of neurons, and the output of cortical columns might be seen by the thalamus which is constructing patterns via the same method outline above 

Imagine how the human brain as a computer system might generate the concept of self, as an internal representation with utility. Imagine how a computer might render or generate it's own sense of self, a character with casual power that represents and is represented by a unified body of causation, defined as having some causal power structure, within some specific volume, ie it's body.

My argument is that the rendering output that makes up our internal representations, and our mind, is in the phase variations between the normal tonic oscillating pattern, and the phasic bursts that alter that tonic pattern. The tonic pattern is not just pink noise. It's an attractor state for the neural oscillations of cell assemblies. Like clocks or fireflies as described in the book Sync these tonic oscillations are dissipating energy from the phasic & high phasic spikes, but they also notice when neurons are inhibited because that is a phase change also that effects the group. To finish the thought, the rendering output is then read by the next array of sensors, in this case the receptors on the receiving dendritic array.

When neurons oscillate together they become a sensory array that can represent patterns in 3D and in 4D, because they represent a phase field that has memory, that can observe its own decoherence & coherence.

So the array is an oscillating group of neurons, and that learns patterns that get stored in the synaptic connections and spines of each dendrite.

Each layer of neurons in an oscillating group, is compressing a detected pattern into a phase change that is adding one delta of detail, like a shade of color, or a touched edge, to a complex multi-dimensional sensory representation that is akin to the 3D model created by slides in the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, except its a 4D model, playing out over time across the neocortex's oscillators, when we communicate with other people that is also

NAPOT’s framework posits that the entification of these oscillatory waves forms the observer (or sense of self) that experiences the synthesized reality constructed by these neural circuits.

Observation is reporting or rendering reported to sensation or perception in a loop, observation is a loop of reporting & detection, observation is a loop of rendering & perception, observation is a state of detection frames coupled with rendered frames. Like frames of a movie, except a movie is rendered frames only, an observer is a strange loop of detection frames interlaced with rendered frames where the detection frames are updated at each interval by the rendering updates, but the updating itself is the process of detecting the next frame of the rendering of the looping observer in time, to say it another way my obervation must exist somewhere in spacetime first for me to be able to report it to someone else. The neural correlates of cognition are sufficient in detail to match the complexity of what a human being reports as their observation.

I make the argument that the sparse distributed representation of the pixels of the frames of consciousness are not creating a holographic rendering but a tomographic rendering in the minds eye, attention schema helps define a tomographic map in each oscillator that makes up part of the whole experience of consciousness. With the idea being that I can track a room full of people or a street full of cars because each entity, object, car or person is independently represented by an individual oscillating pattern, a traveling pattern

People talk about how gasses become water as emergence, but perhaps a better word concept than emergence is binding via oscillation, like the fireflies, when they synchronize, it looks like emergent behavior, but really its the physics of oscillation.

The oscillation of fireflies and the oscillation of cells points to how all the cells in the body can act as a single sensor, entified through the principles of oscillation, entified in time & space, by passing & dissipating signals between cells until the separate cells are in sync as a single sensor, once in sync every part of your cellular body can sense every other part, because touching one part of your body triggers a wave of signals to pass to all the cells of the body.

Douglas Hofstadter's idea of consciousness as a loop—especially in his concept of strange loops from Gödel, Escher, Bach—echoes the recursive nature of this entification process.

In Hofstadter's framework, consciousness emerges when a system (such as the brain) is able to reference itself at multiple levels, creating a loop where one part of the system points back to another part, eventually leading back to the original reference.

This aligns with NAPOT, where the brain's neural arrays constantly feed sensory information back into themselves.

This self-referencing process—essentially the loop—is what creates the experience of self-awareness. In SAN, the observer is not a separate entity but a higher level property of these recursive loops within the oscillatory waves of the brain.

The idea of entification suggests that consciousness or self-awareness arises from the integration of many small, independent parts into a larger, coherent whole. 

Note entification isn't the same as unification and it's not the same as synchronization or oscillation, entification is fractal concept, where many small sensor transmitter components become a larger sensor transmitter object at a higher level of function. Entification effectively replaces the handwavy concept of Emergence with high level functionality that can be reduced to it's component parts because the high level functionality is an extension fractal functionality of it's individual parts, describing how once separate individual parts have a new higher level function.

Observation via entification, is the higher Collective Oscillation of lower level oscillators, it is the Single Sensor of you, that represents the combined functional integration of all your cells, and your self concepts.

This concept can be thought of as fractal, where smaller units (like neurons or sensory inputs) organize into self-similar patterns that scale up to form a more complex system (consciousness, in this case).

In the Self Aware Networks (SAN) framework, this entification occurs as oscillatory waves within neural arrays interact to create a larger perceptual or cognitive whole. Here's how this process might work:

As these arrays interact through oscillatory feedback, their outputs are combined, forming a larger "fractal" representation of the sensory world. For example, individual visual neurons process small parts of a scene, but together, they form a cohesive image.

The Fractal Self: This fractal structure of perception and cognition scales up to form the "entified" self—a unified observer that emerges from the interplay of many smaller neural components. 

This entified self is recursive, constantly referring back to its smaller parts, just as a fractal at one level reflects the same structure as the whole.

Key Exploration: How might the fractal nature of consciousness extend beyond neural arrays into other forms of intelligence, including artificial systems? Could an AGI simulate this fractal entification by organizing smaller processing units into a unified, self-aware system?

SAN theory suggests that the cooperation between local and global scales involves dynamic feedback loops. The brain's neural networks operate in oscillating feedback loops, where each neural array can sense its state and that of neighboring arrays. This mutual sensing creates an entification process, forming the internal observer that experiences awareness.

These feedback loops resemble fractal structures, as they repeat similar patterns of interaction at different scales. Locally, feedback occurs within small neural clusters, while globally, it manifests as larger-scale oscillatory coordination between brain regions. For example, when a sensory input is processed, local neural activity generates high-frequency bursts, which then synchronize with global oscillatory patterns, creating a feedback mechanism that integrates the input into the overall cognitive state.

Traveling Waves and NAPOT's Neural Arrays: NAPOT argues that the brain constructs internal representations of reality by projecting and rendering sensory information via arrays of neurons that "see" and transmit. This aligns with the discussion in Foster's paper about traveling waves moving through cortical regions, organizing neural activity at different scales. The visualization of these waves in neuroimaging studies, moving across the cortex, matches the idea that neural arrays project and perceive phase changes, contributing to the entification of an observer within the brain​​.

My argument is that the physics of oscillation, general to physics and applicable to biology, to fireflies, to clocks, and to neurons, are what bind together our rendered representations of reality, the co-occurrence of similar representations, the neural correlates of which are oscillations in the brain will bind together to become a cup, a table, a chair, a room, a tv screen, the content on the tv screen, anything we see, hear, feel, taste or touch, anything in our ecosystem or in our bodies is presented to the mind as set of patterns from a set of arrays that are bound together with oscillation and lasting for a space of time, or spatially for a duration.

If we combine Hebb's idea of Neurons of cell assemblies forming links because of spatial & temporal consistent firing with the Steven Strogatz ideas about how fireflies & clocks synchronize, we can speculate that neurons wire together because they oscillate together (sync state), and they wire apart because they oscillate part (splay state), and I further speculate that the electromagnetism of the Action potential firing is stimulating the mitochondria to produce more ATP which causes new protein synthesis which is new cell growth, specifically new receptor growth, that represents a new state change in LTP & LTD, and the growth happens between cells that are firing in oscillation together. This is the same principle that causes plants to grow towards the sunlight, the stimulation of sunlight is like an oscillator interacting with the plant which is also an oscillator, the principles of oscillation's coupling explain why neurons oscillate in groups.

Basically the principles of neural coincidence detection (to dive deep into this topic I recommend "The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation by Peter Tse"), which is another way to think about Hebbian learning (similar to the idea that neurons that fire together wire together, and similar to the physics of oscillation where oscillators attract other oscillators and form clumps, and eventually an entire array of fireflies is oscillating in sync reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.) can apply to any material in theory, so a planet could be a coincidence detector, or a pattern detector that learns through its physical configuration to be more responsive to some patterns and less responsive to other patterns, this means that yes the entire cosmos could be a neural network, on a scale that is vast spatially & temporarily, but planets oscillate, earth oscillates, spacetime is imagined to be a harmonic oscillating field, and signals (light) travel between planets, stars, which is about what you need for the cosmos to be a giant neural network, albiet on difficult to imagine scales of time & space.

Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

The brains scattered representations are holographic in the sense that representations for every learned memory are learned collectively by the whole brain, similar to how a group of fireflies can act as a single sensor

It helped me to think of how the surface of a sensor, or the surface of satellite dish is essentially a bunch of atoms oscillating in a similar or homogenous pattern across the entire surface, and this similarity helped me to think of the hive of fireflies (while reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz) as single sensor array, because they were all synchronized together in the same oscillation. I don't think that author Steven Strogatz actually ever describes the group of synchronized fireflies as analogous to a sensor array, but it was what I was thinking when I read his book. It's because the tiny signals passed between fireflies continuously would cause them to eventually oscillate their light flashing together that I realized that if one firefly was captured by the tongue of a toad, or by a bug eating plant, or by some other predator, the omission of that fireflies signal would be felt by the entire collective because they were oscillating together, because their internal clocks were set to expect signals at a certain interval from their fellow fireflies. In such a way neurons that oscillate together could also be considered as a single sensor array, indeed the human body, with all of its cells, can be considered to be analogous to homogenous material, sort of like a satellite dish at the atomic scale, but closer to a hive of fireflies than a satellite dish, but either way I realized that the physics of oscillation allowed biological materials to magnify their functions. This is where I came with the idea of the entified Self in Self Aware Networks theory. In other words, cells are able to act as a single cell, because they replicate the same function, and that function magnifies with the area of its homogenous collaborators.

Neural Feedback Loops in Brain Perception: Firefly-like Oscillation
## Synchronization within neural networks through oscillation allows for collective sensing and perception, with neurons influencing one another in dynamic feedback loops.
they can combine their, just like fireflies, they can combine their individual sensing abilities into a collective sensing abilities.
So the firefly community, because they all oscillate together, they basically like, whenever any of them deviates from its standard oscillation,
that changes the phase, the, that sends a knock into all of the other oscillators,
because the signal becomes off.
So let's say one of the fireflies is eaten or one of the fireflies finds food and it comes, you know,
in some way its rate changes.
Either it's excited, or it's excited scared, or it's excited happy, or it's excited, you know, joyful,
or it's depressed in a stress relieving way, or it's depressed in a stressful way,
or it's depressed in a, you know, like it's different, like it's, now it's relaxed,
or now it's taking a nap, and it's like, it's all about what is that interaction signal
that's the phase change when one firefly deviates from its standard oscillation
is felt by the entire collection of fireflies.
They all dissipate that energy across their network, at least as far as the energy, I mean,
if it's so, if the energy is so, so small of a disturbance, it may not go across the entire network,
so maybe the entire network doesn't notice it in that case.
But in essence, what has happened is that this place of neurons aligned in a sensor array,
this layer, inside a column, for example, it is capable of the collective pattern learning, right?
It has multiplied its capabilities, and it has gone to...

Afterthoughts:
in a sense, that we are going to be looking at holograms,
and we are making tomograms in our brains.

fireflies sync, synchronized sensor/transmitter system, they will all notice faster when one of them falls out of sync, rippling happens, because the syncs are based on thresholds being reached on a regular basis, an inbited or excited bug will cause a rippling pattern across the entire oscillation that eventually gets absorbed and they all start synching again. Think of the group oscillation as magnified receptive field. All the fireflies are going to notice when any of their phases is disrupted, because each now will fire at a new interval. The reason machines can be conscious, the nature of oscillation is allowing a bunch of separate parts to be entified into a single entity. I compare thalamic modulation to the concept drop out, adding robustness to signals, this is the precursor to comparing thalamic modulation to the concept of noising in the diffusion model of artificial neural network. This note addresses how novel incoming sensory patterns oscillate as decaying oscillations, or resonating drums, the resonation will cause synaptic connections to grow, something thats growing is accelerating in relative time, it oscillates faster so relative to other things it grows faster

When one neuron fires it accelerates in time, but it inhibits its neighbors slowing them down in time, its synaptic pattern has evoked or magnified its synaptic pattern onto its inhibited neighbors, their slowdown, the slowdown affects the tonic oscillating field, because now all the neurons have to adjust their clocks again in reaction to the change in timing, until they are all in sync again. Group Short Term Depression concept: when groups cells are slightly out of sync with other groups of cells they get slightly unlinked. GSTD for Meso scale memory changes, however at the same time this effect will cause Group Short Term Potentiation GSTP because while they becoming unsynchronized with the larger oscillator they become synchronized with each other.

Just as fireflies use light signals to synchronize their flashing, neurons use electrical and chemical signals to synchronize their firing. This synchronization is crucial for coherent brain function, similar to how fireflies' synchronized flashing is vital for their group behavior.
