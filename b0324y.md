# Medium Length Summary by SciSummary (SciSummary uses ChatGPT):
In this article, the focus is on the complexity of emotions and its relationship with the brain. The speakers touch on the possibility of emotions being present in sensory areas of the brain instead of just the limbic system. They explore a study that found a specific region, V2, that could induce depressive-like states in rodents. The study controlled for visual influences and communication with limbic regions, making the findings compelling. However, the speakers argue that emotions may be distributed throughout a network of brain regions, rather than just being contained in discreet neuronal elements. They also discuss the difficulty in defining complex emotions and the impact of disorders such as psychopathy on emotional consciousness. The article suggests that consciousness may be fundamentally an emotional state defined by every other emotional state. The speakers suggest that understanding the neural basis of emotions could have implications for the treatment of emotional disorders.

Another article discusses the subject of consciousness and its relationship with neural elements. The author suggests that consciousness may be the inner experience of changes in physiology, including hormonal and epigenetic changes. The article explores the concept of epiphenomenonism, which suggests that consciousness is a phenomenon created by the brain that we passively observe. However, the author argues that consciousness does have causal powers, as it affects our actions and moral universe. Participants in the conversation express their interest in creating a mathematical or structural framework that can replicate the experience of consciousness. The conversation also touches on the topic of sociopathy, with a participant mentioning that 5% of the population may be sociopaths. Overall, the article highlights the complexity of the concept of consciousness and the ongoing philosophical and scientific debates surrounding it.

In another article, the discussion covers a range of topics, including psychopathy, neurogenesis, and consciousness. The speakers discuss the evolutionary aspect of psychopathic tendencies and how they may have had a function in society. They also touch on the potential benefits of psychopathy in certain professions, such as surgeons and test pilots. The conversation then shifts to the topic of neurogenesis and the role of protein synthesis in memory recall. They also explore the potential role of psychedelics in inducing neurogenesis and modifying gene expression. The speakers then discuss the topic of consciousness, suggesting that the problem with understanding it is that it is multifaceted. They discuss the need to unpack the concept of consciousness and recognize its complexity in order to make progress in understanding it. Overall, the conversation covers a range of complex topics in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and consciousness studies.

Another article discusses a theory of consciousness that proposes a solution to the "scale problem" of consciousness. The scale problem refers to the fact that there are many microscopic processes in the brain that contribute to conscious experience, but conscious experience itself is macroscopic. The proposed solution is that there must be information closure between the microscopic and macroscopic processes. The theory suggests that consciousness is not localized to specific neurons or brain regions but rather emerges from a dynamic structure within the neural electron of the brain. The article also touches on the potential role of psychedelics in modulating the flow of information in the brain and creating mixed experiences. The article concludes with a discussion of the challenges of course-graining microscopic events into macroscopic awareness and the recruitment of attentional spotlight according to adaptive rewards in the world.

The article discusses how behavior and attentional spotlight affect consciousness. The theory suggests that consciousness is not just based on the magnitude of a stimulus but also on its relevance to survival. The article also discusses the possibility of detecting a single photon and how a minute sensory signal can be amplified by recruiting more neurons to represent the source. The article also touches on the state of the art of instrumentation for studying the brain, with one strategy being dynamic causal modeling to establish deeper levels of connectivity. The article also discusses the role of emotions in the brain and how they affect decision-making and perception. The article suggests that the mind can be thought of as a cloud of resources, and emotions are a modality or attitude towards the world. There is also a discussion of achieving consciousness without ego or personality during psychedelic experiences or meditation. Overall, the article highlights the complexity of consciousness and the need for a framework to understand it.

The article discusses the relationship between ego dissolution experiences, emotions, and consciousness. The participants in the conversation agree that memories can be brought back from ego dissolution experiences. They also discuss the definition of ego and the low dimensionality of emotions. The conversation touches on the idea that emotions are not separate from thoughts and that they have a visceral basis that cannot be dissociated from the experience. The participants also discuss the importance of defining conscious emotion in mechanical terms before building an artificial, sentient emotional machine. The conversation ends with a discussion on high-level constructs related to consciousness and cognition, which are layered abstractions on top of low-level neural activity. Overall, the article highlights the complexity of emotions and consciousness and the need for a nuanced understanding of these concepts to make progress in the field of neuroscience.
The article provides insights into various theories and perspectives on consciousness, highlighting the intricacies of the concept and the challenges in studying it. One theory proposes that synchronized activity in the brain creates abstractions and consciousness, utilizing analogies from various fields to explain this concept. Another theory suggests that non-trivial information closure is necessary for conscious experience, allowing for the brain to model the environment and adapt to the current situation. The article also delves into the role of language, AI, and neuroscience in understanding consciousness, as well as the challenges in studying psychiatric disorders in rodents. Overall, the article showcases the complexity of consciousness and the ongoing research in the field of neuroscience to further our understanding of it. In a conversation between scientists, the topic of engrams, aphantasia, and visualization abilities is discussed, highlighting the complexities of consciousness that are still being uncovered.

In this scientific article, the topic of visualization and consciousness is explored. The article suggests that one out of every 50 people experiences a condition called fantasia, which leads to only darkness when attempting to visualize. The reason for this could be linked to the brain's occupation with other tasks, rendering the visual environment, and a suggestion is made that sensory deprivation may improve these individuals' ability to visualize. Moreover, the article delves deeper into the intersection between psychiatry and consciousness, citing how trauma can impact sensory experience and voluntary sensory conjuring or imagery. The difficulty in creating a consistent model of psychiatric conditions is also touched upon, and the article recommends the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a potential solution. In addition, the article highlights the challenges of debugging complex neural networks in AI and acknowledges the need for further research in both AI and psychiatry. 

The article also features a discussion on various aspects of AI and consciousness, where participants raise moral concerns about using AI in the interview process. The limitations of AI in understanding context and reasoning are touched upon, and the possibility of AI reaching human consciousness is explored. The definition of consciousness is defined in detail, highlighting its complex nature. The discussion also touches on schizophrenia as a disorder of consciousness and its potential link to language and consciousness. 

The article examines the challenges of understanding consciousness and creating artificial intelligence that can mimic human behavior. The temporoparietal junction's role in inducing out-of-body experiences is explored through electromagnetic stimulation and linked to trauma and personality disorders. Moreover, the article discusses the idea that consciousness is a product of neural activity in the brain and its potential disruption. 

The topic of altered consciousness is also discussed, where the reorganization of neural activity flow to partition consciousness to escape pain and suffering is explored. The article also features an interview with a person experiencing depersonalization and derealization disorder, which alters their brain's processing of stimuli. Furthermore, the causes and effects of anxiety and worry on strange experiences are touched upon, such as persistent hallucinations.

Finally, the article discusses a patient who had psychogenic seizures, challenging traditional understanding of consciousness. Despite the EEG being normal, the patient exhibited symptoms of epileptic seizures, suggesting subconscious imitation or metabolic conditions as potential causes.

Overall, the article explores the multifaceted and complex nature of consciousness and highlights the need for continued research in this field.

# Beginning of the Whisper Transcription below:
Crush is actually not unlike that of if I see someone running toward me, you know

So I don't know but it's the meaning that we give to it

And I say all that to say that that's probably up until about two months ago

So I reviewed this manuscript, which provide a very compelling

# Emotion from Visual Cortex
Story and what they investigated what they observed is that there is an area of the visual cortex

V2 so supplemental so sort of the second in line from the primary visual area and they provide a very compelling

story

That that region in and of itself could induce

Depressive like states this is in rodents and mice

Specifically and they did the appropriate controls they controlled for the visual influences of an emotional state

they controlled for

Making sure that the projections from this V2 area did not in fact send any kind of projection or communication to limbic regions

And so it was really compelling and it sort of

Opened my my conceptual framework for perhaps there are regions within sensory areas


That are yet as yet unobservable unexplored that they in themselves can contain

Fundamental properties of emotion that we just don't give a lot of attention to

Yeah, yeah, I would say because and again

This is really just the hypothesis, but you set the challenge effectively

to make the case that emotions are

Dominant in terms of

Actual neural dynamics and processing or whether vision is as dominant as it's sort of canonically claimed to be I

I

Wouldn't see a seat to unseat the canonical view, but I would say that

Yeah, the past 20 years and even before

We have understood and in with increasing definition the extent to which emotional state lenses

the perception of vision and actually all the other senses as well and also what particular

aspects of the visual sensorium recruit attention and also how it is that

Uh, stimuli under certain conditions or conditions of context will be differentially interpreted as either rewarding or

You know threatening, etc. And then at a

Final level of gradation

It seems to be and I cannot vouch for the inner experience of rodents, but certainly as humans traverse the world

we seem to be

applying aesthetic judgments to just about everything that we look at and

We are doing that extremely rapidly without ever consciously engaging. Well

Without the need necessarily to consciously engage with the you know, do I like the look of this?

Does this seem like a nice place to be?

Do I know how do I feel about this without having to ask ourselves the question? So

It seems to be the case that at least

in terms of the phenomenology and there's also

Evidence from functional connectivity that yes emotions are both

Lensing attention where attention is recruited under context and also

Basically serving to interpret visual information all the time

(Micah)
That's a that's a good point

I don't know if people remember recent papers about emotions being critical to influence that decision-making

We're actually just being necessary for decision-making to happen at all

But as Dexter was talking I was thinking about you know when I see something I might have an emotional reaction to what I'm seeing and

So it's plausible that what shared was saying

You know that emotions might be happening in the in the in the visual in the second layer of the visual cortex

It's very interesting and

but as I've heard this author his name is his first name is Peter last name is spelled Tse and

He was suggesting that the basis of decision-making happens at the neural level

and

# What is the neural basis of emotion?
It would be interesting if

Emotions are also happening at the neural level

You know from from a single neuron to a small neural circuit in a micro cortical column to to

You know across across the entire brain. I don't know exactly know how

That would work yet, but but it's sort of it is a mind-expanding idea. I'd love to hear the people's thoughts

(First speaker)
I guess it's sort of to me

I think of if emotions were contained within discreet neuronal elements

What would be the evolutionary value to that? So for example if I suffered a

Mutation, you know in that cell type that's encoding for that specific emotion

Would I you know the inability to experience? Obviously fear. I think you know

We could agree that that would be evolutionarily maladaptive because fear absolutely serves a role critical role in our survival

What about other emotions? What about the positive emotions with that?

somehow either benefit or lead to a detriment to my survival, so I wonder if

redundancy there

plays an important role and so I

I tend to favor maybe a view that emotions are distributed among a network and

throughout the brain and then probably

We don't have the computational power to delineate fine-tune gradations and emotions, which I also think there is a paper by

# Find Paper
Kim last name is Kim 2012 2013 in nature and essentially

What they were making the argument for was in the extended amygdala

it was between the amygdala and the BNST that they found a

Cluster of neurons that were able by way of their projections to encode separable features of anxiety

so for example

there was a circuit from

The basal lateral amygdala to lateral hypothalamus and that encoded say the vigilance component

Another one that can control the respiratory component. So hyper

Ventilation and things like that and so I think that that's also a very interesting way to sort of look at emotions as

separable features kind of group it all together, you know anger fear anxiety, but

Maybe in effect if we subscribe to that physiological model of emotions that it's really just

In their subjective experience of a range of physiological changes that we could actually map out each physiological

shift

And then probably find that all of the neurons that are responsible for all of those changes

Are encoded and probably act together synergistically and comprise what we consider any emotion

(Dexter)
Yeah, I very much like that and I think it's your original statement that would make good evolution evolutionary sense that you would have

Multiple redundancy you could survive mutations and damage to one area one column. That's a yeah great argument

(Micah)
Well, I'm sort of wondering what the um, you know, so we have our we have we can describe the humans the human beings the inner experience

But but I'm also wondering so when something travels to your inner inexperience when something when an emotion like anxiety or fear travels into

your limbic system

What does that look like are we are as a neuroscientist share a share it

Or any other neuroscientist neuroscientist in the state. Are you are you folks seeing?

Papers that suggest, you know, maybe higher frequency patterns for anxiety or fear or something

Are we getting close to being able to identify?

you know like a like a high-level cluster of frequency patterns that might indicate that someone is their inner state might be moving towards a

Fear a more afraid state or more anxiety state or more joyful state is does that exist yet? You think

(Speaker 4)
For fear

I would say just do research on

The circuits that are within the amygdala

Yeah

Just a quick response

(First Speaker)
Yeah, that's a very interesting question

I don't have an answer for you Micah, but I can maybe provide a little bit of insight on the reverse of that

Which is if we stimulated different parameters at different parts of the brain? Can we induce?

Like different emotional experiences and there is this paper that came out the big top of this year. There really is I think it will be

Probably one of those like

Hallmark papers was done in humans and it was the end of one. However, what they managed should do

They implanted multiple stimulating electrodes in a human. This was a patient who

Was undergoing deep brain stimulation for depression. And so they placed

Stimulating electrodes at different parts of the brain and they essentially mapped out almost in the way that we look if we think of old

You know cortical mappings of you know functional anatomic relationships, but they did this

In a very sort of systematic way and we're able to say things like five-hertz stimulation at this part of the brain induced

Panic-like responses versus two-hertz stimulation at this part of the brain induced euphoric light sensations

# Find Paper
And I'll get the author for you, but I think that was an interesting way

To maybe look at perhaps there are frequency dynamics also

So it's not just the anatomy, but perhaps their electrophysiological

Signatures and by way of the communication that tells us something about an emotional state

(Dexter)
Yeah, I think maybe those two things

actually wrapped together and

They're not

mutually exclusive so we had these two models of the

This idea of the brain as a localized

You know anatomically bound structure where where there was this region which was associated with this emotion and this behavior

and then there were these

kind of

Oscillations that were difficult to pin down in terms of their relation to behaviors and

so

There's good evidence to show that that both actually pair and that the frequency of

Oscillation relates to the distance of

Functional connectivity, so the message passing

Is modulated from a particular area according to its frequency

So as an example like gamma band frequency firing in the

The ventral stratum basically bespeaks a distant connectivity to other parts of the brain

And I don't want to sound overly kind of new-agey, but a kind of an integration or recruitment of

wider network of areas, so

The effect that you might see

from

Stimulating in reverse one part of the brain with a particular frequency would invoke

The appropriate pairing of other regions which would then entrain the emotional state. So, yeah, those two things

There's yeah, if you just look for I think

# Find Paper
One paper is an example, but there's a whole bunch of literature

but if you look at I think a gamma that you just type into Google scholar like gamma band oscillations and

Yeah, just the word long-distance. I think

You'll you'll see an example of this. So so those things might not be mutually exclusive and they might bespeak

Functional connectivity across anatomical regions to create the emotional state and entrained behavior

(Micah)
Okay, I'm wondering if anyone wants to ask further questions in this topic now would be a good time and

Go ahead

(Speaker 5)
Thanks for bringing me out to the stage

so my idea was

We're talking about emotions like they are some clear-cut concept and very well-defined, but I think in truth

humans

Do have a problem with describing and defining emotions, especially complex ones for example take

Alexi themeia as a condition

Which is lost for for words for what you feel

It's one part and the second part is

There is although there is a research about emotional balance

And neural correlates of that

(Speaker 4)
Um, yeah, there's a lot of different ways that emotions are expressed in humans and also different organisms and a

I

Think wait, where are you saying is I forgot what's the disorders called? Is it is it anis?

No, sir. Oh

Okay, I know there's

There's a lot of cases where drugs like wheat can actually

Make it so that certain people

Kind of lose their ability to experience emotions, but there's also

people that have disorders like psychopathy

Opathy where they literally they usually have or were born with either an altered

Amygdala or they have damage to their amygdala and they cannot experience the emotions of empathy

or

Sadness or sometimes even happiness or

grief

and

Yeah, these things these things do impact

the

ways that

Emotional consciousness should be studied as well, especially five percent of the population is made up of

sociopaths and psychopaths

So that actually is a pretty large amount

Yeah

Lack of empathy is common with

Autistic spectrum disorders and with ADHD

People so it's not specific to say yeah

Yes, there's maybe something different going on with psychopaths in that

Yeah, you do have of course a classic

Classically emotional bluntness, but you seem to have an upregulation or a census

sensitization to

Dopaminergic rewards, so the impulsivity that you see in psychopathy accounts

for the

It is hypothesized the exploitative goal-seeking behavior at the expense of other

you know rewards, you know

Opioid rewards or activation of the oxytocin system and just in the absence of

You know this or other in the presence of this of these blunted emotions you have a

Yeah, a natural upregulation

of

Dopaminergic rewards and tend to gain purchase on the world in other terms, which are yeah per dopamine purely

engaged in

prediction and reward which beget the

Psychopathic phenotype I

(Micah)
Well, you know while yall talking I was just imagining that

# Imagine consciousness as an emotional state, and emotional experience as some derivative state, or difference to the baseline state.
For probably for the first time that that maybe consciousness is fundamentally an emotional state

with like sort of universally

But but it would be defined as if like like if you can imagine

Imagine imagine the conscious working space is a is including everything you're conscious of right now the sort of

maybe defined in in terms of a temple of spatial patterns and so someone who who is

You know, and I don't I don't a side note as I guess I kind of wanted to distinguish the terms psychopathic from social from sociopathic

But but I guess it's not super important right now, but I was just imagining. Yeah, so maybe someone who's

a psychopath

Is sort of stuck in a certain kind of emotional state and is unable to

Have empathy towards other people in a neurotypical way, but but but I think that maybe that is still a kind of emotional state

As if everything is like if you're not in one emotional state

You're in another one and every in like so every alternative emotional state is defined by every other one

It's like and it's just a it's a weird sort of

Idea I'll just pause for a second

(First Speaker)
Well, I really like that because when I think about

Emotional states as an epiphenomenon of

Physiology physiology essentially and the inner experience of the physiology

It accounts for the differences in time scales, you know

For example, when we're talking about the level of hormonal secretion that can occur over 12 to 24 to 36 hour

Whereas we know a neurotransmission, you know, it is in a fraction of a second and so

some unifying

Modality not modality, but some unifying framework to make sense of how in an experience

And you know, not necessarily

Make those time scales equivalent, but I think it does provide a framework for

the inner experience or the subjective experience and

How that can be uncoupled or unpaired from

The time scale over which, you know, being things work because I think one of the issues that complicates the in my mind the conversation around

consciousness is

How do we if we are saying that neural elements compose?

the experience of consciousness, how do we make sense of the fact that for example

neurons can change and they can

influence and shift at

Such a rate before we are aware of something happens

So, you know, for example, if I see something looming a looming object either above me or specifically in my periphery

There's an element of my experience that knows it has identified that but then

Normally it takes usually a second longer for me to be quote-unquote consciously aware that that element has entered, you know

Through my periphery and so I do think that when we kind of consider

Physiology in the time constraints over which, you know hormones are secreted and even if we want to get more inclusive

We're talking about epigenetic changes. You know, maybe an hour ago. I do kind of think of

You know, perhaps consciousness is just the inner experience of all of these changes and it's not

Located in any one of those

(Dexter)
Yeah, that was a really great description which narrows down on the philosophical problem

You know, in a very precise way that I think is useful and

Share that I'm tempted to ask do you subscribe to the epiphenomenonism at all levels that

consciousness may just

Be a phenomenon with a sort of one-way arrow out of the brain, but without recursion

(Nancy)
Good evening. Can I speak into that place? My name is Nancy from the Netherlands

I thank you all for yeah, thank you. I thank you all for your

Great conversations. I'm here for a few hours now because I if you some see my bio

Then you may see that I'm very intrigued with what you all say because I like to learn

Your way because I know my way and what I know is it seems that you don't know and that's why I want to ask you something

Because you say all the things I would like to hear so I know the other side of me

But I'm very spiritual and if you talk about consciousness like you do and then I'm not a neuroscience at all

So I try to understand everything and by hearing you

Yeah, I start to learn what you mean and then you talk about consciousness and I thought are you all?

not spiritual at all or a little bit or that's what I really like to know because then you

When you do some things what I do, then you understand what consciousness is because consciousness is like it's all

like energy is all this energy and it is all and

And then when I think that's

(Micah)
I know I have the feeling that the the the person who started this group would would be upset if I if I let us go

Yeah, me too. I I just remembered your show box definition of spirituality

It's sort of

I

Guess I guess I would say I sort of for the most part. I

For the most part I I feel like I have an obligation because to the person who started this group to sort of steer us away from

spiritual topic a

Little bit is a sort of a sort of an off-topic area

But I don't want to be too restrictive. So if anyone wants to reply they can but

I could

(Speaker 7)
Go for it. Thanks. Thanks, Micah. I'm fancy that and I really agree with Michael

We I don't I'd prefer us. We don't go down the spiritual route

But I also get exactly what you're saying and so I've had this question asked to me several times before and

What I would say is what I'm attempting to do in my work

Is to and of course I can't speak for everyone also is just because that's their own

Interpretation but for me I want I'm out to create mathematics that has that same experience that you're describing. I

Don't know what that experience. It looks like in mathematical terms or explain it scientifically

but

That would be what I'm attempting to do to create a being or mathematics or some kind of structure that's repeatable

That allows or allows that that structure to experience reality in the same or consciousness in the same way that

Your eye or anyone else does

(Dexter)
Yes, I'm in the same spirit. I'm only the question but

I

Glancing lightly across it. I don't consider myself to be a particularly spiritual person

but in my study of

human origins and

Anthropology and the assemblage of human culture I have come to a very different view than I had prior as to the importance of

both religion and spirituality to

the human culture and it's

Yeah, our ability to engage in large-scale cooperation

I know that sounds like a very dry answer, but I have a I would say a

Respect would be the wrong word almost a reference for

spirituality and religion even if I myself am not particularly

spiritual but

Sure, if I can I was really curious if you're interested in your answer to the question of epiphenomenonism

Whether you think consciousness has causal powers

It's not no worries, but you you you pose the dilemma super well, I thought

(First Speaker)
Yeah, can I ask you to clarify when you say you said recursive?

So

(Dexter)
Epiphenomenon as generally understood is just that a phenomenon

Supervenes on a particular state of that of matter so consciousness supervenes on brain states, but it does

It is caused by brain states, but it doesn't have any return

causation upon

the way that that neurons are firing firing turn in other words, it's

Just a your poor caricature but just for illustration. It's like an ectoplasm that's sort of like

You know smokes off the top of the brain, but is like the engine from the fun world of a train

It doesn't actually be in any particular way influence the motion or operation of the train

That's very very interesting, you know when you said that I thought of I

Guess my I would pose a question back to you then which is what happens when you respond to a

Change in consciousness or what happens when you're responding in kind to your consciousness state

therefore for example, you're taking actions that may

Lead to an emotional state

That would then you know like as you said will bring it back to brain-wide changes

So I think of what happens if and as a response to me feeling sad, you know, I'm aware of I'm conscious

I'm aware of my emotional state

So then I go and I consume alcohol or I engage in a pattern of activity that you know

And the psychopath logical framework would be considered addiction and we know

That chronic let's say substance use

Changes my generic epigenetic

you know

Consequences which then in terms because that is a fundamental substrate and my experience that composes my conscious awareness

but then

Kind of create a loop and I think that in some ways as I'm thinking about it out loud

Perhaps when we think about addiction, you know, if I use that as a framework

then it really is that recurrent nature because there is as a

Response to my experience. I'm engaging in the world in the way to either

Mitigate negative feelings or to go towards positive, you know experiences

However, as I engage those changes inadvertently. I'm sorry those actions inadvertently have consequences on my genetic material

or by way of epigenetic changes or

You know and as it relates to amphetamines and alcohol and things like that actually causes structural changes at the level of the neuron

Which as we already said all of those elements make up your conscious awareness

# So therefore you're actually shifting your your conscious state
So therefore you're actually shifting your your conscious state

And so I don't know I guess I will pose it back to you whether you would agree with I

Was just praying you won't ask my own question back to me

(Speaker Unknown)
Sorry, we're supposed to skip this question

(Dexter)
No, this is not a question of spirituality. This is a question of consciousness and

the question in

Phenomenology and philosophy of mind as to whether consciousness actually

Has causal powers

Or whether it is just a phenomenon created by the brain that we

In some sense passively observed. So yeah, it's a it's a rigorous philosophical and and scientific

(unknown speaker)
Extra can you just clarify? Are you are you?

are you

Including the world of interacting and getting feedback from others or human relations or

Interacting with the world and is that part of your question as to whether

Consciousness has an effect or not or are you are you thinking of it in a different sense?

(Dexter)
I'll put all my cards on the table. So

Some years ago, maybe 10 I was yeah

Had I been asked I would have said that I subscribed to epiphenomenalism and it's a

Wasn't the time less so now, but it was at the time the majority of you in cognitive sciences

Just given that

Neurons operate at the level of classical mechanics classical mechanics is deterministic

Neurons will interact according to the laws of physics and therefore

since physics when we discovered that cells are

Characterizable in terms of physics at the level not only of their sort of biophysiology, but also in terms of their

Electrodynamics

It basically they got the notion although this had existed previously in philosophy that this is a sort of clockwork

biological machine and any experience

Can't interfere with physics and this appeals to the classic Cartesian

No, the question of the classic mind-body problem. How does a non-physical?

experience interact with

You know physical a physical substrate and effective. So can I yeah, that would yep. Yes, so go ahead

(Micah)
So I want to respond to this so I read a book

that addressed this

This exact thing that that's brought up, but but I just want to point out that

That's sort of like what's implied in what you're saying is that consciousness is a non-physical

activity and

And I can't possibly agree with that

So if I so here so the book was called that that I believe you would enjoy reading is called the Neuro basis of free will

# a criteria causation by Peter Ulric Tse
a criteria causation by Peter Ulric Tse

The Peter and the last name is TSE so so basically he

he

He attacks the problem of how consciousness can influence the world

It's it's a new argument. It's

he examines the biophysics of synapses and neurons and

Neuro circuits and he

Proposes an idea for how a Neuro circuit can consider

How neurons can detect information as coincidence patterns, you know like he been learning and a Neuro circuit can consider that information and

# the reason for consciousness the reason for a conscious experience would be like
the reason for consciousness the reason for a conscious experience would be like

You know if you face a problem, that's too complex for your unconscious mind to solve

You need to integrate so much information that it becomes

conscious and then if if it's then if it's then so the purpose the role of

Being conscious would be to just solve higher level problems in the context of higher level coordination

That wouldn't be possible with lower level brain activity and and then the result of your

conscious considerations would be your your actions

and all of these would be physical processes so

So in that sense if if his work is correct, then that would mean that your

your your consciousness is not passive, but it's an essential role to making

Complex decisions that are that are of a higher order and and then that that directly affects your actions

(Dexter)
absolutely

And so I don't know if you caught this but the sort of entree to my description was it had you asked me 10 years ago

So that was my position and it's a fairly common position and incognito science and as I said, but perhaps less common

but

per David Chalmers

More or less at one point was the sort of standard view in Neuroscience

What changed my view? Yes, exactly

In line with the view that you suggest was a

Really another

Chain of reasoning but it arrives at more or less the same place and it was simply to notice

That the moment that you are talking about consciousness you are

consciousness is

Exerting causation in the world you give a seminar on consciousness and hundreds of people come

They are not coming because consciousness has no effect on the world

But more to the case our entire moral universe appears to be

Ordinated according to our description of the presence of consciousness in particular entities. So

You know torturing a human being

Generally, there's a white consensus that this is a this is a moral ill but torturing a

Old chair or a rock doesn't recruit the same kind of moral concerns and on that basis alone the fact that we

consider

for instance

when we look at end of life for people in vegetative states the

Key component that we consider is not is this a human being is their blood flowing is the basic physiology running is is their

consciousness resident

It's very very clearly

Long before we get to neurons and their interrelationship with the attentional states

at a basic level that you can access just from

Operating in the world as a moral agent consciousness seems very much to be involved in the causal chain of our

(unknown speaker)
well, I mean from a philosophical point of view

This implies that I mean we haven't found anything in the universe

That has it

It will of its own

I mean this goes back to the

philosophical problem of free will which I do not believe as a determinist

Exists at all. We just haven't understood it, but

as I said it must imply that

Okay, so our brain is something magical that is

Something different from everything else in the universe and I can't guess that on that

And

Um

But I actually

If the information is a topic

I just want to go back to to what we learned from it. Was it read who taught us that five percent of

all of us are sociopaths

Sorry dexter to do too, but but anyway

Um, it's that is true

Ellen of you thought about this having a evolutionary aspect or is it just a disorder I

Mean that's just like there's the psychopathic or sociopathic

Tendencies have a function in in in society to say about 40 to 30 people

Evolutionary many have been suggested, but maybe someone knows more about this than I do, but if not, I'd be happy to answer

I know a bit more about

Psychopathy in animals more than human beings

Which I evolutionarily there were more

Many hundreds of years ago, so I do know that

Although I would have to touch up

Research more to discover the frequency. Although there's animals like sharks

And also wasps that

Essentially are almost entirely psychopaths

Yeah, I didn't know what they have that

large amount of empathy among them

(unknown speaker)
So sorry sorry dexter

Probably I could answer a little bit. Um, I got my start in

Like psychology and AI by studying extreme human behavior. So I could answer the question, but dexter, I think you could probably

Try to answer first and I can I can jump in

(Dexter)
Okay. Yeah, just I'll give a brief answer and yeah, if you if you know a lot about this, you'll fill in a bunch of blanks

So yes, of course

Evolutionarily, uh, the known pitfalls are that you can just come up with a narrative which would be maybe it was the case that it

You know blah blah blah some circumstance

It was useful, you know to have low empathy and not care for others and you know be selfish or whatever it is

But yeah, there seem to be some

To be some uh, likely benefits. It's worth remembering that for a condition like psychopathy you have

Well, this is an argument which is not completely settled, but that you have

gradations of

basically

the expression of

psychopathy and so it like

for instance

certain

pathologies like schizophrenia. It's theorized that a lesser expression of the phenotype is actually highly adaptive

per schizotypalism, but just a few places where in the modern day

Psychopathy appears to confer benefits and then you don't have to track too far back to an evolutionary circumstance to imagine how

in

Very small quantities this may have offered some advantage. So when you look at certain professions

Surgeons lawyers

Astronauts

test pilots

Special forces you have rather high levels of psychopathy or trade cycle trade

Psychopathy and so the interesting things here are well known that under

conditions of stress

Psychopaths tend to

Be less

Deflected in their attentional states. So it's not that they don't feel fear. It's just that their spotlight of attention

Narrows to task

In a way that is adaptive rather than being

deflected constantly per

The common experience that people have on the conditions of fear with a panic. So

you know for

Test pilots for instance that are in situations where you know, they are pushing a plane to the envelope of its abilities

they need to attain a particular sort of concentration and

focus on task which

Yeah seems to be beneficial

In a different way with surgeons the same kind of steadiness of hand

Appears to be

Yeah, very very very useful two things been wrapped together there. It may be that a psychopath may feel less of the

Moral responsibility for if it is, you know that they kill a person accidentally. This could be maladaptive if they are

You know unsure in their actions. Thanks. So

Yeah, there's a few traits there in the modern day, which you don't have to reason back

Too far to think that those are likely adaptive in all sorts of societies. I kind of go ahead

(Micah)
Thank you. Thank you for the answer. I kind of want to stairs away from that

I feel like we're drifting a little bit into psychology and sociology a little bit

I want to go back to a neuroscience and an AI. It's fine. I find thank you. Thank you

That was really a nice thing. It's very good answer. I

wanted to ask so someone mentioned

the paper about

It's about using psychedelic drugs and in that having some effect on on the brain in terms of neurogenesis and I

# Find Paper
read this paper on

Basically a new study on Alzheimer's where they induced

new protein synthesis and and that had a positive result in animals where the animals memory immediately

improved it's like a lot of focus has gone on the the role of the

The plaques that are there in the brain. I forget what they're called

But but this took it, you know, so like a totally different approach like hey

what if we just improve the new protein synthesis which is involved with long-term potentiation and and

# Just for memory recall because I because I didn't really think of LTP as something that would be necessary for memory recall
Just for memory recall because I because I didn't really think of LTP as something that would be necessary for memory recall

Right. You like it seems it when when I read it

I don't know if other people had this some this idea too that it was just necessary for you need a new protein to store

A long-term memory, but but this suggests you need a new you need a new protein to retrieve a long-term memory

And that's sort of a novel idea, but but I'd love to hear from the neuroscientists about

maybe sort of

You know, can't do you know of anything? What induces new protein synthesis?

you can can psychedelics and neuro and you know

new

Neurogenesis I'll go in positive. I think people can take it from there

(Speaker Ramsey)
You know, I'm back at the right time

Proteins and this is I think

You know from basic biological principles comes from

Just like DNA transcription

and transatlation

At the ribosomes so, you know, maybe there could be some

You know

epigenetic things going on. Maybe there are certain

You know receptor activations that cause

Downstream signaling in neurons, especially in G protein coupled receptors in which

Sorry if I was interrupted in my my phone alarm went off

Um, yeah psychedelics work on the serotonin to a receptor primarily which is a G protein coupled receptor and

G protein coupled receptors have secondary signaling

Inside of the cell and it's possible that the secondary signaling activate a cascade of

molecular signalers that might

you know, call

modified the expression of some DNA and the expression of DNA basically I think

# Almost all functions of DNA are expressed through protein synthesis at the right at the ribosomes
Almost all functions of DNA are expressed through protein synthesis at the right at the ribosomes

(First Speaker)
So, right? Yeah, and I was just gonna chime in. Yeah, Ramsey's right, but as it relates to

neuro neuro active

protein synthesis for the person LTP or

LTD for that matter

It's a pretty canonical

Mechanism that has been known for about probably 40 years now, but essentially

It's related and it's related to

Pre-synaptic

activity and so we can actually induce it artificially protein synthesis by

Either mechanically or using optogenetics to stimulate the pre-synaptic terminal and essentially what happens at that pulse synaptic in the

Part of the neuron that's budding

You know where we decide to stimulate

essentially

# that induces increased calcium concentration and that as Ramsey
that induces increased calcium concentration and that as Ramsey

alluded to their proteins there

when we're talking about AMPA and

Glutamate receptors that are specialized for this kind of technique activity and it induces second

Secondary changes that has the effect of

gene transcription and translation of these modified

protein receptors that are

uniquely tethered to that neuron in that terminal such that

Activity becomes coupled so it's sort of like birth this term of you know

Cells at fire together wire together, and I just wanted to add that that actually have that also happens I should say and the limbic

limbic areas and the consequence of that is what we see as PTSD like phenomenon where

An external stimulus which normally would you know cause you to jump

Causes this you know after the LTP has taken place causes a huge physiological response

and and it's thought to be fundamental a fundamental mechanism to how

Traumatic experiences can persist long after you know even the remote memory of it has has ceased

So yeah, it's quite interesting

So does that play a role in sort of like you know

(Micah)
 transgenerational memories where where the animal an animal might have memories from its grandparent

(First Speaker)
Good question, I'm not really sure

(Unknown)
Difficult to know I actually wanted to ask a question you showed about your example about the olfactory

Epigenetic effect and the association

So that's different from typical

epigenetic effects

Where you have something like a you know an increased propensity to vigilance or you know anxiety

That's a very very specific and talk as I understood from your explanation of the experiment. It's a very very specifically targeted

inheritance of

aVersiveness to a very particular olfactory stimulus, right?

So it's difficult to explain that in the classic terms of you know the release of glutecorticoids

impacting or causing a

Decrease in the volume of let's say the amygdala or other parts of the brain relevant to the fear response

that's a

Just if I if I had that your

Recapitulation of the experiment correctly, that's an incredibly precisely targeted response. Is that right?

# First Speaker
Yes, it was a beautiful set of experiments

Amazing controls because they showed that it was that particular odorant and they even isolated the specific molecules

That compose that odorant and showed that at the level of the olfactory sensory neuron receptor

But it was that precise transmission that has altered and caused the huge effect that persisted throughout generations

I mean again that work is the final author on that. I'm sorry. The first author is Brian Dies 2015

Dies, and it was published in Nature Neuroscience

The year escapes me maybe 2015, but

# Dexter
So so that's extraordinary and considering the mechanism for that being so targeted

so you're basically saying that the glomular eye in the

offspring was essentially modeled upon the change of the glomular eye given the initial condition and

that

Would seem, you know, my hypothesis there would be that it would likely involve if you said it involves

microRNA signaling it would

Perhaps yeah, good candidate for that would be extracellular vesicles

Which can cross the blood-brain barrier and also

the M of mRNA in these

Yeah, messenger EVs can be guided to target as I understand it by non-coding DNA

But I just have experience of this just in oncology

where this happens in tumor genesis, but

Per Ramses comments that this would need to happen

essentially at the level of the germline

It would be extraordinary if an extracellular vesicle could be guided

In its delivery of mRNA to a precise target that would affect a precise population of

glomular eye, it's extraordinary and it suggests not only

inheritance and these epigenetic effects, but also a potentially fantastically accurate modality for

Cures and therapies for developmental disorders

Where we able to harness it? I'm curious to be a full set

(First Speaker)
Yeah, I mean don't have much to add I can just say that you sound like one of the reviewers

at nature they actually

It's suggested those types of experiments and so the group wasn't able to do it so

So yeah, it's the ongoing

Okay, awesome. Thank you. Can I ask a question?

(unknown)
so

there's

this research that's ongoing about

# ibogaine and
ibogaine and

That it its administration modifies gdnf and pdnf expression in some brain regions and

what they

They researched what's the

underlying mechanisms of

ibogaine's effects on

addictive behavior and self-administration of drugs etc etc if

You could explain, please the gdnf and pdnf

Mechanisms and how

How they are involved in circuitry. Thank you

(Micah)
So that's a pretty tough question, I don't know if if anyone wants to take that on

if

You want to if you want to rephrase it so bdnf

Go ahead

Hi guys, I had something to contribute but if unless we want to wait and get a response to the last question

Okay, go ahead and we'll think about the last question while you're talking

Sure

(unknown)
So, yeah, I've been

Waiting to get added for nearly two hours

So there's been so many topics that I could address but maybe I'll ask you guys like

Would you like I feel like I have things I could share on like

theories of consciousness or or

Miss misadventures more like that that we're making here in this room about thinking about consciousness and also like frameworks for emotion

So I guess you can choose which which topic

You'd care for me to chime in on I

Love to be corrected. So anything you choose from my point of view know about other people

Well, I mean, I think

What's kind of funny is just a moment ago

It's like we were talking about psychopathology and then that was decided that that was a bit off topic

And so we launched it to a diversion into neurogenesis and secondary signaling of G protein coupled receptors and ribosome and transversial memories

And I don't really see how this like I don't think we're gonna make much progress like like what's the strategy here?

It's like what if we understand enough about the low-level details of

Neurobiology that we're gonna have a better theory of consciousness like I don't think it's gonna work out though

I think we're operating at the wrong layer of abstraction

and so what what I propose is that like the problem with with like even thinking about consciousness is that we keep talking about it

Like it's like this single thing and and it's not there's like a lot of disparate

Ideas bundled up in this in this work. And so like, you know, what can make a problem?

Seem really hard and mysterious is that if you wrongly insist that something is simple

Then it remains a mystery because you're actually facing an intricate problem

And you're unlikely to find a path towards solving it until you recognize how complex it is and so

Like I think that begins with unpacking this the suitcase word consciousness and like like

Anyone just think for a moment about what are you conscious of right now?

Just like to pick something like you're conscious of my voice

You may be conscious of a coffee cup on the table in front of you

You're maybe conscious of like the response that you're you're putting together and

To what I'm saying here. Like there's a lot of different things there, right?

So like part of it is like like reaction like it's part of being conscious of things

This is like we react to them or and we recognize things we characterize things

There's aspects of attention and attentional control, but we imagine things like we we make decisions

We recall things we you know, we select among alternatives like we we plan

Like for future behaviors, there's emotional elements

There's all kinds of different types of representational components like language is involved

You know, there's there's like anticipation and reasoning and intention and reflection and self-reflection

And so like if we keep talking about this thing like it's one thing that we're trying to find or solve or define or measure

We're just never could have figured it out because people have been making this mistake for hundreds of years. And so I disagree and I

(unknown speaker)
Everybody who studies new rescience

That can unlock the key to the classic problem of free will

which is

still a magical object that is

completely unexplained and I think

I believe that's the root key here to understand consciousness

I mean, what is it really?

(other speaker)
Well, that's kind of my point is that free will seems like a mystery and conscious seems like a mystery because like if you think about it

It's like a thing like there's all kinds of words from psychology like like intuition willpower

creativity

You know free will that like we think about it like it's something because it's like the paradox of consciousness is that like the more

Consciousness like you have the more layers of processes that divide you from the world

And so like you get progressively distance from the external world in a way that makes you feel like we inhabit some mental world

And and it's it's somehow like this dualist idea that we're it's like metaphysical or something and it's not at all

And the problem is that we don't have sophisticated enough

Yeah, I'm sorry

(Ramsey)
Yeah, I was going to say and maybe maybe maybe just like push back on one of the maximum criticisms

Or I could drill down into what the theory of a framework for emotion might look like in in like a proper model of consciousness

Well, okay. Yeah max. I hear you. I hear you. I just want to add that I don't think you know much of the conversation in this room has been strictly

Constrained to the topic of the room in the title. I think you know we started talking about consciousness

And kind of just like went on like a free flow about like an assortment of different neuroscience topics

You know kind of just like you know, what are we interesting to talk about?

So yeah, I agree with you in the sense that you know like being realistic about probably is not going to you know lead to you know much progress

And a consciousness understands you know a more you know macro macro level level of abstraction to look at you know some of the higher order mechanisms that are entailed

But that being said I the room has kind of been kind of like a free for all where we're just like saying whatever we find interesting and sharing our research sharing

You know stuff that we like and yeah, if you if you would like the conversation to you know be steered more into the topic of the room then yeah

I'm perfectly down to do that. Yeah, likewise. It was a couple round where we were answering questions. So yeah, just I second

(First Speaker)
I just wanted to set the context of what the definition of consciousness was at least a couple of hours ago

And so I think Paul had had really restricted the definition because I think the underlying question was posed to those who study neuroscience and others

How can we get to a point where we can dissect and study experimentally and to get close to what are the elements fundamental to consciousness that we call consciousness

Which in this context was the perceptual experience like he kept it very sort of you know just bare bones. It's just the perceptual experiences

And so I think that's that was the implicit definition that some of us were going off of but I absolutely also welcome

(unknown)
I take some I take some blame for it. I do but I also believe that you should go to the root cause which is always philosophy

But yes, I agree. It was very it was a very stringent conversation which I admire

(other)
Right and like when you frame it that way you invite this kind of dualistic idea right like so I see a lamp in this room

And that perception seems utterly simple to me. It's so direct and immediate like this that the process seems quite irreducible

And so there's this idea of like quality and it's like this irreducible sensation but that's not how things work right like when you look at something and you see what it is

Like today we know that there's much more involved in what actually happens when you see a lamp like it involves processes in many parts of the brain

And many billions of neurons and like like so that but people frame it like there's this idea that like that that I look and I see and it's like a movie

And so how does this observer work and it's like dualism we can't explain it but really we know that like a lot about perception is that it's not simple and direct

It's complex and indirect like signals come into the eyes and the ears and the nose and the skin and they undergo many transformations

And there are bottom-up signals that interact with top-down signals and the signals reach many different parts of the brain

And what emerges isn't a simple image for someone to watch but a multi-layered set multi-layered sets of descriptions infused with memories and assumptions and expectations

And so like when we compare it to like a movie and like and think about perception that way like like the chambers idea of like the heart problem of consciousness

It's like comparing a Tesla to a brick and then looking for some new physics to try to explain how a dumb brick can move around and avoid obstacles

It's like the simple and direct experience of perception is very deceptive and and like you know it's like how a computer user interface hides a lot of the complexity

When you drag a file into the trash can and you think that there's nothing more to it but you're unaware of the complex layers of machinery and processes happening behind the scenes

(Micah)
So maybe I can talk for a minute or a minute and a half

I just wanted to sort of talk about the movie that Max is talking about

It's not a simple movie right?

# The movie of consciousness and conscious AI
The movie of consciousness

I don't know if you're inside or outside right now but maybe you can perceive a space around yourself and you can perceive yourself

And so you have these representations of the world and yourself in the world or yourself as part of it

And the movie you know I imagine that fundamentally it's made out of frequency patterns and spatial patterns

These are just the building blocks of representations of visual, auditory, smell representations, feeling representations

It's all temporal spatial patterns

We have a whole bunch of reoccurring temporal spatial patterns in the brain

The brain is constantly transmitting temporal spatial patterns all over the place

I think that when we talk about something as small as the expression of BDNF or cortisol in the case of this ayahuasca study or DMT study

I think there's a relevance to understanding what consciousness is in a mechanical way in terms of how that is affecting the temporal spatial frequency patterns in certain areas of your brain

And how that might alter the conscious experience

That's eventually relevant to building conscious AI

So my take is that all of these microbiological topics are ultimately related to sentient AI

If we can understand their effects in terms of their temporal spatial frequency patterns and how they're changing the state of your conscious experience

Which is a highly coupled grid of temporal spatial patterns perhaps

And I think, I don't know if it was shared or someone else who was talking about the difference in the context of anesthesia

# The difference between conscious and unconscious and how different regions became uncoupled
The difference between conscious and unconscious and how different regions became uncoupled

If someone remembers that, I'd definitely like them to sort of recap that if they can

But I'll go ahead and stop there and I just wanted to tell you that it's a different interpretation of the past events

I'll go ahead and stop there and then people can take it a different way

(Dexter)
I'd like to give a brief response if I can to Max since he has asked so many questions

Max, if I can, you just gave, and correct me if I'm wrong, but a rather eloquent sketch of hierarchical predictive coding

And how the notion of a simplistic stimulus response, video image in v1, v2, we work out

We're looking at something akin to an iPhone screen, the perception is nothing at all like that

And if that was what you meant by your description, I absolutely agree

My interest then would be is how you think this speaks to or answers or potentially unseats

Or even just contextualizes David Chalmmer's quote unquote hard problem or whether you even accept that that problem is hard

But yeah, I thought that was an eloquent sketch assuming that I understood it

But yeah, I'd use it to know how you think that relates to then forming an idea of a rigorous view of what consciousness is and where it occurs

(Max)
Well yeah, I mean I feel like the problem that they're making is that the notion of qualia is that it's irreducible

Like the sensation of red that I have is irreducible and if you think that then you're just stuck

And I think we have no reason to think that because even some sensation like the color red

You can break it down, it's like I said, there's multi-layered sets of descriptions that you can't see red in really in isolation

Like there's some, David Engelman did some interesting, there's a great video that Wired magazine did with Tom about showing how you can set up these kind of visual illusions

Where you show two colors that are the same but they look totally different because they have different colors around them

And it's like there's certain experiments where if you show some of the two colors they can't really tell which colors they are

Until they need at least three colors, like if you just show it to them they're kind of like, well is that yellow or blue? I can't really tell

And if you put it on a table in context with other things then the colors shift

And so if this idea of red is like this irreducible thing then how do you explain that?

And like the way that we explain it is that it's not irreducible and these sets of descriptions for like a color are built up from relations with other colors

(Micah)
So I just wanted to point out that there's been a sort of counter argument against the irreducibility of qualia and the possibility of magical free choice

And I feel like those are a little bit like strawmen arguments because I don't think anyone in this room is arguing that we have magical choice

And I don't think anyone in this room is arguing that qualia is irreducible so I mean you can make the argument but I just don't think anyone is arguing against you

(Max)
Well I think that's part of the hard problem of consciousness is that they feel like qualia is unexplainable

And so I feel like the part of the kind of counter fact to those arguments is that you can think like the way we have other reasons to believe that qualia is not like this irreducible thing

(Unknown)
Could I respond to your point?

So I think you mentioned actually a very good thing and actually that's also the topic or the angle I tackle in consciousness studies

So I think we can simplify into some kind of information theory problem

So let's say we have perception and some of the perception is conscious

So we have perception and also conscious perception and we know perception is so complicated

So anything you see it's actually there are a lot of unconscious processing going on

But something we can only see is some single and also you say like irreducible qualia, something like that

So from information perspective we can say there is a lot of information processing going on underlying the consciousness

But what is the only part of those information can show in your conscious content

So actually so this is actually the angle we can tackle the consciousness from a information theory perspective

# So for example like recently our team proposed information closure theory of consciousness
So for example like recently our team proposed information closure theory of consciousness

So what we want to say is okay so we know from neuroscience we know perception is very complicated and involves a lot of information

Okay so how can we don't feel that kind of information why we only feel about qualia, only feel about very little about those underlying processes

So there must be some information area between our conscious process and those microscopic information processing

So then we can use information theory to say okay so those microscopic processing is kind of a block from some conscious process

But how is this possible because we know this macro process, our neuron process is moving by the microscopic process

So then we can propose okay so there is a macro and micro information area there

Yeah I'm not sure if I understand what you're saying 100% but I think basically if we were able to actually look at our own brain from the inside

(Max)
It's just too much information and we have limited resources because you need a brain bigger than your own brain to be able to comprehend your brain

So instead we have very limited access because it wouldn't make sense for us to look at 100 trillion connections and understand what's going on in our environment

So instead we operate at a very high level of abstraction and those lower level processes they're not really available for us to inspect and think for various, should be obvious reasons I think about our own ability to understand it

And lack of resources and things and so if you think about like how do you explain how you balance on a bicycle, it's like we can't really explain that in words because this lower level machinery that's involved in our kind of motor neurons and balance and stuff like that

Like they speak very narrow specialized languages and like and our higher level language centers are abstracted from these things but you know maybe six layers of removed and so like even if they could talk to them they just wouldn't understand their language

Because their vocabulary isn't big enough to draw analogies with like a natural human language and stuff and so basically that's what we're just kind of sealed off from these things

I'm not sure if I'm really addressing the topic that you brought up or not

I just want to add that that is extremely accurate what the philosopher Wittgenstein is saying is that we actually understand each other completely the reason why we don't understand each other is because our language is too inaccurate

Could I respond to Max so yes that's exactly how our theory won't try to solve so we in our paper we call this is a scale problem of consciousness so which means we have so a lot of microscopic processes

And as you say we have so multi level of as level of extraction and then they come to our conscious content so how can we reconcile this so we the conscious content is super vain by this

Microscopic but we still cannot feel those microscopic we can only feel those macroscopic things in our conscious content so to solve this problem we propose there is some there must be information closed in the conscious process to the microscope process

So the idea is simple so even you are affected by so for example conscious process is affected by the microscope process but this process can still be information only closed means it can be

the transfer entropy the information from microscope to macroscopic can still be blocked the condition is the macroscopic process itself can form a self predictable process

So which means like this is exactly like the Newton and quantum so if we look into the macroscopic process in this universe we know everything is under quantum mechanism and but we still can use Newton's physics to describe our work in the macroscopic level

Because Newton's physics can very well predict and also explain everything in the macroscopic level and this is the same as consciousness so consciousness as we say is in a very abstract level

But if it is information closed then we cannot see any macroscopic underlying this conscious process even its cellular level or even like atom level

I have a kind of fanciful theory if I can make a slight digression is that like so would it be okay if I just spoke to Ace's point would you mind that match before

No I don't know if that's okay yes so Ace that's I see the analogy there with quantum decoherence as you approach classical mechanics and you reach a world of intelligibility and predictable causation

That makes sense as an analogy do you have any particular purchase on the evolution benefit that is suggested by consciousness per that rubric

So yeah just I tend always when looking at human behaviors to what course to potential evolution well Tim Bergen's four questions so how does this evolve and what was the adaptive value and its ontogeny etc.

So does your theory suggest anything about that and Max thank you very much for your time

(other speaker)
No problem yes exactly so the first thing I have said is so the conscious process is information only closed and the second thing actually is about how this closed information process how it can interact with environment

So we utilize the concept of we call it non-trivial information closed so which means even you have assisted this information only closed but it still can mimic the environment dynamic and interact with the dynamic

So the information in the information closed system because we say it's non-trivial and how this is about the evolution so the important thing is we interact with microscopic objects like other animals

Everything in the Newton in the Newton classic physics so those macroscopic objects we interact so we need to build some model of this macro object or a macro environment

So to do that we can form an information only closed process that is non-trivial and it's modeling of the macroscopic object so that's why we need our conscious content always only have the macroscopic objects

Now we cannot see the quantum things we cannot see the atoms or even the macroscopic things even we can receive the photons but we still see not the photons only we see some macroscopic things because this conscious process is modeling the macroscopic environment change


So that's the evolutionary advantage and also fit our theory. What are the neural correlates of the macroscopic changes that you're talking about if it's not about a neuron firing at one point in your analysis of the microscopic brain are macroscopic things happening

(other speaker)
And that's exactly what the question we want to solve so we have this for example let's say we have single neuron but in single neuron it fires like every second like 10 times 10 hertz around 10 hertz but you cannot feel that right

So somehow this kind of actual potential or membrane potential change you cannot feel but if we gather like several neuron together and then we have a population neuron and then the information encoded in the population neuron is more like what you feel in your conscious content

And this is spatial we call it cost branding and also we have also like a temporal cost branding like you cannot feel a single neuron firing but you can feel like a firing rate to some extent

So it's somehow the information close to our conscious content is not like a very micro scale scoping it's not a single neuron firing it's not a single neuron activity but some type of macro variable cost grant from the microscopic process system

(other speaker)
So we call it this scale problem because somehow our conscious content is not it's not just about it's not all microscopic content but some macroscopic content

So but what kind of macroscopic content can enter our conscious content then that we evolve the criteria or if you can say more like a hypothesis is that some macroscopic content itself can form some informationally closed process

So like a Newton's physics as an example itself Newton's physics doesn't care about any microscopic interaction right so but you still can describe the whole physics board in the macroscopic level

So this physics process in the macroscopic Newton's physics become informationally closed so the point is our hypothesis our brand also can form some macroscopic process is informationally closed

And the point is the macroscopic process is some kind of virtual process it's not real but it still retains the information that need to be worked in the macroscopic level

So very important things here is in our theory we don't think consciousness is belong to some specific neuron or some specific brand area but some macroscopic process in the brand

And of course they lead to some practical difficulty to search that kind of process but we are working on this and we try to develop some mathematical tool to have optimal post-branding to detect this kind of information closed process

And also have non-trivial information about the environment so this is mathematically and falsifiable so we are working on this

(Paul King)
I do agree with that interview I just want to chime in here that consciousness and the content of consciousness needs to be some type of dynamic structure that's happening within the neural electron of the brain and not something that's particular types of neurons or particular ways that they fire

You know a three-dimensional video game and that video game is depicting an object on the screen you know there's some room there's some walls or bricks on the walls depicting on the screen

We can say that that object being depicted on the screen are like certain pixels on the video array but really the object conceptually is something inside the video game you know there's some kind of structural model of that object

So then you can ask okay well which transistors are responsible for that experience the rendering of that you know cube for example on the screen

Well it's not like the particular transistors are responsible it's not particular ways that the transistors are switching not particular logic case it's not even particular memory cells

It's something about the whole scene structure and the way that scene structure is engaging with an interactor environment is creating that abstraction of an object and consciousness could be working in a similar way

Yes it could be an information abstraction this dynamic that's taking place within the neural electron of the brain and not any particular type of activity

Yes exactly that's what our theory wants to say so there's some way we can say cost learning or abstraction and then we can form some macroscopic object or macroscopic concept

And then if those things the transition of those objects become informationally close itself then actually this process is kind of blind to those microscopic process and those microscopic like transistor or any like pixels value pixel level things

So it can totally work on macroscopic abstraction or we can say objects and then so if it's informationally close then that's our hypothesis

So Acer I just had a question how is what you're positing here different from a person who would say okay by your metric consciousness is just a subjective experience of human physiology

Because I think physiology as a foundational concept as a principle really is how things as you're defining the microscopic elements transition or translate into macroscopic elements

Like as you were talking I was thinking about something as simple as a hydrogen as a proton that ourselves we cannot necessarily detect our pH for example but we do have specialized regions of the brain

Known as circumventricular organs such as area called area pastrima that have that are specialized and highly sensitive to acidity or pH concentration such that as it dips below a certain threshold you have the subjective experience of feeling unwell or feeling nauseous

And that many studies and many neuroscientists throughout time specifically sensory neuroscientists I'd have to say have dedicated their careers to exploring what is the level of concentration that we can tweak the blood level to where we can enact a change in a person's inner subjective experience

And there's been a lot of elegant work being done with the advent of optical tools or optogenetics where you can essentially calm and gear the firing rate of specialized subset of neurons

And the physiology of eating have shown really elegant work where you can invent and show tight correlations between the number of neurons affected, the firing rate of those neurons and the voracious nature of which an animal will eat

Independent of its fasted or seeded steaks and so when I think of that it really sounds like perhaps what you're saying is that consciousness is embedded somehow in the physiology or the experience of the ones in the physiology that can be wrong

Yes, yes, you are right and actually this question is very good so for example we have a lot of problems in the microcosm and the point of the level going up right so like the pH level and also a lot of problems in this problem going up

But I would say that in our conscious content we only feel about something like I'm sick, I don't feel well but sometimes I feel well, okay so you can imagine this conscious information and this conscious content is quite low dimensional

So like for example I'm good, I'm bad, this kind of just one dimensional if you want to add something like oh okay I have two different kind of sick

Okay then you add another dimension so you can actually use information theory to quantify how much information in your conscious content

And another thing is okay you can also use information theory to quantify like pH level fluctuation or even neuron fluctuation but it's very high dimensional

So the fact here we can see is so we have high dimensional neurophysiological information space but we only have very low dimensional information in the conscious content

So there must be some close grinding or abstraction between the microscope to the microscopic and then the next question is of course then how can we detect or okay we know this is a fact but how can we detect or how can we compute from microscopic physiological majors

What we can get to get this close brand of microscopic conscious content and so that's the thing I'm working on right now

Hey sorry I'm sorry are you in Japan now?

Yes I'm in Japan

Okay I'm in Tokyo?

Yeah I wanted to suggest some kind of fence for the idea but so we're talking about at the high level we don't really have direct access to these low level sub capabilities and things like that

Well there's some research with psychedelics and FMRI that show like certain chemical psychedelic drugs allow certain parts of the brain to connect that aren't normally connected and things like that

And so yeah I have some maybe silly theory that like some common experiences that people who take PMC report is like there's these kind of alien or machines that kind of enter their consciousness and try to communicate with them and things like that

And so the idea is that you know maybe parts of the brain are connected to other parts of the brain but they're incapable of understanding each other because they're just so foreign and the way that their kind of languages and vocabularies are just they don't map to each other

And so maybe what people are experiencing is just they're kind of accessing some lower level machinery of their own brain but they're unable to make any sense of it and it feels like some kind of you know extra terrestrial in their head right?

But I guess the way I think about what psychedelics are doing is if you take this sort of idea I'm not sure I mean when Asus says macro I guess I think of like higher levels of abstraction kind of structural abstractions and maybe there's sort of many different layers of abstraction

But then if you imagine that these neural activity flows that are carrying information moving around the brain in activity networks or you know forward and backward propagation

That if psychedelics are sort of modulating the flow of that information or causing information from one part of the brain to information being routed through a part of the brain that is not normally routed through

Then that might create sort of mixed experiences to kind of reinterpret what's going on so you know there's a part of the brain that's focused on a theory of mind that is how you sort of model the goals and intentions and intent of another

And if you could imagine that somehow neural activity is being flowed through that area it could get reinterpreted as the kind of benevolent kind of entities that people say they experience energy and taking

This is sort of you know kind of a just so story about what could be happening

Yeah that makes sense that some sort of a useful knowledge would be synthesized just to attempt to explain it

Yeah, Eson I want to ask one challenge and then a question so yes you said that Newtonian mechanics doesn't really care about microscopic effects

But we know that the human vision can detect a single photon especially in the instance where it's primed by a previous single photon

And so that level of detection and as Sharad was saying true also of attraction microscopic events can actually influence state and valence and it would be interesting to understand how your theory managed course grain

Macroscopic or sorry microscopic events into this course grain macroscopic awareness then relatedly also when we think about the attentional spotlight and its recruitment according to things which are salient to adaptive rewards in the world

How does your theory deal with behavior as attentional spotlight and consciousness shifts towards not whether something is sufficient in its magnitude to recruit consciousness awareness

But whether it is of say let's say in a simple case to survival right so in many cases it might be sufficient to have a generalized picture of the world and its course grain is economical and this will make sense

But what about the instance where you need to take very fine grain and sustained attention to thin slice information

One aspect of that is what we know is the amygdala hijack when the amygdala is monitoring for threats and it has this ability to shut down the prefrontal cortex

Like there's more connections from the PFC back so does that kind of address some of the concerns it's like you might be preoccupied with certain things but then when there's a threat it's like this kind of more lower level permanent mammalian part of your brain kind of takes over and preempts your current goals and interests in order to prioritize escape or preparing you for attention

I don't think there's any evidence that the amygdala shuts down the prefrontal cortex, I know that in pop psychology people say that

I think the prefrontal cortex is alive and well and maybe the amygdala is sort of steering with goals, the prefrontal cortex is optimizing course

But I know that there are people who talk about this amygdala hijack concept in code of pop psychology

But on the topic of like photon, being able to detect a single photon, a minute sensory signal can be amplified in the same way that a photomultiplier and astronomy can amplify a single photon and make it visible just by recruiting more and more neurons to represent that source

Maybe that's why I'm thinking about that phenomenon. Yes, absolutely, signals certainly can be upregulated, no question, but yes, so that question, so Ace's essential contention was that microscopic effects are just not taken into consideration

And so yeah, that was my question and why I posed the notion of a microscopic effect which can be upregulated and recruit attention, but then also in the case of behavior

I'm just curious, does your theory speak to behavior and its recruitment of consciousness not relative to the physicality or whether something warrants conscious representation by dint of its perceptual scale, but its savings relative to survival?

Yes, yes, exactly. I think it's also both related to perceptual and also action, but to answer your first question, of course, photons, one photon will receive it, but you can amplify it as it is simple, but let's maybe put in a more like a psychophysical context

So in the experiment, you can show people some lights, right, and the intensity of light, you can adjust it, then eventually you can find a threshold that some light can enter your conscious context, but below the threshold you cannot

So in our theory, this is very simple, it's just like the cost-grainning, the way cost-grainning to form this information process at microscopic level, whether it considers this kind of intensity, how much neuron involves in this process

And then if the information is big enough, then of course the cost-grainning from the microscopic to the microscopic can be cost-grain into the conscious context, so that's the first thing

And the second thing is perception is one thing, of course action is one thing, so we have a lot of action-related things about consciousness, like we have intention, that's conscious content, we have some kind of free will, that's also conscious content

And I want to say that attention is actually also one kind of action, but it's just work internally, so why this action content is, why this action information is also involved in conscious content

So we haven't published this part of paper, but I can simply say that to form the information-only closed process and with non-trivial information about an environment, which means you need to model also not only the environment dynamic, but also your action, how your action affects the environment transition

So the information about your action is also part of the information-only closed process, so that's why we can feel our action, our intention, even our attention

Great, thank you. I have a question about the state of the art of the instrumentation, so when I look at the FMRI images and so on, they seem too rough, too macro, and I come from physics, so in astronomy for example, every advancement of instrumentation gave us so much more insight

Is there an active area of refining the image of the physical brain that goes to much more deeper scale? Is there active research in that field?

Yes, maybe someone who is involved in research would like to speak to this, but I can, unless someone else would like to

Okay, go ahead

I'll tell you what I know, but it's a vastly expanded field, because as I suggested, it is a huge problem, and a really important problem for gaining purchase on actually the kind of questions that Acer was laying on the table, where you're really looking at the transition of populations, neurons, and their precise firing range and so forth

I'll mention one strategy, but it's one of many, which actually involves traditional hemodynamic modelling, but basically then employs in a way which is, if you like, symmetric to the brain itself

It employs basically dynamic causal modelling to, over time, establish, or if you like, draw out of the data deeper and richer levels of connectivity, so if you can predict and model the evolution of your voxel state, you can actually find the great information about where the particular connectivity is going to be

The effective connectivity is issuing from, and so when you combine that with the EEG, you get basically the cortical synchrony and the voxels and the direction of functional connectivity, which gives you eventually a finer-grained picture

So really what you're doing there is akin to the brain itself in many ways, you are basically using a cross-modal binding of information to upregulate the precision that you can attribute to a signal and derive richer information as to the causation apparent

And so yes, that's no new technology, but a cross-modal use of existing technology with dynamic causal modelling to produce better data, but that's just one strategy that's actually employed

Could you tell me a reference? If I wanted to look into this, could you tell me a quick study?

Yes, thank you. Just google, if you google Karl-Priston-K-A-R-L-F-R-I-S-T-O-N, and then just DCM, Dynamic Causal Modelling, and is that search to include G-S-M-M-R-I, and it is worth mentioning as well that that strategy of dynamic modelling is used in...

not only to analyse with great precision as to the hidden aspects of causation, not only brain data, but Karl-Priston-K-A-R-L-F-R-I-S-T-O-N, one of the original actually credited as being the sort of progenitor of the causal modelling used in F-M-R-I

F-M-R-I-S-T-O-N is the same mathematical precepts to epidemiological modelling, and the model of the causal modelling, all of the other models that we had in Europe for predicting the unfolding states of the pandemic, even given sparse information as to particular mutations and all the relevant biophysiology and UV incidents and so on.

So, Karl-Priston, F-M-R-I-S-T-E, Karl, I think, yes, over some period during the pandemic, rewrote the causal modelling software to accommodate the implementation of multiple sources of simultaneous measurement.

So, yeah, you should find it and find out a lot about that.

Are there other neuroscientists in the room? I see that Paul just left, but I had a question for him.

Am I nervous?

What Paul just said is that this amygdala hijack idea, he said it's kind of an apocryphal idea from pop psychology, but I just did a quick Google search and I'd have no problems finding tons of references to the idea in journal of psychiatry and neuroscience and other behavioral neuroscience.

So, here's a quote, the prefrontal cortex shares extensive connections with the amygdala. These structures are central to a neural system that processes emotional stimuli, especially negatively valence stimuli.

So, is this just other rubbish science that neuroscience has rejected?

To describe it, basically, I can't speak for Paul, so just my comments on my own interpretation of what he was saying.

So, Daniel Goldman coined the term amygdala hijack, which comes from work, I think, by Joseph Perdue.

And it's the notion that it's a sort of binary state, right? The amygdala, at a certain level, hijacks all thinking, and then you're in a totally different state.

And it's basically, you know, it's two different worlds or two different modes of being patterned on or off.

Whereas, you know, what we understand is that that is a graded process and I think Sherrod's comments that also at the level of the amygdala, the amygdala is not just a fear center.

So, yeah, Joseph Perdue recently, he's been making a lot of headlines, and he's been making a lot of mistakes.

He's been making a lot of mistakes.

So, yeah, it's just a matter of degree, basically.

I was hoping to share some ideas about ways, like a framework for thinking about emotions, but yeah, the lady read who had asked the questions and already left the room.

Matt, would it be okay if I just ask?

Or I just mentioned that it's not just a question of degree, but also a question of the quality, right? So that the amygdala is not just the fear center.

We understand the amygdala now as being involved in not only different sorts of responses relative to contexts of anxiety and fear, but actually just emotional arousal in general.

So, Sherrod can speak to the side that's probably more learned than I can, but yeah, it's degree and kind.

I was just going to add briefly that even as it relates to the concept that you're mentioning, Max, even at the level of the prefrontal cortex, we know that somatostatin intra-neurons,

GABA-ergic secreting neurons in the prefrontal cortex also respond exquisitely to stressful stimuli.

And we also know that they're corticotrophin-releasing factor, which are stress-sensitive neurons that are embedded intrinsic within the prefrontal cortex that also respond exquisitely to stress.

And so, you know, you needn't even have a projection or a pathway-specific mechanism to describe why is it that in times of stress, executive decision capacity is hindered.

Some of that mechanism is inherent and intrinsic to what's happening in the context of stress in the prefrontal cortex.

Right. This is kind of why sometimes I feel like it's like maybe the wrong level of abstraction when we talk about the neurobiology, because then we debate the kind of, you know, minutiae of what's happening in neurons instead of like thinking about the overall kind of theory and framework that we're talking about.

And so, like, one idea which Marvin Minsky gives us is to think about, you know, the mind as a cloud of resources and what's happening with how emotions enter the picture is that it's like at any given moment some resources are turned on and other resources are kind of disabled.

And it's like maybe if you're having an elliptic seizure or some psychotic experience that like, you know, too many kind of resources are simultaneously active when it's not like a healthy state to be under something.

And so we can think of like, like when you're angry, you know, there's like this diverse collection of mental states that are active, which dispose you to maybe interpret an innocent gesture as a threat, or to dispose you to kind of bias you to have a more cavalier attitude toward decision making.

Like we find ourselves, you know, making my quick decisions without as much deep reflection as we might normally bring about the consequences.

And some other mental resources like regarding maybe empathy toward others has kind of turned off, you know, like so if some Jehovah's Witness comes to my door, you know, I might get in an angry mode where I'm a bit rude to them and it's to get them to fuck off, right?

Or like when you think of someone who you know is like who's fallen in love, it's almost as if like they're kind of running a new program, right?

It's like, like their kind of goals and priorities have kind of shifted and they're really enamored with this person, right?

And so yeah, I mean, that's the basic idea is that you can think of, you know, a word like anger is like it's an abbreviation for this diverse collection of mental states.

And so it's kind of like a modality or an attitude toward the world.

And so if we think about how can we make a machine that has emotions, well, now you have a paradigm for how to do that.

You know, the machine has, you know, various different resources and like you have some mechanism to kind of shift things around so that some kind of attitudes and mindsets are active and others are suppressed.

And then there's different configurations so that this machine can have kind of, you know, different biases and ways to think about different situations, right?

May I ask a stupid question? Can you achieve consciousness without ego or personality?

Yes, people regularly do during psychedelic experiences and people report on the meditation.

So I've never experienced ego death myself, but in so much as I trust such people, yes, it's possible.

It's a bit of a paradox, too, because with true ego dissolution, it's like you lose your own ability to be even aware that that's happening.

So you're unable to bring back any specific memories of it because the whole system is kind of broken down in a way that you don't have any kind of stance in the situation.

I would push back against the claim that you can't bring back memories from an ego dissolution experience.

I agree.

Yeah, I think you can definitely take back memories from it.

I agree. I had an experience and I definitely remembered it afterwards.

Yeah, it's not like people who've had ego death experiences can't tell you about them sometimes.

Well, maybe it's a bit of a delusion. Maybe your A-brain is watching your B-brain having an ego dissolution, but it's not a total ego dissolution because otherwise the A-brain wouldn't have been involved.

True ego dissolution would be death state, right?

I think we might be using different definitions of ego.

I think the definition that is most cited in respects to parsing psychedelic experiences is a definition of the ego that entails this concept of having a contained self that is separate from the environment.

The prototypical ego dissolution experience is defined by experiencing a sensation where the boundary between a person's self and the universe no longer is a boundary, and it's also been described as an oceanic oneness.

Max, I think you were saying that you had a framework for emotion, but the neural correlates are that some stuff is on and some stuff is off. Was that it?

That's sort of vague, but...

Speaking of emotion, it has to be driven by motivation in some sort, otherwise nothing would function.

But the topic of this room is new science and AI, and can someone explain to a layman how we are in close to getting to an actual consciousness or an emotion that isn't programmed?

Except for the human brain. The first thing I learned in psychology was that the human brain is the most complex thing we know about the universe.

And it just seems magical to me, and that's why I'm here. I'm really trying to figure it out, so please.

I think before we can get to the point where we can say we've built an artificial, sentient emotional machine, we have to sort of define what conscious emotion is in mechanical terms.

What I wanted to do was take that question to Acer, and I guess he started to talk about feelings, how the sort of closed macro causality of high level activity might result in feelings.

And that was sort of where the conversation ended, but I wonder, Acer, do you have a framework for emotion and how emotion might be caused at the neural correlates of what that could be?

That's a good question. We haven't had a high process reached to emotion, but what I can say is emotion, to some extent, is a very low dimensional space.

You have just a few types of emotion and its intensity, and so it's actually a very low dimensional space.

So what we can say is no matter what kind of physiological change in your body, and no matter what kind of high dimensional physiological state you have, eventually our conscious content only contains very low dimensional emotional information.

So I think maybe at this point we cannot have very concrete mathematical explanation for emotion experience, but I think it's a promising theory that we can, in the future, we can describe it as some kind of post-grinning and form the information only closed process in the brain, then that content emotional low dimensional information.

But that's my hope.

I'm curious to ask whether it really can be said to be the case with such confidence, Acer, that emotions have such low dimensionality.

Sure it is the case that we have a few words that describe them, maybe we have English language, let's say 50 to 100 words, but we would know the major categories, right?

The major categories in effective neuroscience, they are limited categories, but if you think about, for instance, I'll just suggest the example of a poem, and basically this concatenation of words seems to derive a different character of emotion.

It's not as though there are basically a series of buckets and line of poetry will get you into one of these coarse-grained buckets of emotions.

It seems that even though we cannot describe them, we do not have all the words to describe all of the colors, right?

You might say the same thing that, well, there's, you know, there's just like 12 basic colors and then there's variations from those.

But yeah, our propensity to name things and to say it's a bluish-green and not be able to coarse-grained our description doesn't mean the phenomenon is not coarse-grained.

And so I'm interested as to how certain we can really be of such coarse-graining in emotions.

Sorry, let me just put it this way. I think my description is a little bit wrong. It is low-dimensional, it is lower than the neuron physiological space, but it is still high.

I see. Sorry, sorry. But just imagine like we have like the A billion, we have a billion of neurons and also...

86 billion?

Yeah, 86.

And then also each neuron can have like 10,000 of synapse to other neurons.

So if everyone we can see is a parameter, right? So the dimensionality is super, super high, but compared to our emotional state, of course it's rich, but relatively it's still pretty much low.

That's the relative concept, yeah.

Yeah, I agree with Dexter that this idea that like, yeah, emotions of low dimensionality is like, I think that our emotional, what we call emotions are just as much richness and complexity as other types of thoughts.

Because in fact you can think about emotions as types of thoughts. So give me any emotion, like jealousy.

Like when we say we're jealous, there's like a big rich thought there, right? It's like, okay, like saying, oh, I feel a bit jealous because my girlfriend is, you know, at some other corner of the bar talking to some guy and I don't know who he is and I feel a bit threatened because I value her and I'm afraid that like I'm going to lose her or something.

And like, that's a thought, right? And we just put a label on it called jealousy so that it's an abbreviation. It's like, it's for the economy of communication.

And just in this, it's like basically, in Popsite, we have this idea that like, like emotions are somehow different than thoughts and they're more than thoughts, right?

We think of thoughts as being all these black and white kind of rational things and emotions like they bring color to our mental life.

But whereas in fact, I think emotions take something away. In most cases, when you think about, like when someone's really in love with a person or an idea, there's certain resources that are turned on and there's certain resources that seem to be shut down, right?

Like they're normal kind of fault finding machinery and they're internal critics where they're not really seeing the flaws in this idea that they're in love with.

Or like I said with anger, it's like certain things are turned on like swiftness to action and some kind of hostility and empathy is maybe turned off.

And like in depression, when someone's depressed, it's not just some color like they're gray. It's like they have thought process is about like, you know, frustration about the meaningless of their goals, that their goals don't bring them.

I think there's this view that low dimensional is somehow an insult to emotions. I think low dimensional is just an information theoretic concept about the number of independent degrees of freedom in representing something.

So if you take, you know, that the average person knows 20,000 or more words, each one of those words is sort of an independent degree of freedom in the type of representation space as possible.

If we, you know, if we try to, you know, name as many emotions as you could and even sort of combine some words to get different emotions, it might be hard to come up with more than 100.

You know, maybe we could come up with 500, but a lot of those are going to be complex, you know, structures that combine ideas.

And there's also, it was sort of, Neil was mentioning earlier, there's this view of constructed emotions. There's a wikipedia page on it that's, it's a pretty compelling page, but I'm not familiar with the theorist.

But it sort of says that you might have some, you know, certain kind of core sensations that can happen, things you feel in your body, or things sort of associated with certain automatic dynamic processes, like anger and fear and happiness and joy and pleasure and maybe some things like that.

But then you have a very large repertoire of socially constructed emotions where jealousy might be one of those.

You know, I remember, I think the first time I sort of noticed jealousy, you know, I sort of had some situation and some, some person was, you know, kind of bugging me.

I just found that person really annoying. And I didn't know why, but he was talking to this girl. I was interested in it.

You just like, he's just an annoying guy. I'm so annoying. And it was only life later when someone said, oh, that's jealousy. And then I like had a framework for it, like, oh, that feeling I was feeling, I had a label for it.

And I could understand it in the context of why jealousy exists and what it means in some kind of social construct. And, you know, then then it kind of had a place in my mind.

And so now it's like, oh, there's jealousy happening. But, you know, before that, it was just kind of a sensation that I was noticing.

Yeah, right. It's like it's a one real quick.

Yeah, I just want to point out that jealousy has an extremely important evolution or aspect. It's not a social construct.

But of course, it has an, yeah, it implies that it's all over our environment as well.

Yeah, no, I think what Paul was saying was there's two different sort of uses of the word jealousy, for example, and one is more connected with this kind of private qualia thing that we have in our minds versus how it's used in real life a lot of the time that isn't really necessarily connected to certain sensations.

Yeah, if I can add something to this, I'd like to speak to Max's earlier claim that emotions are thoughts. I think I'd like to kind of offer a little bit more to that conception because, I mean, effective neuroscience.

There's this view that certain emotions are not just, you know, the isolated, you know, neural firing and like some of these more abstract representations, you know, with semantic terms.

But rather, certain emotions cannot be dissociated from certain visceral sensations that are coupled with the emotion that are quite different than, you know, something more neutral such as like abstract semantic thought.

For example, something like jealousy might have concomitant visceral phenomena such as increased heart rate or increased galvanic skin response, perspiration, you know, gritting of the teeth, increased body temperature.

So these visceral phenomena are kind of like part and parcel with the emotion, with the feeling. And in many cases, if somebody has damage to a particular brain circuit where these visceral phenomena don't manifest, then typically the emotion isn't detected.

And there are kind of like parallel pathways where somebody could have a more like a cognitive jealousy where they see somebody, for example, somebody who is, you know, has more sexual fitness than them talking to a person they fancy as a mate.

And they might have like a cognitive appraisal that, oh no, my mating opportunity is threatened. But that cognitive appraisal is different than the more primal visceral experience of jealousy, which would be a feeling that is kind of like embodied within the visceral phenomena that comes with the emotion.

And there are very many emotions that have this somatic visceral basis that can't be properly dissociated from the experience of the emotion.

But at the same time, there may be some more higher level emotions that might have a foundation of a somatic process with, you know, some nested layers of cognitive processes like second order processing like guilt, stuff like that.

But I think it's very important to highlight that when it comes to emotions, I think just lumping them in with thoughts kind of lacks the proper nuance that's needed to tease apart these terms.

Well, I'm not saying that they're simple thoughts. It's like when I say, you know, like you can think of anger as an abbreviation for a diverse collection of mental states, some of which may dispose us to interpret innocent gestures as a threat.

And so that's not a simple thought at all. It involves like perceptual biases and things like that. And so, yeah, I don't think that what you said is inconsistent with the fundamental idea in any significant way.

I think I think it's additive to it, right? So the embodied notion of emotions is important to add to the picture. And that's also worth noting that that is a bi-directional relationship that you can train an emotion by stimulating the physiology in a particular way.

Right, right. If we keep thinking of emotions as being something completely different from thoughts that happens outside our head, then we're never going to make any progress. But I feel like the framework I'm presenting gives us a lot of traction to think about these things.

Hey, I wanted to point to, when it's a good moment, I wanted to kind of put forward an idea that might relate to some things that Acer was saying earlier, but it's a little bit of a digression from emotion, although we can always come back to emotion.

Are you there, Acer?

Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

Oh, yeah, okay, cool, yeah. So on this related to this topic, and it also might come back to emotion because it's all about kind of high-level constructs. You know, related to this idea of consciousness, or let's say cognition and consciousness, both being kind of higher-order processing, types of processing happening in the brain that might be sort of layered abstractions on top of low-level neural activity.

One sort of interesting analogy to consider for the brain, I think, is two things. One is what happens in civilization and how kind of economies work with human beings, and another is what's happening in a clubhouse.

So I just want to kind of look at these analogies and see where this goes. So the first is, if you look at civilization, work labor is organized according to the night and day cycle.

You know, people, we have the work day that has sort of spontaneously happened during the daylight, and people go home to sleep at night, and it's the movement of the sun around the planet that has created that synchronization.

But that synchronization allows society to function so that everyone is, you know, working at the same time, which allows work to be more efficient, and everyone sleeping at the same time.

And then if you look at, you know, the day of week, you know, the seven-day work weeks have, or the seven-day weeks have emerged, you know, kind of spontaneously in different cultures.

Somehow the whole world has standardized on the seven-day week, and with, you know, five work days and two days off.

That's another type of synchronization where businesses have all synchronized so that during certain time windows, they're all doing the same type of activity, and during a different time window, they're doing other stuff, and that's the way of making the dynamic processing of the economy more efficient.

And then even in the case of market days, you know, and a lot of countries will be market day on Saturday or Sunday or Tuesday or whatever in different day and different cities.

And it's the same day when all the buyers and sellers go, converge to the same place at the same time in order to engage in a certain type of exchange.

So the analogy is that's a lot of what is happening with neural synchrony in the brain, that different brain areas need to communicate with each other and synchronize the communication so that the communication will arrive at the right place at the right time from different places, so that the right types of transforms and processing can happen.

So I wanted to kind of throw that out there, and the idea of these rhythms might not be any different than, let's say, the beta rhythms that you see in the frontal cortex or the alpha rhythms in the sort of vision area, or the beta rhythms are 18 to 24 hertz and the alpha rhythms are 10 to 14 hertz.

You've also got the beta rhythms in the hippocampus, and there's evidence for kind of basic processing in these rhythms. These rhythms might be essentially periodic synchronization of neural activity in order to create these sort of layers of abstraction on top of it.

And then the last idea I wanted to throw out related to this is what's happening on Clubhouse.

You could argue that Clubhouse is creating a social conscious space. All the people who are on Clubhouse right now are being synchronized by the mechanics of the Clubhouse system.

You know, different rooms with different topics are showing up and people go and aggregate in those same rooms and those happening at a time and place so that people who share this interest are all converging at a time and a channel, an online channel, so that they can exchange ideas because you need everyone there simultaneously in order for the idea exchange to work.

So there's all these ways in which the activity of elements are being synchronized and coordinated and orchestrated in order to make the exchange of information efficient and allow a higher level of abstraction to emerge.

So something similar could be happening in the brain to create the layers of abstraction that are like conscious cognitive processing and conscious processing.

Hey Paul, sorry to build up on that. I was even thinking yeah that's a very interesting notion this idea almost like there's these nodal points of consciousness in this room right now and they're all sharing information with each other.

And I'm wondering if there might be something similar with that with the brain or just the human body or whatever where there's different nodal points of consciousness.

So for example with split brain experiments I'm thinking there's a possibility that like look there could be at least two nodes of a conscious being like mine would both identify as forests but one thinks more in terms of like linguistic abstractions whereas the other one thinks in these kind of nonverbal ways.

And there's also even like with lucid dreaming when you become lucid within the dream the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex comes on and then you're self aware.

I'm thinking that maybe this might actually answer the kind of paradox of even ego dissolution where it's like oh I died during my psychedelic trip but then this this and this happened.

Well if you died how did this this and this happen. It could be that one node in the consciousness of the brain or one conscious note goes out and they share information with each other.

And because information is shared there is a feeling of oh I did this when actually the use of the word I in this case can refer to different nodes within one being.

So that's another thing that I've been thinking about a lot recently.

We do talk about the minimum level of computing quite a bit but we don't talk about the minimum level of consciousness quite as much and I think to Max and the Marvin Minsky model of agency.

It's very interesting to think about what the minimum sort of agency level of consciousness is and how that differs how that differs between animals and us and what you know those side of brain experiments.

But I'd also like to add and a little bit to Paul's point on what Clubhouse is doing to us.

We talk about consciousness in a static way quite often as consciousness now in 2021 whereas consciousness is is evolved as much as we understand and over a very long time frame.

And you could almost reframe this room as neuroscience and AI a path towards solving computing because effectively it's a race. It's it's what we create versus what evolution has created.

And I it's it's strange to me that we always talk about consciousness as human consciousness in the 21st century and perhaps perhaps we need to look at a different model perhaps in the same way we break down break computing down to minimum components.

We should be thinking of consciousness in the same way.

Yeah, I wanted to go back to something Wissum said before that point gets lost and I was also curious to hear from Acer.

So you but just to quickly respond to Wissum.

You mentioned split brain patients or I think you sort of made reference to that and also I was actually sorry I was forced to do that.

Oh sorry.

So yeah, I think there's you know to say with the analogy of civilization is just kind of a useful intuition.

A split brain is a little bit so you could say the consciousness and take a country like I don't know take the United States for example.

Oh, what does the United States think about this or that?

What do the American people think about this or that?

Well, there's no simple answer to that, but there is a lot that's being talked about.

There's sort of you know the conversations in the air.

I think we lost Paul.

Yeah, he fell out of a solitary synchrony.

Sorry, do you have the idea that I'll wait until Paul comes back, but do you have the idea that you take my metaphor one step further?

And then you can imagine Paul, Paul we lost him for a second.

We lost him for 10 seconds.

So you can say that all these different conversations are happening whether it's in people's living room or on the media or what's being reported or all collectively part of the conscious content of America.

And then you can imagine, let's say the internet was sort of and the media was split down the Mississippi River to divide the U.S. into east and west.

And somehow every website is based on the East Coast and everything people are saying on the East Coast.

It just doesn't the people in the West Coast just can't access that content. It's like it's all the East Coast content is all deleted from their internet searches and what shows up on Fox News and everything else.

And same for the people on the East Coast.

You still have what America is talking about and everyone on the West Coast or on the West side of the country would feel like, yeah, we know what America is talking about.

We see it in the news. We know what everyone's saying. You read that all the time.

And the people on the East Coast would be saying the same thing that they know what America is talking about and it's pretty clear what's in the news.

But each side would be seeing different news and different conversations and those conversations would start to diverge from each other.

And it would sort of lose their synchronization with each other, but they still be conscious.

They just be kind of a divided consciousness now sort of working and sort of splitting off.

So I wanted to make that analogy and then I also want to make analogy to eco-dissolution staying with the same metaphor.

You could say that the ego of the United States is like the U.S. government.

What the U.S. government has to say are the official statements of the United States to the outside world that are received from foreign leaders and reported on the news is the official view of the United States,

even though people in the United States, some might agree, some might disagree, just like some of the neurons might be aligned with whatever the official conscious content is and some might not.

And then if you imagine the U.S. becomes a failed nation state, the U.S. government collapses.

There's no one at home, no one answers the phone at Congress and it all goes silent and it becomes like the country of Somalia where there actually is no government.

Then that's sort of like the state of ego dissolution.

There's still consciousness, there's still stuff going on, people are still talking about things, but there's no singular voice that's being converged on as the official voice

and it's just a cacophony of a bunch of different voices.

So that might be sort of an analogy for ego dissolution.

Yeah, I'd like to just offer something. I think there might be a little bit of confusion of the phenomenology of ego dissolution.

I've heard several comparisons of it to death.

I don't necessarily think that the literature and the subjective experiences predominantly liken the experience to death.

Although people do call it ego death.

Yeah, they call it ego death, but not death death.

I'm not saying death death.

What I was going to say, I will mention, so there are two ways to kind of parse this.

One way is people can have these experiences spontaneously without the influence of any drugs or substances.

There's actually a psychometric...

Of course, cosmic consciousness is sort of a well-known thing.

A well-known thing, yeah, and metatonic.

Yeah, exactly.

There is a psychometric called ego weakness and certain people with certain neurodivergent dispositions such as Schizotypy

tend to have high levels of ego weakness.

This does seem to be a thing on a gradated spectrum where some people just have an intrinsically more fungible ego module.

On the other hand, there are drug-induced ego dissolution experiences of the prototypical kind with LSD, psilocybin, and DMT.

However, I will add that when it comes to this quote-unquote death experience, not just ego dissolution, but like a death experience,

there is a particular psychedelic in which most of these subjective reports tend to describe something that can be kind of like interpreted as akin to death.

That would be 5MEO DMT, which is the Venom of the Sonoran Desert Toad.

It has a very different phenomenology than the reported ego dissolution experiences of the other classical psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, and DMT.

Even in the space of psychedelic-induced ego dissolution experiences, there is kind of this level of nuance that can be had in these conversations.

I don't think that in the classical psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, and DMT, that most of the subjective experiences would equate the experience to death,

but rather a more appropriate explanation would be that the ego dissolution is kind of this dissolution of the experience of having a self contained in this body that's separate from the environment.

Well, that was exactly my point, actually. That was the point I was making.

That was the dissolution of the idea of self.

But before we get too far away, I did want to get if Acer had any comments on the general idea of kind of coordinated, synchronized activity, you know, creating abstractions, that general framework.

Paul, I have a thought about that too after you got me thinking.

Someone had a comment before Acer goes?

I think it just respond to something Ramsey said for a minute, unless Acer wants to go ahead.

I didn't mean to jump in front of Acer, but it's going to take him into a whole different world, so I want to respond to the structure part before we go there.

Yeah, I wasn't trying to jump in front of Acer. I do want to comment on the analogy you're bringing up. It's really interesting.

Okay, I will try to answer Paul and Wisdom's question simultaneously at the same time with our simple hypothesis.

So I think your two questions, one, the first one is related to the scale problem of consciousness.

So the first one is, okay, let's say we have a lot of ways, or also we can say infinite way to do coast grinding or to do abstraction about your physiological states.

It's definitely true. So the first problem is, okay, what kind of coast grinding or abstraction can really lead to our consciousness?

So this is the first one, or we can relate it to the scale problem of consciousness.

And the second one is, okay, if you have two consciousness in your system and so that they interact with each other, so where is the boundary of consciousness?

So this is the boundary problem of consciousness.

So in our theory, we want to deal with those problems with very simple way just due to information theory.

So we can simply say, okay, as a conscious being, and then I don't have those microscopic information.

Okay, so my conscious process definitely is information of close to those microscopic process.

This is one, the first one, that's why the scale problem is there's not...

Someone has, I guess, with some, I think your mic's up.

Okay, so since there's not arbitrary coast grinding can lead consciousness, only some way of abstraction can lead to conscious process.

So that's the first one, and the second one is, okay, so if you have some conscious entity and then maybe they interact with each other,

so which means you have information from A to B, and then we can also use the same principle, we can say, okay,

can we have some kind of information only close the boundary, the system, then we can define the boundary.

So in our theory, the hypothesis is very simple.

So first hypothesis is, okay, we cannot feel the microscopic activity.

So the first hypothesis is our conscious process must be information only close to the microscopic processes,

and the second hypothesis is, okay, so even we are information only close to a microscopic process,

but of course, all your interaction between you and the environment are under microscopic level.

So the microscopic level is only kind of virtual interaction, right?

So if you are information only close to the microscopic processes, how can you still interact with,

still have the rich representation about your environment.

So the second hypothesis is those information close process must be non-trivial,

which means it still can model the external environment and also predict,

have self-prediction about the interaction about you and the environment.

And this is the key point to answer the first question.

So if we add this criteria or this constraint to our physiological cross-grinding,

then we can know not every cross-grinding can lead to consciousness, conscious process.

Only those processes can form non-trivial information only close to process can have consciousness.

And there is a very important implication from our theory and also very different from other theories.

And based on this simple hypothesis, we actually allow multi-consciousness,

or we can best say, nested consciousness.

We allow nested consciousness exist.

So for example, we can have individual level consciousness here,

but if we have a social interaction that also forms some kind of information close process,

and it still can be conscious.

And so the point is why we cannot have the conscious content,

or we cannot be aware of those macro or micro consciousness because we are informationally closed.

So the information closure is a very strong idea,

because our own process is already informationally closed.

So even there exists some other conscious processes, like a macro process or even micro process,

but because we are closed, so we cannot feel it.

So this is the implication from our simple hypothesis.

And this is also very different from other theory of consciousness.

Like an integrated information theory, they try to exclude the possibility there are multiple possibilities of nested consciousness.

So this is one thing.

And for the second part, so if our theories want to say that,

if you are not informationally closed and still have some interaction with other processes,

then you need to enlarge your boundary or mathematically, you need to draw a larger boundary.

And then until you find informationally closed process, that can wrap up the whole process.

And then that we can define the boundary of consciousness by this way.

So from our theory, there is no problem about two consciousnesses or something like that.

So because we have rigorous mathematical description about information closure,

so we can actually define the boundary or we can find or we can say detect the boundary of consciousness.

So that's what we want to do in our theory.

Hello, I'm Michael.

I just want to introduce myself to everybody.

I understand what you're saying.

I share a similar view.

It's like a closed loop.

So I always look at it like electrons.

So we'll just continue to pass.

One of my theories is that if you look at it, how can I put this?

The way I think is a little different.

But if you look at human beings as atoms and consciousness, kind of like orbital shells,

each part of consciousness has its own unique energy level.

The physical mind acts as the valence shell controlling the chemical and conductor properties of an atom and electron exchange.

So that would explain motion and things like that because these electrons want to pass an exchange

and continue to create and push things out.

But we look at thought as something separate.

I always tell people, if you look at our existence as one mind,

then you start to find the dandruff to connect everything and you understand as above so below

and you can kind of see us moving like atoms.

If you look at yourself like an atom and your emotions as these electrons

and these things that can pass from one thing to another,

going from a higher potential to a lower, if it's an emotional effect,

then you can start to begin to kind of conceptualize something different than what we usually do.

My name is Michael and I'm that.

One thing that I think is a potential challenge with the claim that you can't detect a single neuron

is, of course, normally one neuron is not going to make much difference.

It's one neuron in a sea of 30 billion other neurons in the cortex.

But if that one neuron, let's say the spike didn't spike,

spiking at just that right time happened to cause another neuron to spike.

It led to a cascade that caused that decision to just tip, you know,

it was right on the edge, it could have gone one way or another and it sort of went one way instead of the other.

That one neuron could be the, you know, the straw that poked the camel's back to use that analogy.

So it could have a detectable effect even though the neuron by itself didn't have an individual neuron.

I think all that falls prey to your point.

I think your very insightful point about photons, right, is that it can potentially be upregulated

and it only warrants the course grain attention once it's reached a sufficient number.

Is that right, Aisa?

Maybe I can simply answer Paul's question.

So it is possible like, but our theory doesn't only include spatial course grinding but also temporal.

So for example, like one neuron, it may spike, but usually we don't think one spike can change a lot.

But if you have like a high intensity spike, like high firing rate, then the information from this neuron is more robust.

So in such ways, the temporal course grinding can lead to more chance to lead to a conscious experience in this case.

And so it's a simple, I think one thing I want to say is there is no course grinding is really implemented in the brain.

It is a virtual information channel that you can imagine there is a virtual information channel that course grinds the microprocess to the metro.

But the information channel itself is not real.

So it's just some kind of feature extraction to establish information only closed process at the macroscopic level.

And of course, then if this is not real, then how can we find it?

So this is what we're working on.

So we are working on like information bottlenecks way to do this kind of course grinding, but we are still working on it.

So we are not sure what happened next.

I think what Paul is saying is that if you had recursion, if like a single neuron was involved in kind of a recursive where it's re-triggering a pattern that re-triggers itself, then that can cascade into a macro level effect, right?

Exactly. Actually, that's true.

So we actually can find a lot of information only closed process or they say you just put a lot of sound neuron and then use recurrence route and then it just repeat the pattern itself.

But in our theory, we try to say this is usually not the case.

So usually we can represent the environment information, very rich for environment information.

So this is kind of a little bit paradox.

So if this is information only closed, let's say it's isolated and how can you still represent the environment information?

So to solve these products, so the concept of non-trivial information closure is the key of our theory.

So non-trivial information closure is even you are information only closed process, even you are isolated even.

But if you still can mimic the environment change, which some kind of modeling the environment transition and even your interaction between you and environment, then you still can reach information only closed process but still have non-trivial information about the environment.

So the key point here is, okay, you can really put one single neuron and put the recurrence route and make it information only closed.

That's true but what we constantly, our consciousness seems to still have a reach for environment information.

So the come up with this non-trivial information closure is our key hypothesis about conscious process.

Yeah, that's really great. I think what you just said, Acer, is actually the basis right now with the human neuroscience at this point is to be able to take the system in isolation and recapitulate using your proposed hypothesis, the behavioral observations and then where we infer the internal state of the animal.

But my question to you is, your theory sounds great, but what is the role of empiricism, you know, and what you're describing and what comes to mind.

A lot of what you're saying has been done already experimentally and I'm thinking of a paper that was published in 2018.

# Find Paper
This is by, you should probably look up Kate Tai, she's a prominent neuroscientist. There's a paper entitled Dopamine Enhanced Signular Noise Ratio and Cortical Brain Stem and Coding of Adversive Stimuli.

Essentially, this experiment is a, your theory played out and so they identified a node, in this case, this was a prefrontal cortical to periaqueductal gray circuit and using precise electrochemistry, they actually identified the concentration of dopamine required to change the dynamics in that circuit.

And then obviously, from a behavioral neuroscience context, to explore the animal's relationship to a stimulus that was previously neutral and so they enhanced just by perturbing the concentration.

So here we are using your language, something that would be microscopic and then they're observing something that, you know, would be more or less macroscopic or at least higher degree of dimensionality to use the language that you were using previously.

And so they, so I guess my question to you would be, with your model, would you be able to predict what precise concentration of dopamine without obviously looking at the experiment to get the value that was happened to be what caused that trigger, that switch.

But would you be able to predict that and with that, I think that would be very powerful to give credence to what you're saying to us tonight.

Actually, yeah, this is a very good question.

I can say that for now, there are a lot of consciousness theory of consciousness, but not so many theory are mathematically formulated.

So, for example, global workspace theory is a popular theory, but we don't really know what the global workspace is.

So there's no mathematical description.

So it's hard to test it.

Although there is the global neuronal workspace, which is more specific theory.

Yeah, I agree.

I mean, when people talk about global workspace, then they usually less to use some mathematical formulation of global workspace.

But on the contrary, for example, like IIT in an integrated information theory is a mathematical way of formulated.

So what I want to say here is our theory is also mathematical formulated. So to test it over to make prediction is much, much easier than other theory of consciousness.

And how to empirical test it.

So we, of course, we now we don't have like we don't have any measurement, we can have all internal brand states on hand.

But even that we can still compute from based on our theory, we can still compute the non-trivial information closure.

It's just information theory radical measurements.

So we can really compute it with the major the brand and any brand data from any brand major.

And then we can compute the non-trivial information closure.

So that and then if we can from this we can make prediction, right?

And if that matched the phenomenology, then we can test our theory very rigorously.

So what I want to say here is we haven't done any experiment and also in the previous literature, there is no one look at the non-trivial information closure.

No one because this is quite, this is a new concept in information theory.

It's proposed by Bechener in 2006.

# Find Paper
So from here, from that paper, there's no application for this kind of information measurement to neuroscience.

So I want to say that is our theory is mathematical formulated so we can test it very well.

But from now, before now, we don't have much data to support our theory.

That's true. Yeah. Acer, it seems like an interesting direction.

You mentioned there's a mathematical model. Is there anything I can, is there a paper on it or anything I can search for and read to find out more about it?

Yes, I think if you can just Google my name, then you can find our paper published last year in front here.

Oh, great. Yeah, I'll look for it.

Acer, if I didn't ask a question related to Paul's point about synchrony and the precision of message passing.

So that does seem to be something which is a play in neuronal ensembles and the paired filing in the brain.

It also seems to be evidenced across cultural synchrony and just paired systems even at the level of biophysiology.

And humans seem to do this particularly well and it seems also to fall out naturally actually out of any two systems attempting to predict each other.

So in so much as message passing becomes efficient because you have two predictors that are trying to predict the arrival and the appropriate sending of messages.

A synchrony naturally emerges from two Bayesian engines attempting to pass messages, right?

And so this kind of synchrony humans with our particularly explicit predictive brains do extraordinarily well, not only at the level of culture,

but most evidently at the level outside the brain of language.

So we have an extraordinary attunement to isochrony in tone and in language.

So we break speech up into specific past isochronous units even though speech itself is not isochronous.

# Find Paper
And there's been sort of, there's a paper called The Paradox of Isochrony, you might be interested in that.

And The Paradox is that the speech itself is not isochronous, so we don't speak in beats like we do in music.

We're one of the few creatures that can entrain to an isochronous beat, but we don't actually use it when we form words.

But it's been theorized and this paper suggests and models the way in which isochrony is actually used to time the appropriate pauses between speakers and between words

to allow efficient communication that you know the beats after which it's appropriate to begin speaking.

And we do this with extraordinary accuracy.

And so given this like trans scalar precision that's evident actually across all living systems, but particularly humans do this at the level of neurology,

neuronal ensembles and communication between other minds, does your theory in line with Sherrod's question,

does this precision of synchronous message passing fall out for want of a better word from your theory?

I think unfortunately because our theory is only try to identify a conscious process.

But I think this what you say is very important in terms of information theory in the neuroscience.

And I think there is a lot of this kind of study, but our theory doesn't directly try to explain this information communication in the behavior level.

So, yeah, so very efficiently we cannot answer this question directly.

Well, if we would explain at the level of neurons, right, as in dopamine neurons basically up regulating or rather the cortical gain of a signal, surely it does.

If it does at the level of neurons, it would surely rise to at the level of communication.

I think one interesting thing is in our communication where you can say when we use our language, we actually only have intention.

And those words, those sentence are actually composed consciously and we say it.

And we even don't we don't have the conscious access about those like grammatical processing and also those synthetic processing.

We only have some intention then we can say some sentence.

So this is important in our also in our theory.

So this unconscious processing seems not able to form information close information in the conscious level.

So but so what if the only thing I can say is for communication, we since have some kind of abstraction interface, we can just put the intention and then that generates those communication.

And but what so so the only thing I can say is, OK, maybe in the future, we can focus on what kind of the more semantic level to find a conscious process.

Yeah, so yeah, thank you.

That is yeah, very intriguing.

Yes, sir, I have a question. Would you say the way you were talking about the channels, would it relate to like current flow?

No, channel means any information processing.

So for example, current flow is one way to convert convey information, right, even but synapse the chemical channel is also one way to convey information.

So the point is what kind of information from in the brain communicate with other than can be conscious content is our research goal.

Yeah, so any so all you can say we don't know what kind of physical physical subtract is related to consciousness.

It could be neural, it could be atom, it could be anything.

But one thing is unchanged is no matter what kind of physical subject you have information is there.

So information can be detached from the physical subject.

Right. So this is the very foundation of our approach because I don't know anything about physical subject and consciousness.

But what we know is we have conscious content, its information and we have physiological change and it's also information.

So we want to link these two together.

So that's our very fundamental idea of this whole theory.

Can I ask a question?

Oh yeah, maybe Frank should and then Ramsey had brought up ego dissolution so we can always go back to that.

Yeah, maybe you should go Frank.

Oh hi Acer.

Very interesting paper that I just browsed the abstract of the few paper.

So in there you mentioned a keywords of non-trivial non-trivial information closure and the pattern versus the environment.

We know that in general anesthesia that the brain, I mean we lose consciousness but still the brain is firing in some level, at some level.

So I mean it's just take time.

What is your experimental life suggestions?

What would you refer to the threshold that you said there's a certain course grain but there seems to be a specific level, right?

If there's such a level, what's your theory, what's your explanation of this particular level?

Yes, that's a good question.

So in our paper we actually have a chapter about unconscious process.

So you can say even we are sleeping or we have deep sleep, no dreams, sleeping and we are maybe in a coma.

But our brain still have some kind of activity, right?

And of course then we can do some course grinding, do some abstraction, of course.

But the point is whether those activity can be cause grain into non-trivial informational closed process.

That's our core hypothesis.

So in this chapter about unconscious processing we list several unconscious processing like blood side, like procedural memory.

And those processes are usually unconscious and we explain why they are unconscious because they are not environmentally closed.

So even like a patient in a coma, for example their auditory cortex still can respond to external sound.

But this is totally informationally not closed because it's directly influenced by the external information.

So this kind of process then we can simply explain by our theory because it's not informationally closed so it's not conscious.

So the criterion is can you form a course grinding to form course grinding and then the course grinding process is informationally closed then that's the key.

I wanted to ask you, I skimmed your paper and I was looking for what you referenced earlier that you're trying to understand something that's not real in the brain, some sort of, I was wondering what, so if you're trying to like, can you elaborate on that point basically?

Are you talking about the macro process that leads to macro processes that are not real that you're trying to detect by detecting the changes in the environment of the brain?

And maybe to say more about what is the mathematical underpinning of detecting something that's not real, what do you mean by that?

This is some kind of magical mathematical truth. So first simply we can quantify information flow by transfer entropy, that's the first step.

So if we take transfer entropy as a way to describe information flow then we can next define what's information closure.

So information closure becomes there's no information transfer between system B to system A then system A is information only closed to system B.

So by this transfer information and we can quantify information closure is the transfer entropy becomes zero.

So then we can use this information closure to quantify how much information can assist the microscopic system and can transfer to the microscopic system of the system.

So here the important thing is to connect to consciousness. So we have a lot of physiological change, physiological information, very high dimensional, but in conscious content we only have a little bit about it.

So there must be some information lost from the micro to macro and we can use information closure to describe this. So the whole story is based on this mathematical foundation and also phenomenology, our conscious experience.

And then we can formulate the following of the theory. That's the whole thing.

I'm going to ask what is probably an unreasonably tough question, but I'd be interested just if you could hazard a go.

Do you have a theory of why it is that evolution would have proceeded along these lines and also how the integrity of the closed informational system would have survived variant mutations which would have altered the actual physical structure of neurons and their firing rates.

So how is this maintained as the brain evolves over time and what is the adaptive value? I know those are unfairly tough questions, but I'm just curious as to whether they are factored into your thoughts.

I can answer this question, but maybe the answer will be very different from what other people say.

So the first thing is about functionalism. So some people, some conscious theory of consciousness or some idea of consciousness, they think consciousness has some function that support the adaptation in evolution.

But our theory is very different. Our theory is just from very simple informational hypothesis about conscious process. But the point is the implication of our non-functional hypothesis can lead to a strong functional aspect.

So the functional aspect is to form the non-trivial information closure, you need to model the environment and also model your interaction with the environment.

So the functional implication from our theory is if you can well model the environment and your interaction with the environment, of course you have a very good way to adapt to the current environment.

So in our theory, consciousness is some kind of byproduct of a modeling process. So by this way we can, to me, it will separate why, what's the informational aspect of consciousness and why it can be consciousness.

And also why, what is the functional implication of this informational process and also how it works in the evolution.

So I think our theory can very well integrate this two point of view. But like for some functionalism, if they believe that consciousness is some kind of evolution, some tool will evolve in the evolution process.

The evolutionary process then, yeah, it may, it's hard to explain why consciousness can produce or exist at the beginning.

But our theory is more from more non-functional point of view and then put the implication about functional aspects, yeah.

That's very, very, very elegant because you never encounter the variance in the substrate. It's really, it's in virtue of modeling at a particular course grain that the phenomena emerges, right?

So it survives the evolution change to the neural substrate, if that's right, which is...

Exactly, exactly.

Yeah, well, great.

Hi, Aisler, yeah, thanks for sharing your recent research. So I'm very interested.

So the, can I make an example, bring an example of the dream?

Would you say the, say, we often remember what we dream last night, right? So it's a dream state that I'm literally, I've taken, you know, information theory courses.

So I understand that you're, so far, it's more, can I say, it's more theoretical like a work. So if that's to be, what would be a few good examples that the brain states are, that has this closure, information closure states?

Would dream be one or say earlier, we mentioned that you said coma, but is a coma like only, I don't think the brain fires only to the external stimuli, right? So it's fired on soft, no?

So I guess I'm, you know, those will be, you know, I guess a stream. What's your comment on the dream? Yeah.

Okay, yeah, yeah, I think there are two questions here. So first is about dream. So I think a good challenge, good challenge to our theory is, okay, during dreaming, we don't really have external input.

So it's not info, probably, and people may say, okay, it's not non-trivial information only closed. So, but what I want to emphasize here is, not all our brain and brain processes are the part of the information closed process,

because we can easily see a lot of sensory or motor cortical area, they are quite passive, right? So if you input some information, visual, auditory and anything, then it activates.

So they are quite passive and not information only closed because it can respond to the external information there. There is no closure.

So there must be some more core part about our brain is can be information on closed. So about dream, this is the same thing. So during dreaming, we can see from like the FMI, we can see a lot of our primary sensory area and also motor area can be activated, right?

So those are actually the environment of the information only closed process in our brain. So, but this is, indeed, this is currently a more theoretical guess about how we can have conscious content in dreaming.

So that's the first question. And second question is, okay, yeah, of course, there are a lot of like background noise or put more academic worries like noise correlation in the brain.

So every neuron, of course, fire a lot, even you are not working on some task. So, but the point is, the question is, can we find a cost grant process that forms the trivial information only closed?

And then this is an empirical question. And we need to find what kind of cost granting or can say information channel can form this macroscopic information closure process. So we are working on it. Yeah, that's this is a tough one.

Yeah, thank you very much. I hope, you know, in the future, we'll, we'll have offline DMs. Thank you, Acer.

I have a couple. So one was the idea of Acer's idea of virtual consciousness or virtual brain activity. That's not that's, I guess it goes back to real. So I also searched your research paper for a mention of virtual and that's not mentioned in the paper either.

Do you have, so would virtual brain activity have neural correlates? And that's sort of my question. But then I, let me pause there and give you a chance and then I'll have to follow up.

So, yeah, that's a very good question. So very different from some previous theories. So some previous theory also suggest, okay, our brain, of course, from a primary visual or sensory cortex to a high level cortex, we have some the whole pipeline information pipeline are actually doing some kind of abstraction.

So, but they all have, of course, is along this pipeline, they all have neural or physiological subtract behind or underneath. But our theory is different. We don't, we want to say even those pipeline are doing some abstraction, but those are still neurons.

Neurons are noisy. So no matter what you need to build up some kind of abstraction is the kind of virtual or cost grant. And but if the cost granting can be information or close, then it can be very stable and also a good model about the environment.

So very different from previous theory, we want to say those virtual cost granting is there, but it's not. They don't really have a physiological subtract support it, but this is not magical. This is just some way you can form.

It's like using your computer, right? So in your monitor, you have some objects in your desktop. So but those objects are not real. They are composed by like pixels or more fundamentally composed by like memory segments, something like that.

But you still can have object at abstract level, right? So this is the same thing. So if we have an informational closed process at microscope level, they don't need to be a real thing in the physical world.

So so so one one point to that effect is and maybe to bring and share it a little bit. But so so you know people want to find, you know, I guess when people are new at neuroscience, they want to decode the brain and they want to say, Hey, there's there's there's a neural pattern and we can identify it in one location.

And and and then they and then suddenly they're confronted with the reality that that you know what that you have groups of neurons that that might that might fire but not necessarily a single neuron firing in a single circuit.

It's like, you know, the neural correlates of you looking at a bottle could be one could be different neurons each time. So it is sort of like it's sort of like evokes idea that your representation is of some object could be virtual and that it's not a particular neuron.

I mean, there then people say, Oh, well, there's Jennifer Aniston on it's the country contributing example. Right. But but so so the sort of to finish that idea. It's, it's, it's like, well, you know, that that is a complete that is a complete idea.

But but the second idea was what how do you know what what because what I'm saying is like there's a whole bunch of like ideas coming out in terms of how how neurons can receive information in different in different ways.

Like, I guess, I guess there's papers that are saying that neurons can can detect maybe electromagnetic information, maybe light, you know, different, you know, it's just like, I'm not sure exactly what the consensus is here on what if there is a consensus on what the sort of closed, you know, how neurons are actually closed off to each other.

I don't know if this is more of like a question for for Sherrod. Can we really say that that it's sort of connecting trying to connect neuroscience to to what Acer saying and maybe you can both answer that.

But but do we know for is there a real consensus in science about what areas of the brain are really closed off from from other areas of the brain is in terms of information.

Isn't that necessary for your for your paper Acer that some I might be able to before they reply just because that's why I raised my hand to do it and a tag to to your question Micah so that for for efficiency.

Oh, please, please go ahead.

I'm unqualified to be on the stage, but I had heard something earlier in Acer, by the way, I'm thrilled at all your abilities to answer these questions.

It's exciting to listen to.

So to to parlay with what Micah was stating. And he mentioned it at the very end, but but for example, if the eyes were closed, but they were functioning.

That that photons could could interact with the brain is one question of stimuli that may interact that that wasn't necessarily identified from from parts of the of the eye, which which as I understand is an extension of the brain.

So so using that and now some question one is with the the eyes as well as the spinal column conceptually being an extension of the brain has the stimuli to those elements being considered as as areas that that may or may not have had physical representation.

You were talking about that.

The second part of that is as I understand the exo and micro biome with me within the gut or intestines or the the blood moving barrier has has an impact.

Some might say that spicy food impact streams just as an example. So those two other influences that aren't necessarily traditionally added to the typical to typical sensory.

Yeah, I mean, I really enjoy and appreciate that question, Micah, because I think that was the motivation for my question that Acer previously, I said, you know, the models are great.

But toward the topic of this room at hand, a path towards solving consciousness. I would actually also add to that to pose a question to Acer. Let's just constrain things very simply.

Let's say a per individual sitting at a table and someone places an apple in front of them. What are the measurable components that you would use in your model to be able to say with precision at which point that this apple come into that person's conscious awareness.

Or was that person aware, you know, of their conscious state. And as part of that, they saw the apple. However, you, you know, you want to word it and feel free to lean on me for the underlying mechanistic components, the neurophysiology neurophysiological components.

But I'm just very curious about how does one take this model from a theoretical point of view to something that's actionable, something for whom the applications of which can be shared with humanity in a way that helps us better understand ourselves.

And I think that's where a lot of us perhaps join this room with that deeper curiosity. And so I'm just curious how you would go about approaching that Acer.

Yeah, this is a very good question. And actually, I think it's not so difficult to answer. So in the setting that you say, so we can use camera to record this apple, then maybe we can tell the subject to rotate the apple.

And then we can use camera to record what kind of like what you see from your vision. So you have external dynamic, that's the environment, right? And then you can use some neurophysiological major.

And then you can record the neurodynamic. And then simply you can use anyway to compute the information closure, non-trivial information closure, because it's well mathematical formulated.

It's just need to have some approximation to compute it. But in any way, but you have this external dynamic, you have also internal dynamic, and you can easily compute it.

And then you can test whether this, you can detect which kind of information in your brain major can form the information closure.

And then if it's related to your conscious experience, then we can prove or we can say we can evaluate this model, whether this model is really true or not.

So this is very empirically testable. Only one question is the major of our, any major of the physical or like a macro major already cost grant.

For example, like EEG, like FMBI or any non-investive way to do the brain major already cost grant.

So the only question here is we may be able to only find the small part of the whole process.

Not a big, as I say, our theory allows the nested consciousness. So to find the biggest consciousness in our brain probably is difficult to do that now.

But if, but for more small, small information, informational process, then I think it's really not so difficult to test this theory for now. Yeah.

Very interesting. Asa, is it okay if I ask you a question?

Yes, go ahead.

Asa, I just wanted to understand from a perspective of consciousness that you are elaborating or describing, does it all relate to the brain and is consciousness a mental aspect only?

I don't quite understand the question. Can you, can you just refresh it? Sorry.

It seems like obviously consciousness is being approached from elements of the brain and neuroscience and your pathways and elements that are stimulated through senses.

But as far as consciousness is concerned, is it exclusively?

A brain element, a neural element, or does it go beyond that?

Okay, that's a good question.

So our theory, the same as other information, informational theory of consciousness is,

our theory doesn't constrain its need to be biological or neuron-based system.

So because it's information, informational theory, so it can apply to any other sense,

even any other weird processes.

Because any process, it contains some kind of information.

So the importance in our theory is we have a mathematical formulation,

and it's informational mathematical formulation.

You can compute any system by this measure, and then you can, based on our hypothesis,

we can say it has how much consciousness, what kind of conscious content it may have.

So it doesn't restrict to biological or neuron-based system.

So I think that's the important thing of our theory.

I think that's a very important part, and I appreciate you for asking that question.

Brother, because I feel the same way.

You could once say that consciousness or ideas and thoughts are just frequency turned into geometry,

and then geometry been converted into mathematics.

I mean, numbers, zeros and ones, because that's how we perceive information in our reality.

So my idea is, speaking back on the photons, photons could be an exchange of information

because they're just one degree to the next.

So if it all starts off vibrational or frequency, if one wants to say the exchange continues,

just like every other thing in our universe, our cells, atoms, everything,

everything continues to this potential rolling process.

So I feel like that a lot of times it's so simple in my head.

It's the same exact thing, and we're complicating it with all of these understandings in a three-dimensional way.

And I am founded in science, but if I am founded in science, I'm not at all do I have you guys credentials,

and I admire that, and I appreciate that, and I'm glad you all are in the field.

I appreciate being in this panel with you all, but I put in the work the same exact way, like I'm a life student.

So I feel like what we need to do is connect with two. We can't separate.

If you separate them, then you won't understand.

So if things are waves and vibration, and then that vibration exchanges into electricity,

then how hard is it to understand that frequency exchanges into light?

And you know, like how hard or geometry, then these information transforms into light.

I mean, to me, I have a hard time explaining it sometimes, but it's obvious, like it's super obvious,

and we have to look behind the veil, and we have to, if you look at the universe, and I'll say it again,

the cosmos has one brain, then you can begin to understand things, because you can see how everything is interconnected,

and then you can really understand the process by looking at the process of the cosmos.

Like, I'm not trying to be all metaphysical. I'm just saying, even on a science basis, it's really true.

Like, it's true. I don't see any separation, and it's not that hard to understand if we stop making that divide.

Like, we're moving into a state of understanding what we should get past.

Like, okay, let's break this down into this three-dimensional reality so we can understand it

when we already know the other dimensions exist, proven through physics.

Like, I mean, I don't understand.

Can I just get in here and potentially support something, you know, you're going into here, Michael,

because I think it's very easy for it to be seen as ignorance,

and a lot of people shy away from elaborating these points,

because in the academic fields, they haven't had the pursuit of justification as it may deserve.

So, for example, there's an example of birds in Delaware that predict hurricanes

and weather patterns better than meteorologists and AI has been able to,

because they are actually tuned in to different waves and vibrations.

And by the way, if you don't know this, please Google it.

It's been studied and it was studied, and it was shown that these birds with a lot less, you may think,

cognitive ability than us humans, given that they don't have cars, you know, although they're about to a wing,

but they can predict the weather better than we can as humans,

and they're not doing any maths, they're not doing any graphs, they're not doing any of that stuff.

They're literally tuned in to very specific information that is available in this universe,

maybe at a metaphysical level, you know, Big Mike, that you're going on about,

and I truly respect that perspective, because Nikola Tesla did say that us humans will advance

in ten years more than we've ever advanced in several thousand years when we start to,

when science focuses on metaphysics and understands what is actually happening at a higher level

than the physical environment and just biology, because we still haven't been able to truly transfer electricity

the way Nikola Tesla was thinking of doing it in a wireless way.

We're still doing it through cables, because our, you know, our science is still primitive to the metaphysical fashion

of using different frequencies that are available out there now.

What consciousness is necessary to tune into that?

And that's what I thought we would have probably been discussing, and I'm sorry, Michael,

I'm shredding away, and I said, and Sherrod, you know, just hopping in here to share a little bit of perspective,

but what do us humans need to do through AI and neuroscience to get closer to, obviously,

one of the biggest forces in this universe, which is sitting probably between us and the physical world,

being the frequencies, that obviously there are animals who can already tune into that.

So are we truly the most conscious beings in this planet, or do we think we are?

Chicago, we think we are, and Mark, I'm passing to you right after this.

I apologize for jumping in, fellas, but you just got me all, like, super geeked out.

Like, no, I am very, I feel a very strong connection with Nikola Tesla.

I actually have been working on what you were just talking about, and I actually have an understanding,

I believe, I strongly believe, how he plans to do it, and the spirit, and related to human beings.

If you look at, like, quantum field theory, if you look at the fact that quantum field theory is based on particles,

random interaction, it's the same thing with human beings.

So we randomly interact to carry on creation.

You get what I mean? So it's the same thing.

So you don't have to have a specific channel to run something straight through to a specific point,

or rotate that energy.

If you have things interact and randomly, they can carry a charge,

and these particles can pop out of nowhere to carry this charge.

So I'm still working on that.

But anyway, definitely feel where you're coming from, and I know that that is the truth what he said.

And like I said, I mean, that guy, I just feel a very, very close connection with Nikola Tesla,

and I study and try to complete some of his work.

I am a cultivator, and cultivation of cannabis, I use a lot of electromagnetic fields.

I do a lot of weird stuff that other folks wouldn't do.

I talk about it often in rooms, a lot of tech companies email me, try to talk to me.

I knew it was a superconductive point in the plant before they even started to talk about hemp batteries,

because I realized that when I looked at the diagram for superconductivity and understanding it,

and understanding how a plant processes nutrients and the whole process of photons and everything.

And that's the thing, what you said, plants are more conscious than human beings.

I mean, I'm just going to tell you that. They are.

Well, water has memory, so yeah.

Plant, plant, they're just way more conscious than human beings.

I mean, to not, what has taken the human race now is a verbal communication.

I'm just, that's what has like decreased, took us down.

Like it brought us down because to convey an idea is something past words,

because an actual idea has intention.

Your voice, sound, vibration can carry intention,

but not to the understanding of what I'm talking about.

It cannot convey, it cannot convey intention in the way that I'm speaking of.

So when we reach a level like the ancients were, where I believe,

and I could, you know, later on, express these theories,

anybody would want to talk about them later on, because I don't want to hog the floor.

It's a different, it's different ways to transfer consciousness

when you start to understand or transfer ideas across.

Just the same way Tesla wanted to transfer wireless energy,

but we haven't reached that point yet,

because we don't understand how we receive information.

And if we understand how we receive information,

then we can begin to give information in that way.

I just want to reset the room and then I'll let Mark.

You guys think I can chime in? You think I can say something?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll go to Mark, but so we're just resetting.

So this is the neuroscience and AI.

We're talking about a path towards solving consciousness.

And I think what Mike mentioned is really the central premise of the room.

I didn't start this room.

It was Paul King who started it.

And you guys can follow that, the house up there in the host rooms,

similar like this, similar to this.

And so what this room was really concerning is using neuroscience

as a framework and artificial intelligence also as a framework

and a construct to tackle what they call the heart problem.

And the thing that Mike pointed out and the way that he described it

is very true and it's like a problem that affects neuroscience

and AI as it relates to consciousness,

which is that if we go too elemental, too microscopic

using the principles of chemistry, physics, physiology, medicine

to describe the elemental basis of phenomenon,

we end up severing the complexity.

But as we move too far to the other extreme and we invite,

which we should, and a more sort of global view of consciousness,

realism, spirituality, themes within psychology

that have no true empirical testable basis

because of our limitations, our technology,

then we lose the elemental basis that we can use to verbally

introduce concepts and pass them down, articulate them,

communicate them throughout the community,

for which we can formulate a basis of knowledge to build on.

And so it really does present a problem.

And that's really what this room was talking about,

people were coming in with their various points of view to tackle that.

So with that being said, Mark, I think you're up next.

Oh, I had a question.

I just came in recently, so I appreciate you resetting the room.

When you say solve in consciousness, like,

what's an example of some consciousness problems that would be getting solved?

Did you say something about the heart?

Yeah, I think Mark was next, but absolutely, we'll get to you.

Yeah, sure.

So thanks for having me up here.

I really enjoyed the discussion this far, Sherwood.

And I think, you know, you mentioned the term framework.

And I think that's having the right framework to kind of attack the

consciousness problem is important.

And Michael, a lot of things you said are actually extremely spot on.

So like personally, I work in information science, information systems,

analog computing, and a whole bunch of things.

But some of the most important questions in this field are,

what is information?

What are its properties?

How is information transported from two different points of the universe?

And what rules does information obey?

And as you said, kind of how you see it so clearly,

when you begin to ask those like very simple questions,

which I believe are the right questions,

you get a very quantized view of information.

And you get to see how information systems like truly work and how,

you know, it moves through kind of biological processes,

through other kind of kinetic processes throughout the universe.

But really, what is information?

What are its properties?

What rules does it obey?

And how is it transported?

Some people believe the information has universal properties.

And so I would just say like having the right framework to attack the

problem and quantizing it in the right way,

is definitely one extreme side of the equation.

But I think it holds a lot of water.

And so just be curious if any of the researchers in this room,

Acer or others had thoughts on kind of what is information from your point of view.

How's it quantized?

What are symbols?

Yeah, so I just wanted to open it up to the researchers for any of those questions,

if you had thoughts.

Really quick, Mark.

I just want to say something to you and we can talk about it later.

I actually, one morning I was just in deep thought and I just had some clarity about quantum computing.

And again, I compared it to several things that exist in our cosmos.

And it was about some of the issues that they were having with quantum computing.

And I kind of got some possibly a way to solve some of those problems.

So we can talk later.

Okay, A1, did you want to say something?

A1, did you want to say something?

Yeah, sure.

Thank you for the space.

I apologize if I intruded anybody's space.

And then Mark, sorry about that.

Can I go?

Can I just say what Mike was talking about?

Like with the interaction.

What other people were saying.

As far as the interactions, like that's a very, that's a very like way, that's a very good way to put it.

Because if you think about it, it starts with the mother.

There's a research on the Yanomami tribe.

And so if you, if you take a look at like the observation from that specific tribe, the only reason why the consciousness is still having fully, fully got connected and kind of seek to that.

Like the AI kind of like expressing yourself to the point where you, you know, you understand that your mother is the only reason why you chose to become a better human.

Or you chose to be a better, better person to understand that.

Oh, we got to get this done.

We have to get this done.

And the only reason you have to change the framework when it comes to you feeling all this, all these energies, all these different energies, you constantly have to put together these people in the same room.

And they could just collaborate and elaborate themselves to allow them to understand that consciousness is just a feeling. It's all about the feeling.

So it's like everyone wants to feel like they are like the best at the best of whatever it is that they want to do.

And so that's all I wanted to say. Like if you guys haven't seen the Mami tribe, you understand what I'm trying to say by how AI and consciousness is going to solve itself by you creating like a infrastructure with when the mother, it's like the mother is basically the source.

And it's always going to be the source behind it all.

That's all I wanted to say.

If I could just interrupt a little bit. So going back to what Sharad was saying, there's a lot of different topics related to consciousness.

This is like psychology and sociology and you can talk about Gaia and philosophy and Mother Earth and spirituality.

Those are all other topics, but there's sort of a little bit off topic to what Sharad was saying.

In the context of the group of neuroscience and AI, those are a little bit off topic.

So I just wanted to sort of say that.

Michael, sorry, I actually agree and I would like to see if we could enter the puppy of getting into topic as best as we can.

And I think it's a great opportunity for us to have your insight on the study that you've been doing in neuroscience and in AI for us to understand how is that work and how's the work of quantum computation and AI and deep machine learning going to help us become more conscious beings.

And what consciousness are we actually aiming to achieve given that there's a variety of levels in this consciousness because it's a very precious tool AI and deep machine learning and all of these elements.

And given the research and the valuable work that you guys are doing and I'm happy for either one of you to answer.

Sharad, you're doing a PhD and there's a lot of valuable work you guys are doing here, but where is this in your view going to help consciousness evolve and what opportunities have we got ahead and how much more conscious we can become.

Yeah, I'm happy to answer, but Acer, if you want to go first or Michael.

Go ahead. Yeah. Great. So the first question. I'm not a specialist. I'm a behavior neuroscientist and I study depression and really the neuroscience of emotions.

And so the question is, what is the relationship between your emotional experience, awareness, attention and conscious states. And so for the purposes of neuroscience, you know, the work, the task and it's to take some things that's both fundamental to being human,

which we all kind of have developed socially derived language to articulate. Like, what does it mean to be awake? What does it mean to be in love? What does it mean to be angry and to dissect those and break those down and reduce them as much as we can so that we could observe it in a reliable and

valid way while at the same time not obscuring the essence of that thing. And so we rely on models to be able to do that. And so in my case, my central question, my thesis work is there is a burgeoning hypothesis of depression.

And that hypothesis is that depression is actually due to a deficit in interoception, which is your ability to engage in self referential thinking of your experience relative to someone else's.

And we get that again, intuitively, because I can be depressed that due to COVID I lost my job. I'm having marital strife. My situation is just really deteriorating relative to, let's say, my best friend, who actually is thriving during this pandemic miraculously enough.

And so the feelings of depression or what we attribute the state of depression to is not as much how I'm experiencing within my body, but it's also how my thoughts and those experiences and that feeling and perception is relative to other frames of reference.

And so as it relates to consciousness, my definition of consciousness is the internal experience of physiological processes. And my definition is intentionally vague because I think that that composes all aspects of physiology.

And I think of this, I give this analogy, my heart racing. So the experience of my heart racing can happen in a variety of contexts. It can happen if I see a loved one after I haven't seen him in a long time.

It can happen just before I get a message from my boss saying, listen this urge and I need to see you. Both of those are the same physiological experience within my body, yet we can ascribe different emotions to that.

One could be excitement or anticipation. The other can be intense dream. And so I think of consciousness as just the awareness within the person's subjective internal experience of that state.

So I try to simplify it because I do my work in mice. And so when I'm talking about, and I think we can learn a lot by the neuroscience of psychiatric disorders because all affected neuroscientists struggle day in and day out with that question of how do I take something as complicated as a psychiatric illness, schizophrenia, depression, PTSD, OCD and reduce it in a way that I can study this in a rodent.

And guess what? The rodent can't tell me, hey, I feel depressed and the ability to either verbalize it or show through one's actions, their mental state is a hallmark of pretty much all psychiatric disorders as it relates to the DSM, which is in the United States.

That's the criteria, the manual used to diagnose psychiatric disorders. And so I have to then rely on measures crudely by looking at the electrophysiology as the animal. I put the animal in situations where they have to navigate very controlled context that by looking at their behavior and how they react to their environments,

I can then infer their behavioral state using their physiology as a proxy. And so that's an example of how I would borrow from concepts of chemistry and physics as it relates to how this neuron is behaving and how much calcium influx I'm seeing and action potentials

and ion channels and things like that, all of those concepts. I'm using that to then build all the way up to a discussion of, oh, when this animal traverse through this psychological stressor, over time, that stress accumulated.

And what we see as a result of that is a depressed state or animal that is behaving in a depressive like manner as it relates to despair behavior that I see. Sorry about the noise that I see it exhibiting so on and so forth.

And so to answer the second part of your question, which is, okay, so you have this information, how can we use this to help humanity? And that's one that I'm deeply engaged in as an MD PhD candidate.

I hope to bring revelations and insights that I learned at the bench at the lab and bring it into a clinical setting so that people can better understand themselves. And so as it relates to my work now with depression, one of the biggest things that I'm finding,

I initially started my project searching for a part of the brain that seems to be more sensitive to the depressed state as relative to other emotional states. And what I found was that that same center, those same neurons encoded resiliency and encoded the ability to persist in the face of challenge.

And so still having a what we call a positive affect, meaning, generally, the animal behaviors, though it was not going through a really psychologically stressful situation, but we knew, because we in a very formulating and standardized manner to control so that all of the animals and

animals that I'm studying are going through a psychological, chronically stressful psychological state. And so this answers the question I think Mark asked about how do we look at information, and how do we pass it along and what is sort of the irreducible, smallest

to our packet of information. And I think that as a relative neuroscientist, that comes in the way of the rigor of the study and how much we can control it. And so every chart you see every bar graph you see is a packet of information.

Again, broadly in the academic context, and that is why it's important in my mind that when we have conversations about consciousness that there is a degree of attention to the language that we use, as far as we can to approximate it, because that's the only way we'll be able to bring

everyone up to speed to sort of reset the room on a global sense, and then allow people to go with their individual perspectives to answer and tackle this question because I don't think one person is going to be able to answer it.

I don't think it's going to be a global effort, but I think it's critical that we have foundational elements. And I guess my argument for it and closing is that behavioral neuroscientists are well equipped to start to tackle it because this is what we have to do in our day to

day, take these very terms and conditions that humanity, by virtue of the way we speak about them, we impart almost a mystic spiritual quality to it, which is absolutely there. But unfortunately, a huge part of spirituality and mysticism is that you can't really

reduce it in terms that can be reproducible within a human's control of when and where it's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I'll say. And closing, thanks.

Very interesting, Sherrod. And thank you for answering the questions with depth. And I just wanted to add something and potentially, you know, to the work you're doing when it comes to depression and mental health, and I'm sorry to hear that you're going through the

difficult moments you're going through in life. And, you know, I'm sure better times are going to come and you'll overcome it with, you know, better opportunities ahead of you.

But John Hopkins did some research on psilocybin as being the most effective potential medicine for depression four times more effective than any medicine on the market.

And this was researched on last year by Roland Griffith, a PhD scholar that works at John Hopkins. And I just wonder if you ever, you know, looked into that and how powerful that special chemical can be to cure people from depression and bad pattern.

Thanks a lot. I just want to be clear. That was an example. But yes, my heart also goes out to people for whom I was using a basic example. And then the chemical, I'm sorry, I missed what chemical it was.

It's psilocybin. It's it comes from. Yeah, I'm not as familiar. I mean, I know what the chemical is, but I'm not as familiar with that individual researcher and what they found. Thanks.

Yeah, basically, the rich, the what psilocybin does is it activates in your pathways in a very active way during a long period of time in a way that your stimulated senses, which touch smell imagination, can't do on its own.

And can't, you know, the conscious human can't stimulate its own consciousness on its own to that degree.

So psilocybin being a psychedelic puts the human consciousness through neural pathways in such an active form that it gives humans almost a bigger landscape to work on as soon as they become conscious to themselves and awake, so to speak,

which allows them to actually fight addiction, bad patterns, because they're more equipped with more active neural pathways than they were previously because of routine post stimulation, poor imagination, and it actually enhances.

Yeah, so so information has to travel through those action potentials. And anytime that there's something inhibiting basically the full fidelity of the action potential firing in a chain rate, so think about two to do metric points and then you have to have basically the

same discrete quanta of energy moving in that chain. And if in any way that that breaks, or basically there's a less action potential through that chain, then you lose the information that then needs to move through the body.

And so in many ways, yeah, you know, anything that comes into the body that either inhibits the ion flow or kind of opens up those channels is super important. And one quick example I'll just give the room.

It's called the tea cup experiment. And so if you imagine there's two tea cups in front of you one with hot water and one with cold water.

If you put your finger in each, there's different information that has to fire up and get to your brain. And when you observe the action potentials kind of in each scenario, you'll see that there's a different basically quanta of energy or action force that that's

coming through. There's neurons kind of firing up your arm and so anything that's blocking that will obviously just screw up your body's ability to then to respond to it appropriately or to respond to it in what someone to consider just an acceptable or kind of acceptable manner.

That's a great framework. Like one, did you did you go? Oh, no, I didn't go yet. So yes, like now I got some examples of like, solving consciousness when you mentioned like, you know, trying to solve depression and everything.

So now I got a better understanding of like the topic of the room and everything.

What I will mention is that my friend told me one time that Hannah, his girlfriend, they were on mushrooms. And he said that I got to a point where they could read each other minds, and they was talking to each other telepathically and stuff like that.

And they wasn't even speaking for real. So it expanded their consciousness to the point where they were like read each other minds and stuff like that.

Yeah, no, I've heard similar stories. Rachel.

Hi. Yeah. Thank you so much. I just jumped into this room and it's so funny.

My specialty is spirit spirit based science of the mind technology. And so I studied the science of the mind in the realm of neural pathways and the subconscious mind.

So now I'm working heavily with the super conscious mind. And I'm also a plant medicine shaman specifically serving sephalocybin and I popped into the room right when Shaquille brought that up. So I thought, well, let me raise my hand and see if I can contribute to what you've already started here.

Sherad, I dropped in kind of just when you were speaking a little bit and I'm sorry that I didn't catch everything, but certainly any questions around the relationship between science and spirituality, which is what I nerd out on every single day.

I would love to be here to contribute for that. Thank you so much.

Yeah, no, absolutely. And I think that, you know, that the task or the question, I guess, or the spirituality component, how what what language do you use that's rooted in the anatomy rooted in the physiology in the way that the neuroscientists what

understand and communicate, because my understanding is that it's really hard. And I think it's almost, you know, a lack of respect, I feel because I'm also a spiritual person who happens to be a scientist and a clinician.

But I almost think of them as a separate. So yeah, would love to hear, you know, your thoughts on how a person unites that and grounds it in a scientific context for the purposes of this room.

And I just want to reset the room that that was sort of the original question, which is path towards solving consciousness, using neuroscience and using what we know from artificial intelligence.

Right. No, those are those are amazing questions. And I think, you know, we're all because of our individual perspectives and and the idea of relativity behind our perspectives.

And it's it's important for each person to develop their own grounding, if you will, between what they believe on a spiritual level and what they can perceive in this 3D reality.

As far as the work that I do, I don't get too in depth as far as the physicality of the mind, the physicality, if you will, of the mind itself. I certainly talk about neural pathways, and I have this unique ability to hear when neural pathways are being

in essence deconstructed and then reconnected. I hear clicks and pops in my mind. And when I work, psychically, I'm also a healer and a shaman. And when I work psychically with my clients, I piggyback on their healing.

And I hear like pop rocks in in my head because I am hearing the deeper the healing goes. And the healing, if you will, is those the traumas being deconstructed from the physical sense of those neural connections.

But as far as the connection between consciousness and the science of the mind, I come from more of how the mind works and how the mind sees things. And there's three foundational components and that it's it's that the mind only sees itself as itself.

Right. So the mind only knows I am. So from a healing standpoint, it looks like the mind doesn't know I'm mad at her. The mind knows I'm mad at myself. The mind doesn't know he did this to me. The mind knows I did this to myself.

Right. So that's number one. Number two, the mind doesn't know the difference between past, present and future. Right. So anything that we conceive and perceive up in the future, the mind feels like it's experiencing it right now and from this same idea from the standpoint of looking into our past.

But the most interesting thing that we're coming across now is the work with the super conscious mind and the idea that we not only have to look at the I am component, which is the greater picture of our oneness.

You know, reference back to that the mind only knows itself. But the idea that we're, we're needing to look at the identity fabric of the subconscious, which is that I am somebody who so not I am, but I am somebody who is bad or I am somebody who

treats on my boyfriend and to heal that component. But stepping further now with this work with a super conscious mind is that we become the observer. So it's I am somebody who sees myself as somebody who is a cheater or who is bad.

I don't know directly how to relate these concepts to the physicality of the mind itself. I just know how the mind works, because when I go in with different healing modalities, I understand certain what I call word coding, if you will.

For instance, when somebody says I am wrong, if you release that the wrongness, then you release the trauma. If somebody says, for instance, men are wrong. If you release that, that men are wrong.

With that word coding, the word wrong, you release the original trauma that created that belief system within the mind. And there's hundreds of other words that are I call coding.

So I'm more of a software nerd, as far as the mind is concerned, versus the hardware nerd. Thank you. I'm done speaking.

So I kind of wish the Acer was still here, because I would connect that to a question, the Acer.

So I guess he's got these in his paper. Let me see if I can pull it up real quick. The paper was Non-Trivial Information Enclosure, or Information Closure Theory of Consciousness.

That's what Acer was sharing, and it was a big part of this group, but he took off. But that's okay.

So the idea here that I wanted to ask him was, he's basically saying that he talked about EEG being coarse-grained, and so maybe I can put this question to Sherrod.

Do you know what he means by EEG being coarse-grained? Because what I'm saying is, you know, he's talking about basically, I think, a temporal pattern when he's talking about EEG.

And it sounds like his ICT, or NICT, Non-Trivial... Wait, so ICT is...

Yeah.

It sounds like he's got... Go ahead.

Oh, no, no. I was just going to explain that component of it. And I think what his theory essentially was showing was that we have all of these changes, you know, cells are going through cell cycle at the level of the brain.

Neurons are firing action potentials, yet all of that activity is beneath our conscious awareness. And he says that when you take those processes and scale them up, and I think that's where he calls the coarse-graining,

you scale them up, then they reach a certain threshold that we become aware. And so, for example, before we recognize our increase in our heart rate, our heart has already started to track faster.

And so there's a period where things are changing or the system is dynamic, which he calls microscopic changes. There's a point beyond which, if it happens enough to pass a threshold, then we're aware.

And I think that fundamental principle of taking these smaller microscopic changes and scaling them up is his foundational basis for his description of computing... I'm sorry, conscious...

How is he scaling them up with awareness or with AI? Or a different way?

I think it was... Michael, you can...

I'm not sure that even he knew completely what the scaling up was. I was trying to ask him what a macro representation was, and I think it's still an open research question.

Sheridan, did you have a different answer?

Yeah, I agree with you.

So I sort of had a big aha moment when I was reading his paper, and again, I wish he was here to answer this. So have you heard of the concept of engrams, or the idea that maybe a representation of something or somebody is an engram,

which would represent a body of activity, a sort of virtual macroscopic object that floats in your mind, that represents an object. People have heard of that?

Yeah.

I just have the feeling that his... What he's referring to is like an engram, and that he's talking about... If coarse-grained for EEG is a frequency pattern,

so maybe he's talking about... For him, I've been skimming his paper for the past two hours while listening to this audio, and I'm thinking that it's like... At a high level, a high level idea is a temporal-spatial frequency pattern.

Let's say that... If you have a song that's played on a piano, imagine your brain is a piano, and the engram is the song, and so the brain is like the piano keys that are playing the tune,

but the tune itself is virtual in the sense that different parts of the brain can play different parts of that tune. It's not necessarily true that the same neurons are going to fire every time when you look at a bottle.

It might be different neurons that fire each time, but if those different neurons are still managing to play that tune, that would be like your brain has a lot of different pianos,

and so different pianos have the capability of playing that tune, and each time that tune comes in, it could be played by a different piano,

and that could sort of explain why there's not a one-to-one correlation between what you see in your neural activity.

And then I was thinking about what Rachel was saying about the therapy that she practices, if you think of a person and change your internal representation

and how you think about them and maybe imagine them doing something different, that has an effect for her and the people that she works with.

I was just imagining, what if there's something like a neural correlate of that that relates to high-level macroscopic temporal-spatial frequency patterns that are representing what Rachel's thinking about,

and then by thinking about it and changing the context, you're changing the tune, but you're changing the tune of a virtual concept that now is going to be played a different way

no matter which piano in your brain is going to play it.

So I just thought that was a cool idea, and I wanted to share it.

I'm interested in reflections, especially neural correlations from research that maybe Sherrod knows about and other people know about.

Yeah, I mean, I am a huge fan of the Ingram work that has been coming out of MIT.

So from a neurobiological perspective, when we talk about M-grams, it really is constricted or restricted to cluster of neurons that are time-locked to an event.

And so the way that this is often studied in a neuroscience context is in relationship to trauma.

And so what we can do is take advantage of a principle that all neurons, A, the underlying assumption, is that they fire X-potentials and they're encoded.

So depending on what that neuron encodes, though it could be a sensory experience, it can be a combination of those.

But whatever that thing is, it fires an X-potential as a response to that event.

And so when a neuron fires an X-potential, not only do we have electrical activity happening, there's also gene transcription happening.

And there's a specific gene called CFOS, which is called an early activating gene.

And essentially, that gene can be then used to put a time stamp on when at that neuron fire.

And so this allows us to start to perturb structure, function, relationships.

Because the question is, when we're talking about where is X encoded in the brain, me, I'm talking about where is depression encoded in the brain.

We could take advantage of the fact that in the experimental context, we can design a traumatic event for this mouse to experience.

And then at the same time, once the traumatic event happens, we can then take advantage of this early activating gene,

and we can say, wow, after the animal got a light foot shot, because we're not trying to harm the animal,

just give them something that will arouse whatever part is linked to a burst of experiences by way of approximating trauma.

And so after that, where we have a signature based off of that gene, which we've been able to engineer to have a fluorescent tag so that we can identify it.

Okay, this is the region and these are the cluster of neurons.

And in the way that we can test whether or not those neurons were indeed important in encoding the memory of the aversive experience or of the trauma or we call fear memory,

so that we can bring them into a remote context.

So nothing stressful, nothing aversive, no trauma, and then selectively activate only those CFos labeled neurons and look at what does the animal do.

And so one of the very first experiments where this technology was used, they brought the animal into this neutral context and excited only those neurons,

not the neighboring ones, not in this.

So now we're getting well beyond just, okay, it's the amygdala or it's just the glutamatergic neurons of the amygdala.

No, these are the specific neurons that were active at the time that that event happened.

And what happens is that when they're selectively activated, you actually see the animal behaving in the way that they were when the trauma occurred.

So they freeze and they will freeze for a very long time and you would almost think, wait, is this animal being actively shocked?

And the answer is no.

And conversely, studies were done the opposite where they would allow the animal to get a treat.

The animals, in particular, they love sucrose lace water, so it's almost like juice.

And so same thing, you can allow the animal to enjoy this treat and then say, what neurons were active then?

And then you put them in a traumatic experience or there is a task that is used a lot in behavior neuroscience called force swim test where you essentially drop the mouse into a bucket of water

and they know how to swim.

So it's just stressful to them, but it's not, you know, something that they'll drown and things like that.

And so normally mice will swim for a little while and then they just, they stop, they give up.

And so this has been used throughout psychiatry to test actually antidepressants because if you can give an animal, let's say an SSRI in this task

and they will swim for a much longer period of time than animals that don't.

And so it's been a test of spray-like behavior.

But anyway, and as it relates to activating the ingram, the positive experience ingram, when they activate that during this task, the animal continues to swim almost as though it remembers, oh wait, there's more to life.

And so the way that this can be, you can conjecture what this means is that this is an example of how you can scale something that's on a neuronal level using just principles of neuroscience to then start to get at, oh wow, what does emotional states mean?

What does optimism mean?

What does pessimism mean?

And so as we talk about consciousness, we could do that to fundamental components of consciousness such as attention versus awareness versus self-appraisal or ability to look at one's state.

And so I think that is like an elegant example of how we can use certain types of technology to get us forward.

Yes, it almost reminded me some of like, I don't know if it's exactly the same thing, but kind of like what hypnosis accomplishes if you hypnotize the person about the trauma to feel differently about it.

Yeah, I mean, it forms the basis of CBT cognitive behavior of therapy where you are sort of playing off of the role of cognition and it's a role or its effect on emotional state and allowing a person to engage and encourage a deeper connectedness.

Can I ask a question about something that might be consciousness related?

Sure, go for it.

I'm a neuroscientist, so like, it's a condition that's called aphantasia.

It's like, if you try to visualize something with your mind, you can't conjure up into images.

So I had noticed like, early last year that was happening with me, like, if I tried to visualize something, it was just dark or whatever like that.

Like, I wasn't saying anything, but if I dream though, I have these dreams that are so vivid, it's hard to tell them apart from real life or not.

Like, I only know that my dream is a dream because the car floats or something like that.

I'm like, okay, cars don't float in real life.

So this is a dream.

But to me, it's like, okay, I know I can visualize because it's happening in my dreams, like I know my brain could do it.

But like, right now, if I try to visualize like a star or a basketball or something like that, I just see like, like darkness.

I'm trying to, I'm trying to like, visualize and like, be able to, because I don't know, because like, it seems like unconsciously when I sleep, all this visual stuff is happening.

But consciously, if I try to, you know, like, hey, visualize something, it doesn't happen.

And I've been like researching it a lot and stuff like that.

I'm kind of curious.

So, so, I mean, if you talk about a basketball for a second, like, when I, I can visualize basketball and I see something that I guess it could be round or spherical.

It could be orange.

It could have lines on it, right?

Are you, so do you, you're saying you just see darkness, but can you maybe describe the visual properties of a basketball anyways?

Oh, okay. Yes, yes, I definitely can.

So like a basketball is like circle, like maybe an orange is beiges color or dark, dark beiges color.

It has like the black kind of lines on it.

Then it kind of has a little circle grip things on it.

So I had my eyes closed while I was saying all of that.

But like what I see, it would be very close to like, if you just turn your phone off and the screen is dark, but then I do see bits of like, like,

sticky baby, like a dark greenish things that are like, like within the darkness.

But it's like darkness and dark.

And then like, if I would, if I was to catch my eyelids, then the green stuff would like flicker, but it's definitely mostly, mostly dark.

But in my dream, though, I can see the whole basketball and it'll, it'll, it'll look like, like a real basketball.

But I came across some stuff about like narrow pathways and stuff like that.

And stuff like that.

So like, I've been, I've been trying to see, like, if I, if I could do that, like, because I'm like, like, either like, try to make some new narrow pathways to visualize or like,

are these narrow pathways is being used when I dream.

But then they're not, they're not being used now or trying to like, see, like, if, like, if a neuroscience has any input about like how the brain works and stuff like that, that might be able to help people with that fantasy to visualize.

It says, it says, it says it's like one out of every 50 people have been fantasia that when they try to visualize, they only see darkness.

And like, I don't try to, I don't wet his name for that. Like, I don't say that I have that because I know that that's like, I know sometimes limits and beliefs can help people not heal from stuff or whatever.

But that just, that's just the best way to like, keep it simple and try to explain what I experienced when I try to, when I try to visualize.

I can speak to that a little bit like one, not from a neuroscientist perspective, but if there's a misconception, I think about visualization as far as

conscious visualization and especially with in the circuits of those who are clairvoyant and practice clear essences. And people think that if they say, oh, I can see this tiger, that they're actually seeing it.

Similarly to a lucid dream state, like when, just like you said, you don't know the difference between real life and the state picture and while you're dreaming. But it's not that. It's a, it's a, it's a sense.

That is, I guess, in a way considered a sixth sense, right? It's a sense of something without needing to consciously depict it or categorize it like much of the brain likes to.

It's, it's a sensing of it. That is what, what is actually happening when people are consciously telling you, especially those that are clairvoyant that they see something.

I'm not familiar with the condition. I'm not saying it's not an actual condition. I'm instead wanting to encourage you to use your other senses to bring in those capabilities without focusing on what you don't have.

Thank you.

Oh, thank you. Yes, I've been, I've been trying to do that. Like sometimes, um, like, like I had dreams that came true before. And like, I don't know, that's under the category of clairvoyant ability. Sometimes if I fall asleep, like when I'm kind of drowsy, and when I fall asleep, I'll have these like clairvoyant vision.

Um, they, oh, and yeah, and, and like the graphicness that changes. Sometimes it could be like a, like a real life flashback or something. Sometimes I could see a real thing and it'll be like in a circle or sometimes I might see like cartoonish images or I'll see things.

But I really see those things like, like, like, like, like in, like in detail. Um, when, when I try to, because like, like sometimes like say like if somebody, um, if it's like, okay, draw your, draw a room in your apartment.

And, um, the people that could visualize it, that could see it, they could draw it real good. It's like with me, it's like, I would have to like, it's like it's only, but so much stuff I could remember since I, since I don't have the picture reference.

Got it. The details reference. I want to, I want to work on, um, being able to, like, I want to visualize because like it does, um, it does limit, it does limit me in a bunch, in a bunch of ways, like not having that type of information.

So, if I may, um, I wanted to sort of justify, um, or I wanted to sort of like bring, sort of like connect this to everything to the topic because I think it is, it is relevant to our topic.

Um, in terms of, um, you know, talking about what, why, why, you know, in terms of talking about what, what the neuroscience of, of consciousness and how we can basically create a computational model of consciousness.

And so, um, it was brought up earlier, um, that, you know, one, one way to describe what consciousness could be is, uh, basically a case of, um, of, uh, modeling, basically like excess interlinked modeling.

So like, so like it's imagined like, and by modeling, I mean like, um, like if you, if you, if you're looking at something right now, uh, let's say it's a, let's say it's your phone and your phone, uh,

your phone is like, um, it's, it's, so your phone is in front of you and you know, you know you let your phone is in front of you, but at the same time, your brain is making, is making a 3D model of a phone.

And, and, and that 3D model is, um, you know, when you're, when, uh, when a computational system makes a 3D model, you call it, you call it a rendering, right?

And it consists of many, there's many different, um, there's, uh, many different properties. There's, there's, it's, it, it, your brain is, is associating, you know, like, um, like, uh, how the phone feels, how it looks, the orientation of the phone.

Uh, there's this great work by, uh, Jeff Hawking's who wrote, um, he wrote this new book. It's called, um, A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawking's.

And he talks about how a neural column is going to, uh, your brain has a lot of neural columns and, uh, and you might have just one neural column that's going to model each of the objects in your experience right now.

Um, and, you know, in terms of like, you know, the stuff that you're seeing specifically, uh, it's probably going to be modeled by your, your visual cortex, but, but that stuff has to be, you know, like, so it's like, you have a neural column in your visual cortex

that's, that's, that is, um, that is contributing to the model of your, of your phone, but you also have, you know, you have other sensory input areas, you know, like the somatosensory, um, uh, cortex and the audio cortex.

And those, the three primary, um, in the visual cortex, those are the three primary, uh, input areas for, for sensory stuff into your brain, and that includes, um, taste.

But, um, but, so, but you have, you have this, um, sort of like, um, what happens is the idea is that maybe all of these different, uh, objects in your environment are being, uh, represented by brain activity right now.

And, um, if, if a person, uh, is, is able to have an amazing, you know, visual dreams, they're not able to sort of, um, have those dreams when they're awake.

It could, it could, you could just say, well, it could be just because the, the part of your brain that is doing that processing, uh, is currently busy.

It's currently busy rendering what you're seeing right now, and that's why it's, it's hard to, um, visualize something that is not present.

But what you, what you could try, um, is, is a sensory deprivation tank, um, and that it, it, uh, will block out all of the, the, the light and all the sound, and you just sort of sit on water. It's like very salty.

And, um, and, uh, what happens is without, without drugs, your brain starts to have these amazing visualizations that are, that are dreamlike, uh, or some people compare it to hallucinating with, with psychedelics.

But, um, but because your, your brain isn't, um, and, and, and one of the things that I do is, is, uh, yeah.

So if you, this, this can also happen if you can get into a room where you just block out 100% of the light, not even 1% of light can be there.

And you, and maybe, um, a blindfold as well, just to make sure that actually 0% of light is happening.

And then, and then, so then your visual cortex is free up to do other things.

And then you'll start to see things, and you'll start to visualize things, um, that you could because your brain, because your visual system was, was occupied.

Um, currently.

So, so in that sense, I think that, um, um, you can try that.

But, but, but, but yeah, but the idea is that, uh, we, um, are basically creating visual models or graphical models, um, in our brains.

And, um, and that, that's, uh, that's, that's a part, that's a piece of, of, of what's happening with, um, with, with neuroscience.

It's, it's leading to artificial, um, consciousness.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Thanks so much.

Like, um, that definitely, that definitely helps.

I'm definitely gonna try that out.

And nobody, nobody ever like, uh, mentioned that like that to me.

It was, it was one of the person that I talked to, uh, they had trouble, they had problems visualizing too.

And, um, I think they improved it some, but they said that, uh, they, their brain was like, was like too stressed that that, that was part of it.

That, uh, that you had to be like, kind of relaxed to visualize and it bring was kind of too, too stressed.

Um, so when, so when you said that, that could definitely, uh, be, be a case where it's like, you know, uh, it's overwhelmed right now.

Maybe, um, doing, you know, like doing these renders of like the phone and stuff like that in my environment.

But when I'm sleeping, it's not so that I'm able to.

Yeah.

And that, and that's what I was going to say before we get to down the yard.

Um, is that, you know, this is, this is one of the interesting things about the intersection between psychiatry and consciousness.

Where some will posit that psychiatric conditions actually result from a deficit in consciousness or the partial conscious experience.

Um, and one of the things that I do know with my work in psychiatry is that a lot of times trauma can hijack our sensory experience.

And specifically if you have complex PTSD, um, where there's a lot of sensory disturbances or, or I would say stress that impacts your sensory experience.

Sometimes, uh, you know, things can be hijacked, such as the ability to engage in voluntary, uh, sensory, uh, conjuring, uh, or imagery.

Um, and so that's just something I leave you with.

But, um, Don Yarra, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly.

Yeah, you're right.

Cool.

You're next.

Something, oh, um, if I could say one last thing, something, something, um, strange that happened to me one time, which had me feeling like, okay, it's more hope for me to visualize.

Was that it was a shaman that I talked to.

And so like, if I try to, if I try to think about memories and stuff like that, I can't see them, but I can kind of like, like remember them, but I can't see them.

And this shaman, they were able to see my memories for like, when I was younger and stuff like that. They're like, like, see like how my mom looks and all this other stuff like that.

And, and I'm like, like, hold on, how, how you can see my memories, but I can't, but that makes me feel like, okay, you know what, they're there.

I just don't got access to them. Um, but that, but I don't know, I think that's something with their consciousness.

Like their consciousness was on some type of level where they're able to look at people's, people's memories.

Oh, are we doing a Q&A session?

You're up, whatever your thoughts, you would like me to reset the room, I can do that. Otherwise, you can go for it.

Yeah, actually, the thing that you said about psychiatric, psychiatric conditions and problem of consciousness, you know, the more I deep dive into DSM,

the less makes sense. I mean, I can, for example, I work with data and it's, it's just not rigorous enough in some places or over detailed in other places to try to build a consistent model of a psychiatric condition, for example.

Also, the psychiatric physiology is kind of, you know, in the dumps right now. And I was wondering if there are other approaches to phenomena of psychosis or other disturbances.

Yeah, so that was first thing. And the second thing was about AI. And the problem of debugging AI, which is like next impossible if the neural network is complex enough or solves complex enough tasks.

And I was thinking that it's not impossible because you don't have technology, but because the model itself thinks about the world in an unexplainable way, like, for example, a recommender system.

We as a recommender system would recommend another article to a person based on, you know, my collection of the article, motions, etc., etc.

But it would come to my mind to think about it as a metrics of user IDs and page views, etc., etc. So I'm productive enough. I was thinking that the real AI debugger is some kind of psychotherapist in a way.

Because the system gets so complex. And actually, is it possible that we are spending too much time in understanding and replicating the systems that we find in ourselves,

instead of creating something that's what's working for, which is artificial, not copying ourselves, our internal machine. Yeah, thank you.

Great. I can definitely take the first part of that. Maybe, Micah, you can take the AI aspect of it. So I definitely agree with you about the way that we classify psychiatric disorders.

It's absolutely a need of reboot. In response to it, though, they are the NIH or NIH National Institutes of Mental Health in the U.S. It's taking great strides to toward that end. And so they came up with this thing called RDOC, which stands for Research Domain Criteria.

And essentially what they're trying to do is build an entire framework for how do you discuss psychiatric conditions, and it's meant for researchers and those who are applying for grants through NIH who are going to be extending psychiatric disorders

to classify and group their observations on a range of different criteria such as genetics, molecules, cells, circuitry, behavior, physiology, and self-report.

And what they are hoping to do with that is to pick out themes that are consistent across psychiatric disorders so that we could have more commonalities and common languages and motifs.

So, for example, we know that in schizophrenia, there is this pessimistic-like thinking. It's almost like very rigid, very pessimistic, very negative, and it's particularly observed in folks who have what's called negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

So everyone thinks of psychosis and schizophrenia as a person who's erratic and almost like a psychoactive state hallucinating and things like that.

There's another component to schizophrenia where the person is catatonic or sort of muted.

And so that's an example of a characteristic of schizophrenia that is also common in depression because depression at its hallmark is a pessimistic, rigid, negative thought process or cognitive process.

So the idea with RDoC is that, yes, you group it, that would be a behavioral grouping, but then the idea would be, for example, me as a depression researcher, I'm trying to understand the underlying molecular or cellular basis for this cognitive,

rigidity and negative self-thought or self-talk, I should say, whereas someone else who's studying schizophrenia and that component of schizophrenia who's also looking at the molecular and genetic basis,

the idea would be we should, if it's true that this is a fundamental property of the human affect and experience, that perhaps our independent studies or inquiries on this behavioral trait should converge.

And so it's their hope that we'd have what would emerge from our fundamental processes that we can group across the human condition. And then it's that way of looking at it that you could scale up and say, OK, wow, look at all of these emerging properties that may scope or landscape,

I'm sorry, what architect, what we call consciousness, for example. But yeah, I can leave it to Micah to discuss the AI component.

Holy fucking shit. Thank you. I mean, I was bothering each and every expert room on psychiatry for the last month of Clubhouse, and now the RDOC from the first looks like something that actually could work.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem.

Daniel, would you be willing to maybe paraphrase the highlights of your takeaway from what Sherrod said and also then rephrase the AI part of the questions?

To paraphrase what Sherrod said. Yeah? Yeah, in your own words. So I'm just curious to sort of what was the... I mean, there is a phenomenon which is observable, and then there is the DSM or whatever manual you can use,

and their labeling, and their labeling is essentially, is written with bias, like cultural bias or gender bias, and the criteria itself is not...

It doesn't really hold some test because there is comorbidity issue, et cetera, et cetera. So RDOC is a framework that could deconstruct those huge, longest constructs like schizophrenia or psychopathy or whatever,

and look at it at a more in-sync level, the level that's in-sync with biology and neuroscience, et cetera, et cetera, so that we could restructure it in a way that makes sense

and make models that are, you know, the definition of a good model is not how good it explains phenomena, but how good it can predict the phenomenon.

So yeah, Sherrod, if I'm wrong, please correct me.

That's right. And then what's the AI question? The AI question was about...

So, from what I understood, the conversation that goes about the AI unconsciousness is let's replicate some of the mechanics that we learn about ourselves into, you know, the AI model world,

and so yeah, the problem was that AI is really hard to debug. It's a black box, and yeah.

And at first I was really uncomfortable knowing that, but then it came to me like maybe it's not about its feature.

I mean, maybe we should not replicate exact mechanisms of our... I mean, QQT3 is good enough at this stage.

Yeah, I'm losing my train of thought. It's a day in my hands. It doesn't make sense.

All right, and so I guess part of what you were saying earlier was that it had huge scales.

There's some huge problems with neural networks when they're taking a lot of data, something like that.

I'm just trying to sort of like...

Okay, so I mean, you know, one of the issues I guess that you can look at with...

I'm just trying to see if I can narrow it down to something that was actually something that you asked instead of talking about general AI problems.

That's the only thing. So, I mean, I guess it could be general or this could be related to what you asked.

You know, there's the problem of overfitting when you have models that are just...

When you're dealing with so much freaking data into your AI model, it's just doing like a massive job.

And so then there's a number of techniques people use to deal with the errors that can result to overfitting type of errors or...

There's a lot of techniques you can use for...

I guess a word that comes up in this scenario is gradient descent and another idea that comes up is dropout.

And so there's a bunch of techniques that people are using with the current incarnation of deep learning neural networks.

When they get very large, there's sort of weird problems that come out.

But these problems won't go away with the current way that deep learning is done.

So what researchers are working on are new architectures for how to design an artificial neural network.

And so this is like the future beyond deep learning neural networks, I guess.

You know, you hear some people talking about like a self-supervised network.

And that's an example of some new things that people are trying to change the traditional deep learning neural network to.

You know, self-supervised network, transformer networks, you hear that term.

There's something, Jeffrey Hinton is doing something called a capital neural networks.

And then, I'm sorry, there's a new one that he's working on called...

I forget what it is, it's not game, but it's like, capital was like 2017 and then he's got a new one.

It starts with the G. And I bet if I look it up that I could find it real quick.

There's also, you know, Numenta has some really interesting ideas that involve basically creating artificial neural columns.

I guess it's similar to the capital's idea.

And these, so with a traditional neural network, you have this like, you know, it's called narrow...

What?

You're covering your mic.

Okay, so with a traditional...

I think you're good now.

With a traditional neural network, people refer to it as narrow AI because you can basically, you can train it one way.

For example, a convolutional neural network, the ideal one might have just...

It might only be trained on 256 by 256 resolution images.

Or you could do another one that's on 1024 by 1024 resolution images.

Or you could do another one that's like a high resolution.

But you can't have the traditional one, you couldn't have it do all three different scales of resolution.

It wasn't general enough to do any scale of resolution and be able to process that.

And so some of the new models are like, well, hey, wait a second.

What if we had three different neural networks that were all trained on these different kinds of different resolutions?

And what happened is when you get an image to the first layer, it routes it to...

It recognizes, oh, this is 256 by 256.

I'm going to route this to the part of the neural network that specializes in processing 256 by 256 images.

So now you get new incoming data that could be...

Yeah, so the next step you're on this is maybe you'll get new incoming data that is at a resolution you've never seen before.

And the neural network is going to sort of be able to generalize,

generalize or parcel out that new resolution to parts of its network that are going to be as close as possible

and capability to processing that new information at a resolution it's never learned before.

And so this comes about because of concepts like modules or neural columns or capsules.

And it's the idea that in our brains, we also have neural columns and we have microcolons and we have neural circuits

and different scales of things happening where stuff comes to our incoming senses and it goes to our V1 and it goes to our V2

and it goes to all the other layers of the visual cortex and all the layers of the somatosensory cortex

and all the layers of the audio cortex and then it cycles back to the thalamus

and it's really fantastic all the different ways that information travels.

But it's sort of like...

It's so much more complex than the simple idea that is very commonplace in neuroscience

and also in machine learning that learning something is sort of like a hierarchical process.

I mean there's a hierarchical process of learning but there's so much more beyond just that one concept to learning.

And so what I think I see happening is I see that a lot of the new ideas of people understanding

that is coming from 100 plus years of neuroscience but it's not like these ideas are totally new

but there's a lot of like sort of like a continual flow of learning that comes from neuroscience

that is making its way into new architectures for deep learning.

So some of the problems that we're having with deep learning today that you're probably hearing about in AI groups

there's mitigation approaches where they're doing things like dropout and gradient descent

and different sort of techniques to deal with overfitting

and then there's just new architectures that are designed to basically be general learning algorithms

by parsing out different sorts of learning capabilities to different parts of the network.

So you could have sort of a specialization happening sort of.

There's so many different ways to like, yeah I should stop there because I was just going to say that for everything that I can say

someone can come back with a counter argument.

Don't stop yourself.

Go on, go on.

I guess a question I have is in AI, you know how there's this new interview process called higher view

where they use AI to like analyze people's faces and try to like find like attributes of like the performance of the person.

How are these systems that are being made in AI being moderated when things like neurotransmitters

and their application within how they work with neural networks.

How neurotransmitters are kind of in a sense being left out a little bit from the network.

I wanted to say something.

I heard it in another room in Clubhouse about somebody that they worked in the government

but they said that they're also, that they're using people's phone data.

It's like that too.

That's like where things are going through.

There's probably a part of it too, like what you're saying, but some of it is like, okay, what are they looking at on YouTube?

What are they searching up online?

What are they buying?

Or even the other parts of it where they say that like, you know, seven apps are recording people talk and they're using all that information and that they're making out a part of the process too.

Oh, wait, they're collecting pre-recorded data?

Is that what you're saying?

Yeah, like they're using a lot of that stuff like what you comment on Facebook, what you try to see, like okay, we want this type of person.

If they say this type of thing or if somebody is heavy and say somebody's assistant, one president or something like that or whatever and the company doesn't want them, it's like you probably won't get paid for that.

They're trying to stop that or they're trying to fix things about it so they get more fair because they don't think that that's fair.

But if they set that up, that would happen.

Hey guys.

Thanks for bringing me up on the stage.

Sherrod, I heard you speak in another room a few hours ago.

Are you there? Can I ask you a question? Is it regarding neuroscience and I just wanted to ask you, is he here by the way?

Yeah, no, I'm here.

So, you know, I have a question about...

Wait, hold on. I just want to make sure, because I did read where you're done speaking, I just wanted to make sure you didn't cut her off.

Um, I, for the most, for the most kind of, I do have a few more questions about AI, but I'll let you go ahead.

No, so sorry, I didn't know if, go ahead, please, I want the things to go in order, so I don't want it to stop playing bad. Please go ahead.

Yeah, and whoever wanted to respond to what Rick was saying, then, yeah, we can go ahead.

Yeah, I guess how it just, if anybody knows how to kind of discuss this issue, and that it's had an AI on it, because higher view is a very widespread these interview process.

I was interviewed by it recently from a certain company, and there's a lot of moral implications to having robotics and AI process a person's facial gestures or body gestures, and would be interested in knowing people's thoughts on that.

I think that they are not actually processing your reactions or something, but calculating the probability that you will, how many months that you will last, and if you will, if you will fit the company like that, as far as I know.

Can I respond to that if nobody else is going?

Okay.

Okay, so I'm just going to quickly try to answer this. I feel like the current state of AI is not there.

You know, it seems like, to be honest, a slightly hyped as well, because all it's doing is taking all that data, and it doesn't know what's happening in a scene or a frame of pictures like a human brain does, like a human brain reasons.

So it's just ingesting that data and trying to label that sort of a data. Now, I mean, it could mislabel certain things.

Like if you show some emotion, and it records it, even with the facial muscles and all that, I mean, you could be responding to something like the context, you know, the thing with computers is they don't get the context like humans do.

So I think it's still not a foolproof system.

I think I might have something to add to Red's question. So Red asked also about neurotransmitters, and the question was sort of like, well, AI is not really doing anything with neurotransmitters at this point, and that's true.

But I think if it did, I think that if a neural network was going to process the reception of transmitters, that's sort of like what you say, well, the way I have to think about it, and I guess other people could think about this differently,

is that a neurotransmitter would have to be, it's like, that is the input information. You'd have to reduce it into some sort of, you know, like you can input an image or you can input sound, and then it gets reduced to, it gets chopped into, basically, it's presented to the first layer of the neural network.

And so at that point, the neurotransmitter is reduced to a signal, right? And so the signal has, what are the properties of that signal? Does the neurotransmitter, when it intersects with the receptors, like an NDMA receptor in the brain when it's received by a receptor,

is it causing a very specific temporal spatial pattern that can be quantified into, you know, ones and zeros? And if so, I mean, I think that sounds plausible, but then you could have a deep learning neural network process neurotransmitters.

And maybe the brain is doing something like that, where the neurotransmitter, in some sense, represents a signal pattern that could be translated to ones and zeros for a computer, but the brain is taking, you know, temporal spatial frequencies somehow,

and that's part of the super low level calculation, right? And I mean, there's a ton to that topic. I don't know if Sherry wants to talk about neurotransmitters a little bit, but in terms of neural networks, yeah, that would just be an input.

And then whether you're training with neural networks, if training the neural network on neurotransmitters in the first place, then you could send it new neurotransmitters and it would be able to recognize what it's being received,

or if it received something it's never seen before, it would be able to generalize what that could be. I'll just go ahead and pause there.

But aren't we saying that, sorry, Daniel, go ahead.

Oh, thank you. But isn't monoamine or neurotransmitter like hypothesis for depression or other conditions like outdated and for the main part because neurotransmitters are like a,

when you untangle them, when you pull this string, there is always something that's tingling on the other side, but you cannot actually predict it.

Like dopamine, it's responsible for so many fundamental things and conditions that you just cannot predict what will be the result, the effect, like dopamine, its restless legs, its tinnitus, its Parkinson's,

it's, yeah.

Yeah, so I think that this raises good question on whether AI could ever possibly reach the point of being technically, quote unquote, human consciousness.

If that makes sense, at least like a mapping out like a neural network to match human consciousness would not necessarily be quite it.

Yeah.

Yeah. And to read point I want to add quickly. I think I was after Daniel was quickly wanted to add this is how does the like, you know how the brain has recursive thoughts, meaning, you know, I can think what red is thinking, and then I can think what,

you know, and then I can think like the meta thinking process like thinking about thinking. To me, sometimes it feels like that's like the, that's like the seed of consciousness in humans like they can think about thinking, you know, and more levels deeper down.

I am really not sure how that happens in a learning or a machine learning system, where you are, you're statistically curve fitting, you know, within within within some data.

And so, so that's where I feel like there is more to the, at least the human intelligence part, which I think the neuroscientist in this room can talk more about. But you know, even reasoning, and even say, reasoning by analogy, you know, like,

you know, like, comparing two things like a cookie to a child who's a cookie monster, like us, like what will be the relative size of a, of a, like a normal size cookie would be nothing would, you know, they will, for them, the large size cookies something

different, you know, if they, you know, so that's sort of like reasoning by analogy. I don't know if the system can do that. Yeah, it can label data very effectively. But, you know, other cognitive abilities of reasoning, like, even knowing what's happening in a, in a,

like, you know, there's a good example, I think one of those researchers did this example, and I'm just going to tell this example is, you know, when we give images to the system to a CN convolution neural network, like multiple images of like

millions of images of a cat or a dog. And next time it sees it's in some configuration, it kind of gets this is a cat, this is a dog. But if you give a picture where say dog is holding a dumbbell, you know, the system completely breaks down, it's very fragile,

whereas a human mind is very robust in that way, because, you know, we know knowledge of physics and biology, and we totally get it that that that's a fake picture, you know. So like, you know, there's some work out there in the

adversarial networks, I think you guys are already familiar with it. But I think that's, that's, that's also a problem to solve before we can get, get even to consciousness. I might be wrong though.

Great. I believe, author, author Ian, did you have a question? Yes, it was not too dissimilar from Tarun. So if I may just link to that and we ask it together, could that be possible?

Sure. Don't worry. So I'm, I'm writing science fiction fantasy, I'm Ian Lehi, hello to everybody in your relative time zone, and good morning to Midley. And my question would be, do you believe that consciousness is an emergent quality, so we just, you know, lump together enough neurons and it will reach a certain level of complexity, through which we will get

consciousness. And so if we have a human AI, we give it just always give it human like training, or do we need specific structures, we need mirror neurons, we need something is a restructure, which now we think is the motor of consciousness, the same way mirror neurons are as, as

you said, we're responsible for guessing what somebody else is thinking. I'm interested because you write about this stuff. Thank you. Sure. I think Mike and I may have slightly different definitions for it, but my definition of consciousness and again, I guess we should

first be clear about what do we mean by consciousness and I think in the original conception of this room, who that moderator is not here, but it was the awareness of one's perceptual experience, more or less. And so there are degrees of consciousness and I think a lot of times, through

the popular psychology and popular science, we ascribe consciousness as sort of, we think of a higher order nature of consciousness, which is involved concepts like theory of mind, the ability to, to what another is thinking feeling how they're going to act planning for those types of behavioral

engagements and things like that. But in my definition as a behavioral neuroscientist and as an effective neuroscientist who studies psychiatric disorders, I have constrained my definition to a very simple one, which is basically the inner subjective

experience of physiological changes within the body. And that involves not only just the central nervous system, but also the peripheral nervous system, also the immune system. And so all of that, that that confluence of all of those factors happening at the same time.

What that feels like at any given moment is a state of consciousness for me. And so to answer the other part of your question, what are the components that would make up such a definition of consciousness, it would involve everything that comprises of the

physiological system. So it's going to be the genes, the molecules, the neurons, the ensembles of neurons, the clusters of regions of neurons, the neuronal communication by which information is relayed throughout the brain, the

interface of the brain with the blood in the vascular system, as well as the new markers that make up. And we see, as we begin to allow that definition to come into place, I can think of many examples where a person's consciousness is altered by way of things that

are happening within their body. And so we can look at something that has been explored a lot, which is the context of anesthesia. So a person who goes under generalized anesthesia, as we know, can go in and out of consciousness.

And so the question is, okay, well, using my definition of consciousness, what is involved with bringing a person in and out of consciousness? Well, it all depends on the level at which we want to discuss.

And I think, you know, as I said earlier in the room, I think when we talk about consciousness, a, everyone has their interpretation, and it's their lived experience and intuition. But it also is people have different levels of tolerance to the

minutiae and the painstaking details that architect the conscious state. And so some people may have a bias toward a more colored, like a spiritual lens or a favor that mysticism component of consciousness, which is absolutely

there, whereas others of us may prefer, okay, what are the fundamental components? Is it genes? Is it a part of the brain? Where does consciousness lie? And so I think that that is why this room was originally created to have people with their different

orientations to come in and converse about what our theory or what we think it might be. And so I hope I answered your question, but I feel free to clarify.

Ian, I also would like love to recommend there's this professor at NYU. His name is David Chalmers. He's a neurophilosopher. You should check out his experiment, his thought experiment on something called fading

glia, as well as he has other related thought experiments that basically explore how or whether a robot's consciousness could work like a humans and the issues that would present themselves. So if you're interested in checking that out.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I cut you off, right? Okay. Okay. In a similar kind of vein. So like within schizophrenia, a lot of people have considered the possibility that like schizophrenia is like a disorder of consciousness

because like it alters our perception, our awareness and our thoughts, right? So they think it's like schizophrenia is like a disorder of consciousness. And I think that within schizophrenia itself, it parallels the development of human language.

So when the Fox P2 genes are to mutate and we start to be able to talk in a wide variety of languages to develop phenoms and so forth, schizophrenia start to develop at the same time too. And there's been like a gene drive. If you look at genome my association studies, there's been a gene drive of over 200 genes associated with

schizophrenia and there's high comorbidity, comorbidity of schizophrenia with like Parkinson's with autism and so many other disorders. And I think it's interesting because like within that field too of schizophrenia, some people believe that it's like a byproduct of language

and consciousness. And that's why it's like, if you look at people who have schizophrenia, their synapses do not prove normally. And some of them are much more hyper excitable. Even like the glial cells do not do not like we have to take certain

types of schizophrenia. There's like dopamine dysfunction within schizophrenia too. So that I think it's very interesting if you wanted to like look more into that as like a possible reason why how consciousness emerged by looking at the opposite of when people don't have it too.

So yeah, I'm done speaking. My name is Julia.

Yeah, that's great. And I think that, you know, that's one of the things with G while studies is that you can only really kind of look at correlation can't really get a lot of causation from it. But yeah, it's a lot of interesting research coming out of schizophrenia research fields.

And I think this is sort of popcorn style, you guys. So feel free to just discuss everyone can just kind of try.

One of the reasons I invited Sandra up was because he's got the background in deep reinforcement learning and I thought he would be useful. He's the boss. Yeah, I thought he might like to answer some of your questions.

So that's why I brought him. That's why I invited him. Hello guys, I was just waking up having a breakfast. So I tried to listen to chime in. It's really interesting talk. If I have anything to add, I'll definitely add.

But currently, I don't know how can I help and I'm not expert in neuroscience, but I'm really interested in. So yeah, keep going on.

It would be interesting to hear just kind of what you sort of do and what you focus in. Yeah.

Yeah, sure. So I'm really interested and inspired about automation and specifically collaborative AI. What is the collaborative AI is basically designing algorithms that can adapt to the humans behavior and basically assist humans in decision making.

For example, you can have robots in the manufacturing industry, like in a plant fabric, fabrication plant, sorry. And basically the humans will make some kind of decisions and according to those decisions, the robots will adjust, adapt and act accordingly to maximize the common shared goal.

And that is the, I would say the definition of cooperation or collaboration. And that can be applied in a large scale systems. For example, cars, imagine you have millions of cars around the city.

I believe, I hope to believe that in the future, when the autonomous driving will be prevalent and ubiquitous, we're going to have a systems like decentralized or centralized systems for controlling the cars in a very cooperative manner.

Basically, using every possible car in such a way to minimize the total carbon footprint on the city or on the country level, because you can minimize the amount of like a useless travel between points when there is another car that can do that stuff.

And basically, all of those are non polynomial hard problems that cannot be solved by human currently. But I'm currently doing a research that shows that reinforcement learning has a very big potential to beat any human created algorithm, like five times 10 times currently.

Yeah, so I'm really excited about that field.

I guess I wanted to maybe offer something to Ian's question from earlier. So I do. So as Sharon pointed out, I do have a different sort of idea in my mind as to what consciousness could be.

And so I would maybe just describe it as if you I don't know if you're sitting in a room or if you're sitting outside right now or standing. 

# And I would just say like if you if you consider all of the all the contents of your of your thought workspace, right?

What are all the objects that are there in the in the room with you or are there tables and chairs or there are their boxes and and phones and mirrors and TVs and bottles and I'm just sort of describing my environment a little bit.

But the point is that amazing. That's a coincidence.

And maybe I was general enough that so I think that I imagine that that all of these things are there, they're three their models, there are models that are, I guess, in some sense, the renderings, if your mind is a computational system.

But they're also maybe at the root of it, they're they're just tempo and spatial patterns. And maybe all of it together is like the whole consciousness is like is like is like a is like a big collection of temple spatial patterns.

And some of them are modeled by your visual cortex and some of them are modeled by your your somatosensory cortex and your audio cortex and your prefrontal cortex.

Your front your frontal lobes, your your your post parietal. I mean, like what I'm saying is like, like, like, imagine that everything that you're that is your life experience from yourself to your feelings.

They're all basically four dimensional temporal and spatial patterns.

And and so they all have like, like, even like everything from a feeling to a touch to something that you hear, maybe maybe there's a there's a position in space for that, like, maybe there's a peak moment for every emotion for every case.

There's a there's a peak to it. There's a there's a low moment. There's a moment when it when it's what it's high as a moment when it fades.

There's a moment when it's in front of you in front of your experience within you behind you in the past. There's there's all these like spatial characteristics to basically every, every possible thought and sensation that a person can have.

Everything is temporal spatial patterns on some level. And so what I'm thinking is that is that is that so the conscious experience is like basically a bunch of interlinked models or temporal spatial patterns.

And and yeah, you can you can you can have you can take some drug like anesthesia and it decouples the interlinking between all these patterns and that that global experience goes away.

Right. But in order to get to an artificial consciousness, we'd have to be able to to, I think, basically have a lot of different interlinked systems that are sort of like able to talk to each other and share the same language and

basically each of them is modeling a different part of your experience and they're able to model it together in a way that makes sense. And that that's that goes far beyond anything that we're doing in in neural networking right now.

But but but yeah, but it's but it's it's interesting because it is. I was just thinking about what Sandra was saying that there is in some sense we have to you'd have to have the ability for neural networks to cooperate.

That's a big part of it. You can you get there's David Igaman said that you can think of the brain is like a cooperative as a cooperation of rivals.

I think that's what he said. He might have said something different.

But yeah, like so imagine like a cooperation of like your brain is there. They're each trying to do their own thing, but they're cooperating together.

And and then then you get you out of that somehow.

So you're telling me an architectural approach anyway, I need a structure that looks like a human brain.

Well, I so just to address your question more specifically, I think that it could be a virtual but that the the the the substrate of the human brain certainly helps facilitate the consciousness.

But but I think that it doesn't have to be in the shape of the human brain. No.

Okay, thank you.

So from your definition of the consciousness that I heard, maybe I don't know if it's correct, please correct me if I'm wrong.

So the summarization for to say this basically consciousness is your inner for the representation of your environment in the temporal representation and spatial.

And basically, you are mapping your environment and everything that happened with you before as a as an images the patterns inside of you.

But I would add to that is not only that but also how do you actually react to those representations that makes you conscious.

Because everyone everyone has their own mappings of the reality of the representations among around them to themselves.

However, they have a very different actions basically patterns of reaction to the events that is happening around them.

So that is really reminiscent of reinforcement learning in a way that a different agents basically different brains can occur and become in the same states basically spatial temporal representations.

However, they will have completely different actions and behaviors depending on those representations.

And I would say your pattern of behavior and pattern of reaction to those events and to those environment representations is a big part of consciousness without it.

I don't think we can we can disentangle them in a way that I mean because people don't have a same patterns and representations like everyone has something different in their way.

They perceive the reality and consequently the way they react to that reality.

I agree with that by the way that's perfectly well said.

I agree too.

I'm interested in what you're talking about regarding this 4D idea of mapping the brain temporarily and spatially.

So I imagine almost having the neurons and somehow if possible because we don't know if it seems very impossible having the neurotransmitters and hormones and getting those mapped temporally as well as spatially.

In terms of like just like basically getting mathematical analyses of their processes that I wonder this is a this is a really big this isn't.

I'm not going to call it a reach but the way in the way that space time is like four dimensional in terms of like Einstein's theories.

There's this sort of intrinsic depth that could that is within the universe that is as great within the brain.

Yeah.

Okay I'll just go really quick. Well in terms of mapping there's a lot of like maps already within our brain like for right now topic tonotopic right somatotopic for all the somatosensory visual and auditory and so forth.

There are like maps that like predict such and there's also like a lot of studies within neuroscience to show that like they can they can predict like when an actual potential fire within a neuron just from like long term potential

Potentiation at long term depression studies to like reinforce certain behaviors or like to predict like how a person will react on a subconscious like there's like a Wisconsin card sorting task to predict like how people can be able to like predict.

Like certain like if the task let's say was like we want you to group these cards by color versus by shapes.

And they're like what is going on at this task like what is the experimental doing like people are able to subconsciously pick up like like cues or like the pattern way before they can explicitly say what's going on and they.

Like yeah so they've done this with poker games and like a lot of different types of subconscious tests like we we pick up a lot patterns faster than we can like consciously articulate so forth so I do.

I'm not too sure what your question is but I think it's like already been done and like the 40 mapping part.

Oh no I mean I mean they're like the full like full consciousness.

Once we're able to get to that point of mapping consciousness if possible.

It is still a question whether it is possible.

I do think it is possible to figure out the correlates like the neural correlates of consciousness.

So I do wonder on whether it's possible to map out the sort of what's what's the explanatory gap explanation of consciousness like of what it looks like to exist or what it what it looks like to be a human kind of.

Written out mathematically and in scientific notation and I guess what theoretical framework would inform.

Assertion that there is a neurological or a neural correlate to consciousness versus it being versus consciousness being an emergent property of all of these constitutive.

Processes so I guess I'd be curious to know if there was a theoretical framework that made that assertion I would love to read it.

I wanted to know like what Nick was saying with like the the rendering of objects and stuff like that and everything. So like what do you think about like when people's consciousness when they die or like when they have out of body experiences like what you saying that are you saying that like you like you know like you would still be conscious after you die or like if you have an out of body experience you're really out of body it's not just something your brain is making up.

Well my the idea that I favor or lean towards is that the is that your brain activity is necessary for you to imagine that you're floating above your head.

I just sort of favor that theory. I don't want to get another people's faces and tell them that they're wrong but that's sort of what I think.

Oh OK got it. One thing I think you know on this topic of neural correlates of consciousness that's a challenge with the idea that there's some NCC type neurons to be found is it's a little bit like if you imagine the consciousness is something like the operating system running on a computer.

The brain is the hardware. It's the CPU with all the transfer circuits and all the logic circuits and you have an operating you have just like the CPU is operating. You've got neural activity and then on top of that you've got some kind of structured dynamic on top of that neural

activity which is like the operating system and imagine you had some some virtual reality program again with the computer metaphor running on top of that operating system and that virtual reality that we're living inside is something

that you can analyze and you say I want to understand where consciousness is in the computer. You know I want to understand where virtual reality is where is virtual reality in the computer.

So your scientists and you've got this computer that you can analyze and you say well what is the transistor correlate of virtual reality. You know when the virtual reality system is running which transistors are active and how are they active.

We forgot how virtual reality works by like looking at the transistors. It might be that we're kind of looking at the wrong level that what consciousness is something to do with how the processing is structured not which neurons are doing something.

So I'm going to add in regards to out of body experiences. There's a particular region of the brain that seems to have a strong link to the creation of out of body experiences particularly.

It's called the temporal parietal junction or the TPJ and TPJ has it's kind of a place where connections related to the mirror neuron system and the sense of and theory of mind and this region for some reason has some sort of correlation to out of body experiences

and it's been found that when this region is stimulated with electromagnetic stimulation that it can actually spontaneously invoke spontaneously isn't the right word here my bad they can it can the out of body experiences can be invoked with stimulation of the TPJ.

So it's something that can be kind of like summoned with external stimulus.

Oh I just wanted to add really quick that what Fransy pointed out was a good point because they always show that the TPJ is like involved with the Olympic system and like when they use like TMS like deep TMS to like simulate the TPJ and so forth like people do get an out of body experience.

I also want to point out like whoever someone earlier on talked about people who like go in and out conscious or were in coma. There's like it's actually interesting because there's like one person I've had who's like he he has very kind of not wild but I guess like an orthodox or an mainstream ideas about this because that's like his field of research.

His name is Dr. Stuart Younger if you guys want to read up what he writes because I don't want to like speak on his like work and so forth because it's a little bit.

I guess it's like worth the read I guess so yeah.

Maybe if I could say something that might be a little bit interesting I don't know how interesting I'll keep it short but so going back to the idea that the brain is rendering our reality is like a 3D model rendered inside a computer.

So I had a friend who who's who smoked DMT one time and he was inside a room that was like eight feet by eight feet and all of a sudden the the walls of the room expanded and he was inside this warehouse where to his left and to his right like.

There was not it's not a fight not an eight by eight space anymore it was not like infinite space to the left and infinite space to the right and the 3D model of the room basically changed.

And so going going back to like if your brain is making a 3D model then I guess if you if you have an altered brain state that's that's weird enough you could imagine yourself floating above yourself.

# Near Death Experiences

And so that's why I think it's it's it comes down to like if we have 3D models in our brain that might might be a way of explaining the near death experiences that people have in a computational way.

So I actually have this disorder I don't know.

A lot of people haven't heard about this but it's called depersonalization realization disorder.

And I actually have it and I've had it for four years and it's this sort of experience.

Do you still have it where it feels like oh yeah yeah it feels like you are asleep while you're awake.

If that makes sense so it feels like you're stuck in a dream or asleep in your waking day state.

And when I first got it I actually couldn't differentiate between like being asleep and awake because everything felt endless in this day and for like days and days and days.

In the beginning I also had blind sight which is considered for vision for vision blind sight is like when everything looks it looks like you can't see anything so everything's black.

But your eyes are still somehow kind of able to see and navigate you which is really confusing because I was able to like walk where I wanted to but I couldn't see.

So that's that's actually just as an example often in what what like almost like unconscious visual processing would look like.

What's your current situation. Wait. Oh what's my current.

So I have my vision. I have at least like I don't have blind sight but I still have yet like very strange experiences with my relationship with space.

And like visually mostly like visually but also bodily processing myself being in space.

So it's like my like if I'm walking outside on a warm day it feels like I'm floating or if I'm driving like it just feels like my I'm not in my body existing.

It sounds pretty distracting. No it's yeah it's very it's very invasive.

So it's like actually I think like one percent of the population might have the disorder I need to look more into the effort that described as sort of feeling like you're not really there.

Yeah. Yeah. So it's I think that it could be used though as something to look at to understand consciousness further and study perceptual study within also like having your eyes on the perceptual differences.

It's interesting. I had it happen a couple of times to me where I just had a brief experience where I felt like I wasn't actually situated in my body.

And one of them I was actually at a job and interviewing a candidate.

And so I had this person across the desk for me that I'm holding a conversation with.

And suddenly it felt like I was like pulling back and I was looking at the room from like the upper left corner of the room and looking down on the situation and kind of seeing myself in the room with this other person.

And meanwhile I'm still conducting an interview and I'm like trying to focus like OK focus focus but it was very strange spatial experience while this you know engagement was going on.

I was happy when the interview was finally over and I could kind of collect myself and it kind of snapped away after an hour or so.

Are you sure they didn't drug you Paul. Yeah.

It's not a drug. I kind of know about that. It kind of it kind of sounds like something that's called your astro vision.

And sometimes it happens to people like when I was younger or whatever like that I would be sleeping and I would wake I would wake up like in the middle of the night or something like that.

I sometimes early in the morning but I'm not it's like I'm up but I'm not really up still. I'm more so sleep but I can see from like a bird's eye view myself on the bed.

Or sometimes I just had this awareness and it's like it's like my body my body is still like I can't move my body but I'm conscious still and I'm not looking through my eyes.

I have a different type of vision. Yes. I've heard it.

I've heard it defined. Sorry. Go ahead. I was just going to say that Paul it seems like you your perception switched and you tap into your astro vision stuff like drugs can help that happen but it's a natural thing and it doesn't have to take a drug and stimulate your mind at something.

You know it's like you tap into something. Yeah. I want to take those kind of experiences. Oh go ahead Julia. Oh I just said I wanted to go after Roberta because I think Roberta was alive.

I was just going to say I've heard it defined as just a deformation of your body map at the map that your brain is making of the boundaries of your body getting deformed temporarily.

Yeah. It's similar to like people. I think somebody kind of mentioned something like this earlier. It's kind of similar to like in the hospital. You know how people are conscious right.

But differently we thought they're like this person. Yeah. I mean I don't know. You know she can just eat but it's like they are conscious though. So it's like a similar thing like that.

I just want to ask like two questions really quick. Were both of them on like kind of mean hallucinogens were marijuana when this happened and second were they under stress when this depersonalization occurred.

For me it was just a normal situation. I would so for me it actually it was a weed edible that triggered me into getting it. And then it kind of stayed around after that left.

Yeah. But I do know. So I actually I know like one other person that got it from weed. I know another person that got it from like it from acid. And then I know I know somebody that has it from like complex PTSD from when they were a kid.

Yeah. There's like actually. Yeah. There's like this. I have a psychiatrist run that like tells me that he has a lot of kids that come to him that have derealization from their like PTSD experiences because they almost like turn.

It's like going in like you know how like there's self defense mechanism. Yeah. I know.

And then like. So I think that the fact that this is possible. It's it's pretty consistent with the current neuroscience theories of perception, which is that it's not that sensory information is sort of flowing upstream and just being summarized by the brain.

That's not how perception works that rather the brain is generating a coherent model of the world. A point of view is generating a point of view. And the reason you feel like you're in your body is because all your information is coming in from that same point of view.

You know visions coming in through your eyes or to your head. So you feel like you're often located in your head. But it's just sensory information coming into the brain. The brain is trying to make sense of it and creating a model that will make sense of that.

And that model has a point of view, which is you at the center looking out. But that model, it doesn't have to be that particular model. The brain could construct a different model.

And if you have enough awareness space so that you know when you move around a room, for example, you still understand the structure of the room, you can understand the room for the point different point of view.

That model, the brain could have just generated a different model that has the point of view situated somewhere else and the sensory information is still coming in and that model is being updated based on that sensory information.

So the experience of the room or the situation is still, you know, you're still having a conscious experience of the situation. You're just experiencing it from a point of view that's different than the usual one.

The field detached from your embodied position.

I think consciousness is independent of the brain. Like you were conscious before you were born. You're still conscious now. And then when the body goes on, your consciousness still lives.

So like when you're saying what you're saying, Paul, for me, I can see it in a way where it's like that's the case, but because consciousness is, it's not about the brain.

It's not like once the brain goes on, the consciousness ends. To me, it's almost like, this is the best example, but consciousness is like Wi-Fi that's going to always be there.

And then our brain is like the computers or something like that that's tapping into the Wi-Fi. But if the computer or like when your phone battery dies and your phone is tapping to the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi is still there, but you can't experience anymore.

That would be a pretty different view of consciousness that consciousness is some fundamental force out there. The brain is like an antenna tapping into it. There's probably a pretty different view from at least what's in neuroscience, which is that consciousness is a product of neural activity of the brain,

which seems pretty consistent with when you disrupt the neural activity of the brain and change its consciousness. You apply general anesthesia or you stimulate different parts of the brain that actually changes the conscious experience.

So that would be consistent with the idea that consciousness is a result of brain activity, but some people do have this view that consciousness is something else and brain activity is somehow adjacent to it and kind of tapping into it, but that's a pretty different metaphysical view.

Oh, I just wanted to give a spawn really quick to read because I think so within depersonalization disorder and the PTSD part and then within my own research within schizophrenia and so forth, there's a marijuana actually activates certain

schizophrenic gene and actually it also seems to bring about the depersonalization symptoms that you've talked about, and also ketamine does the same thing for both. And also within the PTSD part, it's actually interesting because I think that there's a lot of studies that have shown

this that like people when they're under high duress, they undergo this like the floating out of body experience and it's like a weird self protective mechanism like certain triggers that will activate this because their body does not know how to it's like flight flight fight and freeze

like in a freeze response and then the out of body experience comes out of it. And so I personally there's this. I just finished reading this really good book. It's called the body keeps a score and it's by Dr. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

And then there's like this one section that says like a lot of psychiatric disorders come about because it's a form of self protective mechanisms so PTSD is like one of them because you have the triggers like get out of that situation. And then I think when you take these certain drugs like it activates

like the endo cannabinoid perceptors with allies for like with this schizophrenia and depersonalization disorder and it activates like these triggers that's like, okay, like you're in a stressed out situation because your body doesn't know how to handle these new new newer

neurotransmitters that like aren't usually there and so forth. So yeah, just like putting out there like they might you might have this experience a lot over and over again and like stress will definitely bring it about. Yeah. Whoa. So there's this article in American Journal of Psychiatry 2018 cannabis induced

to personalization, derealization disorder. It's like, it's whoa. Yeah, so just putting up. Yeah. You know, PTSD. Yeah, PTSD would be, I think, sort of a slightly different situation but similar maybe effect. You could imagine that, you know, the brain constructs a sense of self, you know, the ego and the ego is, you know, has this function of trying to further its

survival and kind of organize its understanding of the world and behavior to optimize for survival and protect itself. And so the ego, the sort of self that's constructed in the brain is serving that function. And then under a situation of severe trauma, you know, the sensory

information is just, you know, very traumatizing to that sense of self and threatening to it. And one strategy for and creates a lot of, you know, moral suffering or suffering, I guess would be the term. And that one way of breaking that, you know, getting protection

is to reorganize, let's say, the neural activity flow of information. So that sensory information is flowing into some different thing and is not being incorporated into that sense of self that is being threatened. And it's a way of, you know, perhaps escaping the feeling of pain and suffering

by essentially partitioning consciousness so that you're cutting the sense of self off from where all the sensation is happening.

Can I jump in, Paul? Sure. So the, because I hear a lot of people referring to ways of using drugs to stimulate the switch. But you're talking a lot about self induced. And if you do more, if you go deeper into research on self organization, and you can actually

also start triggering that effect of having these astral experiences. And to start making sense of something that didn't make sense in my worldview, I start using a metaphor from thermodynamics to give it language. So, you know, the idea of artificial vacuum.

It's something that happens very rarely on earth. But we actually have made ways to really create it like our engines. And I kind of believe that using drugs is like creating an engine where you actually really use the artificial vacuum.

So, but there may be situations where you can have this astral experience in a very natural way as well. So the way I like to look at the brains as unconsciousness is that it is a little bit like an artificial vacuum.

It's pretty rare on earth. But if you probably get out of a certain field, like in our case, for the artificial vacuum, it's the gravity of the earth that makes it quite impossible to have that situation. But if you go out of that field, you actually get into a space where it's the default.

So I think there's something similar happening with our ego experience of consciousness and the astral experience of consciousness. But I'm trying to figure it out purely from cybernetics and self-organizing systems and thermodynamics.

So that's the stuff I'm working on. And the thing is, I've been in that situation for like not a few minutes, but weeks and months on the edge, because I was refusing to accept anything spiritual. And it's only when I start accepting that spiritual and I connected to self with that that everything starts becoming normal again.

And don't speak in mixer. I had actually another question for Red, if you're open to talking more about your experience. I'm sure, yeah.

So, so you have this feeling that you're, you're sort of not really there, or that, you know, what's happening is something. Does it feel like it's happening to someone else or?

Kind of what? Yeah. It just feels like it's, it feels like it's happening to everything, if that makes sense. So almost like self-removal. Like, I don't think logically, like, that I'm not conscious if that makes sense.

Or that, logically, I'm aware that I'm awake.

But like, you're able to drive a car. Do you feel like you're watching yourself driving the car? Or do you feel like you're sort of there present?

It feels like I'm asleep. Like, that's the best way to describe it is literally the, like, the phenomenological feeling or what it is like to be asleep, which is very difficult to, it's really tricky to explain.

Almost mixed with this, oops, go ahead. Sorry.

Oh, it's asked, what does it feel like when you wake up in the morning?

Um, it feels like I'm like, now I'm at a point that I'm almost like at this weird sort of 40 to 50% kind of like having slightly gotten back to feeling just a little bit more normal.

Um, because I've had it for like four years now.

Um, so I feel like there's almost, I feel almost like just like half usual, half in terms of relation to being asleep itself awake.

So it feels like I'm like about to fall asleep, I guess, when I wake up and I kind of have that persist and kind of go up and down and change throughout the day in coordination to what I'm doing or stresses.

Does it feel like drowsy or does it feel dreamlike?

Um, so this is the funny thing is me and my friend that have it, we've had discussions about this.

You don't know what fatigue is anymore when you get it because it's so like because you have your own time, you can't really differentiate it from being able to feel fatigue.

So it's like most feeling fatigue is feeling more, more unreal and like even, yeah, just less conscious.

How does your dreams feel?

Um, my dreams just feel the same as they usually do.

But so is it, do your dreams feel more normal than when you're rough or not like that?

Um, my dreams actually do feel more normal than when I'm awake, yeah.

One time, I don't know if it's the exact same thing, but like when I was younger, like if I played basketball or like if I have a long, long busy day of work and I'm working a lot,

and it's like I got like this eight hour shift or maybe this, this, um, this like 10 hour shift or something, I got to like stay up and do stuff and I don't really know how to like maybe 15 minutes break.

I got like 30 minutes lunch or whatever, maybe an hour lunch, but it's like I'm more kind of like overwhelmed at what I got to do, but I got a lot to do so I kind of can't stop.

Um, I'll be working and then I'll get tired and a lot of this has to be like if I don't, uh, it's like I don't get, I don't get the rest I need.

I don't get, I don't get to eat that I need.

And then all of a sudden I'll become like what you said and it's like I just can't get tired anymore. I can do, I can go out the whole day and like I won't be fatigued anymore.

It seems like it's a similar experience, but that's the circumstances that I got to go through for me to experience that.

It sounds like a kind of, uh, sort of when you reach that transient state, when you've been staying up through the night, like let's say like with a friend, if you kind of can just keep going.

It almost feels like you're drunk. That kind of sounds like the experience you're describing.

I wanted to ask a question to Red.

So do you, have you also tried, have you also experienced, uh, like an, like an ego death experience?

Um, and how would you compare that to the deep personalization experience? Are those similar things?

Um, so I would actually say the funny part is before I got to realization, I've actually like always been into like, uh, consciousness studies and, um, neuroscience and like that sort of research.

So when it happened to me, I almost just immediately was like, oh my goodness, this is, um, proof of, uh, this, like, almost, uh, strange, like a certain relationship idea.

I have this weird theory idea, like in my head for the relationship between, um, uh, the body and, and space.

Um, but I'm a very, the reason I wouldn't say are related to ego death is because I almost feel like, um, ego death, this is more of this, uh, idea that doesn't actually,

uh, or at least it, it doesn't like, um, alter the brain in the way that like, depersonalization, derealization disorder has been kind of like, scientifically measured, um, to do to like, um, certain areas in the amygdala and like to,

area, I think it was like V3 or V4 and literally changing, um, how, like, for persistently, um, how a person's brain, um, is, uh, essentially processing the stimuli that's coming in.

Um, so I, I didn't, I personally, I didn't, I wouldn't call it an ego death. Other people may actually see it as an ego death.

Like, I, I won't, um, I guess it doesn't sound at all like an ego death at all. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, like, it's a very, um, but yeah, like, it's almost kind of, there's this a way to describe it even more as it feels like you're almost stuck in a haunted house,

because there's this almost like heightened, um, fear of like everything around you because it seems unfamiliar because you have the memory of the almost, even if you're like not aware of it, but you have the memory of the way that you used to perceive stimuli your whole life.

And then it's like, imagine having those perceptions all shift over just, just enough to seem strange and, and, um, unfamiliar all the time. It's this sort of, um, very, like, like, Paul, while you were talking about earlier,

almost this, like, shift, um, in where the, like, uh, what would you call it, the center of consciousness? Yeah, like, I'm, like, I might be more situated, um, amygdala isn't a word, but, like, more, um, like, my attention, um, and, like,

my, uh, general, like, I think attention has, like, great impact on this way of consciousness as well. And if all my attention is being exerted, um, to, like, taking in, um, stimuli, I guess actually that wouldn't be attention.

Stimulitis going right to, um, the amygdala constantly for long periods would change my, uh, experience of consciousness.

If, uh, you said, like, edibles, like, if edibles kind of made this happen, shouldn't there be a way to, like, you know, um, reverse it? And, like, you know what I mean? And, like, you take, maybe take something, I do something, I can, like, reverse that.

Cause you know what I mean? Like, if the, like- Well, those things leave your body after, you know, three or four hours, uh, I think, you know, one way of thinking about it is those, those, uh, you know, different, uh, psychoactives can modify how the neural activity is organized and put your brain in a different state.

And then, you know, when it wears off, maybe your brain goes back to that state, but sometimes maybe it stays in that state. And, um, you know, it's sort of found a new kind of, uh, organizing, uh, organizing dynamic.

And then it's how do you, like, then shift it back to the way it was?

Yes. Like, if, like, if somebody messed with the computer and put it in, like, DOS motors or some other thing like that, and you want to try to just bring it, or, like, if somebody did a software update and you want to, like, bring it back.

I wouldn't say that. I would say that the, the, the substances can teach your brain a new trick. And once it's learned it, it'll go to it. If it has some beneficial effect for some reason, dealing with stress or something like that, it's learned it. It'll use it.

Uh, on the realm of strange experiences, uh, a friend of mine, um, you know, one day sort of, you know, woke up at night and saw this man standing in a room, and he just stood there. He didn't do anything. He was just standing there.

And, um, but he was kind of there and he kind of wasn't there. It kind of goes like, and, um, he was around, like, you know, day after day, and she went and saw, like, a therapist about it and processed it.

And this was sort of a kind of progressive therapist, like, well, don't worry about it. I'll just kind of fade over time. And I don't think he's around so much anymore, but, um, she just was, it's like very disturbing when this started happening.

And then eventually she got used to it and then it sort of kind of faded away, I guess.

Yeah, speaking of that as well.

Yeah, I, um,

Are you saying, like, are you saying, like, worrying and made the guy stay? And, like, if you don't worry, it'll go, it'll go away?

Yeah, I think having anxiety about it turns it into something dramatic, which probably gives it some extra driving force.

And if you sort of, you know, don't worry about it, then it just becomes less relevant.

Yeah, so I would agree, like, there's almost, um, these people that are more prone to, like, OCD would be more susceptible to, um, even, uh, what's the pre-skits?

Schizophrenia, um, there's this, there's this sort of, like, people can have, like, a temporary delusional disorder.

Um, psychosis.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, uh, they can experience psychosis, um, and experience it only once and then have it go away while there's a lot of people that, after their first episode, they'll, like, continue to have that.

And that, it seems like, um, Paul, your friend, yeah, like, had psychosis, or potential, yeah, like, uh, potentially a psychosis.

Or, yeah, or a persistent hallucination, but she didn't, she didn't, like, yeah.

And also speaking of, like, um, disorders, like, unconsciousness, I, uh, was to care of a patient that, um, had psychogenic seizures, psychogenic electiform, epileptiform seizures, and, uh, it's really interesting because she was in our unit where we, the epilepsy unit, so she had continuous monitoring.

And she had come in because she was driving and, uh, had one of these episodes and, you know, ended up getting into a car accident.

She was fine, um, didn't suffer any injuries, but that's what raised, uh, the level of alert, alertedness, and she came in, um, to the child neurology unit.

And it was really interesting because in the, in the, uh, epilepsy unit, you know, it's continuous monitoring as well as video recording.

And so essentially you have the patient come in and you wait for them to have a seizure.

And, um, so we finally, after three days, captured, uh, this activity and she was driving and shaking. I mean, it was a full-on tonic, chronic seizure. However, when we look at the EEG trace that was taken at the same time, completely, it was normal.

And so it was, uh, exactly. And it's because, uh, it's a very unique and interesting, uh, you know, I like all of these psychosomatic conditions because they break all of the rules.

All of the connections that we try to make when we're building up our problems of consciousness, they sort of shatter all of that.

Because in this case, there's the woman who she had all the symptoms. I mean, all the signs and symptoms, uh, temporary laughs and memory.

Uh, we see these involuntary, uh, as I said, rapid, you know, really ballistic movements and it happens for about two to two to five minutes and afterwards.

That's it. And the thing is, the morbidity and mortality is quite similar to those who have the left-of-form seizures.

Um, and so it is something that's very interesting. And one of the hypotheses is that, uh, perhaps this is a metabolic condition that can excite certain neurons.

However, it doesn't lead to brain-wide dysfunction such that you can't see the EEG.

Could it have been spinal cord induced? Like brainstem spinal cord? Or do you think it was voluntary?

Um, so that was the thing is that she actually had a conversion disorder. And so all of it was, uh, it's still, it's understudied.

We don't know, uh, you know, that's the short answer of it, but it, for me, it makes me very interested in the ways, the lengths that our brains and our bodies go through

to suppress traumatic experiences. And I think, you know, everything from severing our normal perceptual understandings of the world to, you know, something like this.

And, uh, yeah, I just want to share that because we don't know. I mean, the long story short, she was discharged and we had to have that really difficult conversation with the family that, yes,

despite being on our unit for a week, we were able to capture, uh, you know, the activity, but we don't have a way to get rid of it.

And then some patients we will give anti-epilepsy medication, but it doesn't really work as well.

So, and it's just, yeah, very interesting. The person had, oh, go ahead.

Uh, I had a, just a small thought about that, uh, Sherrod, which was that, um, so there's no, there's no electrical activity, um, in this situation.

So it's not, it's not, um, you know, with the EEG, so it's not an electric storm, but, but it's interesting, the brain has, um, because, you know, you can, you can have, there's, there's electrical synapses,

there's chemical synapses, there's also, like, the, uh, the glia, and there's all these different networks in the brain.

And, um, so the idea of, like, a chemical, uh, or non-electrical, um, epileptic seizure is just, uh, is also an interesting idea.

But, but, yeah, I'll stop there.

Well, but, um, the muscle force, uh, neurons are controlled by, I mean, that's all driven by neurons. Uh, so it'd have to, I mean, if there was a, if it was, uh, seizure driven, I think, would have to go through the neural,

I mean, anything that's driving the limbs to move is gonna have to go through, uh, the motor area and activating the motor area.

And I guess the question is, is it being driven by a, uh, kind of out of control neural oscillation in the brain?

Or is it being driven by a motor program that is somehow connected to, uh, the way this person is, uh, channeling their trauma?

Did you say there was, like, a, it was a post-trauma situation? Sherrod?

Yes, correct. And, and again, you know, this is continuous monitoring, um, and it's the, it's a 256 net normally.

Uh, so it's 256 different contact points all over, uh, this person's head.

So most of that would have been picked up. Um, and so, yeah, it's just, it's very interesting.

So are these, um, non, these are non-psychogenic seizures?

No, they're, they're, they're psychogenic, psychogenic, but non-electiform, meaning that, you know, we don't see the characteristic, uh,

oscillatory patterns that, uh, will be consistent with, like, a grand ball or, or a time in chronic seizure.

So you could imagine, for example, that I guess if, uh, you know, imagine an actor was, uh, uh, simulating what it might look like

if someone was having a seizure, um, that person would be, you know, shaking and having a violent motor reaction,

but it wouldn't show up as anything unusual in the brainwaves. Um, now that's, you know, an actor would be someone kind of deliberately doing that,

but this could be someone, you know, involuntarily doing it, but it's still happening through the normal, uh, motor program activities.

Oh, so then, so then, like, so then, like, the subconscious is doing it in a way that it's not going through the channels that it would show up,

but the subconscious is still, like, making it happen?

Absolutely.

Another question I had was, so, so let's say that Paul is, Paul is correct, and this came from, uh, your, your spine,

your spine initiated this movement. What if a regular...

Oh, I don't, I don't think that's what it was from what you told me. I'm, I don't, I'm ruling that out, but go ahead.

Um, well, I, um, so I, I don't, uh, know exactly what it was, but I mean, if, um, if it was, if it was some, some, if it was, uh,

like, what if, what if the, if there's actually some distance between the, the, um, epileptic seizure and the, and what if the motor control that's happening during a seizure

is, uh, was happening in the spine, for example? Like, like, what if there was an easier way to treat seizures by, by not treating that electrical storm,

but, but, um, but maybe just addressing something, um, uh, to do with, uh, to do with, uh, the, the, the patterns that your spine gives your body in order to, to move.

It's just a weird idea, but...

Yeah, I mean, I guess the way of thinking about what you described is its whole body-shaking behavior. That's the absurd behavior.

And the question is, what's the cause? And one cause could be out of control, uh, oscillations, originating in some part of the brain.

That's epilepsy. But another cause could just be the person was shaking violently and had, you know, some subconscious reasons for doing that.

Was there some particular, um, uh, pattern or fume side to the, um, epileptic seizure of motor actions? Like, were they repetitive, like, stare at a piece of any kind?

Uh, was there, like, um, uh, you know, gunning or, uh, just shaking? Uh, nothing else?

Uh, we also appreciated or we observed, uh, tongue, tongue rattling and writhing of the mouth and lips smacking.

Lips smacking, yeah.

And then in terms of the, how would I characterize the movement? Uh, yeah, it didn't seem to have, like, a, a pattern or anything organized about it whatsoever.

That's interesting because lips smacking is, uh, quite characteristic of epileptic seizures.

And so if something was, per this idea of it being sort of like a subconscious, uh, you know, uh, active imitation of a seizure, um, unless someone had seen a seizure and was like, you know,

subconsciously I'm going to do this thing somehow psychosomatically, but it would be odd if it came from nowhere and had, had lips smacking because, yeah, that's quite specific to epilepsy itself.

Oh, it makes it seem like it's something even, it makes it seem like it's something even lower level than a, than a unusual motor program.

Uh, it makes it seem neurological, but I don't, I'm seeing really interesting.

Um, when I, when I said that, I'm not trying to say that I'm right.

That's just like, like what I thought with the subconscious thing, but I do mean it as in like, you know, your subconscious kind of knows what a seizure is and it doesn't have to see somebody else make a seizure to have a seizure.

Like it was this kind of hypnosis experiment. Um, it's on YouTube somewhere, I believe. Um, but they hypnotize this girl and then they tell her that the scissor is like burning hot and stuff like that.

And then when they put the, when they put the scissor, the scissor is not hot though, but they hypnotize her into thinking that.

And then when they put the scissor on her skin, it, it treated it like if it was hot and, and it started doing the stuff like if you're, like if you would put that in high and it burnt and burnt parts of her skin the way and stuff like that, even though it wasn't hot.

So, um, like, but that, that's, that happens if you, if you know, like, kind of, like, you know, like, it's tricky to explain though, but it's like, it's like.

Sure. If you have an idea of what it's supposed to look like, you could model it without realizing you're doing that.

Um, yes, are, are, are like, um, the reason why, okay, so kind of like, like the reason why your body would do that when you get burned is to try to protect it or whatever like that.

So when you, uh, like, if you hypnotized somebody and told somebody that was the case, they would do it or like, if the subconscious for some reason felt like, okay, this is what I got to do to keep safe right now, it would, it would imitate the, the, the, the seizure thing.

Um, without the person, um, I don't know, like, it's, it's kind of, I can't really explain it that good, but, but like that to where like, uh, the person that, that, that doesn't have to see it.

Like, it's a lot of information in the subconscious.

Lip smacking is, uh, quite the rare behavior to ever see, like, you don't see the kind of lip smacking that you see in epilepsy, uh, almost ever, like, uh, yeah, repetitive lips,

lip smacking, which can go on for, uh, like a minute or two or 30 seconds.

Uh, you just don't see people doing that.

And, and you have that sort of frame of life.

So.

Okay.

So this is what I mean.

Um, all right.

So say, like, if, um, you have like, say, if somebody has a panic attack, right?

So they have a panic attack.

Um, so you can see other people having a panic attack, but you don't, you don't have to see other people having a panic attack to have on yourself.

Or if your subconscious are like, without you ever seeing somebody have this panic attack, if your subconscious wanted to meet, you have a panic attack.

You could have one because it's certain things.

It's not necessary.

It's like, that's inside you.

It's not, it's not something that you have to see to recreate.

The, the, the lip smacking comes, uh, basically as, uh, as a result, uh, Paul, uh, disagree with me here.

Uh, this is, uh, not what you demand, but yeah, as a result, as Paul said,

basically, uh, we think, um, a solitary activity, which basically eventually, uh, results in, uh, yeah, patterns in the motor cortex, which drive that kind of behavior.

So it's not the sort of thing that you would, uh, naturally arrive at, right?

It's basically involuntary and, uh, yeah, you wouldn't know to imitate it.

Uh, I mean, a panic attack, uh, everyone knows what it's like to be scared or breathless for sure.

But that's a very, very particular motor pattern that, uh, I would be baffled if someone came up with that sort of, yeah, from there.

If you like, um, just, you know, as I imagine this is what a seizure is like.

Lip smacking is very, very particular.

Yeah.

I mean, and here's another one.

Um, there was an entire, yeah.

So there's another one called, uh, uh, psychogenic polydipsia.

Now this was a woman.

She was in her, her early 40s and she came on onto the floor.

She was admitted because, uh, uh, she perceived herself to be dehydrated.

And so we'd ran all of these tests, read her blood, osmolarity, all of that.

She was seem to be okay, but she complained always.

I'm just so thirsty.

And so what happened was that we, we checked her electrolytes and she had a very, very low potassium.

We were like, okay, what's going on here?

And so we put her on a unit and we just had the nurses monitor, just monitor her number one, but also to look at her water intake.

And she drank so much water that she was actually causing electrolyte imbalances within her, you know, herself.

And she almost killed herself actually, um, because she would consume so much water.

However, when we look at the mechanisms that underlight first, uh, you know, it's, it's highly and exquisitely attuned to the blood osmolarity.

And so, and then we, you know, check their kidneys, make sure her renal system, everything was intact.

And so she had, uh, psychogenic, meaning something that was, uh, psychologically derived with no genetic component or no biological component, but she had this excessive thirst.

So then we put her on water restriction because, you know, we, we wanted to protect her.

And she took such extreme measures to get water to the point where she used, uh, we allow the patients, you know, to sometimes they can use like a sponge bath or just, you know, have things in their room.

She was scooping the water out of the toilet to drink.

And it was just very, very interesting.

And that was, again, just another curious case of here's something where the biology just does not explain this behavior in this woman's conscious state of herself as, as it relates to thirst.

And she just said she was chronically thirsty.

Yeah, it's like you, you count on, uh, I'm not sure where a thirst would be mediated from.

I don't know if that's hypothalamus or something kind of grainstem, but you count on all the assistance to do the right thing by you and, and tell you the right signals.

Um, I met someone whose daughter, uh, didn't experience hunger, uh, from an early age.

And she just, she couldn't make herself eat.

They eventually had to implant a tube in her stomach so that she could be fed on a daily basis through a bag outside her body.

Because she just, it was food was so disgusting.

She couldn't get herself to do it even though she knew that her body needed it and she was underweight.

Um, and, you know, she was, you know, she, even though the alternative was this sort of trauma of having this tube implant in her stomach, um, there, she just couldn't get herself to eat when she ate it too.

By the way, uh, Paul, it is the hypothalamus.

It is.

Um, but I want to ask another side question to the, yeah, to the pathology, but did she ever, um, expel or bring up water?

Uh, did she, I mean, she was drinking that much.

Did she ever, um, uh, so there are cleansing rituals that people do, right?

And they just like, just take vast amounts of water and then kind of just spontaneously spewed out.

Was that part of her behavior or was that not?

Apparently not.

I, I, I, uh, I like to answer so far.

Yeah, very good question Dexter.

But yeah, uh, I have to agree with Paul.

She, uh, she was not.

Wow.

Can I ask a question?

Just still about neurodivergence and trying to bring it back to consciousness.

Um, great idea.

How, how is, how do we treat nowadays?

Um, the existence of multiple personality, multiple consciousnesses inside the same brain.

How do we treat that nowadays?

I mean, how do we, how is it regarded?

I guess it's not called that anymore.

It's called, uh, disorder.

D.I.D. Yes. So how, how, what is the approach towards dealing with D.I.D. nowadays?

Uh, I think, uh, integration therapy is often what's done.

Uh, I think the, I mean, I don't know that much about it, but I think, um, the view is that people,

often people with PTSD, uh, are, um, would exhibit that.

And, uh, so it's as though the different aspects of their memories have been partitioned from each other.

And so when the consciousness is sort of engaged with one memory area,

it sort of doesn't know about the other memory areas.

So, um, I think, uh, their best work with them to win their own one memory.

I should sort of do things to sort of make notes and like look for clues where the,

which each, each sense that each part of themselves can start to learn about the other part

and kind of notice things about the other part and start to develop awareness of the other parts there.

And then, um, eventually, uh, connect the two together or that's my understanding.

I don't know.

So the, the other, the others, the altars are not treated anymore as house fations,

as they would be for somebody with a psychosis or schizophrenia,

but they are treated as individuals who need to get to deal with each other.

Yeah, that's right. I think the standard of care right now is to do, uh,

CVT cognitive behavioral therapy, which in the context of DID is really just pointed

at allowing the person to have a better experience within themselves.

So, you know, to manage, uh, the multiple identities and the consequences of living in that state.

Um, that's why they refer to themselves as a system of people.

Yeah, some of these examples are making me think of a capgrass pollution.

That's another really interesting kind of disorder of sense of, um, sense of identity.

Uh, that's, um, when people experience familiar object or objects that should be familiar as unfamiliar,

uh, such as, uh, seeing, uh, you know, I think one, one patient I read about, uh, her sister visitor

and she's like, who's that woman? What's she doing here?

Uh, and she looks like just like my sister. She's like some actor pretending to be my sister.

And she's like, no, no, it's me. It's like, why are you pretending? Who are you? Get out of here.

Is that like all the time? Is that different?

Um, and the interesting thing about that is that, uh, basically if called on the telephone by the same person,

they immediately go, oh my goodness, there you are.

I just, uh, so good to hear from you and the same person can walk in the room whilst on the phone

and the patient will suddenly again go, oh my goodness, you're an imposter.

And so when they have the thin slice of audio that, yeah, the, um, uh, the delusion doesn't occur.

Yeah, I think, um, I think, uh, Ramachandran, uh, VS Ramachandran, um, had a case study, um, where, uh,

this person could not recognize his own mother and, uh, and an inspection of their brain through, um, uh, PET or MRI scans.

I don't remember which one showed that they had lesions in the amygdala, believe it or not.

And, uh, this is one of those case studies that, um, highlights that the amygdala is, you know, conventionally

or at least in like pop signs considered to be, you know, just like a center of like anxiety and fear.

But, um, there's also, um, the role of the amygdala in, uh, in just like general emotional valence.

So, um, the hypothesis that, uh, uh, Dr. Ramachandran posits is that, um, whenever the person, uh, you know,

looks at, uh, uh, their mother without the concomitant emotional valence, um, that, uh, gives the impression that,

that the mother is an imposter and not the mother.

And, um, I would just like to take the opportunity to tie this back to, uh, the somatic marker hypothesis that, um,

I, uh, I like to make a habit of bringing up because, um, it shows that, um, the, this kind of like visceral, uh,

somatic sensation, uh, is very much, uh, something that is, uh, crucial to some, uh, very important, uh, cognitive and emotional processes.

I mean, I think it wasn't, uh, okay, sure.

I was just going to concur what Ramsey said, uh, on the basic science and one of my colleagues at NYU actually studies that.

It's very interesting.

I think, uh, Ramachandran's explanation, Ramsey, correct me if I'm wrong here.

And I don't know whether this was just a theory that wasn't pulled out by subsequent investigation,

but that there was, uh, a breakdown in effective connectivity between the amygdala and the fusiform face area.

So, uh, yeah, is that right?

The face didn't trigger the emotional, uh, is that right?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing.

I'm not, I don't, I don't, I don't recall, you might be right.

Um, maybe that's the detail that, um, I've forgotten, but, uh, that, that, that,

I can't comment on whether that's right or not.

I did hear, um, one, one, uh, case of capgrass, uh, where the woman did recognize herself in the mirror.

Uh, so it seems like some of these are kind of visually oriented because you mentioned the person was fine on the phone with the person,

but not when they were present, uh, and visually in front of them.

Uh, so this person, uh, you know, she lived alone, but there was this woman that would follow around.

She had a, like a mirror in the hallway and there's a woman that would follow around and, and she would, um, you know,

try to, try to talk to the woman, uh, but the woman, you know, didn't talk back.

Um, and, but she tried to sign language and she happened to know sign language from a long time ago.

And, um, she said that the woman wasn't very good at sign language, uh, and, um, that she was seeing.

And, uh, I didn't really have much interesting to say.

I really kind of seemed to say the same things that she was saying, uh,

but she didn't quite connect the dots that it was her.

Um, this is really interesting, um, because, uh,

I believe, uh, uh, one of, one of the great neurophilosophers,

um, Ned Block, uh, has, he has the disorder that, um,

when he looks at people's faces, um, he can't recognize them.

Um, and, um,

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Um, and I, I often wonder, um,

it's a relationship to,

I'm almost like wondering personally if it, um, inspired him to look into consciousness studies more.

Could be. I did hear one guy give a talk.

I've had President Begnazia and, um, he said he actually didn't realize he had it until, uh, his teenage, teenage years.

Um, and the way he figured it out is he and his brother were watching a soap opera and, uh, you know,

he couldn't quite follow the, the, the, um, the story and, uh, he, you know,

was talking with his brother about it and eventually figured it out that he only thought there were three characters,

but his brother saw six characters.

Um, and so he apparently was confusing a number of the characters with each other.

And, uh, he said his brother, how can you tell them apart?

They keep showing their faces.

And, uh, that's when he realized that, uh, everyone else could tell people apart by their face.

Uh, he had to rely on the clothes they were wearing and their facial hair and, uh, other, you know,

kind of more distinctive characteristics about their, their whole person.

Um, because he couldn't really differentiate their faces very well.

Yeah. Um, this kind of like makes me, uh, that you beg the question of, you know,

I think people with, uh, prosopagnosia, um, like there's nothing like innately wrong with their,

um, like their, uh, rudimentary, uh, visual processing.

You know, they can kind of like, they can still like see the features.

Uh, you know, they can see eyes, nose and the mouth,

but the way that they kind of like integrate the features into a Gestalt,

um, that has a sort of like special salience, um, is, uh, what is not functioning.

So they, they, they see the features of a face,

but it is just a, um, non-salient, uh, stimuli, um, much akin to, you know,

how if you go outside, you know, like the branches and the branches of a tree,

you're kind of like not very salient stimuli.

Sure. Well, if you think about it, faces actually do look really similar.

I mean, if you look at, uh, you know, the yearbook, uh, and you turn it upside down,

uh, you might actually have a hard time identifying people and, uh, you,

you would confuse people. Um, so I think it's actually pretty surprising

that we're able to differentiate faces as much as we are.

I think there's a typical distribution between, yeah, the general integration

of a face as, uh, a combination of its parts, which tends,

as I recall to be right hemispheric bias and, uh, the left side, which is,

uh, we'll basically pick out the individual details.

So it could be theorizing away, um, a specific, uh, breakdown in, uh,

some kind of function precision or connectivity that's right biased, possibly.

Uh, it's also, it also happens to us with different ethnicities.

It takes us time to realize that people whose, uh, whose features do not fall

into what we're used to seeing in a face.

It takes us time to, to differentiate this.

So it's a memory thing, I think.

Well, or it's a visual, uh, processing, maybe plus memory thing.

Uh, there is a brain area that's associated with this ability to distinguish faces.

There was a visual neuroscience study done on, uh, monkeys, um,

where they would train the money monkey to differentiate, uh, different shapes

of bent paper clips.

Um, and, you know, they're sort of, you know, the monkey would tilt to a part

and then it'd add three, four or five.

And I guess eventually the monkey could differentiate, uh,

50 different variations of bent paper clips, um, which sounds really tedious.

Uh, but, um, apparently, uh, the fusiform face area, uh,

was involved in doing that differentiation.

So the conclusion was that that area is specialized for, uh,

very subtle distinctions in form.

Uh, and it just happened to be pretty useful for face identity.

Yeah.

Um, Paul, you kind of, uh, uh, said what I was just about to bring up,

which is the fusiform face area, you know, isn't necessarily just specialized

for, uh, faces in particular.

Um, but you kind of just said it.

It's the, the, the area is specialized to kind of like, um, uh,

tease apart, like really subtle variations in form, uh,

which, you know, like, as you mentioned, faces are, you know,

pretty, pretty darn similar.

Um, and, uh, this, the fact that we have such a,

a powerful ability to discern, you know, just even the slightest subtleties

in faces, you know, like people are able to tell apart identical twins,

you know, just by like some of the most subtle variations.

And I think, um, that as that research, um, uh, demonstrated,

uh, that this area is kind of, uh, where this, uh, this processing

of like extremely subtle, uh, variations, uh, happens.

And there's some credence behind that, um, because there's a,

actually a group, uh, at my, uh, center that looks at the,

uh, and they've actually using, uh, computer brain interface

and everything they're able to actually, uh, classify the,

the affect, the emotional affect versus the facial expression

and the musculature around the face.

And with a high degree of reliability, be able to discern,

uh, the difference between a person who is, uh, depressed,

depressed, uh, on medication, depressed, uh, untreated,

and then someone who's treatment resistant, uh, depressed.

And so there is a lot of salient to that.

I think there's a lot of, uh, uh, real estate, you know,

in our cortex dedicated to being able to discern, uh,

differences, my new differences and facial expression.

I think this is a superior temple focus in the cats.

Um, so yeah, pretty close to the human area.

Um, but from, uh, study that I saw, uh, which was looking

at individual populations within the area, there was special,

specialization within the area, uh, which was specific to, uh,

faces, macaque faces, uh, specifically.

And so per, per person, Pagnosia, if it was about

just precise delineation of features, you would expect it

to go for everything, right?

If it was, uh, sort of generalized.

Um, but I think, yeah, and, and, uh, this is, again, not

rich, but just, yeah, from, uh, brief investigation, I did

trying to understand whether it was actually a localized

functional deficit, but it seems that there may be, uh,

a specialism within the area, which is, yes, uh, as you say,

generalized for detail and integration.

Sorry for budding.

Just to say goodbye.

I'm signing off.

Thank you for this great, great, great conversation.

Enjoy your night.

Have a good night.

Oh, I had something, I had something to say.

Like, is that, is that like similar?

Like if, um, like if I'm at a bar or somewhere and I see

somebody or whatever at the bar, whatever, and they're like,

I'm at the store and then they're like, like, you don't

remember me.

It is like, they got to kind of like, like remind me.

And then it's like, oh, okay.

Or like, if you can't remember somebody's, somebody's name.

Um, cause, uh, I talked about it earlier on this condition

called Fantasia, where it's like, if you try to bring up

mental images, you only, you only see darkness.

So sometimes it's hard for me to not, it's not always hard

for me like, like to, like if I see a bartender and I go to

the next time, I'm going to know that that's the bartender

more times, but sometimes I do meet people and I might not,

I might not remember them.

Or maybe I can remember that I seen this person before,

but it's harder to remember their name.

But it was one time at the bar that I did work at.

Um, the bartender's daughter worked there too.

I would have been like that.

Uh, I worked, I worked there for a while or whatever.

And then like, she was gone for like, uh, maybe like, uh,

a couple of months, um, or like a year probably.

Um, and then I was at the bar and they had a party there

and she was there.

And I didn't, I didn't know, I didn't, she was like, hey,

it's nice to see you.

And I'm like, like, like, who's this or happy?

And I don't even like, no, I don't, I don't know this person.

So I'm like, how did you know me?

And she's like, you don't remember me?

And I'm like, oh, okay.

Yeah, I remember you now.

So it's like, I couldn't, I couldn't remember, but kind of

I couldn't remember for like visual reasons.

It's like, I couldn't meet the connections.

Everyone's had the experience of confusing identical twins.

So imagine if lots of people look like that.

Yeah.

I was going to ask, uh, are you, uh, good at, uh,

sort of visually, uh, imagining, uh, people's faces?

Uh, not at, not at all.

Like, like, uh, the way, the way that my visualization is,

is like, if you turn your phone off and it's just dark,

sometimes it'll be like, uh, dark, greenish, little static.

Uh, but I can, uh, not the visual comes up.

But like, if I dream, though, my dreams are very vivid.

And it's like, it looks like a real life.

It'd be hard to tell the difference, but I'll see, like,

a car floating in a dream.

I'm like, okay, that doesn't happen in real life.

This is a dream.

So, uh, this is an extreme case, but I've seen a patient

who had, uh, a hypoxic brain injury, which was resulted

in hippocampal atrophy.

And, uh, they reported that in their dreams, uh, people

didn't have discernible faces.

And, uh, the imagery in the dream was very, very sparse.

So, their description, so, so, so post, uh, this hypoxic injury.

Uh, so, uh, oxygen deprivation, they were resuscitated,

I think, over the course of about 20 minutes.

In resuscitation, uh, don't quote me on this, but I think,

uh, with CPR, you get something like 30 to 40 percent

of, uh, blood oxygenation, but nowhere near full.

And so, they basically had, uh, damage to, uh, the hippocampus,

which is, uh, a structure particularly vulnerable to anoxia.

And so, uh, yeah, the interesting thing,

aside from anterograde amnesia, which is, which is common

in hypoxic injury, is that their dreams had very sparse

mental imagery.

Um, it recovered over time, but, but not fully.

Um, but, but, uh, yeah, faces never came back.

And it would, of course, make sense that in your dreams,

you are not taking in sensory flux.

You are reviving or building everything from, uh, a process

that we can imagine must involve the hippocampus.

So, uh, yeah, likely, um, the visualization, uh,

kind of deficit or just like, um, kind of like, uh, your

sub-median performance would involve, uh, recall and memory

and the hippocampus, quite likely.

Thank you.

And, and like, and like oxygen too?

You saying?

Oh, no, that's just the case of, yes, uh, it's, uh, a way that

the hippocampus is frequently damaged by oxygen deprivation.

Yeah.

And, um, in my dreams, I could, I could identify faces or anything.

I could tell, like, um, like, like this person face that person

face that person face and like, like, like, like know who they,

know who they are or something like that.

Like one, one time, one time that happened, um, I was on

clubhouse and I was on clubhouse and I kind of fell asleep

and people were still talking.

And, um, I woke, but when I was sleeping, I was hearing

people say stuff and I was getting the visuals to it.

And I'm like, if it was like, um, like, like a, like a

Microsoft presence, like a Microsoft word presentation or

something, like a, like a animation to what they were

saying.

And I woke up like, we're, we're not talking about, uh, this

and we're not talking about, and they were like, yes.

And I, but I seem a visual.

So it's like, uh, in my dream, I was able, because I was

still hearing stuff, I was getting visuals to it.

But if I try to imagine that, like, on my own, it's like,

um, nothing is there.

I'm definitely, uh, trying to, uh, work on that.

So I could like visualize stuff again.

Wow.

I have no, even I think useful suggestions as to what that,

so, so, so just, just so I have that straight.

You're saying that, uh, in waking life, you are not that good

at recognizing people's faces, but when you are dreaming,

you have, you see, uh, the faces of people, uh, that are in

your dreams, uh, per this example from voices, uh, that you

essentially manufacture, you see them at fairly high results.

Is that right?

Um, correct.

Um, but more so, like, I, I think, I think, I think with,

um, like the trouble that I have with, uh, like remembering,

uh, people's names and more so like remembering, um, people

that I, that I, that I, that I, that I seen before on those

that it has to do with my, um, like, I got a, like, it's

like, it's better if somebody personality stands out or

like, they leave some type of, like, emotional impression

on me, then it's easier to remember them because I could

connect, I could associate them with that feeling.

But if I try to, if I try to remember like, okay, what does

Dexter look like?

My, my, my, my, my mind's eye just stays black, so I wouldn't

be able to see anything.

But if you appear in a dream, it's like, oh, that's Dexter.

So you're like my mom.

Correct?

Yeah.

I guess it seems, you know, pretty believable that

something like that would happen because, uh, discrimination

of visual input is a different process than, uh, having

an identity in your imagination and then sort of, uh, you

know, in a dream, sort of, you know, completing that

with a visual image.

Good point.

Yeah.

It's, it's called, um, aphantasia if you want to, um,

check out more about it, like how it, how it works with

the, with the brand and everything.

Like, I was only aware of it, um, early last year that

when I was trying to visualize stuff, I was only seeing

darkness and I wasn't actually, um, seeing stuff.

So like if, if I, if I was to count sheep, I was just like,

like, I would like more visually do it.

Like one sheep, two sheep.

But it's like, I can't, I can't see the sheep and

encounter me or anything like that.

And how's your working memory?

So for example, if I gave you a list of like 12 items and

gave you five seconds to look at it and then say, okay,

tell me the 12 items that you saw as best as you can,

uh, tasks like that.

How are you with that?

Definitely, definitely weak.

Like definitely weak with that.

Because it's like, I have to, it's like, I can't,

like, it's like to, to no extent would I be able to,

um, to still see.

So it's like, I gotta, I gotta rely on what I remember.

And so depending, depending on, on what it was,

uh, and like, so let's, all right.

It's like, if it was stuff that I'm familiar with, right?

Like if you showed me, and even at District,

like if you showed me like a star circle, triangle,

you know, like, like some simple stuff that I'm familiar with.

So like, okay, like I see it and I can't see it anymore,

but I really know those things really, really well.

Okay, cool.

I could kind of like, um, probably do my best job of

describing what was there, but I still might not,

not do too good.

But if you, if you were to show me like, um, maybe,

let me see if I can, if I can give an example.

Like if you, if you were to show me different,

different sneakers and stuff like that.

And like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be,

I wouldn't be able to remember much.

So if you gave me a list of names and I had to,

uh, yes, so, so, uh, not that,

not that good on, on, on that part.

I had to play like memory cards or something like that.

Not, not that good at all.

I was just asking because that ability to recall stuff is,

um, localized to the door.

So matter of pre fucking cortex.

And so as you were saying, you're in the ability to recall faces

and things like that.

I just wanted to know how much that generalized out to,

you know, other attributes that, uh, like numbers and names

and things like that, just like a list of arbitrary,

uh, uh, items.

It sounds like it does.

Yeah.

If you showed me, if you showed me nine different cakes,

like red velvet cheesecake, this is like, I would,

I would, I would, I would only be able to remember like,

uh, the one, two, or three that's about,

and I wouldn't be able to, to, to recall, um,

just something I seen.

I have a, I have an interesting question.

Can you, uh, just quick on that.

Uh, can you remember phone numbers?

Uh, okay.

If I, if I, if I try really, really hard, um, yes,

but like most times, most times, no, it's like,

like, like my current number, I don't know.

It was like one phone number I had in my life that I remembered.

And it was, it was kind of on the easier side of phone numbers.

But, uh, I, I, uh, sorry.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.
