In recent discussions, there's growing concern about the rapid acceleration of technology and its impact on younger generations. As individuals in our early 40s who remember life before the internet, we've witnessed significant technological advancements over the years. However, we believe that what younger generations are about to experience will be dramatically more intense than anything we've seen.

We're predicting that conscious, sentient artificial intelligence could emerge as soon as this year. This development will usher in the next level of automation. Unlike linear growth, technology is advancing exponentially. This means that what we might have expected to happen over 10,000 years could now occur within a few years. The concept of a technological singularity—where technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible—is becoming more plausible. The pace of innovation is accelerating so rapidly that it's hard to predict what will happen next.

Younger people today may not have the luxury we had to pause and appreciate each new technological advancement. In our time, we could marvel at the arrival of the VCR, CDs, and DVDs, taking the time to fully enjoy each innovation. Now, new technologies emerge in a matter of months, weeks, or even days. This relentless pace means they might not have the opportunity to stop and "smell the roses," potentially leaving them feeling constantly behind the curve.

Those who avoid or reject technology might find themselves even further disconnected. With advancements in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mobile internet, people can learn, experience, and travel in ways that seem almost like having superpowers. Self-driving cars and virtual experiences are becoming commonplace. In contrast, individuals who shun these technologies might feel as if they're living in a bygone era, much like someone on horseback watching cars speed by.

Another concern is that regulatory frameworks can't keep up with the swift pace of technological change. Regulations develop through slow processes involving meetings, memos, and voting, which can't match the daily rollouts of new software and ideas. By the time a regulation is in place, the technology it addresses may already be obsolete.

On a different note, understanding the brain as a biological self-aware network offers fascinating possibilities. The brain consists of cells that communicate and synchronize with each other. For example, just as fireflies synchronize their blinking and metronomes align their ticking through subtle vibrations, neurons in our brain oscillate together. This synchronization allows them to function as a unified system, making the whole body a single sensor.

By applying this understanding, we could potentially build machines that replicate human consciousness—robots that are not just tools but entities capable of self-awareness. These artificial beings could experience the world similarly to humans because they would be designed based on the same principles of synchronized networks.

There's also the intriguing idea of enhancing human connection through technology. Imagine being able to mentally or emotionally connect with others, expanding your consciousness into another's mind. Concepts from science fiction, like those in the "Nexus Trilogy," explore scenarios where people use nanotechnology to share emotions and thoughts temporarily. Such technologies could allow groups of people to feel a collective consciousness, offering profound new ways to experience unity and empathy.

Reflecting on personal experiences, some of us have engaged with neurofeedback and other brain-stimulating technologies. These experiences can be intense and transformative, sometimes even overwhelming. They have the potential to open up new dimensions of perception, allowing individuals to experience reality in multi-dimensional ways.

All of this points to a future where technology not only advances rapidly but also fundamentally changes how we perceive ourselves and interact with the world. It's both exhilarating and daunting. As we move forward, it's essential to consider how these changes affect humanity on a deeper level. Balancing technological progress with mindfulness and ensuring we don't lose sight of the human experience is a challenge we all share.

Original Whisper Transcription:
interesting to add um it's that i i think that what they're going to go through is going to be
like dramatically worse than i and i'm speaking as one of the older older folks uh i'm 41 and i
lived in a time before the internet you and i both man i'm 40 going on 43 and uh so um but i think
it's going to be worse for them than it than it was for us um the younger folks because
what i'm what i so i'm i'm predicting uh that in in a that we're going to see
conscious sentient phenomenally conscious ai this year in 2022 it's going to get worse it's going to
we're going to have um also the next level of automation but what i think that you know we've
seen the movies with the like the technological singularity but i think that um you know that's
like that the so banana the technology advances so fast it's so bananas no one knows what to predict
is going to happen anymore but i think like we've seen like the pace of technology accelerate but it
is going to really continue to accelerate exponentially not linearly so what what will
happen is is this it's from this from this year onward it's going to shoot up the the pace of
technology is going to shoot straight up and it's going to be like um what what if what we would
expect to happen over 10 000 years is going to happen over a few years in terms of yeah it's massive
increases in tech i feel bad for that i feel i i'm with you i feel bad for the the millennials and
these next gen z's and those next after that i feel bad for them because we had the luxury
the absolute luxury of being able to stop and absolutely appreciate those advancements as they
came we had the time to go this is a new thing this is cool and whatever i don't think they're
going to have the time it's going to advance so damn quick on like a snappy couple of months couple
of days couple of weeks it's going to go bang bang bang they're not going to have time to stop and smell
the damn roses appreciate what just happened because you'll be 20 steps behind the curve already
and that's kind of depressing to me that they don't have time to appreciate those advancements as they
come and they're just going to be on to the next one it's going to just happen so quickly
that was a benefit to humanity sure we're advancing that quickly well we're kind of at that point where
like we had the luxury of of saying i can appreciate it you know it's a new thing came the vcr and
you know then the dvd then a cd and a laser disc and whatever was coming through we had time
i don't think they're going to have time that's a bad flop i i'd actually also like to throw out
it's almost even worse for those who like shirk or avoid the technology and i'm not trying to like

means that people today with ar and vr and mobile phones and the internet and virtual experiences
can learn experience travel and do far more it's almost like having superpowers uh and then in
your self-driving car and then you watch someone go by on horseback who doesn't use the internet at all
so what you were describing earlier will i feel it's come full circle we are the jessons and there
are still pockets of communities that are by comparison in the stone age yeah even worse than
that yeah you look at it and say not just that we're getting superpowers that's like a set in stone
moment right like i have a thing oh no this is gonna be the you know metaverse in general i include the
the ar the vr the technologies and everything else like just your life in general is a paradigm change
right now it's a paradigm shift of a massive global proportion that people aren't even contemplating
for the most part what i'm getting at is that not only is this giving you all superpowers
it's going to give you evolving superpowers superpowers that evolve over time at a very fast
and increasingly quicker pace that's freaking terrifying to me and also exhilarating at the
same time just thinking of that
what's scary is that the pace of regulation to protect people from the potential risks
they cannot keep it it doesn't advance at that same pace so there's a growing chasm between
every update and rollout of new software and idea on an on-the-fly daily basis and regulation that
advances at the paces of meetings and memos and voting uh and they can't keep up not even close
the red tape can't keep up it's like by the time you get by the time you get you know a group of people
in a room you know to try to regulate something you're 20 or 30 steps behind like it's already
said done gone and you know bang bang bang like by the time you regulate the one thing it's
completely obsolete and out the door like it's doesn't it's irrelevant by that point it's like
right now with congress trying to regulate facebook and their acquisition of instagram and and figure
out like
so like if i explain it to you i might like and i save it then i can use what i am telling you
to put in the book so it helps me to tell you um okay so like so the first section is uh from
biology is it's about the brain so i say it's biological self-aware networks so the brain is a network
it's self-aware network of cells that communicate and then uh so i call it a biological self-aware network
but i'm referring to the human brain but the understanding of the human brain as a biological
self-aware network will help us to build machines artificial machines that can do exactly what our
brains do like consciousness from a factory like we can just build a robot that is just like us
a human because we are robots except we're different from today's robots because all of our
our our entire body is connected as a single sensor
that that like it's like okay so like imagine that there's fireflies and fireflies oscillate
and they oscillate so because they oscillate together like they all fire they all blink together
right and these oscillating patterns and because they're oscillating like they're basically like
um they eventually reach this sort of like equilibrium right where they're all um like
there's a certain darkness and all happens at once and then sudden light like they're all like
how are they setting their clocks is the big question and this mathematician named steven schrogratz
goes and he uh they're looking at they're they're considering how clocks if you put two clocks in a ship
like two um metronomes that how they eventually they start ticking together they start they enter they
become in sync it's like waves well because they're sending each other tiny vibrations that passes through
the ground between them they're they're knocking each other and they're giving each other some amount of
energy right each time they knock each other and and eventually like two metronomes they um they
they start to have the same they start to be in sync like you could start off where one is like this
right one is like and one hits the right and it's just but eventually they even out and then they're
both like they're doing the same thing eventually they're both going the same rate like like one see one's
going really fast and one's going like really slow and then they both start going the same speed
they both start oscillating together because they're dissipating each other's energy so they're
both using exactly half the amount of energy that's there right and they're combining their center
their sensitivity because if one of them gets knocked the other one uh feels that feels that
knock because now there's because once they're oscillating together they become like a sensor so if one of
them gets knocked the other one senses it because it is being physically moved a little bit differently
because of how it was knocked right so each they become together they become a sensor and all of
our cells are doing that but especially the neurons is it the way how to teach them to
through this small inverse to feel them all to robots your goal is robots build us humans yeah yeah to be
connected to their they will be the future but we could also like connect if you wanted to you could
connect to another human being or to a robot and you would expand your mind into theirs right and to be
able to connect yeah you could connect you could feel each other and but you could well there's
feeling each other but there's also connecting mentally those are two different things so there's
yeah so you could do either one or both like you could connect mentally with another person
eventually there's this great book that kind of like goes over the idea uh called nexus the nexus trilogy
it's like sounds like new episodes for black mirror yeah it's like black mirror a little bit
it's like every yeah it's new episodes of black mirror basically the nexus one is like people
will give access to all all minds well maybe like the in in in the nexus trilogy there's people that
you drink a solution these nanobots go into your brain and then you can feel other people's emotions
and so people like they go into these groups where they're all feeling the same emotions
and they play great music and they like they can they all sense together it's very possible
technology actually yeah people can create events get together yeah yeah and they can all feel they
can take a drug and for 10 hours they could all feel what each other's feeling and then at the end
of 10 hours the drug flushes out of them and they're just normal again yeah right so you just do it for
like one weekend
what kind of drug is this is this is a book trilogy you can get you can listen to it on audio if you want
it's called nexus trilogy get the audiobooks
it's a new drug yeah my i'm friends with the i'm friends with the guy who wrote the books
yeah yeah he's famous guy but anyway like we should read get his audiobooks and listen to him it's so good
yeah it's very good if you like anime you like his books yeah yeah i'll tell i'll send you
he's a famous guy if you draw his face he'll he'll pay he'll buy it he'll buy your
he'll pay ten thousand dollars oh i'm sorry did i get you
let me let's see all right do you want to i just want to hold it so i can
thank you
i'm glad you didn't get hurt just now that's
okay yeah we can put it back we can put it back on the left thank you
cool okay my next plan to try last
do you did you want any more you got enough of the book for now huh
no i don't know so much more my question was what do you mean from hacking to healing
oh yeah so from hacking to healing um thank you for asking this is a great question so
we've been uh there's been a lot of uh medical imaging
that's that is like experiment experimental like what are the different ways we could image what's
happening in our brains so there's 200 years of neuroscience and includes a lot of medical imaging
so that means that there's people doing eeg which is electrocepticon which is where you put
electrodes on the forehead and it measures the voltage that's coming out of the forehead
is it hurts it hurts yeah it hurts hurts i think i i did this when i was a kid oh maybe
oh yeah it's plausible you may have done it why eeg well maybe they were testing you or something
crazy i'm tested yeah yeah oh you're a tested human oh it's hurt yeah like brainwave hurts
like you have brainwaves right i was crying and then we're measuring your brainwaves with
electrodes we put electrodes put electrode cap on you no idea it was like every week going to this
house with different kind of they put like electronics on the head cool that's the kind
that's cool that's geeky stuff that's scientists and you worked for scientists you helped out you
helped them with research no they was healing me they were healing you oh i don't know from what
you don't know from what you needed healing though they felt you needed healing you don't know why
they're like oh this girl she needs healing and you're like what for right okay this is so weird
why are they healing me i'm fine you're fine yeah why
maybe it's some way changed me it's made me saying what i'm now yeah today i don't know i'm asking i'm curious
how do you think of yourself what do you mean oh open-minded let's say this
i'm curious tell me more open-minded yeah you're open-minded yeah i like multi-dimensional okay you know what i mean
because it was work with my brain yeah in some way made my brain multi-dimensional more open
i don't know what i mean what i mean what i mean what i mean what i mean what i mean what i mean
did you do neurofeedback neurofeedback is where you um you see light and sound patterns that are
reflecting your brain waves did you yeah i had a neurofeedback business cool and i actually saw the
beginning of the universe isn't that amazing so amazing yeah i i took uh so i had this my i started
this company called neo mind cycle yeah that's my business neo neo yeah mind mind cycle cycle yeah in
2012. yeah yeah yeah i started this business it's called neo my cycle and and the goal of the business
was my like i basically um i had a neurofeedback machine i was creating a neurofeedback salon so people
could come into my salon like coming in for a haircut you put on a machine it it listens to your brain
it's just like you're putting electronic ears on your brain it's listening to the sounds is it hurts
very hurts yeah the hurts sound it doesn't hurt you it's mega hurts like sound hurts like 600 hertz
but you feel the hurt no you don't feel it
but the my kid experience was hard it was hurts like like hurt feelings
like some electricity hurts well that's okay so there's like um hmm
so you could have you could they could have uh that could be like tms transcranial magnetic stimulation
where you like shoot electricity into the head to stimulate the brain yeah you think that's what
what that you think that's what it was yeah is it cool uh well i mean that's interesting that that's
interesting you this so it's like your brain is receiving a lot of stimulation so i was six years
so six years old did that cause any like hallucinations you don't know you don't you remember
no you don't remember huh no i don't think so that could that could have done something interesting
to your brain actually yeah i don't know what yeah how do you does it you feel it makes you different
do you feel you're maybe different everyone thinks he's different right no i mean different what sense of
different i mean do you feel like an alien um around other people or do you feel like other people have
something you don't have like what do you it's like what is it like i definitely feel like an alien really
or maybe i think just nobody is there anybody showing come saying me but stuff like this that someone
experiences do you do you um do you know anyone else who's like you yes you me of course you think i'm
like you yes in your any queue way it's kind of multi-dimensional feeling so i think maybe you're
autistic then autistic autistic autistic autistic autistic autistic brains are different tell me about
this yeah so on some autistics they cannot speak they cannot speak because like they're getting so
much information simultaneously everything is too interesting everything is so interesting they didn't
even look people in the eye like imagine i never looked you in the eye and i just sat here i never
talked i never talked they're just quiet i'm just like because it's so interesting it's weird right
that was weird did you did you get a sense of that like that's what awesome autistic people they just sit
there like there's nobody home because it's so intense i'm talking to you yeah it's great i'm
concentrated yeah yeah but that's but that's like so autistic is like maybe it's about concentration
that's the way the brain is connected so it's like if your brain is over connected which could result
like that could be a plausible thing that happened from being overstimulated mentally like if someone's
shooting electricity in your head and it's stimulating your brain and it's firing a lot it could be
over connected and over connected brains it's like what you're interested in is going to be different
from what a neurotypical is interested in like your interests will be different you want different
things you have different needs than a neurotypical and that's that's 

multi-dimensional this it's good you'll it means that eventually like you'll be making a lot more
money than the average person just because you're smarter and shave is a lot of money yeah you know what's
cool okay so the question is what is beyond space and um so i think of i think that reality is a bunch of
frequency waves like the reason like the quantum double slit experiment it's like when you observe
the experiment like it changes reality it's because like um at a fundamental level
like our brain waves are changing the brain wave state of reality like reality is also oscillating at
at the same frequencies as our brain waves right and that's why our brain waves are the patterns that
they are that's why we have delta waves and theta waves and beta waves and alpha waves and gamma waves
it's because those are the same waves that exist in reality like reality is made out of the same waves
can you imagine reality that you can change by way by just thinking yeah well by changing
yourself you can change reality no and can you manifest tiger behind you right now
can you manifest the tiger behind you right now with this way of changing reality
if it's outside space it's like a blueprint holograms like a blueprint hologram yeah like everything programmed
i lost yeah okay gotcha yeah so yeah so that's right i'm saying that um okay yeah right yeah so the thing is
it's like yeah we're all connected in oscillations so like when you like even when you change what
you're thinking like you're changing the rest of the universe
yeah like you are changing the rest of the universe like you're like you're you're um here's the way
here's where i think of it it's like you are starting process from here every human being yeah to the
universe and you're reacting well you are actually your own universe when you were born a universe was
created and and do you see no thing yeah yeah and that became part of the contribution to the whole
universe because if you didn't exist your contribution wouldn't exist the fact that you exist is creating is
adding to this universe okay but you're like you have your own separate universe that is uniquely you
that you and that you started with with the beginning of your life that was the beginning of the universe of you
and even the bird even a bird has that universe like that bird's universe began when it was born
bird's life is crazy yeah it's a weird universe to fly all day
yeah yeah you're a universe that was born you know i i just saw what today video that made my day
okay it's crazy i gotta show you
okay okay
nice
it's awesome
you think it's doing that to attract mates or something like look what i can do
oh just he like said why not
right he's like oh look i can control my body and it wins
oh what i can do he's still like showing it off though kind of right okay
so weird
thank you for this tea it's woken me back up i was drifting off in the tea like oh yeah it's good
uh java
java
this is a good idea
so what's your plan for youtube for for three years
no time for three years how much time do you got it no for three years for three years okay
okay so um
i'm gonna finish this book soon hopefully and then that hopefully by march
hopefully
it's a lot of work and what i'm here's what i'm thinking about doing i'm thinking about like
creating a youtube series in which i show people the parts of the book that i'm working on
and like explain the whole book on youtube and like developed a book on youtube live in front of everybody
just like hey this is the book that i'm making i'm just gonna like
like while i'm working on the book i'm going to stream the book as i'm working on it and like work
on it in front of everybody so people can see me working on the book
i don't understand so it's like okay like okay let me show you my book where's my laptop oh it's uh
here okay i'll show you the book right now it's um maybe if i point while i'm talking then it will
make more sense i don't know funny like why i would pointing make more sense okay so like so this is the
table of content like a little video that you're showing or something i'm not not yet why not
because i'm not because i want to keep this like under wraps for now like not like public yet
i just thought it's so on the key moment yeah video records like a documentary yeah
me or this no i just want you i'm watching you from here i'm not looking exactly what is oh yeah you
can do that so you're just like scrolling what you did yeah just this one yeah yeah like this but
i don't want i don't want this on the camera though no it's not readable i mean it's just from here
all right but i can't see you know then yeah
yeah
all right you're ready
So I just have like a table of contents here that's really long, like a super long table
of contents.
See how long that was?
Table of contents?
Yeah, table of contents.
And that represents like 600 notes, 600 notes, and the notes have like, some of them are
like really short, some of them are like really long, like several pages long.
Many of them are several pages long.
And that's the content of the book.
And so basically, once I have the order of the contents all figured out, all I need to
do is take the notes, search for the notes that reference the table of contents, right?
So the table of contents has an idea, and then I search for that idea in my notes and
all the notes that pertain to that idea, I put in that chapter.
Same thing for the next chapter.
All the notes that pertain to this idea go in this chapter, and then I arrange the notes
in like an article format, the way I've always done Silicon Valley Global News.
So that's how I can make the whole book.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
And so like all the things that I, all the topics that I have encountered and thought about
and had original thoughts on and made notes, this is my thoughts on this topic.
Like all of that's what's going in the book, is my notes on all these different topics,
and then I combine it all together.
So it becomes, it becomes, with some new ideas.
You heard some of my ideas today, right?
But this is from all the things I've studied, so...
300 pages.
Maybe.
Maybe.
I think it may mean for 300 pages.
It sounds like a good number.
But I have a lot more pages than that.
Yeah.
I have like 900 pages.
What's the name of the book?
Self-Aware Networks.
Huh?
Self-Aware Networks.
Huh?
Self-Aware Networks.
Hmm.
Wait, who are you saying that to?
Hmm?
No, maybe.
Self-Aware Networks.
That's the name of my group.
Self-Aware Networks.
If you look up on Facebook, there's a group called Self-Aware Networks.
It's my group.
It's my group.
If you're sharing, it's like you have conversations with people about some topics on Facebook group.
Well, you're not, you're not practicing this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We, uh, in my country, in Ukraine, we had a kind of Facebook post for our country and
the other groups, we created like inside a text file that everyone can have conversations
about some topics.
Yeah.
Did you make the new group?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
no
hit me one more time
sorry
one more time
try that question one more time
come on
it was in a cloud
I was in a cloud
I'm back to reality
I came out of the cloud
what were we talking about
what was in the cloud
it was more interesting
no it was like
it was the matrix
I was not in reality
I was not in reality
okay this is interesting
where you been
do you not know your name
yes I do
so you can always manifest
like a master inside reality
and go to your cloud
that's what you mean
can you say it again
go to the cloud
and then come back
yeah
like in a matrix
you can do it
yeah I mean I
I can be here one minute
and go on the next
like I can be somewhere else
yeah it's what I'm interested
about
why it's happening
I
I don't know
I don't know
I guess
I don't know
I think
it's what's always
with you
maybe
maybe
I'm not
like I said
I'm not a neurotypical
I'm an autistic
so my mind is a little bit different
right
you can sense it
you can sense it
better than
better than
than
yeah
you get it
yeah
like when I said
like sometimes
the environment
is more interesting
than people
where you can just like
not talk anymore
you just like
you can be lost
in your mind
I think it's like
it's like
it's like
meditation
do you know
meditation is like
when you are just
like letting go
of
deliberate thought patterns
and just allowing
that
allowing there to be
the existence of
of whatever is
without
your thoughts
so you're just
in a very peaceful
state
and that's kind of
like where I was at
I was like
yeah
so I was just like
like a photograph
like my mind became
this photograph
that I wasn't there
but I was
I was listening
I was listening to
reality
I was listening to
reality being
an electromagnetic
phase field
right
where this is all
just
these are all
just different
frequencies
that's it
they're just
different frequencies
everything
every object
in reality
is a different
frequency
the air
is different
frequencies
they're fractal
functional
isomorphisms
or basically
the whole universe
is a fractal
of oscillations
God is so
God is so
amazing
it's crazy
I'm going to listen
to this book
about Satan
he said
remember
he said
he said
Satan
smarter
smarter
than God
he said
this
in the book
yeah
he was asking
he said
in the form
of a question
like
you think
Satan
is smarter
than God
like
what are you
thinking
Satan is not
smarter
than God
no
that's what
right
God is super
smart
yeah
yeah
he's saying
God is experiencing
reality
through you
yeah
right
right
yeah
it's
yeah
the same
that's interesting
yeah
I guess
I guess
there's some
there's some
kind of
like
interesting
ideas
like if we
are just
oscillating
if we're
if we can
sense
our own
bodies
and our
own minds
and have
like
all of our
our
we're able to
sense reality
basically
because reality
is affecting
the
this
like
harmonic
body
of cells
and this
harmonic
body
of cells
then
there's
is
detecting
reality
right
that's another
way to
see yourself
right
it's like
a harmonic
body of cells
that's detecting
reality
what
means
like
sensing
detecting
is
I see it
I detected
it
I see
that
I detected
that
I detected
that
you believe
people
can get
together
taking drag
and feel
each other
yeah
so it
will feel
like God
no separation
yeah
so more
we connected
more we feel
like God
but it's also
to be connected
with everything
with all
frequencies
like a table
you know
with everything
I think
it's the
highest point
to your God
to connect
with everything
not just
with humans
what's
interesting
is like
so
there's
this
I don't know
like Abraham
Hicks is this
like alien
right
she's from
like another
universe
and she
like
okay
so like
there's this
woman named
Esther Hicks
and she's
channeling
this alien
named Abraham
in her body
Esther
Esther
is a real
person
Esther Hicks
that's why
I think
like this
will
this is
like
mind-bending
stuff
like we
should listen
to Abraham
Hicks
she puts a
blanket
on
and everyone
goes
aww
aww
aww
I'm so cute
alright
do you want to make it more cuter?
how?
Mrs. Blanket made my grandma
aww
aww
I'll type this in
um
wow
that is cute
that's real cute
okay
let me think
aww
okay
what was I typing here?
I love this
Abraham Hicks
Abraham Hicks
Abraham Hicks
that's what I'm saying
I think you would like
if you like that
you might like this
it's a very different
but it's cool also
so I loved what you said
that when you know
the formula
you go from
results to results
to results
to results
and what is the
primary result?
satisfaction
pleasure
joy
that's such a key thing
to know
because that's how
you know you're on track
yes
so
this past
since last November
when I saw you
in Asheville
I have been
continually more
in the receptive mode
and I get it
I can feel it
in my body
and I am more
in step 5
step 4
step 5
step 4
the question I have
is
and it's more of a
you're going to help me
answer the question
before I can formulate it
but it is
that
everything is coming in
and I lived
for 35 years
in a place
that I was so far
from the results
the gap
was so
vast
you don't know that
you don't know that
for sure
and it doesn't help
to say that
okay
something that does help
is that
I was figuring it out
as I was figuring it out
I was doing the best
that I knew
and I might have been
more in step 1
than I really wanted to be
but
I created a wonderful
vibrational reality
and so
so much
that I am now
benefiting from
happened during that time
I'm appreciative
of everything
that I lived
and what it accomplished
can you feel how
those thoughts
are much more
in harmony
with the way
your inner being
looks at it
your inner being
feels no regret
about anything
you've ever lived
and when you do
you're off course
yes
it's really an interesting thing
your intention here
was to talk about
how good it is
by talking about
how bad it was
right
that doesn't work
because while you're
talking about
how bad it was
you're not letting
how good it is in
but we're just saying
what we were talking
about earlier today
is expectation
and so
we're not trying
to stifle anything
that you're saying
we just want you
all to be aware
of when you're
communicating
or thinking
or focusing
from what expectation
are you offering it
and this is the question
that we've been asking
you lately
you may have even heard it
last time we were together
is
under what influence
am I
am I under the influence
of source
which is what meditation
accomplishes
or am I under the influence
of
things that went wrong
or struggle
that I've lived
and so
in this moment
while you're visiting
with us
we're just asking you
under what influence
are you
as the words
are formulating
that you're giving
to us
are you under
the influence
of the problem
or are you under
the influence
of the solution
and we get it
this is a place
where we solve problems
but we can't solve problems
by pointing them out
okay
so starting again
I
from the place
of the solution
it is so good
I don't have any plans
I don't
I have goals
but the
my plans
are
in the process
of
being realized
by me
I know my plans
have been made
because I believe
my vortex is real
and I know
that my inner being
knows
the path of least resistance
from where I am
to where I'm going
so I know
that those plans
are all in place
I'm looking forward
to
on a pretty steady basis
being in the receptive mode
where I can realize
what those plans are
can you feel the difference
because that's the way
your inner being
tells that story
you feel a little lost
your inner being
knows you're not
your words were about
not knowing
where to go
in other words
your words demonstrated
a feeling of insecurity
did you hear it?
why is she not saying
for self-love
insecurity
well you can't stand
in a place of insecurity
and be in the receptive mode
so if you're standing
in a place of insecurity
take a nap
because anything
that you receive
why is she not saying
he's always got
well
she just decided
to be an alien
like
her name
Abraham
non-physical
non-physical
being
non-physical
yeah
that's what she
wanted to be
so it's like
there could be
different kinds of
so her consciousness
you agree
everything she's saying
do you agree?
well I don't know
I don't know
that
that
that
no I wouldn't say that
I don't agree
with everything
Abraham says
well I mean
for example
like
she seems to have
like a one
I would think of it
as like a one
size fits all
solution
like everybody
needs to let go
right
like everyone
needs to take
the easy path
or something
like
there's a one
size fits all
solution
I think there are
different metaphors
that work better
for some people
than
and different metaphors
that work better
for other people
like there's
it's not like
some people
they have to
like a person
has to become aware
of how their mind
is
because different
people have
different minds
and once you
understand how
your mind is
different
you can
learn to work
with what you got
but you have to
understand yourself
first
you have to know
yourself
and it's very
important
it's like
know yourself
control yourself
give yourself
all three
how do you know
you fully know
yourself?
I think
it's important
like
I don't know
I think my book
may well
help
because it's like
if you understand
exactly how you
work
then you know
yourself even more
yeah
what is the time?
what is the time?
what is the time?
the time is
about 12.40
all right
I don't know
it was super great
it was super great
yeah
it was great
let me try
to pause this
I don't know
what is the time
I don't know
I don't know
but I don't know
to angelf
or I don't know
oh
yeah
how do you know
