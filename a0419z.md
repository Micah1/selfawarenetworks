is outside metrics, explicitly. So there is no metric of categories, that's interesting because if the human brain does categories/directories it may actually have a real metric between categories. Different brains may have different metrics between categories. it would be interesting to see what those differences actually are in physical terms.

the hierarchical looping oscillating neural network from inputs to outputs in the human brain can be thought of as having a natural directory structure for semantically seperating concepts into branches, or branches of nodes or branches of neurons, so that learned representations have a home, an area, spatially organized

this is why humans are innately great at understanding different contexts and the different rewards & consequences in each context, so in videogames you can be violent, but in real life its not acceptable, because there are different rewards and consequences in real life than in videogames
