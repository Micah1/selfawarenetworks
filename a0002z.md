This short note seems to be mostly poetic and probably won't make it into the book. I think it's interesting.

A consequence of some reasoning is how to explain a universe that basically has a sum total of zero information in it. A universe that does not have any patterns that seems to be filled with patterns? A universe that some mathematicians think is made up entirely of information, how can it have none? The synchronization of decoders is static dissolving an inhibiting wave of decoherence that upsets isolated equilibriums collapsing together a convergence in the weight of atomic alignments that electromagnetically orient a reversal of polarity into a temporary displacement of superposition. A selection buttercup! A selection composing the distributed, like the nucleus attractor, compactor anti-distractor, fe fi fo factor reactor!

Ions, there is so much going on with ions, its a magical magnetic mechanism, an electomagnetic sandbox, it binds, it polarizes, it bursts, it has gradients, inhibits, excites, depolarizes, its the material of neural dynamics, it can be both attractor and attractee, and now with this tool it becomes our playground
