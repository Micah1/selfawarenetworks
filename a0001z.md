a0001z
If you began reading my notes from a0001z this is a good time to point out that these notes were randomly ordered, as the numbering system was created, and recreated after many of the notes were already many years old, many of the notes date back to the period between 2011-2015, I think I came up with the numbering system in 2020. In addition many notes were deleted or removed from the number system, and other notes were given numbers belonging to those notes that were deleted. Going forward I will be reorganizing my notes with a new numbering system as they are transformed into the material for the book.

"The Ego Tunnel" is a book by Thomas Metzinger explores the idea that there is no self but asks what is the entity that is experiencing reality?

What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in an cycling phasic oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entitified via the principlies of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modelled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

(oscillat, render, field, graph, causation, emotion, tomography)
Not Holography, Mindography, or the rendering of consciousness moment by moment, as a reaction to the universe, learned by cells, the process of natural selection

3D Neural Networks (Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation, Denoising, Real Time Raytracing, and Self-Aware Rendering)
you are the rendering that your brain is rendering
(oscillat, synap) map: synapse configuration, SDR, Oscillator, internal recognition

The idea that a neuron's synaptic configuration represents a lot of different SDR patterns, that emerge from combinations of neural firing into distinct internal renderings that an oscillator can recognize

Past examples of people using EEG and or MRI to translate images from brain activity involve sorting large scale noisy signal data into neural networks to predict or guess what picture the brain could be seeing based on an existing set of images that the researchers pick, however that its not the same level of brain machine interface guess work as generating images movies and narratives from neural activity alone without researchers supplying categories of images themselves.

Because oscillations transmit everywhere in the brain any part of the brain can serve as a reader for saving all of the brains oscillatory patterns.

A new method for how to download the entire contents of the human brain into a computer.

Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.

It's like recording a 3D movie of all your brain activity, from which the computer can infer the changes in all your neural connections, 

I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.

The real speed of cognition is about the number of simultaneous operations I think, not about the temporal cadence of the sensory field, and the representation of the main body of causation (the human muscles)

The brain introduces its own timing delays to coordinate it's predictions to align reality between what you see & hear. To create a perception of reality that seems whole from lots of little sensors that make up your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, and body.

The idea is that you are the rendered multi-sensory perspective and the model of your body of muscular causation, and this includes the thought stream, the sequences of patterns, emotions, feelings, these are all part of the sensor-motor model that the whole brain is making

You, the rendering, and it, the chemical structure oscillating with the phase field of space are sharing each interval of the moment that is being rendered as the organisms map of reality. You the virtual information are sharing this moment with your physical body, like two halves of one oscillating nexus.

The mind itself is like a rendering, even the non-visual parts, in that a rendering is a frame in a movie, or a moment in a sound track, that is made up of a lot of different parts brought together to make that one frame. In each interval of time your brain state, and your brainwaves representing one facet of your brain state are changing to represent that next moment in time as the next rendered frame. At the micro level that consists of receptors that fired, neurons that fired, neurons that were inhibited, and other states that cells, and parts of cells can be in. At the meso level we are exploring changes to neural circuits, and cortical columns, and at the macro level it is about studying connections between major regions of the brain, the thalamus, the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the tempo-parietal junction, the rich clubs, the default mode network, the connections between pyramidal cells and the thalamus and so on.
