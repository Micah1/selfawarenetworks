# Self Aware Networks

Years ago online I ran into a group calling themselves Neo Advaita Vedanta, they insisted there was no self. They asked me to look for myself, but to deduce that anything that I found was not actually myself, the goal was to achieve an experiential realization that there was no self, and through that experience someone might experience liberation. There are many critics of Neo Advaita Vedanta, specifically the folks who practice traditional Advaita Vedanta are very critical of the folks who practice neo Advaita Vedanta, and I do not recommend engaging with these folks.

I just think it was interesting to try out, or put on the thought experiment which was the idea that there is no real self. In this thought experiment somehow our bodies gained the illusion of a self, and illusion that is hurting our bodies. This illusion of self we are asked to imagine is just a fiction, a story, and a problem. Seeing through it as an illusion is solves this problem.

I think this thought experiment helped me to imagine how the human brain as a computer system might be rendering a self.

Later on I heard of a book called "The Ego Tunnel" by Thomas Metzinger, that I did not read, but I learned that it also explores the idea that there is no self and then asks the curious question "what is the entity that is experiencing reality?"

What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

I am a convergence of patterns that exist & oscillate in spacetime. These patterns are rendered by a 3D neural network (the brain) and detected (observed) by the same 3D neural network (the brain) and this process oscillates in spacetime at a rhythm that enables this convergence pattern to happen. 

# Ripple & Sharp Wave Ripples & Action potential events trigger pond like ripples across the brain.

The exit terminal array of a neuron, when inhibited by the action potential event, represents a magnified pattern to a larger group of cells, a pattern that spreads in an ever larger radius like a stone creating ripples in a pond, because in the later neural array, some other neurons will be exited into phasic bursts as a result of the middle neural array's inhibition, because that third array is recognizing a pattern, and so on.

# NAPOT 2.0: Individual Receptor Modulation

NAPOT as described in the Whitepaper is correct but the granularity of the transmission between neurons is greater than the Whitepaper draft suggests.

The message transmitted between neurons is synapse specific meaning that its not like the neuron is a single led pixel light, which was a thought experiment, but rather it's like the individual synapses on the neuron are the LED pixel lights.

The neurons's exit terminal output therefore is like a mini computer monitor with each synapse being an individual pixel that is modified independently.

So when the neuron fires it transmits a very specific pattern to its exit terminal neighbors.

The precision & granularity of pattern transmission is greater than described with the thought experiment of the exit terminal being like an LED pixel light.

In this expansion of NAPOT every neuron is an even more complex computer, as if the receiving dendrite is the keyboard, and the exit terminal dendrite is the computer monitor with each synapse being a pixel that the next oscillating group of neurons perceives

The idea with sparse distributed representations is that is that you get a 1 when a neuron is active and a 0 when its not

My hypothesis is that the concept might apply to individual synapses increasing the granularity of the rendering of the models within the oscillation activity we call phenomenological consciousness.

I am suggesting that the up regulation & down regulation of individual synapses at the sensory input basel dendrite affects through either the potassium gradient or through cyclic AMP individual calcium channels (up regulation or down regulation of individual calcium channels.) results in a synaptic SDR being output by the exit terminal or the Apical Dendrite.

To connect ideas together, the neuron through the sparse coding of individual synapses, emits a pattern to it's exit terminal array, that is a sparsely coded representation, consisting of synaptic transmissions that are either upregulated or downregulated to trigger excitation or inhibition in the recieving dendrites of the next array. When synaptic backpropagation happens, meaning when the signals are transferred from the receiving dendrite backwards to the exit terminal, what is being adjusted is the synaptic pattern, that represents part of the model of what is being held in the mind, during the oscillating feedback loop of neural activity.

In essence the models of reality, that are oscillating, are alternating between two states, one state is as a patterns held in individual neurons by individual synapses, and the other state is as waves, soliton waves that represent a wave shape with a specific magnitude (amplitude + duration) and frequency pattern (like high frequency bursts or single bursts), and the wave shapes correspond to the synaptic patterns which are like presets that define the wave shapes for when the high phasic action potentials are triggered.

# "Properties of Sparse Distributed Representations and their Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory" via Subutai Ahmad and Jeff Hawkins, Numenta
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07469.pdf

This idea is based several things
1. bidirectional forward & backward synaptic weight changes before and after soma bursts
"Bidirectional synaptic plasticity rapidly modifies hippocampal representations"
https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.02.04.934182

2. The idea that metabotropic receptors on the receiving dendrite might trigger cAMP messages to change individual calcium channels in the exit terminal. The fact that synapses are individually inhibited or excited points to this possibility that the neurons output to its network is tailored synapse by synapse to represent memories with greater resolution & definition. See note a0272z on cyclic Amp modulation of specific ion channels
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0272z.md

3. Sparse Distributed Memory by Pentti Kanerva: The idea of individual synaptic modification is consistent with the concept of Sparse Distributed Representation (a major topic at Numenta), meaning that only a 2 or 3 of the exit terminal synapses need to be excited, and the rest inhibited, for one neuron to pass on a very specific pattern to its exit terminal array.

# The concept Reference Frames may apply

The idea of "References Frames" in our Cortical Columns from the book A Thousand Brains may apply to the slow tonic oscillations that are brain wide, in relationship to the incoming high phasic signals, or soma burst action potentials.

The higher layers of the brain, the cortex, and the thalami, tend to have slower delta & theta frequencies with a higher magnitude lower frequency. While the incoming sensory inputs to the lower layers of the brain, the cortex, and the thalami seem to trend with higher frequency brainwaves: alpha, beta, and gamma frequences. Although I have read some papers that seem to contradict this hypothesis at times, more research is needed.

In general I think there is evidence that the Hippocampus is essentially a special cortical column, like Cortical Column #1, after reading Buszaki 2006 I think that should be commonly accepted.

Self regulating receptor channel? say what?
# "Researchers identify a new mechanism responsible for controlling auditory sensitivity"
"a newly identified mechanism of how auditory sensitivity is regulated that could temporarily reduce sensitivity of the auditory system to protect itself from loud sounds that can cause irreversible damage. The study, led by CU Anschutz researchers Andrew Mecca and Giusy Caprara in the laboratory of Anthony Peng, tested a decades-old hypothesis which proposed that the gating spring, a tiny, nanometer-scale protein structure which mechanically opens and closes an ion channel in sensory hair cell cells in response to sound vibrations, can act directly as a controller of the channel's activity. Previous work in the auditory field has focused mostly on understanding mechanisms which target the ion channel. This study provides the first evidence that the gating spring itself has the capacity to modulate the sensitivity of the channel." I didn't hear you.

my hunch is that this paper (below on Auditory...) is chasing the wrong hypothesis because the major effect of calcium spikes is not going be on the dendritic side but rather on the exit terminal side of the neuron. I want to look up the sources of their hypothesis that they tested to understand if they interpreted the research incorrectly

3D Neural Networks (Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation, Denoising, Real Time Raytracing, and Self-Aware Rendering)
you are the rendering that your brain is rendering
(oscillat, synap) map: synapse configuration, SDR, Oscillator, internal recognition

The idea that a neuron's synaptic configuration represents a lot of different SDR patterns, that emerge from combinations of neural firing into distinct internal renderings that an oscillator can recognize

Past examples of people using EEG and or MRI to translate images from brain activity involve sorting large scale noisy signal data into neural networks to predict or guess what picture the brain could be seeing based on an existing set of images that the researchers pick, however that its not the same level of brain machine interface guess work as generating images movies and narratives from neural activity alone without researchers supplying categories of images themselves.

Because oscillations transmit everywhere in the brain any part of the brain can serve as a reader for saving all of the brain's oscillatory patterns.

A new method for how to download the entire contents of the human brain into a computer.

Essentially the computer can do neural imaging tomography to create a 3D map of the oscillating structure of the human mind, predicting the entire oscillating structure with neural oscillation tomography.

It's like recording a 3D movie of all your brain activity, from which the computer can infer the changes in all your neural connections, 

I think people think that the oscillations are just about timing your responses, or the temporal cadence of your thoughts, but I'm suggesting that the timing is shaping the internal representation, so that the map of reality is rendered just in time with muscle coordination speed.

The real speed of cognition is about the number of simultaneous operations I think, not about the temporal cadence of the sensory field, and the representation of the main body of causation (the human muscles)

The brain introduces its own timing delays to coordinate its predictions to align reality between what you see & hear. To create a perception of reality that seems whole from lots of little sensors that make up your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, and body.

The idea is that you are the rendered multi-sensory perspective and the model of your body of muscular causation, and this includes the thought stream, the sequences of patterns, emotions, feelings, these are all part of the sensor-motor model that the whole brain is making

You, the rendering, and it, the chemical structure oscillating with the phase field of space are sharing each interval of the moment that is being rendered as the organism's map of reality. You, the virtual entity of information existing as phases (frequencies) are sharing this moment with your saltwater, protein, chemical body, like two halves of one oscillating nexus.

The mind itself is like a rendering, even the non-visual parts, in that a rendering is a frame in a movie, or a moment in a sound track, that is made up of a lot of different parts brought together to make that one frame. In each interval of time your brain state, and your brain waves representing one facet of your brain state are changing to represent that next moment in time as the next rendered frame. At the micro level that consists of receptors that fired, neurons that fired, neurons that were inhibited, and other states that cells, and parts of cells can be in. At the meso level we are exploring changes to neural circuits, and cortical columns, and at the macro level it is about studying connections between major regions of the brain, the thalamus, the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the tempo-parietal junction, the rich clubs, the default mode network, the connections between pyramidal cells and the thalamus and so on.

"default mode network (DMN) and multiple demand network (MDN)] underpins their broad involvements in cognition."
"Recent work has established that the activity of brain areas often varies in concert, giving rise to the notion of functional brain networks [2.], as well as to the associated hypothesis that the relationship between brain activity and complex behaviours is best operationalised by the interaction of distributed nodes that constitute these networks [3.,4.]. "
"We suggest that a brain-based interpretation of human cognition can be enriched and guided by studying the microarchitecture of large-scale functional networks, notably the DMN and MDN."
"In particular, our review highlights how microarchitectural heterogeneity impacts on brain function across scales: (i) local cytoarchitectural variations within subregions echo motifs of functional organisation across the brain [54.], (ii) microarchitecture provides complementary information to structural connectivity in predicting functional connectivity [53.,55.,83.], and (iii) the DMN and MDN are variably spread across large-scale axes of microarchitecture and function"

After reviewing "A Relativistic Theory of Consciousness" a second time, it turns out the similarities to my work are much more superficial or surface level than I realized this morning, it shares a few high level conclusions. It's essentially a philosophy paper with none of the underlying neuroscience. No worries. I did like reading their paper. I respect it for what it is. I recommend reading it.
