(super position, observer) Reality and your brain are updating simultaneously

but the observer effect or the measurement problem is analogous to measuring the up or down spin of an electron with a magnet

because when you observe you are collapse the position of the electron in that moment to an up or a down state

but also a magnet is doing that because before the electron is up or down in the magnet it might be in super position

so the observer effect means that your brain is like a magnet, and that the observed and the observation are one thing, that they are being co-created simultaneously by the universe. reality exists as soon as you see it, as soon as you are aware of it.
