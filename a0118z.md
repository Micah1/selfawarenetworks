the idea that we are changing the lens shape of a neuron, by heating/cooling, expanding & contracting its membrane, its interesting, the expansion & contraction of a neuron would warp the data in a magnetic field for example, creating a lens magnification or alternatively an inhibitory lens reduction in the electromagnetic field everytime we change its shape.

The gravitational field effect in space between oscillating bodies might be altered by a combination of heat, electric charge waves, anti-electric charge waves, magnetism, mechanical acoustic waves, light waves, thermo waves (heat), and if gravitons exist.

but that the combined effect of all of these might achieve the same effects whether or not gravitons are present in the environment. 

I think with category theory we can show that space is graviton invariant, it can behave as if gravitons are present even if they are not present, and this is especially important if we are thinking about gravity from the future affecting the shape of spacetime in the past and visa versa.

I wonder if there would be any use for spin-casting optics with smoothly varying density by combining two different molten materials.

that headset would be pretty hot! like lets change the lens shape of the XR headset in real time by heating & cooling its membrane to expand and contract.
