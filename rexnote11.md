I don't think you understand why the term NDCA is in my book. Even though I spelled it out for you.

With BOT I'm suggesting that the brain's coincidence detections, at the synapse, dendrite, action potential, neural array, cortical column and other cell assemblies is naturally great at making low and high dimensional representations like biology's own built in tomography (BOT) for detecting and rendering patterns to itself (NAPOT). The coincidence pattern at any scale being a bit, as long as that bit is a phase wave differential from what was expected.

As Tomography and the Fourier Transform are math & model technologies that have natural application in biology so might NDCA which means that the sum of synaptic frequency configurations which is a subset of the dendritic connections and dendrite branch configurations becomes communicated as Phase Wave Differential defined by the Action Potential Wave Shape which is defined at the start in part by Sodium, starting what they used to call the all or nothing principle, and then the wave shape of the APsyn is further defined by the APD action potential duration, which is more clearly defined by metabotropic receptors increasing or decreasing the rate of potassium. The wave shape is communicated by a phase wave differential in terms of the vesicle release, a change in duration can change the vesicle release, but the point is for that neuron, it's synaptic frequency and dendritic branch configurations are represented in the APsyn wave shape which varies the number of neurotransmitters per interval and varies the frequency, so the total configuration of the neuron, as a tempo-spatial map of changes, is passed as a mini-NDCA

However a cortical column is an oscillating group of cells that is somewhat isolated or siloed to the rest of the brain, and this also calls for those cells that do connect the cortical columns together to use a biological NDCA concept to essentially pass along a map of the 3D + time phase wave differentials in the cortical column as compressed sequence of signal that are encoding a reduced representation of what the cortical column is observing to the rest of the brain.

You need to think A LOT HARDER, and drop a lot of stuff just to focus on NDCA as a biological concept that extends mathematical concepts to explain biology. No need to mention lie groups, or jennifer aniston neurons or graphs, you are getting too far away from the subject matter. You can understand how the wholistic 

My points, above, are the points you should focus on developing in this chapter

No bullet points, no numbers, just use natural language to write a chapter about how NDCA Nonlinear Differential Continuous Approximation is a way of saying at each level of fractal scale in the brain, from synapse, to membrane, to dendrite, to soma, to array, to group of cells, to cortical columns and other brain regions, at each scale nonlinear inputs cause phase differentials, and at a higher level they aren't summed up like a 1 or 0 in deep learning, instead these phases have different amplitudes, durations, and frequencies at every scale. So if you imagine not the sum of what the brain is doing at each scale. At the synaptic scale, at the membrane scale, at the dendritic branch scale, and so on up. At each scale those differences are captured at a higher level, but not as a simple binary sum, but as a non-linear phase wave differential that communicates the pattern mapped out at a lower scale into network operation running at a higher scale.

You could say that all the phase wave differential activity at one scale (let's imagine synaptic frequency configurations) is a sheaf, and when the lower scale configuration results in a phase shift (like an action potential from the soma) then everything below the soma's burst event becomes a nonlinear differential continuous approximation, which is allowing a pattern (a sheaf of fractal phase wave differentials from each column) inside one cortical column to connect to a pattern inside another cortical column, so the brain can pass around and interpret high level sensory representations for example to other parts of the brain for other representations to be developed or perhaps for decisions to be made for example.

Rewrite 16c so it is focusing on making a case for the arguments I am giving you right now in this prompt.
