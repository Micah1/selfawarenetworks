To start with I am going to just link text notes to this table of contents, then those notes will be replace with new wiki pages. It's a matter of prioritizing organization over format in the order of operations.

**Entified**
Phenomenological Consciousness is the rendered & temporally entified volumetric representation of reality passing between Oscillating Neural Arrays that Project or Incept Renderings to subsequent Oscillating Neural Arrays that "perceive" in their receptive field the information of the previous arrays. Rendered information is perceived in the oscillating sequences of neural arrays in physical information vortex of the brain, resulting in the generation of phenomenological consciousness.

Cycle 1.x Ilya Prigogine: Whole Brain Physics as a dissipative system



Thermodynamics * maximum entropy (convergent integration of information configuration (synaptic cohesion) in a harmonic resonance field)

John Carmack: Why I think he went from VR to AI, meaning that I think of how a VR headset works as a possible building block for understanding that the human mind has to create representations of reality, sort of like a game engine, for your eyes to see in the VR headset. The analogy of what a VR set is doing, rendering your perspective, based on your head position, gives us something to think about, in terms of how the rendering in our minds has to change with our head & eye position.
