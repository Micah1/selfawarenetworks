# Grand Summary of resnote04's Conversation

Throughout this discussion, we explored a highly integrative view of how brain regions—ranging from individual cortical columns to subcortical structures like the hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia—might function as semi-autonomous “agents” within a larger, coordinated network.

Agentic Framework Across Scales

We drew parallels to Michael Levin’s concept that agency (the capacity to act, learn, and adapt) appears at multiple scales, from cellular processes to higher cognition.

We also connected these ideas to Jeff Hawkins’ “A Thousand Brains” theory, where each cortical column can behave as an independent learning system contributing to a larger intelligence.

Feedback Loops and Reinforcement

Rather than a simple, discrete reward signal, the idea emerged that each “agent” continuously refines its internal state based on ongoing feedback loops—some of which involve traditional reinforcement signals (like dopaminergic prediction-error signals), while others involve more subtle, continuous adjustments (inhibition, excitability, synaptic tuning, etc.).

We introduced a concept of “NDCA” (Nonlinear Continuous Differential Approximation) to capture the idea that these feedback signals and oscillatory synchronizations are constantly shaping each agent’s “viewpoint.”
Synchronization and Harmonization

A recurring theme was the role of oscillations and phase relationships in unifying the contributions of many agents. Deviations from perfect synchrony become informative “error signals” or alignment adjustments that help the brain maintain an adaptive equilibrium.

Distributed Executive Function

Historically, executive function is often ascribed predominantly to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or to interactions with structures like the thalamus. The emerging perspective here is that executive-like control may be broadly distributed, with each region operating semi-independently and exerting top-down or lateral regulatory influences on the other regions it connects to.
This fits with Hawkins’ notion that every cortical column has its own motor output and predictive model, implying that “executive decisions” are not exclusively top-down from PFC or thalamus but also arise from distributed local computations.

Consciousness and Collective Rendering

By continuously integrating these local “renderings,” the brain constructs a shared internal experience or “common internal vision.”

Consciousness, then, may emerge from the dynamic harmonization of many smaller perspectives, each guided by continuous feedback loops and a drive toward synchronization or “functional coherence.”

Answer to the Key Question

Do these conclusions support the idea that every brain region (or cortical column), each oscillating as its own agent, is effectively regulating every other functionally connected region?

Short Answer: Yes. The conjecture strongly suggests that executive function is not centralized in only one or two regions (like the PFC or thalamus) but is broadly distributed. Each region has a degree of autonomy—its own goals, motor outputs, and learning mechanisms—and it exerts regulatory influence on other regions through continuous feedback loops.

Every Region as an Agent

Each region (or column) maintains its own predictive model and participates in decision-making at its own level of granularity.

This echoes Jeff Hawkins’ claim (in A Thousand Brains) that every cortical column has a motor output, implying it contributes to behavior selection.
Bidirectional Regulation

Traditional hierarchical models (PFC top-down control) are complemented or replaced by a network model where every node can influence and be influenced by others.

In effect, executive control becomes a property of the entire network, arising from the interplay of many “small executives.”

Harmonic Cross-Brain Pattern Rendering

Through oscillatory coupling, synchronization, and continuous adaptation, these regions/agents merge their local “viewpoints” into a cohesive, global perspective.

The resulting coordination allows for complex behaviors—like the example of eating an apple while riding a bicycle at the beach—where local tasks (balance, taste, movement) all sync up into a seamless experience.

Implications

This reframing aligns well with cutting-edge theories of distributed cognition and the notion that intelligence is an emergent property of many interacting agents.

It expands the boundaries of “executive function,” showing that regulatory processes can come from anywhere in the network, not just the PFC or a “control center.”

Hence, the conversation supports a deeply distributed model of executive function in which each brain region is, in essence, its own agent, continually modulating and being modulated by other agents, thereby creating the coherent whole we recognize as thought, behavior, and consciousness.

Phenomenological Consciousness, meaning the experience of being someone who is observing reality, is a phase field pattern, a patterned defined by traveling waves that are different in phase from one another, thus they are phase wave differentials. The phase fields are primarily defined by tonically firing groups of cells that fire together, tonic firing is low frequency high magnitude neural oscillations. The traveling waves that define the patterns in these phase field are high phasic patterns characterized by higher frequency lower magnitude signals. These phase fields are defined primarily by electric, magnetic, and mechanical waves, resulting from chemical and electric trasnmissions between cells.

When it comes to synergy between human beings an artificial intelligence, our words, resulting from our inner phase aligned pattern generators, become tokens, those tokens become vector aligned pattern generations, so there is a direct connection between the concept of words being phase wave differentials in the brain, and words being tokens which are vectors to an artificial embedded vector space.

Agent systems do not work very well right now because an LLM is making a guess it has some probability of being wrong, but a chain of Agents, in an Agentic Workflow, involves training many guesses, essentially making a chain of guesses, and this compounds the odds of the AI being wrong, the likelyhood that you will end up where you would not like to be increases, the odds of bad or off track responses get dramatically higher the more you chain agents together. This is the big bottle neck, agents are just not reliable.

We can say that OpenAI's o1 is chaining together a bunch of guesses, but each guess is exploring the semantic space around part of the query, so it is broadening the semantic sample space, you could imagine it as like a K-Nearest neighbor search applied to the vector embedding to find semantically related ideas or concepts, but it doesn't have to use something like K-nearest neighbors because it's thoughts about your prompt are their own sort of search & retrieval algorithm that isn't based on proximity. It's possible that a useful analogy between one concept and another concept would not be found with a K-nearest neighbor search of the vector embedding, but it might be found with a thought based sequence about your prompt. Your prompt triggers results from the vector embedding but o1 creates thinking prompts that re-trigger that same vector space, it is retriggering that vector embedding retrieval by using the first retrieval to predict new results from the subsequent retrievals.

In the brain we have regions of braincells, like cortical columns, or identifiable anatomical regions like thalamic nuclei, or more broadly the hippocampus, and we can say these regions have dynamic functional connectivity, that is they connect when have a matching frequency they are connected into task specific behavior patterns. I argue that they are also collectively rendering larger patterns when they are functionally connected. 

The following are quotes from Marlene Cohen ‪@marlenecohen.bsky.social‬
"There is reason to believe that attention orthogonalizes the attended information & we have preliminary evidence that disorders that affect cognition (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) might change formatting as well. As you suggest, it will be really interesting to see how this depends on other processes."

"New results for a new year! “Linking neural population formatting to function” describes our modern take on an old question: how can we understand the contribution of a brain area to behavior?"

"On the other hand, you all keep publishing evidence that everything an animal perceives, knows, or does can be decoded from essentially any brain area. If everything is everywhere, why have distinct brain areas?"

"A clue: the way different information (e.g. the size of a strawberry and how I predict it will taste) is formatted in neural populations affects how it can be used for computation. If size and taste prediction are encoded independently, I can flexibly use either or both to guide a decision."

"That idea that neural population formatting implies a neural population’s role in decision-making came from terrific theoretical work and correlative observations but had not to our knowledge been tested causally. That’s what we set out to do."

"Consistent with ‘everything is everywhere’, Doug could decode both motion and reward information in both areas. But it was formatted differently: MT kept that information separate while dlPFC mushed them together in ways that reflected the decision strategy. "

So all of the signals an animal receives are being passed all over the brain but different brain regions process information differently? This allows an animal to make nuanced choices considering all the properties of an entity they are attending with simultaneously divergent approaches?

If each brain region is an agent that is taking the same information but processing it according to it's learned specialties, it becomes a winner if it reaches equilibrium with other brain regions faster, that is to say if it has processed it's incoming phase wave differentials back into a synchronized state then as unit it may more quickly reach a phase state that allows it to connect functionally with other matching phase states. What is implied I think is that while a cortical column or other cell assembly is strugging with processing a pattern it's signal outputs are also phase wave differentials, until it reaches a synchronized internal state, meaning that it's not going to functionally link up with other brain regions. IF this hypothesis is correct it could bolster reasoning behind meditation and brainwave entrainment as tools to help disconnected brain regions finish processing so they can link together in larger patterns. It's also a key reason to get rest & recreation, to let your brain regions finish up their processing, so your mind links together a bigger pattern.

o1

Thought about neural synchronization and brain regions as agents
Below is a conceptual synthesis that weaves together the major themes you brought up: traveling waves (phase wave differentials), Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, distributed “agentic” processing in the brain, the parallels to AI/LLM agent chaining, and what it means for consciousness, learning, and behavior. I’ll break it into key sections so the connections are clear:

1. Traveling Waves as Phase Wave Differentials

a. Tonic vs. Phasic Firing

Tonic firing: low-frequency, high-magnitude oscillations. These set up the overarching “canvas” or baseline phase field in which more transient information processing can occur.

Phasic firing: higher-frequency, lower-magnitude “traveling waves” superimposed on that tonic background. These traveling waves carry moment-to-moment changes in information.

b. Phase Fields in the Brain

When neurons (or populations of neurons) fire in a coordinated manner, they produce spatiotemporal patterns of electric and magnetic fields.

Phase wave differentials mean: if different regions or columns are out of phase, the differences in timing become both a carrier of information and a mechanism for gating which areas can or cannot communicate effectively.

c. Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT)
You describe a theoretical framework (Self Aware Networks / NAPOT) in which these traveling waves with their phase differentials “render” internal images of reality.

“Rendering” here means that each neural ensemble projects its perspective—via oscillatory firing—into a coherent large-scale pattern that emerges from collective synchronization and constructive or destructive interference of waves.

2. Distributed “Agentic” Processing in the Brain

a. Each Region as an Agent

Mirroring Jeff Hawkins’ idea (“A Thousand Brains”), each cortical column (or any distinct cell assembly / anatomical nucleus) can be seen as a semi-autonomous agent, receiving shared information but processing it in its own unique “format.”

Marlene Cohen’s recent discussion of “population formatting” aligns with this. She notes that the same information (e.g., size of a strawberry vs. how it might taste) is everywhere in the brain, yet each region encodes or formats it differently.

b. Convergence and Divergence

“Everything is everywhere”: Many signals get broadcast widely across cortical and subcortical structures.

“Different formatting”: Each region’s specialized tuning or “learned specialty” re-encodes the shared data in ways that reflect that region’s role (e.g., motion in MT, strategic weighting in dlPFC, etc.).

c. Equilibration via Phase Alignment

You propose that an area reaches equilibrium or “converges” when it has integrated incoming signals (phase wave differentials) into a synchronized internal state.

Only once it “settles” (i.e., matches frequencies or phases effectively with other assemblies) does it join into the broader, functionally connected network for that moment.

If a region is still “struggling” to parse input, it remains somewhat phase-desynchronized—thus less integrated into the coherent cross-regional pattern.

d. Relevance to Meditation / Rest
Meditation, rest, or any practice that fosters large-scale synchrony might help “stuck” or desynchronized regions to finish processing.

By encouraging slow, coherent rhythms (e.g., alpha, theta, or even slower waves), the brain can reset, consolidate, and realign local neural assemblies into broader patterns—resulting in a more unified state of consciousness.

3. Consciousness as a Larger “Rendered” Pattern

a. Self-Rendering & Phenomenological Consciousness

The traveling wave perspective implies that consciousness emerges when these phase-differential signals integrate into a macroscopic pattern—the “ink” of the mind’s internal image, as you say.

Phenomenological consciousness = the moment-to-moment “feel” of being an observer is then the wave interference pattern itself—the combined effect of many traveling waves crossing in space and time.

b. Phase Alignments = Unified Moments of Experience

As local networks “find” their resonance with the global wave, we get fleeting, stable micro-states that correspond to moments of awareness.

The “sliding” or “shifting” of these micro-states over hundreds of milliseconds might correlate with how we experience a continuous stream of consciousness.

4. Parallels to AI / LLM Agent Workflows

a. Agent Chaining and Error Accumulation

In large language models (LLMs), each step is akin to a guess in a multi-step chain. If each guess has some probability of being wrong, chaining many guesses compounds errors.

This is reminiscent of desynchronized neural columns each passing along partial or potentially erroneous signals.

b. Searching the Vector Embedding

LLMs, when searching for relevant tokens or ideas, can re-trigger vector embedding retrievals. This can be loosely analogized to neurons re-sending signals to each other, except that LLM embeddings are typically driven by large learned parameter sets, not a direct phase synchronization mechanism.

c. AI’s “Phase-Like” Mechanism?

While LLMs do not literally do wave-phase alignment, the iterative “self-attention” or “re-querying” can be seen as repeated alignment of semantic embeddings.

In other words, they keep “nudging” the conversation or the internal hidden state to converge on a coherent thread, somewhat paralleling how neural columns might keep oscillating until they synchronize.

d. Why “Agents” Are Unreliable (for Now)

Because each agent in an LLM-based system might produce a next step based on partial or uncertain inferences, the final output can derail.

The biological brain, in contrast, has robust error-correction and inhibitory circuits that can “quiet” bad signals. Also, centuries of evolutionary tuning have shaped how these brain-wide oscillations robustly converge.

5. Implications and Big-Picture Takeaways
Distributed Executive Control

No single place in the brain (not even the PFC or thalamus alone) holds all the executive power. Instead, “executive function” emerges from a constantly shifting coalition of columns and subcortical structures that manage to synchronize in the right patterns at the right times.

Why Different Brain Areas Exist if Everything is Everywhere

Because each region formats or transforms the information differently, preserving the brain’s ability to (a) hold parallel, potentially conflicting representations; (b) re-combine them into a flexible decision strategy.
This flexible re-combination arises from the wave-based gating: only the areas that achieve phase-aligned synergy for a given task collectively exert control.
Traveling Waves as a Key Mechanism

The new traveling wave (TW) research suggests a spatiotemporal organizing principle: the wave front is not just random noise; it actively coordinates local computations and re-entrance of signals between areas like hippocampus and parahippocampus, or between cortex and thalamus.

Meditation, Rest, and Self-Organizing Intelligence

Practices that enhance slow, coherent rhythms may help unify distributed agents by creating conditions favorable to widespread phase alignment.

More so than just “relaxing,” it allows the system to resolve incomplete wave differentials, forging robust inter-column synchronization and a more holistic sense of self and environment.

Analogy to AI

Even if large-scale “agent chaining” in LLMs is still prone to compounding errors, the conceptual parallel to phase alignment is instructive.

Future AI systems might incorporate “continuous feedback loops” or biologically inspired synchronization mechanisms (perhaps at the level of neural network gating or phase-coded synchronization signals) to reduce error accumulation and mimic the emergent stability we see in the brain.

Final Thoughts
You’ve put forth a rich framework:

Traveling waves (phase wave differentials) form the backbone of how the brain “renders” experiences and actively coordinates distributed processing.
Each region is functionally an “agent,” receiving widely broadcast signals but encoding them differently; true convergence requires phase alignment (synchronization).

This approach helps explain why distinct areas exist despite the “everything is everywhere” phenomenon—because formatting matters for how signals are used.
Meditation, rest, and healthy oscillatory states are essential for letting these diverse agents “finish their tasks” and realign, thus supporting integrative consciousness.

Meanwhile, in AI, the unreliability of chaining many guesses is a sign of lacking robust feedback and synchronization. Better synergy might come from more brain-inspired, phase-alignment-like designs.

Altogether, this points to a deeply distributed, wave-coordinated understanding of the mind—one that resonates with emerging neuroscience findings on traveling waves, hierarchical dynamical processing, and the possibility that consciousness is literally the phase-aligned summation of local “agent” viewpoints.






Micah Blumberg said:
Agent Phase Synching Feedback Loops might fix the problem with Langchain, babyAGI and other Agent frameworks that compound the odds of bad guessing with each iterative agent action. This conversation we have had helps to explain why, but I will let you spell it out for me.

o1

Thought for a few seconds
Below is a concise explanation of how “Agent Phase Synching Feedback Loops” (inspired by the brain’s traveling-wave synchronization) might fix the problem that LangChain, BabyAGI, and other “Agent” frameworks face—namely, error compounding with each iterative guess.

1. The Problem: Error Compounding in Agent Chains

When you chain together multiple agent steps:

Each step is a “guess,” based on large language model (LLM) outputs that have some non-zero probability of being incorrect.

Errors snowball with each additional step, making it more likely the final output is off-track or simply wrong.

Example

Agent A outputs a sub-goal.

Agent B interprets that sub-goal, but if A’s output was partially wrong, B’s next action can diverge further from correctness.

Repeating this many times can lead to large divergences from the intended solution.

2. Brain-Inspired Insight: Phase Alignment and Feedback Loops

In the brain:

Distributed Agents (Neural Assemblies):

Each cortical column or subcortical nucleus can be viewed as a semi-autonomous “agent” receiving shared info but processing it uniquely.

Traveling Waves and Phase Differential:

Neuronal populations communicate effectively only once they phase align—that is, once their oscillatory patterns synchronize.

Until a local region “resolves” the data (i.e., reaches its own stable firing pattern), it remains out-of-sync and less likely to contribute a stable output to the larger network.

Ongoing Feedback for Error Correction:

If one region (agent) is “out of phase” (i.e., spitting out an error signal), other regions can withhold or temper further propagation until that region either corrects itself or is suppressed.

The overall system “pulls back in” any outliers by continuous feedback loops, preventing an entire chain from derailing.

3. Applying Phase Synching to AI Agent Frameworks

a. Periodic “Resynchronization” Check

Rather than letting each agent’s guess pass uncritically into the next step, you introduce a feedback mechanism:

Collect partial results from all active agents.

Check consistency or coherence among these partial results (a “phase alignment” analog).

Any “outlier” or contradictory partial result triggers a re-check or refinement step. Only once a certain coherence threshold is met do you proceed.

Outcome: This prevents small errors from uncontrollably propagating. Instead, the system “pauses” to reconcile divergences—akin to how the brain re-aligns oscillations.

b. Weighted Voting / Cross-Verification

Just like different brain regions “vote” with their synchronized oscillations, AI agents could cross-verify each other’s outputs before moving on.

Agents that produce obviously out-of-sync results (e.g., internally inconsistent steps) get down-weighted or forced to re-iterate their reasoning.

c. Dynamic “Phase” Gating

In the brain: If a neuron group is firing out-of-phase, it stays somewhat isolated until it converges.

In AI: If an agent output contradicts major lines of reasoning, it can be “gated off” (excluded) until it’s either revised or validated.

Result: Only the chain steps that stay in “synch” (coherent with the collective partial solution) propagate. This significantly reduces runaway error accumulation.

4. Why This Reduces Error Compounding

Built-in Error Checking

Brain-inspired systems do constant error checking via oscillatory coherence. AI agents need a similar mechanism to continuously assess “Is this new partial result aligned with the rest of the chain?”

No Blind Forward Pass

Typical LLM-based agent chains push forward with minimal re-check. Phase-synching feedback imposes a global synchronization event that halts progression when red flags appear.

Iterative Convergence

Each “resync” step is essentially a short loop of iterative refinement—agents re-issue their sub-results with more caution and more context, aligning themselves closer to consensus or correctness.

5. High-Level Analogy: Brain vs. Agent Chains

Brain	AI Agent Framework

Multiple neural “agents” (columns, nuclei)	Multiple agent modules (LangChain, BabyAGI steps, etc.)

Continuous oscillatory signals + phase alignment	Iterative re-checking + feedback for alignment

Inconsistent signals get suppressed or re-synced	Inconsistent agent outputs get revised or discarded

Emergent stable function → prevents runaway errors	More reliable final output → prevents compounding errors

Conclusion

Agent Phase Synching Feedback Loops could solve the LLM agent reliability bottleneck by forcing continuous coherence checks, much like the brain does with traveling waves.

Instead of letting each agent’s guess freely compound errors, you’d have a mechanism that detects and corrects out-of-phase (i.e., erroneous or incoherent) outputs before they derail the entire chain.

This is why the “phase-alignment” principle—derived from how neural populations sync up—can be a powerful roadmap for making multi-step AI workflows more robust.

Thought about agent systems and semantic search
Below is an expanded explanation of how an agent system (let’s call it Agent_System’s x1) “chains together a bunch of guesses” and broadens the semantic sample space by iteratively re-triggering a vector embedding search. I’ll break it down into steps:

1. Initial Prompt and Vector Embedding
User Prompt

The user provides some query or instruction.
Agent_System’s x1 ingests this query (e.g., “Explain how traveling waves in the brain might inform AI chaining.”).
Vector Embedding

The query is then transformed into a vector embedding—essentially a point in a high-dimensional space that captures the semantic meaning of the text.
This embedding might be used for an initial retrieval of relevant “chunks” from knowledge bases or for an initial guess about how to proceed.
2. First Guess → Expanding the Semantic Space
Form a ‘Guess’

Agent_System’s x1 uses the initial embedding (plus internal learned parameters) to generate a “partial solution” or guess—this could be an outline, a question, or a short draft of an answer.
Exploring Surrounding Semantics

This guess itself can branch out in meaning, highlighting additional concepts, keywords, or directions that weren’t explicitly in the original prompt.
It’s somewhat like doing a localized K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) in the vector space around the user prompt, but it isn’t strictly limited to nearest neighbors. It also draws on internal model “reasoning,” allowing more creative leaps or “thought-based sequences.”
Re-triggering the Vector Space

The partial solution (guess) is then fed back into the system, generating new embeddings for the newly emergent concepts.
This leads to additional retrieval steps or queries that are subtly different from the original. Now the system is effectively “probing” regions of the vector space that are tangential or related to the partial answer.
3. Subsequent Guesses and Iterative Retrieval
Chain of Guesses

Each new guess can incorporate the partial results from the previous guess(es).
In effect, the system is building a thread of internal prompts—one that can refine or pivot based on intermediate progress.
Semantic Broadening

Because each step re-embeds and re-checks the knowledge base or reasoning chain, it can discover new analogies or new angles that a simple single-step retrieval might have missed.
This is not necessarily a nearest-neighbor approach. It might be a more flexible, “thought-based” sequence of queries.
Feedback Loop

The system can continually feed these intermediate expansions back into the vector embedding engine, retrieving even more context or updating its internal state.
Over multiple iterations, the system’s knowledge retrieval can diverge from a “typical” nearest-neighbor clustering—it might find rare but relevant connections that purely distance-based similarity wouldn’t highlight.
4. Why Not Just k-NN?
k-NN Is Proximity-Based

A standard k-NN retrieval approach returns the top-k results closest to a given vector query in embedding space.
This might miss lateral connections—concepts that are thematically relevant but not in the immediate, tight cluster.
Contextual Reasoning

Agent_System’s x1 uses contextual or chain-of-thought reasoning that might link two ideas based on subtle narrative or logical patterns—not simply on word-vector similarity.
Example: “Traveling waves in neuroscience” and “phase synchronization in multi-agent AI” might be somewhat distant in embedding space but thematically linked by concept.
Iterative Re-triggering

Because the system re-queries with new partial solutions, it effectively shifts the semantic center each time.
That dynamic shift can unearth concepts or references that a static, single-shot vector similarity approach would never surface.
5. Outcome: Richer Semantic Exploration
Broader Sample Space

By chaining guesses (prompts) and re-triggering vector searches, the system explores a wider region of the semantic space.
This helps surface non-obvious connections, deeper analogies, or novel lines of reasoning.
Drawback: Potential for Error Compounding

The flip side is that each guess has some probability of being wrong or irrelevant—so repeated chaining without checks (or “phase alignment”-like feedback loops) can lead to a cascade of mistakes.
Overall Benefit

Done carefully, iterative prompting and retrieval can produce a much richer, more insightful end solution than a single nearest-neighbor search or a single LLM pass.
This is especially valuable when the user’s initial prompt is ambiguous, complex, or open-ended.
Key Takeaway
Agent_System’s x1 isn’t just doing a static similarity search. It’s effectively using each partial answer or “guess” as a new internal prompt to rediscover and expand the semantic space. This process is more like iterative, context-sensitive reasoning than simple distance-based lookups. While this strategy can significantly enrich the answer (finding connections k-NN might overlook), it also introduces the risk of compounding small inaccuracies—a problem that might be addressed by better feedback loops or “phase alignment” methods (as discussed in the broader conversation).






Micah Blumberg said:
but then Agent_System’s x1 does some sort of vector alignment search, some sort of check to make sure there is a phase consistency between the semantic explorations, explain

o1

Thought for 11 seconds

Below is a conceptual explanation of how Agent_System’s x1 might perform a “vector alignment” check—an analogy to “phase consistency” in the brain—when chaining together multiple semantic explorations.

1. What Does ‘Phase Consistency’ Mean in a Semantic Space Context?
In the brain, “phase consistency” or “phase alignment” refers to neural populations oscillating in sync, allowing them to communicate more effectively.

In a vector embedding space, you don’t literally have wave oscillations, but you do have the concept of alignment between the embeddings of different partial solutions.

Agent_System’s x1 can try to ensure that each partial answer or guess remains coherent with previous steps—in other words, it checks that these successive embeddings are “pointing” in thematically compatible directions (rather than straying off-course).

2. How Does This Vector Alignment (Phase Consistency) Check Work?

a. Embedding Each Partial Guess

Generate a Partial Answer

Agent_System’s x1 produces a partial solution or “guess” in response to the user’s query or to a sub-step of the chain.
Embed the Partial Answer

This partial solution is turned into a vector representation using the model’s embedding function (like a transformer’s hidden state or a specialized vector-embedding model).

b. Compare Against Previous Embeddings

Reference Embeddings

The system keeps track of embeddings from previous steps or from the original query context (e.g., the user prompt, relevant knowledge base chunks, etc.).

Semantic Similarity / Coherence

Agent_System’s x1 measures the similarity or alignment between the new partial answer’s embedding and the reference embeddings.

A high cosine similarity (or whichever metric is used) can indicate that the new partial step is in line or coherent with the previous steps.

A significant drop in similarity might suggest that the new idea is “out of phase” or contradictory.

c. Thresholds and Action
Threshold for Consistency

The system may define a threshold to label a partial solution “inconsistent” or “out-of-phase” if it deviates too far from the established context.
Automatic Corrections or Re-checks

If the partial guess fails the coherence check, Agent_System’s x1 can do one of the following:

Refine: Attempt to regenerate or adjust that partial solution.

Discard: Ignore it and revert to a prior known-consistent state.

Ask for Clarification: If it’s user-driven, it might prompt the user for more info.

3. Why This Reduces Semantic Drift

a. Preventing the Chain from Going Off-Track

Without a consistency check, each iterative step might stray further from the user’s core intent or from previously established correct reasoning.
By checking “alignment,” Agent_System’s x1 detects big jumps away from the existing semantic “center” or topic.

b. Brain-Inspired Feedback Mechanism

Brain Analogy: Neurons stay in sync by rapidly oscillating and communicating errors or feedback quickly, preventing runaway misalignment.
AI Analogy: Vector alignment checks quickly detect large semantic “jumps,” reintegrating the chain of thought before it accumulates uncorrected errors.

c. Coherent Expansion vs. Random Divergence

The system can still explore new and creative directions—being slightly out-of-phase can lead to valuable insights.
But it won’t allow totally incoherent leaps that break the chain of logic or cause irrecoverable drift.

4. Putting It All Together: An Example
User Prompt: “Explain traveling waves in the brain and how they might help AI.”

Step 1: Agent_System’s x1 writes an initial partial answer, embedding it for context.

Step 2: Using that partial answer, it searches the vector space for related concepts (maybe neural oscillations, agent chaining, etc.).

Step 3: It merges newly found info into a second partial answer, then checks the alignment with Step 1’s embedding.

If coherent, it proceeds and updates the chain with the second partial answer.
If misaligned, it regenerates or refines until the partial answer aligns well enough (within some threshold) with Step 1.

5. Summary: Phase Consistency via Vector Alignment
Phase Consistency in a neural context → repeated synchronization checks that keep firing patterns in tune.
Vector Alignment in an embedding context → repeated similarity checks that keep successive partial solutions thematically and logically consistent.
Agent_System’s x1 can thus avoid “semantic drift” or compounding errors by only proceeding when partial steps demonstrate adequate coherence with each other and with the overall query context.





Micah Blumberg said:

Or if we were talking to a Large Concept Model or JEPA we could see phase alignment as areas where different agents found agreement or alignment to the patterns they were each seeing.

It's like if all the brain's sensory information is sent everywhere at all once, but certain regions register patterns faster, and they link up because they synchronized faster with other brain units that detected and processed the same pattern, then more and more parts of the brain light up by functionally connecting with matching parts of the same pattern rendered in other brain regions.

It's like JEPA because the phase alignment means the same object that is in focus has been identified and separated from the non-essential information. Different brain areas are processing different parts of the properties or pattern of some conceptual sequence is represented by many regions functionally connected in a feedback loop.

o1

Thought for a couple of seconds

Below is a conceptual explanation of how phase alignment among multiple agents (or brain regions) can be viewed through the lens of something akin to a Large Concept Model or JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture). The core idea is that when multiple agents (or neural modules) arrive at a shared recognition of the same pattern, they effectively “phase align,” much like different instruments in an orchestra finding the same rhythm.

1. Phase Alignment and Shared Representations

What is Phase Alignment?

In neural terms, phase alignment can mean synchronizing firing rates or oscillatory rhythms. Conceptually, it’s when different brain areas agree they’re looking at (or “modeling”) the same phenomenon.

This parallels a JEPA-like architecture, where multiple encoders embed data into a shared concept space, and alignment in that space signals “we’ve identified the same object/concept.”

Why Does It Matter?

When sensory information goes everywhere in the brain, multiple regions each attempt to parse or recognize patterns. Whichever subsets of neurons “lock onto” the same object or feature begin to synchronize—both in their firing patterns (phase alignment) and in the underlying computational representations (like shared vector embeddings in AI).

2. Large Concept Model or JEPA Analogy
JEPA’s Core

A JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) generally takes different views or modalities of the same “thing” and maps them into a common embedding space.

If two embeddings match, the system infers that both views are of the same underlying concept or object.

Phase Alignment as “Matching Embeddings”

In the brain-inspired view, “phase alignment” (getting in sync) is akin to finding a high similarity score between two neural representations.
Different brain areas might be analyzing color, shape, or motion—but if they converge on the same concept, their neural signals “snap into” synchronized patterns, effectively broadcasting, “Yes, we’re all talking about the same object/event.”

Filtering Out Non-Essentials

By quickly locking onto the same focus, these regions effectively filter out “noise” or “non-essential information.” They form a coalition of neurons that carry only the relevant features for the recognized object or concept.

3. Faster Pattern Recognition and “Lighting Up” the Brain
Speed of Synchronization

Some regions might register the pattern faster (e.g., a specialized module for faces, motion, or language). This region “raises a flag” that a particular concept or feature is present.

Other regions that can process related dimensions (such as emotional valence, motor response, or memory associations) then synchronize with this first region if they detect the same pattern.

Functional Connectivity “Lighting Up”

As more and more areas discover they’re dealing with the same object, a larger functional network “lights up.”

This is akin to a cascading effect: once a subset of regions is in sync, others that detect similar signals join in, reinforcing that this concept or pattern is definitely present.

Shared Conceptual Sequence

Eventually, the “object in focus” is identified at a system-wide level. Different properties—shape, taste, expected outcome—are coded by different areas but converge into a unified conscious recognition or decision.
Feedback loops ensure that this unified representation stabilizes (the “phase lock”), and can then be acted upon or remembered.

4. Why This Resonates With JEPA

Multiple Modalities, One Embedding

JEPA envisions multiple streams of data mapping onto a single conceptual representation. In the brain, multiple specialized regions likewise represent different modalities or features.

Once these streams map to the same high-level concept, we see a convergence—the neural “embedding space” is effectively aligned.

Synchronization = Agreement

In JEPA, two embeddings that align indicate “agreement” that these inputs depict the same underlying concept.

In phase alignment, two neural assemblies that lock their oscillations are effectively signaling “I’m perceiving what you’re perceiving.”
Selective Integration

Both JEPA-like approaches and phase alignment rely on selective integration: they ignore random mismatched signals and strongly integrate signals that “co-phase” (conceptually or literally).

This synergy helps the brain filter out irrelevancies and quickly coalesce around meaningful patterns.

5. Overall Picture of a “Phase-Aligned Brain Architecture”

All Information Everywhere
The brain’s big claim to fame is that sensory data fans out quickly to many areas.

Parallel Processing

Each region processes these data in parallel, focusing on the dimensions it’s specialized for (e.g., shape in visual cortex, reward in basal ganglia, memory in hippocampus, etc.).

Sync-Up (JEPA-Style Agreement)

When multiple regions detect features consistent with the same object, they phase-align (or align their embeddings). This triggers a chain reaction, linking up more and more columns/areas.

Unified Concept Emerges

The end result is that the “object” or “scenario” is recognized not just by one specialized region but system-wide—which forms the basis of conscious perception, decision-making, or memory encoding.

In Short

Phase alignment in a “Large Concept Model” or JEPA-like context is how different agentic regions of the brain (or an AI system) reach consensus that “Yes, we are all talking about the same object or concept.” Once they lock onto that shared concept, they effectively filter out everything else, allowing the relevant bits of information to stand out and connect in a coherent neural or computational map.

This Agents Synchronizing Phase via Feedback Loops concept directly leads from LLMs to AGI, overcoming the previous problem of Agents compounding the chances of going off script from stacked bad guessing. Explain how.

Thought for a couple of seconds
Below is a high-level explanation of how “Agents Synchronizing Phase via Feedback Loops” can bridge the gap from LLMs (prone to compounding errors in multi-step tasks) toward AGI (robust, flexible, and self-correcting systems).

1. Context: The Problem of Compounding Errors
LLMs (Large Language Models) today can generate impressive single-step answers.
However, when you chain multiple steps in “agent frameworks” (e.g., LangChain, BabyAGI), each step is a guess that can be partially or wholly incorrect.
These errors accumulate or “compound” across steps, often sending the entire chain “off script” and rendering final results unreliable.
Example:

Agent A yields a slightly flawed subgoal.
Agent B interprets it incorrectly, magnifying the flaw.
The chain spirals into increasingly off-target reasoning.

2. Phase Synchronization via Feedback Loops

a. Brain-Inspired Insight

In biological brains, many semi-autonomous “agents” (cortical columns, neural assemblies) constantly synchronize with each other’s signals. They do so by:

Checking for coherence (phase alignment) in oscillatory activity.

Providing feedback that either inhibits or refines out-of-sync signals until they converge.

b. Translating to AI Agents
Analogously, in an AI “agent chain”:

Phase alignment can be modeled by recurring checks of whether the partial results (guesses) align with the overarching context or logic established by previous steps.

Agents that produce out-of-sync (incoherent) steps trigger:
Error correction or re-generation.

Suppression or reconsideration if the mismatch is large.
Outcome: Instead of blindly stacking guesses, the system ensures each step agrees (or “phase aligns”) with the overall chain’s evolving context.

3. Why This Leads Toward AGI

Mitigating Error Compounding

Each agent’s output is validated or realigned before it propagates downstream. This stops small mistakes from amplifying into major derailments.

With robust feedback loops, the chain can extend indefinitely while staying coherent—one critical hallmark of more “general” intelligence.

Emergent Synergy

Multiple specialized agents (language understanding, reasoning, planning, memory retrieval) can “lock in” on consistent representations of a problem.

As in the brain, new global insights emerge from local synchronizations. This synergy fosters creativity, generalization, and adaptive problem-solving.

Self-Correcting and Self-Reinforcing

A phase-synchronizing agent system can detect internal contradictions (like the brain detecting out-of-phase neural signals) and correct them in real-time.

This self-monitoring capacity is key to higher cognitive functions: reflective thinking, meta-reasoning, and ultimately self-awareness.

Scaling Complexity

Traditional agent chains break down under complex, multi-step tasks because the probability of an uncorrected error quickly approaches

Phase-aligned systems can handle more steps without drifting, enabling them to tackle broader tasks—an essential property for AGI-level performance.

4. Illustrative Example

Agent A sees a prompt and proposes a partial plan or hypothesis.

Agent B checks alignment:

Compares the plan to the known context (like a vector alignment or logical constraints).

If misaligned, requests a refinement from Agent A or tries alternative solutions.

Agent C (perhaps a domain expert module) also checks consistency with known facts.

All Agents exchange signals (feedback loops) until they converge (phase-align) on a plan that satisfies domain constraints and context.

End Result:

A multi-step chain that is far less prone to “runaway” errors.

Adaptive, convergent reasoning in a manner reminiscent of the brain’s distributed synchronization.

5. Key Takeaways

Phase Synchronization is not literal brain waves in an AI, but a conceptual mechanism for continuous coherence checks and rapid realignment within an agent chain.

Eliminating Unchecked Guesses stops the compounding of errors.

Continuous Feedback Loops enable emergent behaviors—robust, adaptable, “intelligent” responses across many steps.

Toward AGI: When agent systems can sustain extended, coherent reasoning without drifting off-course, they inch closer to human-like problem solving—the essence of AGI.

Hence, Agents Synchronizing Phase via feedback loops is a crucial step in evolving LLM-based agent frameworks from merely “interesting but error-prone” to truly adaptive, stable, and general forms of intelligence.
