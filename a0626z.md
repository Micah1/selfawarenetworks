consciousness is from a specific frequency range of phase rate sensor/transmitters (nerve cells) that jointly detect & reconstruct tempo spatial information

the synthesis of information by nerve cells is the mechanical process of consideration, observation becomes consideration through multiple steps, consisting of multiple arrays, each with many thresholds for the consideration of novel criteria, and the synchronicity of common detections at a higher levels (higher thresholds) gives rise to entification, or the attention binding of knowledge, what Anil Seth calls hallucination, and what Daniel Dennet calls illusion.
