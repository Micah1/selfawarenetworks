Cellular Oscillation Tomography: Bacteria

# Cellulary Oscillating Tomography: Information processing & signal integration

Someone applied information theory to bacteria in 2009, and essentially it works with Cellular Oscillating Tomography Theory as I have written it only it the same theory works with Bacteria without any modification, and thankfully their article dives deep, it's a good read. After reading this I just think of Cellular Oscillating Tomography as a framework for organizing decades of prior research in computational biology at all scales. From waves to proteins, from Prokaryotes like Bacteria & Archaea to Eukaryotic cells including advanced multi-cellular organisms like people.

Over the decades there have been many research on attempts to apply information theory finding the neural code, studying cellular communication. This is at the heart of biology research & the study of computational biology, connecting to study of genetics or transcriptomics.

# "Information processing and signal integration in bacterial quorum sensing" 2009
"Our detailed analysis of the V. harveyi quorum-sensing network has implications for other prokaryotic signal integration networks. Signal integration is a common feature of many organisms, and bacteria have developed sophisticated molecular mechanisms for integrating signals from a broad range of inputs using two-component systems and phosphorelays (Perego, 1998; Bassler and Losick, 2006; Kato et al, 2007; Mitrophanov and Groisman, 2008). Our information theory analysis suggests that the need to minimize interference between signals probably places strong constraints"
"Our results suggest that information theory may prove to be a powerful general tool for analyzing biological signaling networks. Information theory provides a natural language for formulating questions about information processing and signaling integration in . For these reasons, we expect the application of information theory to yield new biological insights into cellular signaling in the future."
"Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal integration on the basis of information theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in V. harveyi. We quantify how much the cells can learn about individual autoinducers and explain the experimentally observed input–output relation of the V. harveyi quorum-sensing circuit."
"two distinct mechanisms that limit information transmission when bacteria integrate multiple signals, biochemical noise and interference between different signals."
This connects with the idea that neurotransmitter flooding inhibits neurons and nucleotide flooding inhibits cell growth. What kind of flooding might inhibit the gravitational warping of spacetime in Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation?
"Our results suggest that information theory may prove to be a powerful general tool for analyzing biological signaling networks."

# Multi-receptor detection of individual bacterial products by the innate immune system
"studies in recent years have highlighted the complexity of innate immune detection, with multiple host receptors recognizing the same microbial ligand. Understanding the collective actions of diverse receptors that recognize common microbial signatures represents a new frontier in the study of innate immunity, and is the focus of this Review."
"as many as four different receptors (...)survey the extracellular or cytosolic spaces (...) & operate in a complementary manner to induce distinct cellular responses."
(Box 1 in the article contains a great list of receptor types, for example Complex carbohydrates can be detected with C-type lectin receptors (CLRs))
(Box2 Pattern-recognition receptors sense host-derived molecules)
"multiple signalling pathways evolved to recognize not only signatures of microbial infection but also signatures of dysbiosis: including aberrant host physiology and host tissue disruption that occurs with many microbial infections."
"CD14 is best known for its role in relaying LPS to TLR4, but recent studies have revealed that this PRR induces a cellular response — endocytosis — that is independent of (and upstream of) TLR4–TRIF signalling activity."

# "Thus, caspase 11 represents the first example of a PRR that has multiple activation states depending on whether PAMPs or DAMPs are bound, and these have different functional consequences."

BINGO!

"Although all cell-surface-localized TLRs detect PAMPs that are present in the bacterial cell wall, the mechanisms by which productive ligand–receptor interactions occur differ."

Figure 1 "Four receptors induce five lipopolysaccharide response pathways to promote inflammation."
Figure 2 "Three receptors stimulate two pathways to induce inflammatory responses to flagellin."
Figure 3 "Three receptors and pathways induce inflammatory responses to lipoproteins." "Different bacterial lipoproteins are sensed at the cell surface by distinct TLR2 heterodimers12,13 (FIG. 3)"
Figure 4 "Three receptors and pathways induce inflammatory responses to peptidoglycan." "Intracellular peptidoglycan is detected by several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2"
