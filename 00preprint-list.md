This is a list of the pdf file that have been published here as peer reviewed preprints, intended for future publication in other scientific journals, while all the published documents in the main directory are public, published, and time-stamped by Github, this special list of pre-prints denotes documents that are intended to be submitted to other peer-reviewed publications, or scientific journals, such as ArXiV, Nature, etc...

The first paper that has been prepare to be published in this way is Micah's New Law of Thermodynamics.

Note:
This Self Aware Networks Institute GitHub Repo is now officially declared to a pre-print server and peer-reviewed scientific journal equivalent to websites like ARXIV. You can review any of the notes, or pdf's, submit comments, submit corrections.

I recommend that you publish your articles & notes on GitHub first as it is functionally and anatomically isomorphic to publishing in any scientific journal. Github preserves the time of upload and it tracks any changes that are also time stamped as a matter of public record. This serves the same function as uploading your work to ArXiv or a journal like Nature, it serves the same function as publishing your work as a book or in a Newspaper, and anatomically the material evidence that proves your authorship has identical weight to publishing anywhere else. In theory you strengthen the ability of your work to survive by publishing in multiple sources. It remains possible that Microsoft could be nuked for example, in that case GitHub would cease to exist, so if you publish your work in many other places that preserves the chances your words, and the proof of your authorship lives on.

Later on you can reference your github files in peer reviewed Journals, and draw links between what you can prove that you wrote in the past, allowing you to prove authorship when you finally start sharing your work more broadly with the Scientific Community.
