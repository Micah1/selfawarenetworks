Electromagnetism vs Magnetism vs Electricity

Think about the fact that opposite charges attract each other,

imagine that a neuron is gradually collecting charges but it's process is displacing positive & negative ions, polarizing positive & negative ions which creates a sort of kinetic threshold of stored potential that is increasing over time, eventually resulting in a collapse, like a blown circuit, where an action potential event happens, or a lightning strike happens, or an avalanche on a mountain happens, a tipping point event.

So the ionic gradient is constantly readying the neuron to fire when its not firing and not being inhibited.

What is tripping the circuit breaker however is 

It's not just when the action potential fires, it's by how many other receptors it touches and what frequency changing messages it is giving them, whether that message

because neurons transmit frequencies to other neurons, but they have collective learning patterns, neurons that fire together learn the same patterns together, so that patterns live in the oscillations memory, distributed many times across the entire oscillation, so that the learn patterns have invariant neural representation.
