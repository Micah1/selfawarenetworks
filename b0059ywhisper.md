Title: Scale

In b0059y I make a bunch of predictions about the structure of the functional brain but they need citations.

I think I can write this software because the representation of neurons are of what signal

a neuron represents at a given point in time.

And the signal that it represents at a given point in time is what's going to be passing

on to its array, and that array is going to be passing that on to the next array.

And so the patterns that fire in the next array represent a sort of chunked up pattern

because the pattern was sort of like analyzed to a certain granularity of detail and then

magnified, sort of, or you could also think of that as like, brought into larger scale

focus.

So when a pattern moves to the second array, it magnifies, it goes into a larger scale,

and we get to measure scale patterns, right, and then, so there's three scales of patterns,

there's microscale patterns, measure scale patterns, and macroscale patterns, right.

But technically everything in between as well, technically everything in between, I just

wanted to paint the sort of scope of the range, so you can sort of understand the range.

And so it's like, there's micro, there's measure scale, there's macroscale patterns,

there's everything in between, and so you have, the large scale features would be like

different places that you can go to, different locations, different cities, different buildings

inside different cities, those are large scale information configurations, and macroscale

and mesoscale stuff, but where you are relative to some particular facility, that's micro

scale information, right there, so that activity is your life in the moment perspective, it's

based on your senses, it changes really fast, so that's micro scale activity, because it

has to change really fast, and the stuff that is rendered by it, like, so imagine that your

brain is sort of like, also divided into micro scale, macroscale, and mesoscale graphs,

and so you can, so you can basically say that you have,

you can almost, you can almost say like, if you match your, you can say like the outer,

the outer part of your neocortex, the sixth layer, like that, maybe like, where you would

represent that macroscale, it's in the slower, but the highest layer, the sixth layer, so

you have more, you can go to the pyramidal cells, to the interneurons, to the thalamus,

when you get to the thalamic bridges, things weird about like the delta frequency, right,

it's a much slower frequency, the top of the, the sixth layer, it kind of, it moves more

slowly, it's lower frequency, higher amplitude, and I think it has more of the observer of

the macroscale patterns, right, and then I think of, I think you're going to have this

like, gradient towards the center of the brain, where you're going to have like, theta is

going to be a little bit lower than delta, and we're going to have alpha, and then theta,

and then, so we have the gamma, and then the high gamma, et cetera, so, but it's interesting

that there are gamma, where there's, so there's like a low 40 hertz gamma in the delta frequency

range that shows up, it's very interesting, that it doesn't, so, but I would say, I would

suspect that the high frequency gamma happens the most often in the alpha, in the first

layer of cortex, in the, near the thalamus, near the bottom of the thalamus, or the incoming

senses, and you can have a lot of alpha waves down there, and then maybe the high phasic,

highest phasic, gamma burst, so, I don't know, I don't know for sure if that's right, but

it's just a hypothesis, it's going to be like, this rate is like, the frequency gets reduced

over time, but the amplitude goes up, and that means that the, the sixth layer is like

the observer, and, or the, like the, it's like the, that's where the, it's like, it's

like when you look around the world, imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull

a little bit, right, the stuff in the, like in the background, in the distance, at the

macro scale, like the horizon, and then, you know, it's like the bridge in the distance,

that's like the, in the sky, that's the macro scale, the sky and the land, that's the macro

scale, the scene, the background, right, and then the stuff in the middle is like, there's

the buildings, there's the city, there's the people, this is the mezzo scale, right, and

then down, of course, the, the micro scale is down where the bugs are, or, or even more

micro than that, right, the nano, there's the nano scale, so you can, the quantum scale,

you can get down there too, but it's, it's, um, it's just really kind of like interesting

to think that I have a specific sense of scale, right, right, like this planet looks like

it's huge, but that's just my sense of scale, right, so like this sense of scale is just

a perspective.
