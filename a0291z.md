(field, oscillat, tomography, neuralink, super position, emotion, cortex) alzheimers has oscillatory brain changes really specific ones, your peak alpha frequency shifts

    - if you have this particular hippocampal wave ripple phenomema, electromagnetic wave signature
      - fwr thumbprints of disease in brainwaves
    - You are only actually using a subset of coding genes at a particular time in your life.
  - alzhierms has oscillatory brain changes really specific ones, your peak alpha frequency shifts
    - In terms of talking about changing psychiatric understanding of psychoactive drugs from a perspective of whole brain computational neuroscience electromagnetic imaging, and neuromodulation.
    - Neurophysics approach to reinterpreting neuro drug action or brain drug action in its real complexity
    - In psychiatry there are big problems we know that there are a lot of drugs that affect the brain, and the fact that we don't have any new drugs coming from the pharmacuetical industry we can follow on Tim Ferris's coat tails.
    - How well can we see cortical brain activity
    - Harvard work in terms of temporal interference transcranial stimulation
    - leverage Morgan's experience in terms of whole brain conductivity mapping EIT for transcranial deep brain electrical stimulation and high resolution EEG that's your sensing system, and your injection system. You need to do the conductivity mapping. You need to be injecting current at different locations and have them temporarily super imposed deep in the brain.
    - To do that means that you know, if I inject current at this scalp electrode, the wave from it is going to be cresting in the amygdala. You need to do that with multiple scalp electrodes. I know the electrical properties of that person's piece of meat & skull so that you can have all the current injections, all the waves that you are injecting into the head can all be cresting at the same time deep in the brain at the same time. 3 or more different waves to all be raising at the same time only in the amygdala. 
    - "Temporal interference TES super position of multiple wave crests makes it so that you have stimulation in deep tissue and no intervening, Cell paper June 1rst
    - Suresh by moving down to New Zealand. has papers with David Wiley, he was an advisor at Electric Geodesics
    - Ayawasca alter's brain
    - Its pretty obvious, Robin Carhart Harris and David Nutt, they've been the early proponents of hey we should treat psychedelics as something that is for research worthy work, always turning to brain imagers in terms of what the hell is this doing, bringing Suresh in was the smartest thing they did.
    - Suresh cites one of his own papers, tsaiki and wolf science? his 2018 paper 1 over 5 spectra drug induced states. Is it funny when researchers cite their own papers.
    - A post doc does EEG, they've taken figure 2. I know how to use the EEG tool lab toolbox. They have lentil.
    - I can see David Wiley's finger marks
    - Brad Voytek 1/F stuff, 
    - Projects
      - The long story there was that it would help us to emphasize the kind of neurophysics approach to pharmacological EEG.
      - focus on developing the neuro
      - how does the cell level influence the system level
      - the whole brain eeg, how does 
      - the ai would run a search program to affect the human brainwave state, AI could drive a person into a lucid dream state, through audio, visual and brain stimulation
      - you are going to want to have the data that Morgan is talking about like what is dreaming
      - Multi-dimensional representation that maps to a set of a smaller set of cognitive bias
      - How we operationalize, this is how cognitive neuroscientists operationalize cognitive bias, yes no decisions we have to study it, gambling tasks, we need to assign quantitative values to the decisions you are making
      - operationalize all the stuff you are talking about in terms of loss avoidance
      - traders loss adverse
      - that means they did the subjects become very conservative in their loss risk?
      - you can figure that out mathematically, have them make 100 decisons, 100 bets, their cognitive bias will come out,
      - avoiding loss 
      - computational concept, 
      - to operationalize this you made a stupid task, betting stock broker type tasks we need people to make short term value judgments on a repeated basis to figure to figure out what their bias is
      - if we make these multiplayer
      - Virginia Tech, Steve Laquant
      - What they do give you is an operational bias estimator
      - I can turn that stuff that docs been talking about, you play this game for half an hour and I can figure out what your bias is, if its a two player game, where you have the option of collaborating or competing you have people who will burn their partner for a short term game even though long term this is a non-optimal strategy
      - The one that you are talking about currently is this one called: An adaptive individualized FMRI delay discounting procedure to 
      - how do we estimate these kinds of cognitive bias in as shortest time as possible for this subject
      - FMRI points to a 
      - if I could point you to the 2nd paper. the paper 
      - pupillary correlates of computations underlying human response behavior
      - these are oxford psychiatry people, 
      - smaller amounts of money now or larger after a delay
      - delay discounting tasks, reported various contrasts
      - Dversky his research guide in all this. I think of their work in terms of reaction time analysis, pupil time, reaction time, pupillary response
      - their pioneering methods in behavioral economics tests
      - Wrapped up in what doc what talking about.
      - having people talk about money?
      - here we report pupillary correlates of the computations human response behavior, in which the opponents facial emotions and their offer amounts were drawn probabilistic based on their decisions
      - modelling
      - regardless of what they think consciously they are being influenced by me putting a face on this task
      - if I take faces out of this task we can put it down to loss aversion
      - a game where you can save people or kill them to save other people, 
      - violate the assumptions of the rational actor model
      - all offers should be accept irrespective of the authors facial expression
      - If we build it there is a chance Google will be interested
      - they really didn't think they could get this from mobile data
      - Get the California Surgeon General, if we are already
      - Get the demo up, startup? leeway? we need to dev contacts with subjects, healthy controls
      - quantitative self noo tropic experimenters
      - likely to go through regular drug approval,
      - approval to import docs drugs under dea procedures
      - do a lot of documentation, this amount of compound x, none of it can disappear
      - cocaine as a lab drug
      - how prepared we are to having 12k a month in revenue.
      - startup you don't know how long its going to take to do the new thing that you are going to do
      - we could order the tms, the eye tracking the eeg setting that up, training people to use it, and getting back office stuff necessary for running this business
      - that would all be a pre-requisite to doing 12k a month turn over
      - 6months to a year to get the kind of regulatory approval and all our ducks in a row to be doing brisque sales and participant testing
      - trained procedures for staff to follow
      - you want to set up the franchize so someone else can run the fulltime lab operation
      - set up an experiment so someone 
      - ramping up experiement time
      - when everyone is signed off on the exper
      - the analysis is doing what it is supposed to be doing
      - then you train lab assistants to run the subjects
      - you are collecting subjects for the next year
      - in this case, child mind institute is this ongoing thing, it's not just the 100 or 200 that we collect, the yare always going to be comparable to the 2000 or 3000 that NY is collecting, that's for starters,
      - how important it will really be to have the same people come back and fall sleep
      - both EEG systems
      - get the drug session for another day, coming in for 2-4 different drugs, pharmaceutical
      - we are trying to find psychoactive drugs that change your brain dynamics, capture that, and build the bigger picture across lots of different, now we have seen your brain in many many different states, we want to be in the best position to talk about what is your resting brain state, what would be our best model based evidence for how it should be modified,
      - we will have this huge database to compare it with for people who get labeled with diagnosis, and maybe there will be spectral similarities
      - there will be a personalized precision model of your brain activity
      - All of the other documents #soon
      - Testing
        - People
        - When we program you into particular states there will be biological addition physiological response, eeg heart rate, galvanic skin response.
        - A lot of drugs make people anxious
        - there are people who are stopping to take drugs because they get too anxious
        - the pharmacological interaction is still working but its still stuck in a rut
        - we will be collecting more than just EEG, heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, fnirs, 
        - the best way to get someone interested in something is to build something that they want to be apart of it.
        - brain training/ neuromodulation field
        - It's built on a couple key pillars. Like high density electro (down the road magnetic also) imaging, whole brain computational modelling, cellular level model of psychiatric states and pharmalogical interactions, and mapping neurotransmitter effects during sleep cycles? what is our deliverable? what we are hoping to offer people? What our value proposition, individuals would pay $1000. Oh Morgan everything you are saying is right but its too much data to collect, too complicated in analysis pipeline, 
        - We are in the Stone Age of brain science, but with Neuralink and Openwater we are looking at the coming of an Industrial age for brain science
        - CMS so that we find patients who will come back repeatedly, we need people who can stick with the program, self experimenters, quantitative self people. We need a meetup that is about people who are committed long term self-experient.
        - We what we are interested in is people coming in for 5 sessions over multiple weeks?
        - bringing us up to where neuroimaging is currently
        - they've done all these studies for 20-40 people,
        - the tasks that they have people do with EEG and MRI are still very amenable to cellular based analysis
        - the other thread here that has really come out in the past 2 years, collecting a lot within the subjects data, russ poldrac at Stanford started the center for reproducable neuroscience, scanned himself daily for a year, with an MRI machine, 
        - talk to him for a podcast and a Neurotech talk and news
        - really thinking outside our traditional data collection we can start to imagine what is really possible, what if we could put an MRI on someone's head while they walked around during their regular days.
        - Jack Gallant, his stuff that is focused on v1 v2 v3 visual cortex, 
        - Higher order associative areas vs early visual areas have done YOLO meaning is an algorithm in computer vision, because its opensource a lot of people run yolo on visual scenes and it does object segmentation
        - it doesn't have any training data so thats why its training data, it's from 
        - We've got face areas.
        - It was only the 1920s that brain surgery changed from being more likely to kill you, about a 100 years of being more likely to kill you if we opened up your skull
        - People like Cullen Spectre present visual stimulai to get your face area mapped out.
        - Do we want to have a phone call about everything we
        - our inkling about what we can offer that's different and valuable
        - propose that we are not talking about doing any drug stuff for six months to a year just because Morgan doesn't see how we get all our ducks in a row such that we can say that we are ready to use that,
        - what is his interest, are we just buying compounds from him and that's it, or does he want to actually put up the money to support a lab, does he want a lab?
        - Morgan Hough is putting together a story for what we can do with this, to some degree, why he should want to do this with us, sort of like lets imagine that we are trying to get investors and his compounds are just the examples, what we would be really saying is that together with the kind of community of people that we could get coming back
        - what exactly are we saying in terms of clinical trials? does Doc Zee
        - Not trying to get 600 people to drop acid and see if they are happy, or cognitive bias testing.
        - Can we get the same subjects to take multiple drugs,
        - computational modelling of personality, and cognitive bias, 
        - you are a friendly person means you are more likely to share stuff, you are more likely to see or do delayed gratification, by having
        - what Doc brings are multiple compounds that have different affects. if we can get the same people to come back in and have different drugs and be ready to assess them and have different metrics to have brain imagining,
        - this is our true deliverable,
        - we want a precision, brain model, brain behavior model for each person, wake, sleep, potentially inbetween, anethetics, dissociatives and psychedelics, interested in, plays to the strengths of docs synthetics, we want drugs that have a big effect with a single dose,
        - if psychiatry was bolder it would be using more powerful drugs to explore a person's brain space
        - it would feedback on us in terms of their response to each of these drugs is going to tell us something
        - how do people respond differently to different drugs
        
        - and the differential drug interaction with ritalin
        - and the procedural generation
        - alcohol flush reaction
        - a profile across a number of different reactions
        - the brain is so much more 
        - what's the equivalent of tapping the knee bone, what are the neural correlates of that?
        - what we actually want to do is something more like what allergists do, or even more like what cardiologists do
        - a stress test, multiple medical discipline analogies about what we need to bring to brain medication, lower hanging 
        - minimum viable product, what machine, what researcher
        - hey getting to what Doc was theorizing? 
        - what is numbers, if we can get 100 people to pay 500 a month, 
        - are people wiling to pay 300
        - 50 people a month to pay  250 dollars, we would come out at 12k a month
        - 2 people a day max, collecting the data is time consuming
        - we want people
        - we need a loung in the clinic so people stick around a long time so we can operate slowly as needs to be
        - if we can get those people to come back
        - my perspective is how we can do the customer management solution, one office person, plus experimenter tech, two people a day, then you need
        - a morning subject, and an evening subject
        - getting people to come in at 5 or 6pm and people will fall asleep in the chair, it opens us up to people who work 9 to 5.
        - Overlapping hours, have 2 patients at the same time, 
        - all the documents we need to have checked off for each patient, modelling it on the lab, what Gazzlab is asking for, what Morgan would do, its partly practical and partly
        - want to be collecting the same data at minimum the same data they are collecting at Child Mind Institute,
        - finding out how to run a TMS clinic because that will give you all the admin software what we need, are there enterprise solutions for this? Can we make this someone elses problem. Cloud solutions for running a TMS clinic that includes insurance reimbursement
        - semi treatment with a research component who will sihn offon it psychiatrist
        - this is where we could add value

        - EGI-electrical stimulation, conductivity mapping, trying to map electrical mapping
        - Olivia davide 2nd paper, put the tms coil on a robot, move it around, recording the eeg, tomography from moving tms, flash photograph from differents perspectives, put the coil over the motor cortex to connect with the eeg twitch
        - great comment from bixom at neurological "we know a lot about tdcs's effects on tms"
        - what nih, we don't understand tms effects on tms? tms is a physics tool, stop thinking of it as a controlled brain blast, a physics tool, your brains response to this blast
        - tms-eeg, pharmaco-eeg is a thing because your eeg spectra changes when you take drugs
        - sleep eeg, tms eeg and pharmaco eeg, having a real physics cellular model of whole brain electrical 
        - no one is trying to make a single head brain model
        - subcortical electrode paper we have a bunch of patients 3 that have subcortical electrodes, high density, if we use our intracranial measure as our aggressor, we are sensitve to that deep activity
        - if you try to do the same thing without that intracranial electrode
        - you can't hear that deep.
        - everything with superficial cortex is so much louder.
        - higher 
        - this is why we can change things
        - totally change the field, collecting sleep data on the same subject
        - sleep data, tms eeg data, eit,what we pioneered at electrical geodesics, EIT-EEG we inject electricity into the head, figuring out physics properties of the meat in between, if we do that we are in a better position to to noninvasive targeted deep brain stimulation and diagnosis, 
        - diagnosis, accelelate ways to diagnose patients early
        - we can do alzheimers, early alzheimers diagnosis, prognostic diagnosis,
        - with the ability, the hard part, by our ability to detect subcortical brain activity non-invasively
        - that includes the need to make it necessary to EIT, 
        - you can analyze someone's gate to detect dimensia
        - psychiatry is not a branch of medicine, to give psychiatrists the ability to collect data from the object of interest
        - we are not looking for a cheap alternative to give the field for the very first time to give people a prognostic marker of disease
        - alzheimers has only been diagnosed post mordem
        - pet imaging, and stuff like that allows you to say you have Alzheimer 
        - Lauren Frank paper hardcore uscf neurology
        - here are some world renowned experts that we could talk to separately that are not involved and we could get their opinion. they could be participants, Dave Wiley, rests more on the data collection, 
        - what I am trying to give you is a viable somewhat tomorrow timeline if we could connect these various datasets, Morgan has been working on related projects for 25 years
        - Christian beckmen resting state analysis
        - ICA is widely applied in EEG for artifact removal.
        - Christian beckmen guassian gara mixture model ICA components, bayesian model doing hypothesis, add a gamma in the tail, then you do a model comparison, the model with and without the gamma distribution, given the small penalty, you've added a gamma so you have lost a degree of freedom.
        - do I have a better distribution of the __ with the gamma included, you've got no signal? 1 over f with alpha beta frequencies
        - 1/f fit non-oscillatory, multiple lorenzian fit of how many lorenzians do I need to add to explain all the oscillatory peaks in that subject. some people have a beta peak and how some people don't. os is my power spectra explained better with an additional power component or not
        - collecting the data as fast as possible,
        - 1000 samples per second limit
        - we want to well characterize that subjects alpha. 
        - Go Forward, VR Health Institute tests, measure gasses, heart rate while running, eye tracking, video of gate, tms-eeg, bmi fat/muscle percentages, blood tests, VR interaction eye tracking, stress test and create a program where people come, and the idea is that people come in once a year? split it into one hour blocks
        - The space would have a treadmill, a fitness room, an examination room, quest diagnostic
        - longevity blood tests? dna tests, crisper kits
