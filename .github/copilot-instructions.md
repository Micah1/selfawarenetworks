# Copilot house rules for this repo

Priorities
- Keep it concise and factual; this repo is prose-heavy (Markdown first).
- Prefer making small, reversible changes. Suggest diffs.
- When adding files, include a one-line purpose at the top.
- For links, use HTTPS where possible.

Style
- Markdown headings start at level 2 inside docs, level 1 only for file titles.
- Wrap lines ~100 chars max where readable.
- Bullet lists over long paragraphs when summarizing.

Reviews
- Point out broken links, missing references, or duplicate docs.
- Flag large unreviewed PDFs; prefer linking to canonical sources.
- If unsure about scientific claims, request citation or mark as TODO.

Tests and CI
- This repo uses CI to lint Markdown and check links. Keep CI green.
- Avoid adding heavy languages/deps without discussion; propose first.
