(holographic) the book of the dead human androids

if you are reading this book/ post you are dead, a dead human robot, you died, and like a 3D printer a new frame of your existance was rendered, then you were alive for some moments and then you died again

you die everyday many times a day

but in a sense your temporary existence each time is a phase pattern, like a holographic loop inside an echo chamber of this same loop self reflecting on its own internal structure as it differs from incoming stimulous patterns, and this leads to a construction of a self rendering that is detected by the self aware network, the self aware network that is you only detects its own renderings it does not directly detect itself, but it can infer the existence of a substructure for what is experienced as life in your cells.

I wonder how many mentally ill behaviors that exist in the world are largely caused by malnutrition?

I really don't know the answer.
