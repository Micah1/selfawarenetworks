# SCP Slow Cortical Potential

"The Slow Cortical Potential (SCP) is a potential shift of the electrical activity in the brain lasting
from several hundred milliseconds to several seconds. The user can learn to voluntary influence the
cortical positivity/negativity.  
The SCP can be generated even if the motor periphery is completely disconnected from the central
nervous system. It can be used as a binary signal, using a certain amplitude threshold as selection
criterion [24], but can be artificially extended to offer more choices like in figure 2.15." from "Pioneering research into

"3.2. Slow Cortical Potentials (SCPs)
SCPs are slow voltage shifts in the EEG that last a second to several seconds. SCPs belong to the part of the EEG signals below 1 Hz [116]. SCPs are associated with changes in the level of cortical activity."

"Negative SCPs correlate with increased neuronal activity, whereas positive SCPs coincide with decreased activity in individual cells [116]."

These brain signals can be self-regulated by both healthy users and paralyzed patients to control external devices by means of a BCI. SCP shifts can be used to move a cursor and select the targets presented on a computer screen [117].

People can be trained to generate voluntary SCP changes using a thought-translation device [117]. The thought-translation device is a tool used for self-regulation SCP training, which shows visual-auditory marks so that the user can learn to shift the SCP. The thought-translation device typically comprises a cursor on a screen in such a way that the vertical position of the cursor constantly reflects the amplitude of SCP shifts. Although most thought-translation devices show continuous feedback, it is possible to train SCP self-modulation in the absence of continuous feedback [118].

Success in SCP self-regulation training depends on numerous factors, such as the patient’s psychological and physical state, motivation, social context, or the trainer-patient relationship [117]. It is known that the learning capability of the user drastically affects SCP modulation training. Self-regulation training is therefore strongly recommended for patients at the early stage of a progressive disease [117]. Furthermore, initial SCP modulation skills have an effect on future performance following training [119]. Therefore, the value of SCPs as a suitable control signal for each patient can only be determined on the basis of initial trials. Other factors, such as sleep quality, pain, and mood also have an influence on self-regulation performance [117]. Their effects are not identical for all patients and further investigation is certainly needed to establish general rules on this matter.

Self-regulation of SCPs has been tested extensively with patients suffering from ALS [120–122]. Typical accuracy rates achieved for SCP classification are acceptable and vary between 70 and 80 per cent, but the rates of information provided by SCP-based BCI are relatively low. Besides, longer training is required to use SCP-based BCI and it is likely that users will need continuous practice for several months."


# "Neurons of the cerebral cortex exhibit precise interspike timing in correspondence to behavior" (2005) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16339894/

"In the cerebral cortex, where each nerve cell is affected by thousands of others, it is the common belief that the exact time of a spike is random up to an averaged firing rate over tens of milliseconds."

"We show that times of spikes can be very precise."

"In a brain slice, precise time relations of several neurons have been observed."

"Here we show () time intervals between spikes, measured in correspondence to a specific behavior, may be controlled to within the milliseconds range."

"most nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other by standard pulses called action potentials (or spikes)"

"However, if time relations among different neurons could be precisely controlled and read out, complex representations could be built from simpler ones efficiently and very fast"

"In a brain slice, precise time relations among several neurons have been observed"

"Could this phenomenon be also observed in brains of behaving animals?"

"We show, ()when time intervals between spikes of different neurons are measured in correspondence to a specific behavior, timing may be controlled to the milliseconds range with the best case reaching 0.5 ms."

"However, there are cellular mechanisms and experimental artifacts that may generate precise spike timing. These include the following: (i) neurons can recover rapidly from the refractory period; (ii) spike intervals within a burst may repeat with high precision; (iii) periodic activity driven by internal pace-maker processes (not due to network oscillations); (iv) dead time for spike detection when recording is made through the same electrode; (v) sharp on or off responses to an external stimulus with abrupt onset (or offset).

# "An electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia model for exploring the genesis of slow potentials in the brain" (2021) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34270543/

"A common experimental method for investigating brain activity is to measure the electric potential outside neurons. These recordings usually only capture the high-frequency part of the potential while ignoring frequencies below a set cut-off between 0.1 and 1 Hz. Therefore, standard recordings cannot tell us what the slow frequency potentials might say about on-going brain activity."

"These recordings are traditionally done using a low-frequency filter, with a cut-off frequency normally set somewhere between 0.1 and 1 Hz (see, e.g., [2–4]). Frequency components below this threshold are often referred to as slow potentials, standing potentials, sustained potentials, or DC potentials. We will here use the term slow potentials."

"A multitude of brain processes have been associated with slow potentials, including both physiological phenomena, such as brain-state transitions and readiness potentials, and pathological phenomena, such as spreading depression, stroke, and epilepsy [4]."

# Slow potentials & Potassium K+

"Slow potentials are often correlated with changes in extracellular ion concentrations, and especially with rises in the extracellular K+ concentration"

"Slow-potential shifts are normally reported to follow similar depth profiles as the extracellular K+ concentration"

"Since currents always travel in closed loops, an intracellular current that, for example, goes towards deeper layers through (M1) neural dendrites or (M2) a glial syncytium, requires inward currents entering the cells (sinks) in the superficial layers, and outward return currents (sources) in the deeper layers. "

When greater numbers of potassium K+ channels are opened more extracellular K+ will concentrate, the cell then acts like an electrical sink, creating a slow potential, taking energy out of the circuit, but that energy is distributed to the extracellular space to dissipate randomly in the brain. Perhaps this extracellular current becomes part of the aggregrate electromagnetic brainwave energy in between cells.

This could be how brainwaves are formed, as the result of extra extracellular ion current, when the cell acts as a sink, taking energy out of the neuropath, and randomly distributing it to the extracellular space of the brain.

Okay. For those of you who have been following my incredible work, you may need to sit down for this one. "It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy..." I think I may have isolated how brainwaves are formed from neural activity, & it involves inverted or negative action potentials.

# extracellular potassium K+ contributes to the electrical sink

"Sink and Source are terms used to define the flow of direct current in an electric circuit."(...) "Such a sink and source configuration requires an extracellular current going towards the superficial layers in order to complete the loop, and thus a gradient in the extracellular potential." (...) "A sinking input or output circuit provides a path to ground for the electric load.
A sourcing input or output provides the voltage source for the electric load." Source https://blog.orientalmotor.com/what-is-the-difference-between-sink-and-source-logic

# Diffusion Current (Brain Cells)

"The spatial K+ buffering current in astrocytes [14] is a well-known example of such a slow current loop. In addition to M1 and M2, diffusion of ions along extracellular concentration gradients can (M3) give rise to a so-called diffusion current. The diffusion current is a direct function of the concentration differences and the diffusion constants of the involved ions, and will contribute to completing the current loops between the membrane sources and sinks (see, e.g., [15]). The three components (M1-M3) are therefore not independent (see Fig 1, figure caption)."

"Computational modeling in neuroscience has largely focused on simulating the fast electrical activity of neurons and networks of such, while ignoring other components of brain tissue, such as glia cells and the extracellular space."

"Within that paradigm, multicompartment neuron models are typically based on a combination of a Hodgkin-Huxley type formalism for membrane mechanisms (see, e.g., [16, 17]), and cable theory for how signals propagate in dendrites and axons (see, e.g., [18, 19])."

"Two underlying assumptions in these standard models are that the neurodynamics is unaffected by changes in (i) extracellular potentials and (ii) extracellular ion concentrations. Models of this kind thus do not account for so-called ephaptic effects, where neurons may affect their neighbors non-synaptically through inducing changes in the extracellular environment"

# Medical Imaging tech tools
"The edNEG model (electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia) (i) keeps track of all intraneuronal, intraglial, and extracellular ion concentrations and electrical potentials, (ii) accounts for action potentials and dendritic calcium spikes in neurons, (iii) contains a neuronal and glial homeostatic machinery that gives physiologically realistic ion concentration dynamics, (iv) accounts for electrodiffusive transmembrane, intracellular, and extracellular ionic movements, and (v) accounts for glial and neuronal swelling caused by osmotic transmembrane pressure gradients."

* "endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a lipid signalling system, comprising of the endogenous cannabis-like ligands (endocannabinoids) 2009 Z Mouslech"

"Using the edNEG model, we analyze these effects by splitting the extracellular potential into three components: one due to neural sink/source configurations, one due to glial sink/source configurations, and one due to extracellular diffusive currents. Through a series of simulations, we analyze the roles played by the various components and how they interact in generating the total slow potential. We conclude that the three components are of comparable magnitude and that the stimulus conditions determine which of the components that dominate."

Electric ephaptic effects have been the topic of many studies (see, e.g., [21–28]), as has the effect of changing ion concentrations on neurodynamics (see, e.g., [29–33]). The justification for neglecting such effects in standard simulations is that they often (and by assumption) are quite small, at least on the relatively short time-scale considered in most neural simulations.

# Volume Conduction Theory
# Introduction to Volume Conduction http://eknygos.lsmuni.lt/springer/586/43-53.pdf
"The term “volume conduction” refers to the complex effects of measuring electrical potentials a
distance from their source generators. Near-field potentials refer to those recorded in relative close
proximity to the detector, whereas far-field potentials refer to those recorded at a considerable distance,
as is most commonly the case in evoked potentials."

"In fact, all motor and sensory nerve conduction waveforms
are substantially impacted by volume conductive effects. "

"Volume conduction is the term used to describe the effects of recording electrical potentials
at a distance from their source generator."

"In truth, volume conduction plays a role in almost all clinical neurophysiological recordings, both central and peripheral, because recording electrodes are never placed in direct contact with the nerve cells generating the signal."

"Wavelength is usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ); it is equal to the speed (v) of a wave train in a medium divided by its frequency (f): λ = v/f." Source https://www.britannica.com/science/wavelength

"Relationship Between Wavelength and Frequency
A simple equation relates wavelength to frequency:

v = λf

v = wave velocity (how fast the wave propagates in a medium)
λ = wavelength (distance over which a wave shape repeats)
f = wave frequency (number of waves per unit of time)"

"Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases. As frequency increases, wavelength decreases."

"What is magnitude formula? the formula to determine the magnitude of a vector (in two dimensional space) v = (x, y) is: |v| =√(x2 + y2). This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. the formula to determine the magnitude of a vector (in three dimensional space) V = (x, y, z) is: |V| = √(x2 + y2 + z2)" source wikipedia

# Magnitude Frequency Inverse Relationship as long as Voltage, Current & Resistannce remain constant.

My conjecture is that it's actually Magnitude that has an inverse relationship with Frequency. So if Amplitude & Frequency both increase the wave length is shorter than if Amplitude decreased while Frequency increased (as long as voltage remains constant, with voltage increase you could see an increase to both magnitude & frequency at the same time)

"These theoretical results contain several points of physiological interest. For the
centrally distributed excitatory conductance increase, the initial rate of soma membrane depolarization is twice as great as when the same amount of excitatory conductance is distributed uniformly over the receptive surface. However, for the
peripherally distributed conductance increase, there is a zero initial rate of soma
membrane depolarization. In the case of the square conductance pulse, this particular example shows a peak soma membrane depolarization that is twice as great for
the centrally distributed case as for the peripherally distributed case. This could
easily represent the difference between success or failure in the initiation of an
axonally propagated action potential."

# NAPOT Revision 3

Imagine after reading this that brain cells are effectively accomplishing neural rendering & inner qualia & your mind's perception of reality through tiny data driven electromagnetic ion changes, phase changes, that are changes in the timing of signal propagation across the network.

From changes in the timing of phases, your 3D neural & glial network of cells, computational renders your experience of reality.

The phasic action potential, the burstlet, and the burst firing (many burstlets) are less common signalling compared to the default tonic firing (in information theory that means they contain more information) but the slow waves, or inhibited firing, or what I call negative action potentials are also less common or more rare signal differences, differences in timing (thus containing more information in information theory compared to the more regular tonic firing rate.)

"In contrast to these transient phenomena, it can also be seen that the steady depolarization of the soma membrane produced by sustained G. is only about 20 percent less for the peripherally distributed case as compared with the centrally distributed case. This suggests a need for modification of the widely held belief that
synaptic excitation delivered to the dendritic periphery could produce no significant
passive electrotonic spread of membrane depolarization to the soma. On the contrary, because of the very large dendritic surface area and the high density of synaptic contacts over the entire soma-dendritic surface (e.g., Wyckoff and Young, 1956; Rasmussen, 1957; Young, 1958), dendritic synaptic activity would be expected to
dominate the slowly changing background level of the neuron's excitatory state. A
relatively small number of (synchronously active) somatic synapses would seem to
be especially well suited for precise timing (triggering) of nerve impulse initiation."

"This suggests that synaptic inhibition may
operate mainly by decreasing the background level of the neuron's excitatory state;"

Effectively this is like a conjecture that suggests that the Basal Dendrite's inhibitory (potassium) synapses perform the role of increasing the resistance to current (from sodium excitatory synapses) They were correct.

# This was Dendritic Computation in 1962

So when burst firing is triggered in the soma reflecting a coincidence of signals from both basal & apical dendrites, the voltage of the cells phase magnitude (waveform) is increased and it is translated into a soliton waveform message to it's exit terminal, but also a phase wave change to it's extracellular space (depending on concentrations of ions (mainly potassium) inside & outside the cell).

"At the beginning of this talk, I remarked that the dendritic neuron model may
have relevance even to the problem of learning. What I had in mind was the growth
of dendritic trees and the possibility that learning might involve preferential enlargement of certain dendritic branches.13 It seems reasonable to suppose that different
dendritic trees (or portions of these trees) provide the receptive surface for synaptic
activity of different functional pathways to which a given neuron may belong. Conditioning and learning might involve an increase in the caliber and surface area of the appropriate dendritic branches. This would enhance the synaptic effectiveness of
this pathway in at least two ways: it would provide additional surface for either
additional or larger synaptic terminals; at the same time, the enlarged caliber of
these branches (and perhaps of their trunk) would increase the amount and rate
of electrotonic spread from this region to the central convergence zone (at or near
the soma). Thus, the influence of this entire synaptic and dendritic system would
be increased."

"A simplified treatment of synaptic excitation and
inhibition leads to the theoretical prediction of a functional distinction between
somatic and dendritic synapses: dendritic synaptic activity would be expected to
dominate slow adjustments of the background excitation level, while somatic
synapses would be best suited for triggering of impulses. "

# a0288z.began

I began this book after writing the Synaptic Unreliability article on SVGN.io News. This led to NAPOT, Neural Array Oscillating Tomography that defines with the idea Arrays of Neurons are emitting phase wave changes to Neural Arrays defined by their exit terminals, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 Vesicle sacks and that this represents the essence of computational rendering & pattern detection between arrays of neurons, that when oscillated in feedback loops allows the mind to become conscious of it's own internal models.

I then refined this idea in NAPOT Revision 2 to apply the concept of Sparse Distributed Representation at the Synaptic level to clarify that the model output from each neuron in each part of one array creates a specific inceptive synapse specific pattern to it's exit terminal represented by the next neural array. What I found out when researching upregulated & downregulated synapses, including backprogation from a postsynaptic array to a presynaptic array, and back propropagation from an Apical Dendrite to the soma (or from an exit terminal to the Soma) led me to the concept that Burst firing is actually a coincidence detection between both sides of the neuron (the dendrite + the backpropagating signals from the exit terminal or apical dendrite) and this allows a single neuron to detect coincidences across seconds instead of just milliseconds (Read my notes on Behavior Timescale Synaptic Plasticity). I also began to analyze how the thalamic output to multiple cortical layers simultaneously allows the 5 Layer Pyramidal Neurons to selectively respond to patterns detected across multiple cortical layers simultanously. This allows incoming sensory inputs from the thalamus to the layers that intersect with the basal dendrite, to be compared with the tonic oscillating brainwave patterns looping in the apical dendrites. So that coincidences are mapped between your mind state (in the apical cortical to cortical & cortical to thalamic loops), and coincidences between your incoming senses (from the lower layers of the thalamus connecting to the basal dendrites.)

In NAPOT Revision 3 I found evidence that the release of 0 vesicles, compared to the usually 1 vesicle per tonic interval, constituted the transmission of information (rare signals have higher information) and this was validated when I came across research on slow wave potentials, slow potentials, or DC potentials, which appear to be soliton waves, stable information containing waves, or negative action potentials, that have an effect on the tonic oscillating pattern, and these SCP waves appear to be created when extracellular potassium increases (because more potassium channels opened) which means the neuron has acted like an electric sink, pulled energy out of the neural circuit (inhibition) slowed down it's phase pattern (relative to the group oscillation) Essentially DC potentials or Slow Wave Potentials are negative action potentials, your brain still detects them because they are changes in the rate of oscillatory firing, which affects all neurons in an oscillating group (which is striving to reach equilibrum or synchrony). In the process of studying this I realized that the extracellular potassium gradient is like the grounding of current, or the dissipating of current to the extracelluar membrane (to the brain) and my conjecture is that this process is what gives rise to brainwaves, or how brainwaves emerge from oscillating groups of braincells. These brainwaves are in effect the volume conduction that is observed with electrode based medical imaging.

The extracellular potassium gradient is of course an inverse of quantity to the intracellular potassium gradient. This is interesting to think about for EEG Source Localization, when we know we are measuring aggregate brainwave activity, a dipole change in electric voltage, from thousands of apical dendrites, at the location of each electrode on the scale, but we can source localize signals as deep as the thalamus, even though we are probably reading voltage changes from the extracellular potassium gradient when a cell fires. That extracellular voltage change effectively mirrors, or is an inverted mirror of the phase wave change that neuron transmitted to it's exit terminal.

"Subcortical electrophysiological activity is detectable with high-density EEG source imaging" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08725-w 

Effectively the EEG frequency wave spectrum is encoding the inverse of phase wave changes (inverse in the sense of photography, an inverted color image), at the soma level, released to the extracellular space, and with source localization the refraction of that signal dissipation is being reversed.
