What's the difference between a thought in your mind, and a coordinated sequence of spatially positioned electrical spikes? What's the difference between the electrical activity in a human brain, and a hundred year electrical storm on Jupiter? Is Jupiter thinking?

Thomas The perspective

Will you please say more about what you mean by that Daniel?

Daniel Hayato Thomas
yes ;)

Micah Blumberg
If Jupiter is thinking, how would we communicate with it?

Daniel Hayato Thomas
ok, but seriously I gotta run in a few minutes so I can't go into detail but consider that if a human subject was dissected there's no substance to the thoughts other than maybe those electrical spikes
In fact you could say that there are no thoughts, just those electrical spikes, yet shift the perspective a bit and the experimenter should be (unless it is an automaton) having very real experiences of thoughts
As to communicating with jupiter, I guess drag the question back a step and ask if a person is thinking how do we communicate with them?
ps. Read Zizek for more inspiration on this, and to drag this back on topic It's interesting that Lacan and Baidou's (who are major inspirations for Zizek) thought relates strongly to catagory theory

Slavoj Žižek?
Oh I wasn't looking for a philosophy answer but thanks

If it is a self-referential, self-modifying *evolving* loop, it is a thinking entity (see Hofstadter's I Am A Strange Loop). Unless the hundred year storm is evolving and progressing, it's not particularly interesting as a "mind".

Micah Blumberg
a storm actually is a loop, a vortex, with an eye at the center, like a human being the hurricane is a dissipative system, it's a cousin

Micah Blumberg
you are a dissipative system, a vortex, a loop, just like a hurricane :) or a storm on Jupiter :)

Peter Rothman How would you detect "thoughts" in systems like this? What about detecting "thoughts" in higher order systems such as nation states and corporations?

Micah Blumberg
love Hofstadter btw, good reference Mark :)

Peter Rothman
That is to say, it seems to be a subject that might be amenable to scientific experiment and measurement.

Micah Blumberg
Yes, you just blew my mind Peter! Thanks :)

You will like an article I am working on for h+ to appear this week then. Trying to put some real evidence around the computational singularity idea, and there is some BTW, but also some of these upper bounds come up because you have super-exponential growth that otherwise would reach infinity in a finite amount of time. Since we think that can't happen, we have to have some other effect that prevents it, i.e. a limit on the further reductions in CPU sizes, memory per unit volume, energy efficiency etc.

Micah Blumberg
The singularity would be the moment when a computer chip interfaces with the whole cosmos as one super computer :)

Micah Blumberg
oops that already happened :P

A storm is a loop but it does not continue evolving to ever-increasing complexity and "distance" from its environment.

Mark Waser
Thoughts, in the form of memes, are "obvious" in higher order systems like nation states, corporations, and other communities.
The real problem with storms as thoughts is that they don't *ever* play well with each other.

Micah Blumberg
Precisely one can make the argument that storms do actually evolve "to ever-increasing complexity and "distance" from its environment." because you are such a storm, even now you are isomorphic to a vortex, your a dissipative system that evolved, the conscious descendent of a hurricane or tornado.
