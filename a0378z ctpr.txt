(field, observer, qualia)
I don't like the objective/subjective framework when discussing qualia, it's useless. Instead of the term subjective I use predictive, still has the "ctive" sound, and probablistic.

To do qualia in math I think you have to combine the ideas of Douglas Hofstader with what we see in brain scans.

Think of it as a brain structure A of sensor chips sensing another brain structure B that is also sensor chips sensing another brain sensor structure C that is also sensor chips... until N before looping back around to A.

Then think about the components of the canvase of consciousness, the objects represented by sensing circuits (nerve cells) and brainwaves from the things in your visual field being sensed by other mathematical abstractions in your brain, like a sensor construction of an idea of an observer self.

Imagine that the apple you see, in the mind, is actually sensing what's next to it, the apple is seeing you, the table is seeing the computer, the ceiling is seeing your thoughts right now.

The loop of inner seeing gains structure because it cycles through the same big structures over and over again.
