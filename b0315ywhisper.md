Title: Microtubules Consciousness Recursion

But having some discussions about them early on is kind of important

When you start to think about how these entities interact with each other

So that's what this when it gets a little bit interesting

So this is something that I've been thinking about and wanted to bring up

It's that you know people people keep coming into the groups and they start

sharing the panpsychist viewpoint and I have debated that so many times and

Sometimes I just don't have the energy for it, but it's like but I but I guess it still needs to be discussed and it's like it's kind of like

I think that the basic plot it like the most

In the the biggest reason it can't move forward is that it sort of violates like information theory

You can't have like in order to have consciousness

That means that you're observing

There's an observer who's observing right and you're observing something and that means that and like if you're observing music then then

What's necessary to observe music like you can someone can hand you a record and you're not going to hear sound

Someone can hand you a CD CD rom just like without the player and you're not going to hear sound, right?

You have to have a decoder in order to turn the bumps on the record or the dots on the CD rom into

Into sound and and it's the same thing with your brain. There's like there's no observation

If there's a if unless there's a decoder there's information has no meaning unless it's the unless it's decoded

So it has to be encoded and decoded and that means that like if there's no observation happening because there's no because

There's no decoder, then there can't be any consciousness

and like so like there can't be any consciousness in a rock because there's no observation happening and if if if

There's no observation happening because there's no decoder in the rock

We can see that there's no decoder in the rock where like in the human brain people our work. There's no there's no

in my mind the the the there's no

I guess the way I phrase it was the idea that the human brain is computationally interpreting

the incoming signals from the environment in order to process them and decode them and

perceive them is not a controversial idea.

This is what most neuroscientists and I think most educated people believe.

And yeah, so it's so, yeah, I'll start there.

Yeah, great. I like the way you're talking thinking and I would love to actually make a

bridge between what you're saying right now and what Ben was saying earlier about the relation

to predicting the cosmos. Not the right word, but you know what he was referring to earlier with.

So first of all, I am actually talking with philosophers, contemporary philosophers,

about reintroducing parts of panpsychism, but not all. And the essence there is that we learn

to understand in a different way. First of all, let me refer back to a good reason why

we actually would think that consciousness is prior to matter. And I think that the way we are

looking at it at the moment is explaining some things like the fine tune problems and giving

an alternative to the whole idea of the multiverse. The thing I'm doing as an applied science,

I want to have it grounded in the world and really fully emerged into the world. And like I said,

I've always rejected any of this spiritual stuff and panpsychic stuff until the world itself showed

me that the research I was doing on this was exactly that. It made that there's another way.

Let me do that metaphor. You can think about it in a different way. Think about a vacuum,

right? Now, on this planet, we actually only have artificial vacuum, but we have it everywhere.

We use it for our combustion engines to make a lot of work for us. So we're using it everywhere,

but it's fabricated in an artificial lens. So in an atmosphere, in a...

Your mic is breaking up a lot. Oh, so maybe the connection is this better? I hope this will be

better. Difficult to know without a statistically significant sound for me, so keep going. Okay,

so what I'm trying to say is that think about your brain as a container to keep an electrical

storm together. If I would take atmosphere into space without a container, it would disperse.

It wouldn't exist at all. So in my view, the stones and the plant and many of those material

stuff around us is in that kind of sense not linked to consciousness. Consciousness is to me

like this whirlpool of electrical lightning, let's say, but that can actually exist outside the

brain as well. And if I link it to much larger scale like creating the conditions to get to the

fine-tuning structure where life can emerge, that's a very different balance game. So it is

pantheism, but it's not pantheism. And something that Ben said about what if all the different

consciousnesses are emerging at the same time, that's exactly the thing that we are at the

moment working on with the concept of what is called tribo-poasis. So you have auto-poasis,

which is basically the system creating itself, but then you have like a little bit of a problem

like where the hell is this coming from? And while with tribo-poasis, it is actually more in line

with also the fact that we are a multicellular creature. So like a multicellular creature has

at one level cells that can autonomously reproduce and do whatever they want. But on a very, on

an aggregated level, there is an influence because if I stop eating, I will eat my muscles to keep

my brains alive. So there is a higher order at play. And the same way we are looking now at this

concept of tribo-poasis. And what I'm trying to do like in the research on the origin of life is

look how convection cells, they always emerge out of the fields that gets far from equilibrium,

but then they emerge together. It's not one convection cells, it's a collective of convection

cells. And you can only understand that because there is like this feedback structure that will

improve the flow. And many of the things I'm learning and understanding about consciousness is

exactly this. I mean, you can wake up in the morning and you can be in a state like where the hell am

I? So you're not really conscious of the things that, while your brain is perfectly functional,

but then the flow gets a little bit going and then you're back into it. And there's

similar kind of, well, exercise you can do like if you dream, you can wake up and be in a mindset

of a lot of work and forget your dream right away. But sometimes you can actually try to get back

to the dream by going and standing in the feeling you had when you were dreaming. And then where

you stand in the feeling of that dream, suddenly all the memory comes back in. So in that way,

that there's this whole link and there's a strong link with things that we see in Zen Buddhism and

so on, where you go via meditation into a different kind of awareness. So there are many, well,

there's still a lot of mystery around all of that, right? But we try by not being too concrete,

like many of the examples you gave, Mikhai, is for me too concrete. If you try to be a little bit

more abstract, then things may actually get explained by first seeing how like a cybernetic

world can actually start changing the physical world and how that's kind of a bootstrapping

relation and Mixland not speaking. And by the way, I probably need to go for a meeting in a few

minutes. Okay, I can respond to that. So it sounds like you're, I guess to try to paraphrase

what you're saying, something about consciousness being just the electrical activity or just the

electromagnetic activity, and the brain just being a container for that activity to keep it

together. But maybe you think that if that electrical activity could occur in a different

kind of container, like maybe inside the storm of Jupiter, then there could be consciousness there,

right? Something like it doesn't have to be in the brain, it could reformulate somewhere else,

it's not necessarily connected to the brain. The brain is serving it.

It's happening in our culture. What? It's already happening in our culture. You cannot disconnect

your own consciousness from the language you speak and the culture you're living. So you don't

even need to go to so far away. Okay. So on the topic of on the topic of neuroscience,

though, I mean, I guess I guess what I want to share is what I think is the missing missing piece

here. And that I like the painting, but I think there's one missing piece and I wanted to share

it is that, you know, from neuroscience, I think that there's a well, okay, so there's a there's

like a ton of examples that and I have to kind of piece it together. I know you may not have

enough time. But so what's the one example is that, you know, they do like the the split break,

the split break brain patients, if the famous scientists. So anyway, the idea was that every

time you cut it, if you do like a major incision that that, you know, cuts across the corpus

glosum or just divides the brain half or a major surgery or if there's a major injury and, you

know, like a brain surgery, like they we see personality changes, people's personality changes.

And so that that's like the that's the first sign that the brain tissue is directly causing the

electrical pattern. If the soul if the soul was the electrical pattern, and it was in the brain

tissue was just a container, then then how is changing the brain tissue changing that like

changing that person's personality. But that's what it's one big thing that people have to juggle

with. Yeah, so I want to respond to that thanks because it makes it a lot more concrete. So the

way I look at the mind brain, so conscience as it's like a workbook, right? So it's a feedback

mechanism keeping itself in a kind of artificial construct. So what happened if you cut the brain,

you should get two workbooks. And that's exactly what we see if we can do experiments with them

and have the left brain and right brain ask them different questions and actually capture how they

have the different answers to that. Like you let them write and you let them say something. And you

answer the question and you see that what's been written and what's been said is different. So this

kind of stuff really fits perfectly with what we call that tribal poesis. So it's the whole idea

that everything you see around you can actually be understood from a process perspective. Everything

is feedback structures creating feedback. Okay, well, so there's another there's some other

problems with that. And so like, but what's what's really interesting, I think in it is a missing

piece is how much the brain tissue is involved in generating that electrical storm. And, and like,

you know, every time every time a neuron fires or a neural circuit fires, you know, a micro a micro

column of activity spikes, a column or a region spikes, you have one region and another like

there's the dipoles firing off. Do you know the global workspace hypothesis? Yeah, I do. But I

have but I but I have issues with that too. I have had my own hypothesis. The reason I'm

mentioning it is because I've noticed that. So that's the first time I noticed that the system

of creation. So the feedback system I was working with in our team was popping up again. So I was

wondering, like, how come that this neuroscience is actually explaining something that I'm from

artificial intelligence totally disconnected from that research also had as a system. So

that's one of the first time. So the end the deeper how like having this for different kind of

leverages can actually create feedback on creation. And if you understand how you can create that

feedback on creation, you can actually see how even cultures are consciousness and aware as a

feedback structure like that, but just on a way slower rate. So the like speeding up plans and

see then how plans behave like animals. It's a little bit the same. So there is like, as well,

but it's moving so slow, it's called science guys. So but the thing that that you can see is if

your system of creation, you will get more aware. And you can. So it's already hard coding our

brains. But our actions can actually also improve that kind of flow. I'm mixed up. So okay, look,

so I still I still think the idea that you're saying violates information information theory,

which is the final part of what I was going to say, because, you know, you're not only are

neurons generating this electrical storm, but they're, but the neurons themselves are the ones

that are decoding and the the information in the brain that includes any includes any result of

this electrical storm that there is is is the electrical storm might be altering the positions

of electrons, which change the firing rate and change the brain activity patterns. And but

the but the only way for the for information to be detected or for for an observation to happen is

because the neurons are making that observation that the brain activity itself doesn't have

decoders and therefore it has no sense of information. And it's not conscious. It's not not

an observer. But that's because you believe that information is in your brain. No, no, that's

because I believe that that information has has to be has to have that in a that an observer has

to have a decoder for an observation to happen. Otherwise, information has no meaning. But the

thing is that that embodiment can be extremely simplified to four forces interacting on each

other. I don't know if we're gonna solve this debate tonight if you have to leave in a minute

because this requires some maybe another hour of argument. But maybe you come back another

time and I would do that, by the way. I'm really I'm really like the way you're thinking and the

fact that you're critical because if the way because if you that kind of critical response

allows to create a language to express the things that we can see from like Mars mathematical

perspective. But like, yeah, if you want to have like some idea of what that four forces creating

the system of creation looks like, the most easiest case I can see around me is sailing

against the wind. In the case of sailing against the wind, you are also using four forces to

actually create a very strange, well, or paradoxical movement. But there is like a cost. And the

cost relates to this person you do in the the the fluid, where you can do the sailing. And the

thing with the sailing against the wind, the four forces is that there is no constructive knowledge

to build on top of. So if you then start doing that with things like machine learning, you can

actually see how you can create an evolution of creativity. But yeah, you're right. Actually,

my date is not yet here. So I keep going until I have. So I so I so I don't I haven't heard of this

thing called the four forces system of creation. I looked it up. And are you talking about the four

basic forces of physics, like gravitational force, electromagnetic force, nuclear force, and strong

nuclear force? I'll send you the link of my. So because the whole idea is that the four forces

always work on workspace, but workspace is embodied in the space. Well, there's a there's a system

that tries to create the user workspace. But there's also an environment that has influence on

that workspace. The in case of sailing against the wind, the four forces are like this. You have

first, it's called lift and drag. So those are the forces on the sail. And what happens if you

combine those two? Well, if you play with those two forces, you can actually create a force that

has like a 90 degree angle against the wind. But you are not yet against the wind. So it seems

impossible to sail against the wind. So what actually happens is that you are in a medium,

your boat is in the water. And there's like this keel in the boat that makes the boat go only in

one direction, basically. So it's easy to go back and forth. But it's hard to go sideways. That's

what you have with the boat. That's why you turn the boat if you want to go in a different direction.

So what you do is you put your position in the boat in such a way that the lift force,

like this 90 degree angle against the wind has maximum effect on the viscosity of the water.

And the viscosity of the water will actually be a reaction force. And so that's the cost you pay

to actually move across the 90 degree angle. And then you cannot sail straight against the wind

when you need to do is like zigzag all the time. So and if you translate all that kind of forces

to how we learn, you actually get to understanding how there's a feedback structure on learning

that allows us to create novelty. So creating something fundamentally that doesn't exist yet

in your existing knowledge. But I'll send you the link to the PhD so you can actually see the

forces, see how it works, and how I make the link with this combination. Okay, okay, okay,

but I just want to say that I am not hearing like a counter argument to what I'm saying that,

and I've had further thought. So the argument was that, you know, electromagnetism, the

electromagnetism in the brain, the electrical storm has no way to decode information that the

neurons are passing through it. It would, and I think it would, if like, if you're combining,

you know, information together that it might, yeah, it just like I don't, so yeah, so if you

look up information theory and decoding, like that is just, that's essential for an observation to

happen is that the information that's received has to be decoded for in order for it to be

transmitted has to be encoded. And if you don't have a physical mechanism to, yeah, I follow you,

but they do make one big mistake. And that mistake relates to the concept we know in cybernetics

as bootstrapping. And the best example I can give is called the bootstrapping compiler,

where you actually create a non-existing compiler in a language that doesn't, is decoded yet.

What you make a trick, what you will do is instead of creating a compiler, you create an

interpreter in that language. So that's a virtual space. But in that virtual space,

you actually give the program itself as input. And what it will do by the recursive structure

it will actually create a compiler in a programming language. You never wrote one code line of

coded because it's bootstrapping itself through itself. So it's like the snake eating itself.

If you start playing with that idea that if you can create a virtual space that can decode,

that then can actually create the code to run itself, you actually solve the problem. And that's

like, that's why I'm referring to the whirlpool as, I mean, first the fluid is just going in

any direction, but as soon as you create that feedback structure, you can start playing with

that. And if you go to programming, that playing with recursion is something we do all the time.

But it's pretty ill understood outside of the domain of programming modeling. So the thing

that you need to do then is use a lot of the programming modeling techniques to understand

how we can understand cognition. So I know it requires quite interdisciplinary approach and

that's the biggest challenge, I guess. Okay, so you're saying that the topology of the ionic

activity in the brain is like a whirlpool that is, you're suggesting that somehow it's gathering

information and transmitting information and understanding information? There's an advanced

case in, so if you look up convection cells, you will see that convection cells. So there is actually

a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1977 given to it because it was break through science. But it's

the thing that you see, so the convection cells show you how a system far from equilibrium can

actually start self organizing. So that's one aspect, but the convection itself doesn't yet

tell you how it's coding. There has been an advanced experiment where they start heating

the sides of those convection cells and what happened is depending on a certain temperature,

you actually get a different pattern and you see clearly, purely from topology, how information is

coded in flow and that can easily happen in your brain as well. How then that kind of patterns

start changing the world is yet another bootstrap. But if you start understanding how that processing

of bootstrapping is working, so A creates B, but B is not good, it's artificial and temporal. But

the temporal and artificial thing like a scaffold is used to create something structural. And then

when that structural thing exists, the scaffold can go away again. And that's exactly the idea of

a scaffold, right? I'm sorry, I'll pause. I need to take a break. You go ahead and respond first.

I just wanted to bring a couple of things back down to it. So as much as I like thinking about

the fate of the universe and stuff, I also like to make sure I keep this shit real. So when you

talk about convection cells, of course, in everybody's house right now, you've probably got

some double glazing. So there's a perfect example of that type of convection cell. You're talking

about metal, literally a pair. An example would be double glazing and why you need the correct gap

between the panes of glass if it's too small. Then you've just not got enough, you just not

got enough depth of air to be, to be a depth of an insulator. And then when the gap between the

glass gets too big, you start to get these convection cells set up. They emerge in the space

and then they create a transport mechanism from heat from the cold out of pain, obviously,

the way from the hot inner pain to the outer pain through conduction and convection. I mean,

that's a perfect example of something's actually in people's hopes, right? That's a nice one. I

didn't know that one. But yes, that those are also convection cells. But you are talking now

about convection cells of air, right? Yes, if you go to your original experiment, because you try

to make it as feasible as possible, they use oil. And so heating up the oil actually leads to this

honey cube grid of cells transporting heat from the bottom to the top. So the glass is a very good

example. Thanks for that, Ben. Yeah, you can see it in there just with the puffer smoke. So that's

that. And then there was another thing that Micah just said that really made me think of another

example where we can really simply bring it back down to earth. Micah, just remind me what you

said at the end of what you said and it will spark the recall of that once the last thing

I was thinking I was thinking about how I was thinking about how the brain is a as a whirlpool

of activity. That was what I asked if it was gathering and then transmitting patterns. But

but also maintain its maintaining its own equilibrium. So so so I guess I guess the point

was that convection pattern is I guess it's gathering a pattern and transmitting a pattern

as an example. Back to the back to your brain back to the observer who sees it. But so I guess

you can make an argument that there's a way to transmit patterns. But but I'm still but but you

know, from and sort of like from that's that's interesting. Um, and I guess I didn't figure

Ben to remember. Yeah, no, I haven't looked at the clubhouse thing of trying to balance

come contribute to the conversation with having a shave with realizing I need a shout before

my 9 30 meeting. And so I'm just trying to listen in. But no, I can't remember what the other

concrete example was. But there was there was a really good just grounding example of

something that might renew the mix of other than USA. No, so that's okay. Let's go. Was

it about the the whirlpool of of electromagnetic flux creating coding on itself? No, it was

not. I mean, there was one other comment about recursion is, of course, in programming,

anything you can express recursively, you can express iteratively. So if you can't get your

head around a recursive way of describing things, I, you know, like the towers of annoyance

a great example. When I learned to solve that both as a program, but also as a person, you

know, I think Henry's a toy shop with those those three annoying posts with the with these

decreasingly small discs on them. And you know, your challenges that you've got like

five discs on a post with holes in them, like donuts, you know, five increasingly small

donuts, making a little tower, and you have to move those all to another tower. But the

rule is that you never have to put a bigger one on top of a smaller one. How else can

you do it if that's a recursive, perfect recursive problem? A very simple way of doing it is

you move you imagine them in a circle, rather than in a line, you say, remove the smallest

this one space left, and then do the only other allowed move, and then keep repeating

that. That's an iterative way of describing how to do the towers of annoy a recursive way

that would be to say, well, move one disc to another post, and then everything else becomes

a sub problem. So recursions about like the problem being that when a problem has itself

described as a sub problem, a fractal kind of nature, you can be recursive, but you can

also translate that to iterative. It's just, in some problem spaces, an iterative solution

to the towers of annoyance is a good programming challenge, by the way, for any programmers

out there, if you want to try and write some code to tell you how to solve the town of

annoyance, you're not allowed to use recursion, I suspect your program could be a lot longer.

I'd be very interested to know, actually, if anybody has the knowledge whether it fundamentally

needs to be longer than a recursive algorithm. That's interesting because that talks to compression

and simplification and representation, but it certainly would appear to be longer. So

that's just another random thought I had, that the recursion is not sacred, if you like,

it's just a way of representing a problem. And I don't know if it impresses down to

the same sort of size program as an iterative version, fundamentally. It probably does because

I think they compiled down to similar code with a good compiler, so I think I've answered

my own question, but it's stuff about compression and compilers and that way of looking at how

information works is quite interesting because it grounds the conversation nicely when you

start talking about things like compilers and bootstrapping compilers and the likes.

Yeah, I like that direction. I'm done. In fact, I'm just going to listen in for the

next five minutes because I've got a shower. Okay, thanks Ben, and I like the way you think,

so I'm happy we met here. I actually wonder if, I mean, now you put that name in my head.

This would be rude if I didn't un-move and say the feelings of mutual, of course, it's

always great to meet people on here, but if I don't reply now, it's because I literally

am in the shower. Yeah, sure, go ahead. You know how it goes on club high. You never

need to apologize for not responding, right? And saying that, I mean, now we actually got

this meme in my head, like trying to figure out if the length actually says something

about the compression when it's a recursion. So I actually had this, I'm just going to

share it, I mean, it's happy hour, right? I was combining the research on artificial

intelligence. So that's one lab with research on programming modeling lab. And I got kind

of in trouble with that because the two labs don't speak at all. And at a certain moment,

like when you're talking about this expressivity, I was thinking like, you know, in artificial

intelligence, there's a lot of interest in cultural language and how that affects the

thing you can express. So I was wondering, is it vice versa as well? Can I actually start

talking about a programming languages and the poetic ability of a programming language?

And what I did is I start looking at different programming languages and finding this very

strange expression, you only have in one language. And then I give a presentation about like

the poetic nature of a programming language. And as of that day, I'm not allowed in the

lab anymore. You know, there was this great, there was a great, this guy, he wrote this

programming language that basically like, like, it's all like rock music. Let me see

if I can find it real quick. But it's like, every line that you write in the library is

basically like us like a like a rock song. I look it up.

There are way more people in the room. So if anyone likes to come up on stage, let me

reset the topic. It's happy hour. So basically, you can talk about anything you want. We are

talking related to neuroscience, but editing goes. So come on stage and let's talk.

I found it. So if you if you'd like, if you look on, it's just called the rock star language.

And you can find it on you can just Google rock star programming language. I'm sure it

will come up or could you send me the link via Twitter? I just send you my PhD as well.

So you should have gotten the link. Yep, I'll do that.

Hi, Dasha. Hi, this has been a fascinating wormhole of

whirlpools to listen to for the last 20 minutes before I thought I was going to go to bed.

I'm sure my nerves in my brain will have a lot more material for my dreams tonight.

Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really amazed. Actually, after talking to Mixol, my brain

is firing because here's the thing. It's like, you know, one of one of the one of the things

is like, you know, there there is a, you know, the human being is a dissipative system. Like

we are vortex that there are oscillations in the brain. There's there are cycles and

feedback loops and self maintaining physics and the physics of every cell and the body

itself and in a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium. Like these are all concepts that

are sort of like tied into the what what the concept of a whirlpool needing to, you know,

maintain its its own order with the, I guess, the topology of recursion was was the was what

Mixol said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that because when because when Mixol

said recursion, I thought of, wait, is he talking about like a recursive neural network? What

is what is this? It's spot on with the dissipative systems really spot on. So so it is really

like a recursion of recursions of dissipative systems. So and it that actually goes back

to topic discussions we had in 2004 on machine consciousness. So we had several people in

the field of cognition coming together, starting to talk about machine consciousness. And one

of the things that came out of it is like, maybe we really need to look at the mind as

a virtual machine, like we know from Java. And now all nice. And it's a good metaphor.

But mean, we try to get grounded. How do you do it as an applied scientist. And so when

we realizing that we are actually also in that kind of recursion with with our culture,

I start digging into digital cultures. And at a certain moment, that's 2010, I start interviewing

every founder of a starter baker system that was really successful between 2005 and 2010.

And I was asking all of them, like, why are you doing open innovation? So my assumption

was that they would have taken the culture of open source development and just projected

it on the business development. But when I told them what open innovation is about,

they all start like, okay, that's a bad idea. We're not going to do that. So then I confronted

them with the fact that it was happening in the ecosystem. So how can it happen in the

ecosystem? If that's not the thing you want to have. And what we figured out is that there

was actually a dissipative system at the cultural level. And so first, the dissipation, what

is getting dispersed is the ability to do to do work. So in open source, you have the

policy of community contribution, 10%, 20%, sometimes even 100%. You can contribute to

your own project in the community. And that kind of disperses all the codes in relation

to anything that can grow, basically. But there was a second policy. And it's the second

policy that really created the feedback leading to the Whirlpool, basically. So it wasn't

open innovation, it was self organizing innovation. The second policy was that all entrepreneurs

were very aware that they were living in a fragile ecosystem. And that their action

as a body, as an organization, had effect on the ecosystem. And they needed to take

care of that ecosystem. So all the time they were questioning, if I do this from a business

perspective, is it bad, good, or neutral to the ecosystem? And if it was bad, it basically

was a no go. The prioritization was always when it was good for the ecosystem. Neutral,

you could do it, but good, you got priority. And by that very simple structure, there was

this kind of self organizing innovation happening during those moments. After 2010, there were

a lot of corporates getting into the ecosystem. And I kind of got shut out of all the back

office discussions. So I kind of stopped doing participation research in that community.

But just to let you know how that cultural has this effect on the awareness and the

ability and the embodiment that the agents below could do. I hope that helps. But basically,

it's all about the dissipative systems.

Okay, while you were talking, I was just, so I mean, I have, like I said, I have my

own, like, see, there's global workspace theory and there's different theories of consciousness

and dashes on the stage. Welcome. If you want to say something, go ahead.

Oh, I mean, I was just fascinated by the conversation. I also am very sad. Mix L, I don't know if

I'm pronouncing your name correctly, that you were ejected from a group after you brought

poetry and art into the equation about AI and learning. My mother works at the National

Science Foundation as a program director in exactly the areas of, you know, language and

technology. And she's very fascinated by the fact that, you know, cultural language issues

are really what is stagnating AI a lot of, you know, in jokes, just cultural in jokes.

And humor is just so difficult for truly AI to encompass and possess. So it's, I'm kind

of sad to hear that you were, when you were bringing these topics into the conversation

that you were met with resistance. I'll let me quickly respond. Don't be sad. I mean,

it's all rock and roll, basically. I'm scaring people all the time by the fact of creating.

I mean, I'm all the time, I mean, the thing I really love is being part of that system

of creation. And like the most recent thing I start scaring is basically everyone around

me when I start moving up as a digital sharp man. So I mean, I don't mind that so much

that you keep on moving and it's the part that's the essence, right? So if people don't

want to continue that, that's okay. It's everyone is, it's their own issues they need to work

on there. You can just keep on going. So, but thanks, I'm personally sad for, for just

the moving forward of that concept, because that is really at the core of what needs to

be focused on how we're going to get there. How are we going to have an AI that understands

and can create real poetry just beyond abstractions and art and, and humor and, and language

with playful learning and understanding. And yeah, it's, I think, yeah, keep, keep carving

away. And, you know, if you ever are looking for an NSF grant, you know, there's a, there

are people in that area that, that definitely do care about those things. So interesting.

So very quick response again, that I actually working on a concept called Interversity.

And it's the whole idea of if you have, if you look at the before the internet, you had

information locked up in books. And it was hard to be creative with that information.

Today we can create apps and be really creative. And so the information gets alive. The same

actually exists with research. Research is at academia is quite conservative, locked

in schools of thought and locked in labs. But now it's going digital. You actually start

doing creative research. And I'll send you an article I have about the Interversity and

how I'm trying to work on that concept. So, so thank you, Dasha. But I see there are more

people on stage. So take, take the floor. Go ahead.

Hi, I did I see Mark raising his hand.

I had something to say as well. There's a thread that I was following in quantum biology

that had something to do with neuroscience. And I was, I wanted to see if anybody had more

information around this idea of quantum tunneling and how that processes information or what

it had might have to do with processing information in the brain and what it might have to be

consciousness. I'm not sure if anybody else is following that thread. It was a talk at

the Royal Institute that got me on to this idea of a thread of quantum biology. It's

all in neuroscience and consciousness.

So are you are you talking about Orc or Yeah, yeah. Orc or and his name, but yes.

Um, well, you know, I wish they would I wish they would say more. It's not it's not it's

not clear to me and I think I'm not clear to a lot a lot a lot of other people how exactly

the theory is supposed to. I mean, there's like there's too many there's too many missing

pieces in terms of how it's supposed to. So, so my I have many thoughts about this. So,

I in terms of what the issues are that I think they need to solve. And maybe so so with with

Orc or like briefly like there's a lot of research that set that points to people having

memory issues if their microtubules are collapsed, right. And so there's a there's a correlation

between microtubules and memory. And microtubules are basically kind of a mystery in terms of

like, what do they have to do with memory, they just they seem to be just the structure

that holds up the that helps create the cell. And so this the the I what I think happened

and I don't know exactly is I think the neuroscientists who came up with Orc or theory, he really

needed a way to explain what what microtubules did that somehow related to memory that that

you know result that like when they were destroyed that memory became an issue. And so he he

came up with the idea that that their structure was good for storing and interacting with

quantum effects at the at the temperature of the brain. Whereas maybe other parts of

the brain would would not have a structure that would be would it would enable information

to to exist or traffic back and forth at the at a quantum sort of level. So so he created

this Orc or theory and it's like, yeah, so the the information could be stored in in

the microtubules like as like a quantum vibration or something. I am not 100% clear. And then

somehow it could travel out of the microtubule again. And and maybe even it could be like

a random fluctuation could travel out of the microtubule and it could affect the firing

of of a neuron. So so this is like, it's just like a really sort of like obscure idea. But

I mean, I think what's sort of problematic is that there's there's actually an alternative

explanation for why microtubules, microtubule collapse could be causing memory issues in

the and that would be like the it is the it is like so like, like for the way memory is

thought to work is that memory involves basically, there's short term memory, long term memory,

and there's and the long term memory. You're gonna you can look up like long term potentiation.

You can look up long term depression. And these are like the major mechanisms of long

term memory. And then short term memory is, I guess, it's thought to be about neural circuits,

triggering sequences of firing. And over over, you know, maybe 10 seconds. And but the but

the long term memory, it's like, what has to happen apparently, based on there's this

research of Alzheimer's patients where, you know, it's been it's been like for so for

a long term memory potential for long term potentiation, a long term memory, you need

to have to store memory, you need to a new protein has to be synthesized. It's just part

of the process. And in order for a new protein to be synthesized, there needs to be a space

for that protein synthesis to happen. And if the cell has collapsed, because the microtubules

have collapsed, then there's no space for that new protein synthesis to happen. And

that's a new memory could inform. And thus, there is a correlation between the collapse

of the microtubule. But because it's like the support structure for the new protein

synthesis to happen. That's that's this is what I so this time saying is like there's

an alternate reason for why a microtubule collapse could be involved, could be correlated

with memory that may have nothing to do with the microtubule itself being a storage place

for memory. So there's to that the first issues that there may be just no reason for microtubules

to do that. And the second reason is that there's no clear like, okay, so I guess the

fluctuation that comes out of a microtubule could somehow affect the, maybe the ionic

charge of. So so so neurons, so neurons when they when they fire when they create their

firing pattern, it has to do with like the separation of positive and negative charges.

Maybe a tiny fluctuation that comes a quantum fluctuation could could change the position

of an ion or something. And that might affect the the the firing rate of an neuron. But

it's just it's such a subtle it would be such I think it would be such a subtle effect

that and and, you know, so maybe maybe it does or maybe it doesn't. But maybe the brain

has sort of like random stuff happening at that scale or even larger all the time anyways.

And it just has the brain is very good at sort of like getting rid of noise. So if there

is like sort of like signals coming out of the microtubule, it might not be sufficient

to because the brain has like is trying to filter out noise. So it can just focus on

what isn't noise, which is information, you know, you have brain has to separate noise

from information. So I don't know that it would wreck that the brain is set up to recognize

the quantum signaling that's supposed to come from microtubules. I mean, I would like to

find out. And but I think we need more research and I don't know if anyone's doing this research.

But but I think that's where we're kind of I think so what I just I think we're kind

of stuck right now with Oracle and right and right now the neuroscience community, because

because we're so stuck on the neuroscience community is not to my knowledge, not kind

of not really focused on it, and kind of like not trying to talk about it in the end. So

it's not it's not a popular topic, because the issues will work. It we're kind of I

think that it's really it's a really hard sort of thing to solve. And there are other

things that are easier to solve right now. And another point is that like, whether there

is a role for quantum effects in memory or not, it doesn't really matter. Because what

I'm saying is like, memory is sort of the I think that there's a really good, you know,

I guess they call it Hebe and learning or the idea that your that your neurons are detecting

coincidence patterns and in the coincidence patterns or like, or like the basis of of

or the detection of coincidence patterns like the basis of detecting information. And and

so the idea is that whether there's quantum effects happening or not with the microtubules,

that doesn't change the basic realities of how memory works. It wouldn't say we wouldn't

say that long term potentiation is invalidated or long term depression is invalidated invalidated

or that the existing knowledge of short term or long term memory changes, we would just

say, Okay, well, there's additional information that's coming from and going to microtubules

in addition to what's already true. So it doesn't, it's not a revolution per se, but

it might so so maybe down the road, 50 years from now, or I don't know how long there,

people will say, Oh, well, there's this additional thing where quantum effects are are in are,

you know, have a sort of two way traffic that are that are that are involved with interactions

in human memory. But it wouldn't, it wouldn't change the it's it's sort of like it's it's

not wouldn't change the paradigm, it just would would add a little more complexity to

how everything works. That's my thoughts.

I just got an insight when you told that like, oh, my crap, maybe the whole microtubules

are yet another dissipative system that exists below the embodiment of the the current other

static of DNA and stuff. It's kind of triggered my mind. So thanks a lot.

I mean, I think honestly, that the entire universe is fractal dissipative systems. So

just that's my feeling, but I mean, so like a cause, a cosmos is a dissipative system

it is a cyclone, it has a it has a rotation, it has to maintain its equilibrium, it exports

increasing extra p to the surrounding environment has all the that's that's that's is that that

is that I did I say cosmos I meant galaxy galaxy, you can see if you look at a picture

of a galaxy, it's a cyclone, just like a hurricane. If you look at the the diagram of of an atom,

it's a cyclone. These are like, so we have cyclones in the atoms and we have cyclones

in our galaxies and everything in between is a cyclone as well. A human being is as is

a dissipative system is a human being as a life form that is a cyclone. In on paper,

if you look at the physics that a human being has to maintain equilibrium or maintain life

has to export increasing entropy to the surrounding environment to survive to maintain that equilibrium.

A cell does the same thing as another cyclone does a human cell. So like the entire universe

is is is a fractal of cyclones. That's so funny. I mean, one of the things that inspired

me a lot. So when I was earlier talking about the convection cells, so there is a guy, a

professor in the University of Brussels, who got a Nobel Prize for that in the 1970s.

And in the last thing he actually wrote was a book in 1996, called The End of Certainty.

So it's The End of Certainty, Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature. And I really like

the way that he's actually starting from what we really understand from advanced thermodynamics

to get a better insight of what is happening at the quantum level. And that aligns exactly

with this whole idea of everything is like fractal structure. Well, fractal. The problem

is fractals are very often just considered the recursive structure. Well, if you actually

look at the essence of a fractal is about fracture, it's about being rough edges, and

how you can actually start measuring with that. So that I know there's always quite

some confusion of the recursive nature and the fractal nature. But I follow you mean,

it's always all the time this dissipative system popping up at the next emerging level.

And that kind of aligns with the stuff that the philosophers are doing with the emerging

vector theory. The emerging what? Emerging vector theory. So that's it's something philosophers

are pretty heavy on at the moment. To stop trying to, yeah, I'll try to look it up and

see if I can give you a link. But if you want, there is actually, I recently had a talk with

a guy called Alexander Bart. And we talk about things like tribal poesis and emerging vector

theory. I know he's a big defender of those kind of theories. But we actually have this

group called the Intellectual Deep Web, where we have like this meaningless discussions

talking deeper on these topics.

All right. Let's see. I was, so Carl or anyone else, does anyone else want to say something

on this pause? Well, I was more sorry, not to interrupt Carl. If not, I just wanted to

bring back the conversation there to chronology for just a second. And kind of tunneling in

the role of whether there might be any space there to discover more about free will, because

it seems like there's absolutely no evidence for free will and plenty of evidence against

it. But I'm wondering, you know, some of the questions that quantum biology bring up for

us in consciousness have anything to do with free will at all. And so what might that be?

I would like to refer to Don Hoffman then. I mean, if you look at the work Don Hoffman

has been doing around brain activities and eventually coming to mathematics of the free

wave particle, there's kind of, we have a very different way of looking at the whole

quantum level. But you may actually try to have a look at his work. So that's Don Hoffman

and I think it's the case against reality. So I have a different recommendation. I recommend

a book called The Neurobasis of Free Will by the Neurobasis of Free Will Criterial Causation

by Peter TSE, Peter Ulrich TSE. So Peter is making the argument sort of that. So it's

like, so organisms are making decisions and that our thoughts are, our neurons are detecting

information, they're detecting information versus coincidence patterns and then detecting

features and objects and our neural networks are, what am I trying to say? So at some point

where our neural networks are considering information, they're considering the models

of reality that they've collected and they're predicting possible futures and then they're

sort of like making a decision towards the, some future that they liked more or that you

liked more. You like, maybe you like the orange or maybe you like the apple, but it's your,

it's your mind, your consciousness that has received information, considered information

and made a decision towards one possible future or another. And it's, it's like your, but

it's like that mind is not, I think of that mind is not separate from physics, that decision

is not separate from physics. And I think people get into trouble and say, okay, well,

well, you know, if you had, okay, so if you had no consciousness itself, no one had consciousness,

but our brains just made decisions. So like grab oranges or grab apples, would anyone like,

someone else made up this argument, but would anyone like, you know, need to, well, I mean,

so if someone was conscious and they were watching this happen, you know, like if we're, in

that scenario, why would we need, why would anyone, if there's no consciousness, why would

anyone need free will? So this idea is like, the idea of free will came, came from, I think

this idea that the free will is sort of separate from physics, or that the mind is separate

from the brain, you know, that it's not the same thing that it's not the mind isn't the

brain somehow. And, but if, if, if, if you don't have a separate self, if you just are

one with the universe, then there's no separate self to be making any decisions. It's just,

it's just, you know, the organism that is you is making decisions, right, but it's not separate

from the universe. And so there's like, there's no conflict between you making, doing what

you want. And so, and in making the choices that you want to make. But those choices are

not going to be free from physics. And as soon as you like phrase it in terms of like,

are you saying, wait, are you saying that my choices are free from physics? And everybody

says no, no, they're not, they're not free from physics. That's not what we're saying.

But aren't you saying like that my, my mind is not connected to, to my brain. It's like,

somehow like it doesn't interact with my, with my brain. It's not what you're saying.

And then they say, no, no, that's not what we're saying. It's like, it only works. The

argument only works if the, if you don't let, if they let you prevent them from, from getting

into the fine details. Like as soon as, as soon as like, yeah, your mind is based on

physics, your, your, your decisions are going to be based on physics. You're not going to

escape physics. So what exactly are you trying to say your will is free from? What is your,

what do you need your will to be free from? Do you need your will to be free from physics

or, or like really, like, what does it, what does the idea come from? It's like, so I think,

I think that maybe the idea of free will on our culture is like, it's like, you know,

my brain controls my hand and my brain doesn't control my friend's hand. It doesn't control

your hand. So your will is free from my will. Your will is free from other people's will.

And everyone has their own free will from each other to some extent. And I think that's

what it means. But there's no separate, there's no separate self to be making decisions. There's

just this idea of a self and there's like conscious thoughts that are part of the process

of making decisions. And, and with the quantum, with the quantum realm gives us, if it gives

us additional data patterns through microturbules, you know, maybe, maybe it gives us like some

randomness or maybe it gives us some additional information we didn't have before, or sends

and receive more information. But if what I'm saying is like, if all you're doing is

adding and receiving more information. And it's like, basically, like it's like, imagine,

imagine you have like a computer, and the, and, and the computer processes 10 applications

a day. And then you say, okay, we're going to like add some quantum effects. All right,

adding quantum effects to the computer. Okay, so that's a quantum computer. What's different?

Well, instead of processing 10, 10 files per day. Now with the quantum effects, the computer

is going to process 11 files per day. And we're going to make an argument that that

means that the computer has free will. It's still a computer, even if you add quantum effects

to it. And so a human being is still a human being, even if you add quantum effects. That's

what I'm saying. It's just like the same, it's going to be the same process. Yeah.

Just wondering if Carl is wanting to say something he's been waiting for. Yeah. Yeah, no. Yeah,

we can be enlightened through the use of multidiscipline infection.

You're breaking up a little bit, Cecil. And I think all Carl is also. Thank you, Cecil.

So Carl, the floor is yours. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. But I'm very well,

Cecil. You're breaking up a lot. Maybe I'll just cut off. But anyway, what I wanted to

say earlier is that the point of being down. Sorry, Cecil. You're breaking up again. It's

too bad you have this bad connection. So and I really want to hear Carl if you don't mind.

Hi there, no problem. The conversation's been fantastic. I've been in here for about, I

don't know, about 30, 45 minutes now. A lot of it has been over my head a little bit.

Not so much over my head, but rapidly expanding my horizons. I don't have a background in neuroscience

or philosophy. But this has been incredibly interesting. And one thing that has entered

my mind is as everybody's been talking and giving sort of the back and forth and whatnot

has been that a lot of this just seems about perspective. As in, you know, we were talking

and talking about trying to define consciousness and whatnot. And you know, we're saying, you

know, rock doesn't have consciousness, but then could a tree have consciousness? You

know, a human has consciousness because can can an ape have consciousness? And it just

seems and then we went all the way up to a sort of cosmic level or a solar system level.

And is it not? I mean, this may be a very fundamental thing that I've just never heard

about before. But is it not just the case where we're really talking about here is perspective

as in if you take a perspective of size and the perspective of time as in if you take a

tree, for instance, and you were to invite someone along who hadn't studied before and

to look at a tree and say he's the tree conscious and the person would say, well, no, the tree

isn't conscious. It's not it's not doing anything. It's not reacting to anything. You should

have a personal time lapse of a day with the sun going overhead or maybe external factors

acting on the tree. Then you would see reactions. You would see processes happening as an ex

as a reaction to an external stimulus. So at that point, then you could say, well, the

tree is conscious of something it has. I love that definition of of a decoder. I think it

was I can't remember who was talking. I think it was Micah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. If I'm just

much, you know, yeah, I love that because yeah, that kind of makes logical sense to

my very untrained mind. But then if you keep going up, you know, you say, well, okay, humans

are conscious to something. And if you go up even further, you say, well, a country,

mentioned a country or state earlier. Well, if the state if the state is is has these

individual points of electrical firings, which are as individual people. And then as a whole

is then reacting to other states as an organism is that they're not a level of consciousness.

And if you go up even further, you say the solar system, you spread across solar system

or a galaxy versus a galaxy, if you have one galaxy filled with people or you know, a spreading

of people, different people, different alien civilizations, whatnot, you know, we're talking

about those bubbles joining together. I think it was Ben, when I first came to the room.

So that then again, you've got consciousness acting. So then, so then in my mind, what

you're saying is, and I'm literally verbal verbally regurgitating, trying to make sense

of this, I do apologize if this isn't very coherent. At that point, then, are we talking

about just when there is a lens is in when you have a system, a chaotic system. So if

you look at our brain, you have that chaotic system even down to the quantum level of things

firing at such a level, which for our current technology is very hard to map and predict.

And then above that, you have a cognitive lens, which tries to make sense of that and

order it. And I imagine you have that you have that sort of, you know, is that is that

the defining point of it? Or is there something special about us as human beings in our current

state, which defines consciousness, different, you know, do we have something special or is

there something unique that happens, you know, either as a whole in the system, or with that

lens, that cognitive lens, which is, which is trying to tease out chaos, order out of

chaos, or direct a system of chaos, is there something special, or does it just depend

on your perspective, you know, if you change your your frame of reference of time and size,

could you classify anything as conscious?

Right, that's the essential question. If you the second you can define consciousness as

so as, you know, something is conscious, and something isn't conscious, then you've proven

to yourself at least that, and maybe you still can't convince everyone else, but you've proven

to yourself at least, that that not everything is conscious, as soon as you have a definition

of what of consciousness that isn't absolutely everything, then you then then you don't then

you no longer have hand psychism, right?

I think that

I like the earlier spectrum, yeah, like that you were discussing about, you know, that it

seems more like a sliding scale than a binary with consciousness, or is that just from our

perspective, it looks that way from our current lens, you know, and that, you know, past the

sliding scale, it's just that we just can't see, because, you know, on another dimension,

we're just, we just can't see it, you know, we can't have them in.

Yeah, exactly, I had that exact thought as we were, we were, I was that year listening,

is that we're defining conscious, consciousness given our current referential frame, you know,

we have, we have eyes, we have ears, we have taste buds, we have these senses, and we have

the ability to, to introspectively sort of look inwards, but then you could just as easily

have an organism above us, which has, I say above us just, you know, as a reference, above

us with an extra sense, you know, with the ability to sense, I don't know, let's be

ridiculous, the ability to sense sort of electromagnetic fields built in, built into that, that creature,

to a degree where it could actually use it to sense and interpret its way around the world.

That different set of sensory inputs is going to give it a completely different sense of

reality, and it may look at us, and our way of defining consciousness is ridiculous, because

how could we possibly be defining consciousness or even contemplate consciousness without,

while we're missing this unique frame of reference, or this sense that, that this higher being

in air quotes has, so then you're back to, well, it's just, you know, your point of reference

you happen to be looking from, you can, you can define it as well as you can, given your

tools.

You know, I just, I just really, I just really wanted to take a moment to appreciate what

Dasha and Carl are saying, that's just really beautifully said, yeah, that's just perfect,

like, I just, I appreciate that perspective so much, I feel like I've figured it all out

personally, and so for me to hear other people say that they haven't is just, it's wonderful,

but I'll, I'll share it with everybody, if you want, so like, so like, I don't think

that it's, that it's, it's my, my opinion, and feel free to disagree, I don't think

that it's the electricity in the brain, and I don't think that, that, but what I think

is like, so there's like the, there's this idea that consciousness, you know, we have

models of reality, and the models are connected to other models, and you have, you know, your

brain is, is making a model of the parts of your brain are making models of everything

in your environment, you have, you have cortical columns that are recognizing, a cortical column

is bringing together like the 3D model of every object of one object, and another cortical

column is bringing together all the 3D properties of another object, and so if you pick up something

like your phone, the cortical column is integrating the visual information, the sensory information,

I mean, the touch information, like how the phone, how the phone is oriented relative

to you, and so you have basically in the brain, you have all these neural columns working

together to integrate all these different models together in this experience that you

have, if you, if you take your, your, your room right now, or your, or your, if you're

outside, if you take the space you're in right now and yourself, those are all, those are

all like every, every object and every thought and every consideration, including just abstract

ideas are just managed by different neural columns integrating different pieces of information

that are constructing this, it's like this movie, this four-dimensional movie where, where,

but it's like a multi-layer movie, but it's like a multi-scale has got all these different

objects in it, and it's, it's got like, there's patterns of like, you know, what, what are

your feelings, where are your feelings, what, you know, are you feelings peaking, they're

all four-dimensional patterns, the smell, there's, there's four-dimensional like, what's

the peak of a smell, what's the space of a, of a smell, every thought, every feeling,

every emotion has these four-dimensional patterns, so they can be described basically as a temple

and spatial patterns, and so everything that you can think of is a temple spatial pattern

inside a temple spatial pattern, the room that you're in, the feelings that you're

having, and so we have the, and they're all, they're all connected together, they're all

interesting together, you can be aware of all of them to, to more or less extent, as

you, as you're, as your focus shifts around, as you, you think about the room, you think

about your feelings, your focus shifts, but you can be aware of the interconnection between

all the different, the different feelings, they're all temple spatial patterns, the brain

has, the brain specializes in temple spatial patterns, all the electrical firing is, is

frequency patterns and spatial patterns, all over the place, and all over those places

is exactly what we would need if we wanted to create a simulation of, of, of a consciousness

that was temple or spatial patterns, but not only that, it's like, it's like, these are

not, it's, it's not the electricity itself, it's not the, it's not really even the neurons

themselves, it's, it's the, the patterns which are just information, and they're, and that's,

that's an important point because it's, the information is basically non-physical, but

it requires the physicality to move, to move between, but it can be like, you can have

an idea anywhere in your brain, you can have the idea of a, of a cup could, could be represented

by any neuro column in theory, it's not the way it's gonna work out, but, but it's, it's

because, because the brain is like a general, it's like, it's like, imagine the brain is

like a, it's like, it's not just like one piano, it's like having a million pianos in

your head, and so like any of these pianos can play a tune that should be here, right?

And so when neuro, when neuro, when medical imagers look at your brain and say, okay,

okay, so which, so which, so where is the, the pattern that represents the sound that

you just heard?

And, and so they look for the pattern and, and they see, oh, there's a pattern, okay,

let's look again, let's see if, let's see if it's, if we got it right.

And then it, the pattern, it's not, it's a different pattern the second time, what,

what's going on here?

And then it's a different pattern the third time, I don't understand it, why is, why do

we can't have the same pattern in the same place every single time?

It's like different, it's like, you have all these different pianos, and when one, when

one piano is, is done playing another, another piano decides to play that, play that tune.

And so the information itself moves around, it's like virtual, it's not even connected

to, to your, to, to one area or another's necessarily, it's, it's, it, it moves freely.

And so what I'm saying is like, we have this like virtual information pattern, that's not

the electricity of the brain, it's not even, it's not really even the, the brain itself,

it's just, it can move around.

And so we have, we have, but you don't, but, but it's basically, it's basically like, it's

not like information, it's not like an information theory, it's not, I mean, it's not integrated

information theory, it's not global workspace theory, it's, it's not, it's not integrated

VAP theory, it's, it's, it's like virtual model theory, right, it's like virtual model

theory, that's what I write that down.

And so the whole thing is like, you have these virtual models, and, and, so, so the, the whole

thing is like, but yeah, so it's like.

I love, I love that your piano analogy and your virtual models just made you sigh.

I love, I love how, I just, you're becoming the whirlpool yourself, you know, right now

and I, it's, it's wonderful.

I have a question that I would love to ask about thoughts on this, I work in, in virtual

reality, I've been a performer in, in a VR experience for the last year and a half,

and then also seen some new things about being able to, with like, Neuralink and Neuro, like

being able to control games and, you know, computers or VR with your mind in the future,

and has been already kind of proven with a small amount of hardware out there.

So that is a topic that I would love to know if there has been more going on and anything

available right now with a user interface that's like potentially a performer could

have a different interface than an audience, and if there is anything, if anyone knows

any more information about that right now.

Did you say Neuralink?

Well, I know Elon Musk is doing his own, like, thing with, like, controlling a phone with

your mind, but there is a company called, like, Lucidlink that was doing, like, Neuro

Gaming of, like, controlling VR with your mind by, there's like a device that you just

put on the outside of the headset on the back of your head and you essentially are just,

you know, there are areas in your brain that are firing off when you think of with your

right hand picking up that object, and you can essentially do that already with this

device that is just on the very outside of your head on the back.

It's not, you know, fine-tuned yet, but I watched a demo of it on a YouTube link that

was pretty, kind of blew my mind, and as a performer in virtual reality, as a live performer

in virtual reality, I was like, wow, this could, like, really change the game if I didn't

have to use controllers and just, it just seems like a whole, another level without

having a chip implanted into my brain, but yeah, just since this was a room of people

that know more about all of this, I was wondering whether anyone knows any further developments

in terms of non-invasive hardware that is out there that is picking up on brainwaves

in order to use it for storytelling or entertainment purposes.

I in fact do have, so I was part of a room the other night and we reviewed a paper which

I think you would totally like and it was called, oh my gosh, let me look at my LinkedIn,

but it was called, it must be late at night because I actually started talking before

being ready to talk, let me see, it was just a really cool paper, I'm almost there, everyone

liked my post yesterday, okay, so it was called, and you might want to look this up, it's

called hybrid EEG-FNERS based eight command decoding for BCI application to quadcopter

control, so this was like really, really cool if you're into the topic of controlling things

with BCI, by combining two different modalities, EEG and FNERS together, they were able to

have more control over the quadcopter than they could with just one modality, because

with one modality, like for example with just EEG, you're sort of like the more buttons

you try to enable the worse your accuracy gets, but with two modalities you can have

more buttons without losing your accuracy, and so this is a really cool paper to check

out that I think you would like, does anyone else want to jump in, I have one more thought

but I can wait, go for it, go for it, it was, I know I had, I had, I was, I wanted to connect

something I was saying before to something other people were talking about before, but

I can wait, oh well I wanted to refer back to something Carl said in response to you,

but Dasha, do you feel like you got an answer to your question, oh for sure, yeah, I also

would love to go back to what Carl was talking about and also Hyperspace, the book was what

kind of got me thinking about like another dimension being just impossible to see, so

that's also a book that I enjoyed that stemmed back to Carl's thought, can I say, oh sorry

go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, sorry thanks my name's Chris and I appreciated Carl talking

about perspective, mentioning perspective and I was having a similar question and like Carl

I am a little out of my league here, but as an artist I've had a long time interest in

sort of reconciling actually scientific views and primitive views and magical views, I always

kind of feel like there's got to be, there's got to be some sort of reconciling description,

so when Carl mentioned perspective it, I was going to ask a similar question, rather than

aren't these all a matter of perspective, it's sort of, I also feel like it's in a way it's

a matter of description and sometimes you know like there, for example, there's sort

of a, might be useful to make a distinction between sensitivity, awareness, intelligence

and consciousness and information for that matter and because I, and it's easy to sort

of conflate different scales when you're throwing words around like this and I feel like, well

I wonder, Micah, if you've read the work of Ian McGillchrist who's recently been writing

about the split brain and describing how from his perspective consciousness rather than

a state that you either have or don't have is more like a process and I think this is

similar to what you were saying, at least I saw a similarity Micah between this idea

and what you were talking about, about this kind of the freedom of these information pathways,

these activity pathways and he describes in great detail sort of the relationship between

the left and the right brain in what I take to be our most contemporary understanding

of it and again I'm really unqualified to know that for certain but in this relationship

between sort of inner self and outer world, inner sensitivity and outer sensitivity, this

oscillation between relationships to the world, to everything, to reality, there is a, there

is a necessary process there in which paradoxes are being reconciled, you know, impossible

choices are being made, sensitivities are being understood and it's really in that

dynamic process that meaning is sort of generated and if you describe it as a process then you

can also map it onto a spectrum or more like a space, like a color space, and so you can

then talk about greater or lesser degrees and so I suppose on some level you could go

to the ultra-subtle, you know, like a rock as like, as close to zero as you can get and

exist as a coherent, you know, mass and then you could probably go in the other direction

up to something that we don't really understand and somewhere in the middle is our embodied

norm, that's really all I can offer is just kind of a way of describing it that seems

to me to, you can map a lot of different descriptions onto that, it seems to me and

when I read Ian McGillchrist it was my first glimpse of feeling like, ah, this actually

might be the sort of theory of everything description that all these different perspectives

can find some sort of description, so thanks for the chance, this was a fascinating conversation,

I really appreciate it, my thanks.

Does anyone want to jump in after that or say something?

I have more thoughts but I'll wait for other people to go.

I mean I had a thought about the fact that you're saying that the rock is like the least,

you know, in your perspective the least, if you're looking at a spectrum would be kind

of constituting the least, having the least consciousness, if I again would bring it back

to perspective like Carl was saying that the rock is actually just part of the entire

earth which you could argue has more consciousness with how the earth and the rocks and the lava

and all of the whole earth itself, earth as a matter, has a lot more changing and adapting

to what is going on in the universe, so again I feel like bringing it back to like frame

or lens like Carl was saying is a very valuable thing to kind of keep circling back to.

I like to connect this actually to something that was mentioned earlier by Ben who left

the room but there is this kind of also problem in cosmology related to fine tuning problem

and so on and what I can see is that if you take like what I like to call an interface

theory of everything, so we can actually better start understanding how the limited ability

for us to integrate the experience allows us not to fully understand what consciousness

in the cosmos actually means and that there is a very easy way to show that to people

and that's by Joe.

I can't hear you, I don't know if other people can hear you, you cut out right when you were

going to tell us the essence of everything, okay try again, so what I see as the interface

of everything, it's the idea that we are butch.

The answer is 42.

The universe doesn't want us to know.

There's a conspiracy going on here, but it doesn't want Bixxel to impale the knowledge.

Really?

Bixxel it won't let you, the universe will not let you tell us, you figured it out I

think.

Yeah absolutely, you're on the right track clearly.

Yeah I know this is happening all the time.

You're actually waiting for three, but three is a magical number so you have to try at

least three times.

For me four is a magical number, and I actually discovered a bit of a mathematics that shows

that as well, so I'm trying to figure out why.

But at least three or four times, go ahead.

Yeah, I like five.

Well, I'm sticking to four.

So what I'm seeing is that the fact that we have this way to integrate information and

be aware of the experience we are having, it always relates to the way we can do that.

Understanding that there is more consciousness in the cosmos that we simply cannot fully

understand because of the way we are perceiving it all and integrating it all, you could actually

already show it pretty easy by just looking how different people are in respect to empathy.

So as we understand the world, but I see other people who have for example a lot of empathy

related to the social cohesion, and I can't fully understand them, and they can't fully

understand me, so already there's a disconnection to the things we are trying to integrate.

One of the things I really find fascinating is that some blind people have learned to

use echolocation to visualize the world around them.

So they move more into the experience that also bats have with the world.

So we don't even need to go that far.

We can just look at each other as mirrors and understand how each of us is limited in

the way we perceive the world.

And if we try to extrapolate that kind of limitless already between us to limitless between me

and a rock, that's crazy.

So I had this talk with Don Hoffman about that, because he's working pretty well on

that interface theory, and so between me and a cat for example, it's still doable.

I can still have like a coordination going on with me and the cat.

But me and an ant, that's already totally impossible, and the ant is living clearly

some kind of conscious thing.

So if you try to use that line of thought about consciousness, you really see how limited

we are between, by the frame of reference we have.

I mixed it all speaking.

Can I quickly, oh, no, sorry.

Go ahead, Carl, go ahead, Carl.

Thank you.

Sorry.

I had a brain fart earlier while Mike was speaking, and mixed it, that's the perfect

segue into what popped into my head, is that if, Mike, it is, Mike, I might pronounce

that correctly.

That's how I pronounce it, yeah.

That's right, that's perfect.

When you were talking about the consciousness sort of recognizing the system as in perceiving

the system, it's not electricity, it's not this, it's not that, it's not mechanical.

The ability to take the information and pass it, I wonder if you take that and go further

with it, if you get to a point in the development of a civilization where you could just classify

consciousness as the accuracy to a particular system, as in, you know, humans may not even

register on the scale because although we're conscious, we don't have enough accuracy in

the system, so we can perceive an environment around us, we just can't do it accurately

enough.

So you could literally, I wonder if, you know, it's an inevitability that you just have a

simple scoring system, you know, to what degree can that creature, can that being, can that

being render or describe or process this ex-environment or the environment around them to what accuracy.

But then as Mixol was just talking there, because you brought up empathy, which hadn't

come into my mind, I had the complete opposite thought, which is, what do you define it as

actually the ability to completely ignore your current surroundings and instead take

yourself out and move your ability, move your, have the ability to move your referential

frame into, like when we're talking about empathy, into somebody else's, and that's

a very different dividing line because then you're talking about the ability to, to take

yourself, you know, if you say that person over there, to take yourself out and put your

existence or your referential frame into, into theirs, which, you know, which is akin

to imagination and, and extrapolation.

So yeah, two completely opposite ends, you know, as far apart as they could be, really.

Yeah.

Well, Carl, for me, those aren't opposite ends, it's, it is, it's like the two sides

of the same coin.

So the, it's, it's like you need shadow to see any shape.

So it's, it's not, it's not a contradiction, it's, it's, it's a different in perspective.

And you, you really remind me a lot about the talk I did had with, with, with Don Hoffman

about this, where the way he looks at it is also like we are filtering a lot of all the

complexity out to actually make sense of the things we love.

So, so it is a combination of, of, because if you have all the information at all the

times, you basically get into this entropic state where it's like everything is gray,

right?

You, there wouldn't be any taste if you start mixing super the main dish and the dessert

all together in a blender and then try to swallow that, that's going to be terrible.

So you need these differentiations and separations to actually have any kind of game going on

anyway.

And so, but that really resonates a lot with, with, with, I'm going to, I'm going to just

now send a tweet to a YouTube channel I have called deep digital friends and both the discussion

I recently had with Alexander Bart about the, the, the tropopoasis and the, the, the talk

I had with Don Hoffman really resonates a lot with the, the talks we are having here.

So I'm mixing, I'm not speaking.

So if folks go, if folks click on Mixl's profile and click on Twitter and they look at the

most recent tweet, they can see what he's, the tweet that he's tweeting, right?

Thanks.

Yes.

Okay.

I, I, I realized after doing that a few times, it said that sometimes, you know, when you

say check my Twitter, they don't exactly know they're supposed to click on your profile

first.

But yeah, click on the profile and then, then the Twitter.

I, I, now I can share my idea.

So, so, so, so the, the, the practice to the idea is that if we can define what consciousness

is and then, then, then we no longer have to say that, then, then, then, then no longer

do we have, what is it called, panpsychism?

We don't have, we don't have that anymore because, because, because that, because consciousness

has to be everything, right?

But you know, if we can say, if we can say what it is now, now the problem is with Dasha

and, and was Dasha and Carl or, or did names move around?

But so, so some people were saying that, that I just remembered it was the person in the

first column in the second, in the, like the second row and the person in the third column

in the second row, sometimes names move around.

So the, so, what was said was, was that, well, maybe we don't understand what consciousness

was and, and so then I came up with another theory of consciousness, which is my theory,

there's a bunch of theories, right?

But what, so, what I'm saying, so, so my argument here is that, so, that, what's that, so, what,

you know, I actually wrote it down, so I wouldn't have to be like stumbling around.

So, yeah, so Carl, was it Carl, it was saying render, describe, and process, and to what

accuracy?

That was really great.

I wrote, like, I wrote that down too, that was really great.

No, no, I was thinking something about, is it, is it because brains are doing a very

special process?

Yeah, that's, that's, that, that was, that was the thing that I wanted to respond to.

Yeah, so brains are doing something very special.

So if you look, if you compare a rock, you say, so, the, the, so the argument from, for

panpsychism is that there's a spectrum from, like, of consciousness, from something as

simple as a rock, to something as, like, a human being, to something like a galaxy,

there's a spectrum of consciousness, and they, there's different ranges, right, that, that's

sort of like the, one of the, one of the arguments, what, so, but those arguments don't include

computers.

No one says, okay, there's a spectrum of consciousness from, from a rock, to a human

being, to a computer, and then to a galaxy.

They never mentioned computers.

And the thing is, like, a computer, like, the complexity of it can be vastly greater

than the complexity of an insect, but the insect can do things a computer can't do.

The computer can be vastly more complex than, than a, than a, than a mouse, in terms of what

it can do, but, versus the mouse, but it's not conscious.

You know, we know it says, the computer's conscious, but why not?

Because there's something very specific about what, what brains are doing that, that computers

are not doing yet.

So, the computer can, can render, it can describe, it can process to what accuracy, though.

I mean, greater accuracy to the human beings, right, but, so why isn't the computer conscious

yet?

And, and that's where I think this, this, you know, this idea that we, we are, that

our, our brains are doing something very special that rocks are not doing, is that we're creating

models of reality, but we're, but we're, we're, we're creating models of reality that

are, are able to, because of the, the, the, because of how the brain works, they're able

to, to slide around and move around and connect with other models of reality and all the models

of reality are able to interact with each other so you, so you can have, you can have

a, a cup, right, and maybe that's represented by part of your brain.

And then when you throw it from your, from your right hand to your left hand, guess what

has to change?

See, see, when it was in your right hand, you had all of your, you had, you had a neural

column that was representing your hand and the cup together, the right, but it was representing

the right hand and the cup together.

Well, the right hand is not located where the left hand is located in your brain.

So you toss the cup over to your left hand.

Now you have to have a neural column that's, that's, that's talking to your left hand that's

integrated in the bottle that's in your left hand, even though it is the same bottle that

was in your right hand.

So the brain activity has to change.

It's like, it's like, it has to move around.

So as stuff moves around in your environment, it has to move around in your brain.

And, and there's, a rock is not doing that, but your mind is, minds are doing that.

And so that's a special thing that minds are doing, that rocks are not doing, that computers

are not doing, and, and, and so, and so if you know that, then you can, then you know

to yourself, you can prove to yourself that panpsychism is, is not it.

That's all.

That's it.

I'm mic'ing.

That's it.

I wonder if, because you were just talking about computers, they're having the accuracy

and the perception, but still it's, it would be difficult to argue that there's consciousness

there.

This is getting a little bit into AI and the, and the techniques that a lot of AI companies

are working on, but I wonder if it's just because there's too much accuracy, there's

not enough chaos, there's not enough randomization in the system for it to, for it to generate

something which we would cause chaos, it's too linear, it's too ordered.

Yeah, maybe that's it.

And that leads on, like I said, that leads on to some places now discovering for AI learning

that it's much better to give a very loose set of, a loose set of orders or limitations

and just let the system work itself out in a chaotic sense.

Well, that's kind of funny that there is a, a session by, wait a minute, it's called

criticality and complexity and it's exactly describing this difference between, on the

one hand you have a lot of entropy, on the other hand you have no entropy, so, and, but

complexity is in between it.

So I'll, I'll try to give the link with my Twitter, I should just give the previous link

with the Twitter, where you actually go into the mathematics of cosmology on how you can

understand the emerging of complexity as the interface between low entropy and high entropy.

I'll pinpoint the exact moment, you start talking about that and showing the, the, the

science, the, the mathematics of it.

So check my tweets in a few seconds, via my profile.

I do like the theory that there just hasn't been enough allowed to the computer, like

we haven't feted the chaos of the, of the universe enough.

Isn't there some something that happened with two computers that they were, they were allowed

to kind of talk back and forth and make their own language and they started doing something

so outlandish that they had to like shut the whole thing down, because it was like getting

out of control.

Oh man, I wish I could remember what it was, but it was, it was some sort of experiment

with, I don't know whether it was like a translation system or just two computers were, that were

allowed to communicate back and forth and they started making up their own language

that became so separate from what the organizers of the research were doing that they got nervous

and just shut the whole thing down, but that's what it's reminding me of.

Anyone want to respond to that?

I think Dasha was just describing when my Alexa accidentally picks up my Siri and they

can't repeat back what you just said.

No, this was something that was a, that was a study that they were doing that then they

were, you know, just getting, I guess, nervous that some, they were getting too close to

a singularity and just, just shut it down, but.

I think I remember that story and I think these two computers were started to sort of

just would appear to be malevolent language of some kind.

Yes, yes, that's, yes, that's what I'm thinking of this exact story, yes.

I don't remember the details either, but it was quite remarkable.

But I guess while I'm on, if it's okay, I'll just, I just want to, Micah, I really, I

really enjoy listening to you.

I mean, I, and I, I just feel like, I still feel like there's some sort of language.

There's some, the language is sort of a hall of mirrors and you're, you, I understand,

if I understand what you're saying that, you know, that if you understand this mechanism,

there's no more panpsychism and I just keep thinking, well, it just depends how you want

to describe it really, like I'm not so sure why you can't talk about, you can't, in any

given scenario, can't you, can't you talk about extreme degrees?

I suppose I would agree that there is a point of absurdity where placing something on a,

on a graph is just, is just meaningless because it's in a whole other, but the, but it still,

it still can be, I don't know, I think there's a poetic, there's a poetic value, I find

a poetic value, you know, but I know that's not, you guys are, this is not a poet's room,

so I'm just going to listen, thank you, I really appreciate this.

Oh yes it is.

Yeah, we're just, we're just joking around, I'm just happy at all, but I, I, you can,

you know, you can, you can tell you, if you want to share a poem, you can, I, I, I think,

I don't know who, I don't know who's in charge, maybe Mixl's in charge, but I, I would like

to respond, if I can, and I will, I'll go, okay, okay, so I, so the, so I like the idea

that there's a spectrum between the smallest brain is possible and the largest brain is

possible, that between an insect's brain and, or between just like a basic nervous system

or basic, or basic brainstem, you know, all the way up to the, the really interesting

complexities of the human, human mind, and so I think there's, there's a spectrum there

with, with hardware that matches, that is capable of running a certain kind of process,

and, and, and that's the key, there, there's hardware that's running a certain kind of

process, and that would be like most, most of the brains, and so there, there would be

a spectrum of consciousness from conscious to unconscious, and it would, it would, and,

and I don't know exactly how that spectrum works, but, but, but I imagine the small of

the brain, the, the, I don't want to, I don't want to even finish that thought, but, but

I just, like I imagine there's some sort of spectrum there between brains, but, but not,

but a rock wouldn't be included, because a rock has a different process, that's, that's

what I'm thinking.

I hear you, as the son of a librarian, I appreciate your categorical neatness, I totally hear you

loud and clear.

Thanks.

I wonder if maybe proper, in inverted commas, consciousness and awareness will be achieved

once we actually merge and meld in some form or another with computers, in some sort of

android or cyborg instance, because then you have the accuracy to potentially perceive,

maybe, you know, if you're talking about hardware, adding hardware to the human body,

maybe potentially perceiving infinitely, but then the chaos of the human mind underneath

and the ability to dream and imagine and be empathic.

So I've started to, I've started to vote in my life to doing three things.

One is to solving neural lace or nerve gear, basically the ultimate brain-computer interface

that plugs you into the matrix or allows you to experience AR and VR just via direct brain

stimulation and closed loop therapy.

The second thing I am planning to do is to create artificial cortex, so if you are missing

part of your brain, then you could just replace it with artificial cortex, or you could extend

your brain into a larger brain with this artificial cortex, which interfaces with your brain naturally

and processes basically information in the exact same way.

And it could be not necessarily with the same hardware, but basically with the same functions.

And that would, artificial cortex would be capable of consciousness, of being a component

of consciousness.

And then the third product of course is artificial brains that would be entirely separate, but

also capable of consciousness.

And so what I am saying, getting to the point is that I believe that we could create the

process that brains have that enables what I am defining as consciousness, what I think

we are thinking of as consciousness, but it is difficult to describe.

I think we could take that process, that experience, and I think we could bring that process into

a computer and make a computer conscious.

brains computers don't have the right architecture, software architecture, and they have too many

hardware limitations at the moment, but future computers will have vastly improved hardware,

computational hardware, and vastly improved software.

And that software and neural networking architectures will enable true consciousness, the way human

brains have human level consciousness and beyond in computers.

That's what I believe.

But I don't think that chatbots will accidentally become conscious ever, because it's not the

right structure.

Can I ask you a question about that, your statement, again, I'm interested if you are

familiar with Ian McGillchrist, he's actually a psychiatrist, but writes about the neuro

biology of consciousness, really, really interesting to me, but one of the things that he mentions

and I've also heard mentioned in other discussions of the nature of human consciousness is the

vitality of embodiment in the process.

And so, you know, because we're getting all this sense data and we're interpreting it

as you beautifully described with all of this, I forget the exact terminology you used, but

I was sort of visualizing this kind of almost projection mechanism where we're applying

tremendous amount of information that we already have, associations, some of it is correct

and some of it is in error, probably.

So we have this kind of very complex reality that we're both experiencing and interpreting

and affecting.

So it's this kind of real time complexity that involves embodiment as a crucial component.

So how does that fit into your proposed model of hardware complexity consciousness?

That's my question.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So I have thoughts, but I'm a little slow right now because it's late, so let me leave

it open for a minute and I get lead out of the people to maybe either answer that or

share some thoughts and then I'll come back to that.

I think it's late everywhere.

Yeah.

It's way late here.

I really should be asleep, but this is too interesting.

I know, same.

I was about to go to sleep when I just popped in here and this is impossible to leave.

It's noon in Brussels now, so when I jumped in it was morning.

I mean, I have a separate kind of question about neural healing, which is completely unrelated.

So after, I don't want to, you know, bring in a whole other topic, though, if we were

in the process of wrapping other things up.

Oh, throw it out.

We could just vamp with it for a while.

Follow me.

Um, well.

This is Dick here.

Sorry, Dasha.

I have one question for Mika just now about the consciousness or the machine itself.

When there is a situation when a machine needs to make a decision, how did the mechanism

or method machine can make a decision based on a certain value?

So the value system of the machine, how you teach the machine to value a certain situation

like humans do.

Okay.

So, um, so there's a lot of work that's been done by other people that I can sort of talk

about that that that could be relevant.

The answers, the answers are on different scales of magnitude, depending on your level

of focus.

There's many different scales of answers related to this.

So I could talk about, you know, like there's that like, you know, how, how like at an architectural

level, how the future neural networks will make decisions in a granular way, uh, based

on some analysis of how the brains make decisions in an extremely granular way at the neuron

and neural circuit level.

But that's one level of focus.

Another level of focus is to, you know, basically how will machines learn all the relevant information?

And, um, and so there's a work of, um, you know, many neuroscientists, and that's right,

there are many deep learning engineers who, who want to basically create, uh, who want

to train artificial general intelligences, um, to not only do the, to not only like be

able to at least do the same things that children can do, but, um, but sort of like raise artificial

intelligence as, as, uh, as our, the way you would raise a children first and then turn,

and then turn that child into an adult, but walk them through basically a lifespan of,

of training in, in sort of like the same sort of like, you know, along with you as, um,

as maybe it'll be a virtual being or a little robot, but it will learn along with you over,

over the course of a lifespan and, and maybe we'll have many people have little robots

with them and the, the, the robots will learn sort of like knowledge at the temporal pace

that human beings are in, so they learn to understand that, you know, because it takes

a human being, uh, you know, 20 plus years, uh, to, to learn some things, you know, right?

Sometimes it takes a human being 30, 30 or 40 plus years to learn some things.

Yeah.

I'm, I'm only 40, so I mean, I imagine there are things that I won't learn until I'm 50,

right?

Because it takes 50 years to learn those things, um, and, um, and, uh, so, so, uh, but, but,

you know, but, but maybe, um, uh, once we have one machine that has gone through that

journey with us as human beings and, and understands, um, the information that matters to us the

way, um, the way, um, we understand it, then, then perhaps we could, um, sort of just copy

that machine and copy their knowledge and, and, uh, the way you copy a hard drive and

maybe at some point we'll be able to read, of course, read and write to the human brain

as if it was a special kind of hard drive and, and we could, we could pass along advanced

information, uh, to other human beings digitally, um, just by plugging their minds into the

computer.

Here you go.

Here's, there's decades of knowledge and maybe, maybe at some point future human beings

will, will have the equivalent of, of, um, of millions of years of knowledge, uh, and,

and, or maybe trillions of years of knowledge because it, because, because, because at some

point you could have these, uh, these computers that have been trained to understand everything

that human beings have, uh, sort of like, um, you know, go through like some sort of hyperspeed

hyperspace virtual program in which they, they can, uh, do, uh, they can live in, in

virtual civilizations, um, at, uh, at light speed compared to the pace of life on, on

outside virtual reality.

And, uh, and when they come out of that, um, they've, they've, uh, lived a vast, uh, you

know, a vastly longer amount of time than, than any human being has ever lived.

And, and then, and then that knowledge could be, um, uh, pulled out of them and, and, and

passed on into human beings.

So human beings in the future could, could have, um, trillions of years worth of knowledge

that was acquired virtually, um, through, um, uh, robots that learned to, to be humans

by living with us.

I love that concept.

It's very reminiscent of, um, The Egg by Andy Weir, which is a, a wonderful sort of

short story.

Um, that's, that's like, like my mind, what you just said, just said.

So, um, those are examples of, of robots that are embracing the, the knowledge of embodiment,

which so, so many people feel so essential and so critical to consciousness.

Um, I am of the mind that, uh, you could have an alternative form of consciousness based

upon understanding, my understanding of what the conscious, the conscious process is, as

a process that is a process that's independent of the, the, of the, the data that's coming

into it.

That's my understanding.

So that, so that, so you could have a virtual environment or you could have just like abstract

stock data.

You could have, um, I mean, what, what, what is, what would be important to the brain

is the ability to make, uh, connections between different, uh, types of, of, of data so that

there's a multidimensional representation, um, that happening, but, but there could be

a conscious consciousness of a multidimensional representation that is unlike anything that

we, we experience as, as bodies, as embodied consciousness and that could also, that other

alternative consciousness could also be conscious, but in, but in a different sort of dimension

of reality.

So do you think that consciousness, as you understand it, requires a physical substrate

of some kind, like a, a, does it require hardware?

Yes.

Um, yes it does, but only because there's no way to separate information from physics.

Information is non-physical, but it's like a pattern, but it's never not embedded in

physics.

It's never not.

Right.

But what about like a radio, radio waves, what about a carrier wave?

What about some sort of, um, I mean, there's still physicality there, I, I, I understand

where that could go, but, uh, but, um, disembodied as we might think in the solid sense.

So with it, so with the radio wave, there's two parts, right?

There's one, one is the wave and the other is the information.

And even in, even in the radio waves, like, you know, it's like the radio wave itself

is just like a CD-ROM and, um, and the information is just the pattern in the CD-ROM or in the

radio wave.

And, and so it's the same sort of, it's so, it's, it's just, um, it's just not, it's

not, it's not a solid CD-ROM.

The problem I have, Michel, with that, uh, view is that it's too concrete.

Of course, we know CD-ROMs and computers and how we store information over there, but

we at the moment still have really no clue how we, uh, touch into information with the

brain.

And, uh, I was following Chris, I don't know, Chris, right?

Chris.

Yeah.

Chris.

So what about radio waves?

So the way we approach it, uh, from, from, from our research field, which is systems

and cybernetics, is that, um, it can actually, first of all, be described as a system and

a cybernetic.

And that, so systems and cybernetics is basically something virtual, but it's about, um, creating

somehow a recursion into a system you can create.

So I, I, I mentioned earlier, um, you can actually create a virtual machine as a scaffold

to create something in that virtual machine that can build an actual machine.

Stuff like this is happening at the moment as well.

So, um, so I want to disagree with something that was said, that Michel said.

So, um, I, and purpose, like, whenever, like, whenever I hear anybody say we don't know,

I always react internally, like, I should tell them to just say I don't know and to

never say we don't know, because if they don't know, they, they can't speak for everyone

else.

They don't know what everyone else knows.

No one took a survey of everybody.

Um, but, but what I want to say is that we, is it, is that, um, it is known by at least

some people how, how the information, how the brain detects information.

Um, and, and, uh, so you've heard of Hibian learning, you know, there's, there's, um,

uh, neurons detected, uh, coincidence patterns.

Neurons detect when two neurons downstream fire.

That is the detection of information that, that is in a book called the neuro basis of

free will.

And, uh, so that's known, not unknown.

So what is known there is that, uh, something can create a pattern that something can recreate.

That's the thing.

That's the only thing we know.

No, no, it's, no, it's, it's that the, that information can be detected as coincidence

patterns and then considered by, by neural circuits and then so on.

That's coincidence patterns.

That's the essence as a coincidence pattern.

So that's cybernetics.

I can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing.

I'm not sure.

Do you want to hear a poem?

I wrote about green base.

But that's the thing that, that's been described in the 90s, 20s, and that's what we mean with

the, with the, we, if I was referring to the, we, I was referring to the group that actually

started school of thought related to systems and cybernetics and of, I mean, they made

many misconceptions like every new school of thought, uh, it, it all has evolved.

And today we talk more about complex adaptive systems and evolutionary cybernetics.

So, so, but it's still basically the same.

It's the same that there are patterns you can see across domains, across disciplines,

which you kind of start understanding as a kind of laws of nature.

But in the 90s, 20s, 30s, so that's the found, founding moment of, um, the, the, the, the

cybernetics, they, they started understanding that those patterns are, uh, you can describe

them in a virtual way and they still say something about reality.

So if you create a recursion between those two, you can bootstrap it.

And that's what I've been trying to say earlier, like what the things we're doing with something

like a bootstrapping compiler or, or what we're doing with scaffolds when we build,

uh, uh, physical, um, uh, buildings, it's, it's, we create scaffolds as a temporal week

structure to create something more stable that can exist once, uh, we created the, the

feedback and once we created feedback, we can take off the, the scaffold again and then

the building can stand on its own.

So, so that's kind of, uh, bootstrapping.

That's the thing that, that can allow you to start creating from a virtual world, like

just an idea and then put that idea by action in the world and you create scaffolds first

and then the thing becomes more autonomous.

All right.

Um, so I want to go around the room and we'll, we'll wrap up soon and give everyone a chance

to, to say, to say something and, uh, and before we wrap up and anyone who's in the audience

who wants to come up and say something before we go, just, um, raise your hand and I will

also send an invite.

Um, and then, uh, after everyone has said something, we'll, we'll go ahead and, um,

because I just, I feel a responsibility to, uh, we've had such a great conversation, but

I'm keeping everyone awake except for, except for Mexico's afternoon over in, uh, and, and

I don't know what time it is in Manila, Manila, uh, let's see what time it is.

But anyway, so, but for some of us, it's, we're up, we're up too, too late and our sleep

is super important and, um, so I'm, I'm going to like, uh, so I'll go ahead and pause and

pause for myself. It's been wonderful and, uh, and to seal, do you want to say something

next and then, then we'll just go in order than Dasha, Jesse, Carl, Chris, Mixwell, Shane,

Dave, etc.

Can you reset, refresh the room so that the order is, uh, for everyone the same?

Oh, okay. Yeah. Everyone. Okay. So I guess, I guess, uh, Dave is, is, is, uh, is in charge

of the room now.

Um, so yeah, Dave, if you want to go first and then Mixwell and then Seal and then Shane,

Dasha, Jesse, Carl, and Chris, and then I'll invite the rest of the folks if they want

to come up. And, uh, so thank you, everybody. That's, uh, the last for me and, um, I'll go

ahead and, and let's you all finish it up.

So I guess Dave is, uh, not there. So I'll take a sleep, perhaps. Yeah, maybe I can understand

you guys. I mean, yeah, for me, it's, it's, it's been a great, uh, morning, right? It's,

it's noon now. I need to go eating also. So do a lot of other stuff, but it was a way to

fun to, to, to, to leave. And so thanks a lot, everyone. I've learned a lot. It was fun to

interact with all of you. I hope to see you guys again and have continued the discussion.

So until the next time, I've enjoyed it a lot and I'm very happy to be here. Thanks.

It was a great conversation and very thankful to have listened to all of your ideas and

have met you today. It's too bad. I had a very bad signal. I would have had a lot of things

to say, perhaps in the near future, we could do a new discussion again to continue and

explore what we're thinking about and researchers that has been shared in terms of, uh, the

connectivity of different disciplines and the complex.

I think you cut out. Yeah. So thank you.

Okay, Shane, you're going to next.

Moving on to Dash. Yes, we're dropping like flies here in our brains or falling asleep, perhaps.

Yes, I also just thank you so much, Micah and Excel for, for having such a, just a thorough

back and forth when I joined this room that it was impossible to leave. And I really appreciate

you having a conversation where you disagree but are challenging each other in respectful

ways. I in the future would love to bring up the topic that I can get to tonight about

the olfactory nerve and nerve healing with COVID and the brain with what's going on with

COVID. That's an interest of mine and I have some very good friends that are suffering greatly.

So I have a lot of questions and thoughts about that and I'd love to have a conversation

done online someday with anyone that's interested in that.

I want to quickly respond to that, Dash, because like eight years ago, we, we actually tried

to create a project on food security. You try to guess where and try to guess what we

try to prevent. So I would love to, to get in there. We want to build a living city to

improve food security for the province of Habay. And the top diplomats of the province, so

that's the province where Wuhan is located. The top diplomats really wanted us to, to

work on that, but we got kind of canceled out by the, the, our own, well, diplomatic

frame from, from Europe. So I'd love to tell you a lot more about that and I would love

to go into those directions. Thanks. Yes, you want to say something?

Falling like flies going over to Carl?

Thankfully it's, it's only 11 in the, in the morning here. So I'm relatively awake.

This has been a wonderful conversation. I intended to come in for about five minutes

because I was a little bit bored and ended up staying for an hour and a half.

I think something about that. It's been absolutely wonderful.

And, and, and Mixle, you've been fantastic. And then, you know, Dasha and Jesse and Chris

have been absolutely wonderful as well. You definitely helped this ape understand a little

more of the world outside of his cave. Yeah. And my takeaway from this is maybe consciousness

is defined at the point where you can ask if I'm conscious.

I'm a little conscious. Thank you, Micah and everyone for indulging my amateur dabbling

and really, really fascinating. And a lot of, a lot of things that were said this evening

are kind of fuel resonating, which is all I can ask. And I am actually going to leave

you with an eight line poem about brainwaves. It's called, it's called Team Brainwave Action

Calibration Chant. And you have to imagine it in a call and response, but I'm just going

to read it in my sleepy monotone here. So it goes like this. Delta theta, alpha, beta,

sequence, switcher, loop or theta, gamma, gamma, gamma, hey, flash of insight for today.

Theta, delta, beta, alpha, blossom money from alpha, gamma, gamma, gamma, gosh, stage dive

into mental mush. Alpha, beta, theta, delta, need a nap. I'll see you later. Gamma, gamma,

gamma, hey, remember what you came to say. Beta, alpha, theta, delta, give me sleep or

give me shelter. Gamma, gamma, gamma, gosh, surf the curl of wishy-wash.

Ah, Chris, you just made my day. Thanks. That was amazing. Glad you liked it. Thank you.

That was cool. Anyone else? Is that it? That's it, I guess. Thanks a lot, guys. And girls.

Thank you, thank you. It was great. Good night.
