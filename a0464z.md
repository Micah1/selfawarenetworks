Thought of the day: if Einstein said that space creates time, and we are space within space then we create time in time?

Brian Bauereis
Do you think that the space we take up within the space that Einstein is describing, are any different? Your thought reminds me of an incredibly interesting fact: our brains are actually able to slow down time during moments when we need the most time available! Individuals perception of slowing down of time, in moments of crisis, is not a perception at all. Maybe your thought of the day just became more interesting. I invite you to look up this wondeful and mind blowing fact. :-)

Spacetime is one thing, space doesn't create time, it is time, time is the fourth dimension of space.
Humans are not separate from spacetime. lol I am spacetime

Micah space-time are interdependent therefore one creates the possibility for the other to happen!
@brian, I'll have a thought about that when I finish work tonight.

If you watch starting at the 44 minute mark he talks about a new theory of how the brain does time. There is no clock inside, different regions of the neocortex experience time at faster or slower rates. The lower regions like V1 will experience time very fast while higher regions will experience time much more slowly. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48r-IeYOvG4&feature=youtube_gdata_player

it's really "spacetime", meaning its not two things :)
it seems like if adrenaline shifted your conscious peak brainwave activity into the lower regions your sense of time would slow down

fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.
