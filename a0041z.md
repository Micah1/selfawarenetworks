The Lorentz invariance is the proposition that the laws of physics are the same for different observers 

action is how much time is perceived by an observer in their own frame of reference

all objects moving through space time move through paths that minimize the time measured on that path?

Fermat: Light always travels the path that minimizes its travel time, the principle of  least time

this is a special case of the Principle of least proper time

the famous double slit experiment

a stream of quantum particles are launched at a barrier with slits in it.

the wave function represents all possible paths that it could take???

the wave function at the screen represents the wave of final destinations for those paths, some more probably than others

Paul Dirac 

Quantum action = integrated time evolution of the wave function
 this quantity
he realized this quantity should result in destructive interference in most places like the 
dark bands in the double slit experiment

constructive interference only where quantum action varied slowly near its stationary points just like classical action

Richard Feynman
Feynman's infinite possible paths weighted by it's quantum action

probability amplitude

it calculates the phase shift that a particle picks up

it effectively calculates the phase shift that a particle picks up along each path towards its destination

the most likely destinations 

then it adds the phases of all conceivable paths to that destination

the most likely destinations are those where the phases line up

The most likely destination between two neurons that fired at the same time is work because the phases between them line up?

Richard Feynman's Path Integral Formulation is a description in QFT that generalizes the action principle of quantum mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or a function integral, over an infinity of quantum mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.

The path integral IS the quantum analog of the principle of least action

a particular final destination is likely if the many phases that could lead to that destination line up.

very tiny changes in the path lead to rapid changes in the phase causing those paths to cancel out

Particles tend to end up near the stationary points of the quantum action

This happens for the paths that take the shortest path, the shortest path through configuration space

the shortest path through configuration space

the space of all possible trajectories given our objects constraints

configuration spacetime for planets determines the path of planets, where the shortest path minimizes proper time

phase space is the space of all possible positions

or it could be the more general state space, all the quantum states that a system could be evolved through

state space, all the quantum states that a system could evolve through

the application of the quantum action principle to the evolution through quantum states under pins quantum theory

Dirac Equation

for each Quantum Field

track the evolution of all quantum fields through configuration space

the configuration space of ideas

"The Principle of Least Action" corrected to Action is always minimized or maximized

the force 

general relative describes the force of gravity in terms of bending of the fabric of space and time

is "Oscillating Space" a thing?

particles are more likely to travel a path that minimize their travel time, out of all possible paths

So the argument for why time dilation around a mass is scale dependent could be that the electromagnetic wave field pattern of space is defined relative to dense oscillators such as planets.

It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in space that it displaces are dissipating the energy from that sphere with distance, the fact that particles dissipate energy with distance causes spacetime to stretch out, but the same principle causes space to fold on itself to become atoms, molecules, chemicals, stars, planets, people, life and asteroids. What it means that an oscillating atom is happening when the path of two or more particles causes an oscillating convergence, where two or more particles start orbiting each other,

It's like why is there always an electron or a proton in every atom? Why don't we have atoms that are only electrons, or only neutrons or only protons?

The phase state of two electrons in orbit would cause them to merge, but I think by merging they would become faster, so they are merging in a temporal way. Like two oscillators with the same phase pattern they can easily merge, but the oscillating pattern of a proton or a neutron cannot merge with an electron because the phase states are not aligned, and that means the shortest path between them isn't the most direct path, and the result is that neutrons and electrons and protons fall into orbits that prevent them from colliding.

The shortest path through configuration space is why dendrite spines from neurons that fire towards other neurons that fire.

because a spine that never existed before pops out of the dendrite wall at just the right place and grows in just the right direction, that point on the wall, and that direction, it's the most excited part of the electromagnetic membrane that is the cell wall, because that point in the geometry of the cell is receiving the most excitement (heat, electromagnetism, mechanical waves, and chemical waves), and with each new signal transmitted the space of possible movements expands in-between the energy sources of waves

heat represents spacetime that is moving faster in the temporal dimension.

heat is relative

its that heated space is moving faster relative to cool space

its like in heated space you have more particles that are taking up the same space, particles in phase (like two electrons) can take up the same space but it cause an interval of time to happen relative to particles that are cooler, as such heat is attractive, and it sends out signals that are stimulating the particle field like an atom

particles that are cool are moving more slowly through time relative to particles that are hot

but particles that are hot are particles of the same phase that are orbiting each other temporally

this means an adjacent particle is receiving two signals from the heated particle for everyone one signal its receiving 

interactions along an orthogonal axis between two objects in space is going to bend spacetime between them

So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.

The combined effect of many oscillators is going to bend space time because each oscillator, and each group of oscillators is bending spacetime according to the density of their combined effect

specifically the center of the perpendicular diameter of any oscillating body, adjusted by its delta in configuration space towards any object in space 


Long Term Depression, Quantum Field Theory, and General Relativity



I have a new quantum physics theory

but back to LTD,

so two neurons fire, at the same time, or close to the same time, because they are close in phase they each send signals to each other at the exact time when each of them is increasing it its interval of growth, everytime a neuron fires its interval of growth accelerates relative to neurons that did not fire at that moment in time, it becomes hotter for brief moment so there is a thermofield that is receiving a phase change

Interesting idea: What if the thermo field was 1:1 correlated time? So that where time was sped up space was hotter. It's an interesting idea. What examples might break that idea?

so it's like time accelerates around particles that have converged together in 3D space to oscillate in time, which causes the expansion of space.

oscillation causes the expansion of space also because it creates more heat
or more relative time

oscillations create more space time relative to their density which is how many particles are oscillating together amplifying each other's effect to create an oscillating body

but the same effect is also going to cause the particle field to become more stretched out at a distance, I'm just thinking about the vast expanses of space between galaxies, this spacetime distance in between galaxies is relative to the temporal velocity of the field of spacetime which is all fields

The temporal velocity of combined oscillators in huge things like planets is going to create a large-scale gravitational effect on the local scale, but past a certain threshold it's going to have the opposite effect where space seems to get more stretched out.

you would eventually have filaments between galaxies

because the oscillating force of each galaxy on the fabric of spacetime means that they warp space time in between them, the signals between the two points in space happen faster because in each respective direction signals are happening faster so the whole space between them is happening faster

and in essence all of space time is an oscillating field with fractalized oscillations happening at every scale down to the planck scale, up to the whole of space at the largest scale

but 

I think we are in communication with other galaxies

there is a new awakening happening right now

the whole of space at the largest scale is either one oscillation or its many, because its size is relative to its oscillations

Space near oscillations moves faster and contracts towards those oscillations, but space in between the oscillations is being pulled towards the hot lines between hot points; they are hot lines because the field is being heated from two directions. These field lines in one sense fold space by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime. 

because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a high frequency (slow) signal with low magnitude

essentially the frequency of mass is it's density per it's oscillating body ie it's volume

but that is spacetime expanded in a sense
because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 

but whereas the positively charged space is like space time accelerating towards itself, ie gravity

the divergence of space horizontally between hot points is going to be an expansive force, almost elastically repelling the galaxies from one another, creating the relative appearance of space expanding as time marches forward because time marching forward means particles falling

My grandfather told me about his work on GPS and about time dilation and how time moves more slowly in space. He worked at ____ putting the first GPS satellites into space.

Precisely timed triangulation with GPS is useful for millimeter precise landing.

Then there is the action  perception cycle

The brain as a fractal, the cosmos as a fractal

thermodynamics
heat as oscillations in time


particles orbiting other particles to expand space when their phases )time frequency does not match

they are trying to take the shortest path through configuration space but configuration space creates a gravitational effect by layering time as heat or excited space

two particles orbiting each other great energy and heat that dissipates signals into the surrounding environment warping spacetime from our perspective but just creating electromagnetic lanes that drive gravitational effects vertically and expand space horizontally through the reciprocal horizontal activity being pushed into the nether regions

galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.

so there is an inversion where time is expanding inside the oscillator, and space is expanding outside the oscillator, and the two expansions are linked, relative and inverted

but we experience time advancing in a forward direction from our perspective because expanding time 

expanding time forces particles that are moving more slowly to iterate forward in time relative to particles that are expanded in time because they are like phases undergoing a bose-einstein condensate

the fusion of patterns of the same frequency causes time to exist for more slowly moving patterns whose configuration now takes longer to iterate because it is moving more slowly through time

in other words time is a configuration of spacetime

spacetime is an oscillation of phase states that is oscillating through possible phase states

I was talking about the different kinds of signals that braincells detect, consider (consideration is a physical process determined by synaptic connections, sensitivity, and thresholds set by the cell or by nearby cells or by the oscillating network of cells in that nuclei cluster and it relates to sensitivity and thresholds varying by numbers of receptors, the state of the cell, other thresholds such as the quantity of ions inside or outside the dendrite, the cells charge displacement etc), and transmit, that includes chemical waves (phase changes), mechanical waves (phase changes), electric waves (phase changes), magnetic waves (phase changes) 

In the deleted note I said something to the effect of: consider also the possibility of chemical waves passed between neurons, glial, and other types of cells that are different from acoustic waves or mechanical waves.
