(cortex, neuron) so neural columns are multi-modal
vision neurons

its too simple?

the visual cortex closest to the frontal lobes is going to be the most multimodal

visual cortex is involved in multimodal processing that is connected

the visual cortex, closest the eyes is going to be the most visual, and least multimodal 

because the makeup of the proportionality of thr modalities of any neuron is going to be based on  the signals that are closes to that neural column.

the human brain is like 3D chess

any square on any level is a neuronal column, and activity is coming from every direction, up down, left, right, forward, back, diagnal horizontal, diagnal vertical, diagnal horizonal and vertical

3D Chess

the idea is that vision is involved in so much of our brain activity that the visual cortex is far more multimodal than has been theorized in the past

so imagine there is a gradient from one end of the visual cortex to the other, the closer to the eyes the more that cortical column is all visual information, the farthest from the eyes the more that part of visual cortex, that cortical column is involved in multi modal processing to the degree that its location

a mouses brain is mostly
