3D signal processing. Okay. So, the human brain is like a 3D signal processor. And that's each cortical column is dealing with information on six, six axis like front back, signals, motorized signals up and down seconds so that means it's like sending or saving signals to six directions and you can say that's not it's not equally true every time a signal because there's there's some one of the directions of your signals to travel through.

00:45

Although there are feedback loops, so there's processing and the whole like rain does, like oscillating loops, but they're still our directions for signals. There's signal paths, right? There are signal pass for voter signals. There's a signals and there's signal paths that sort of preferred to certain kinds of oscillations like they'd observations and hippocampus or delta pathways.

01:22

In the talons Delta and we only have like the sensory input oscillations might be alpha waves. Going to have my wider which higher frequency.

01:42

I'm going to do the beginning of time story. I'm gonna do the beginning of time story and I'm going to, I'm going to take that, like I'm going to talk about Nehemiah (who?). Go from like in 2012 and 2011. What I thought I was going to do was as encoded neurofeedbacks along and had I spent some of the year doing.

02:17

I spent some of that first year doing a lot of research and a lot of testing. In fact, the first two years, a lot of research on a testing tested on myself, I'd have people that I met in San Francisco come and come to my office and test it out and and they report back on their experiences.

02:37

And we had one more person who had try to tried to the experience one time and then they went on to have some incredible breakthroughs and therapy where their multiple personalities coalesced into a single personality. And he was he is a trans man. San Francisco trans, man. That that I met and who had tried?

03:23

My he's one of the rare people who tried neo minecycle town with my business and in the goal is to optimize brains, but of course I couldn't, I couldn't figure out

03:49

How to prove that brain optimization and had happened. I couldn't I couldn't figure out how to it's like, you know, how do you how do you look at brain signals and say, okay, well this is good and this is better. Like this is just, is that we require, like decoding what those brand signals meant, and I wasn't at that place.

04:16

And, and, and I hadn't really even fully grasped at this was the question in front of me, like, it was just so abstract. Like what am I doing? How does this like add value to the customer? What's the appropriate price to sell this for as an experience? Because it's really workers and Neurofeedback Salon.

04:38

Could I really optimize brains? What am I we're from not optimizing brands. What am I doing? And so like and and like trying to help myself like yeah, there's just one person who's a day of amazing breakthroughs and therapy this one woman. She said that she started cleaning a lot after she tried it to try this session on time.

05:01

She went home, which started cleaning like the whole weekend like as if she had, you know, as if she like, taken stimulant drugs or something, she uses cleaning every everything. And I mean, that cocaine speed, and just these one, that makes you clean, and I don't know. I've never I think I have, I can't say whatever, you know, I don't think so anywhere.
