# Key arguments in this note and why they are important to Self Aware Networks:

1. 3D Signal Processing and Neural Arrays
The concept that the brain processes signals along six axes (front-back, left-right, up-down) aligns with the Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) theory from SAN. In NAPOT, the brain's neural arrays not only process signals but also project sensory representations between arrays. This aligns with the discussion in your note about how the brain processes sensory information in multiple dimensions.

2. Oscillatory Feedback Loops and Brainwave Patterns
The idea of the brain functioning in oscillating loops and how signals follow specific paths with feedback mechanisms is core to SAN's focus on oscillatory feedback loops. The SAN theory discusses how these oscillatory behaviors create an internal observer through entification, which mirrors the processing loops mentioned in your note.

3. Signal Paths and Specialized Oscillations
The mention of distinct paths for motor signals, sensory signals, and specific oscillations (like beta in the hippocampus or delta in the thalamus) connects with SAN's concept of entification via oscillation. In SAN, different oscillatory patterns in various brain regions are responsible for specialized functions like memory and perception, echoing the note's discussion about the different signal types and their respective paths.

4. Memory and Perception
The note's emphasis on the difficulty of optimizing brain signals due to the complexity of decoding them ties into SAN's view that memory and perception are dynamic processes created by traveling wave interactions between tonic (low frequency) and phasic (high frequency) waves. This is especially relevant when discussing how one might assess whether brain optimization has occurred, as SAN suggests that perception and memory are inherently intertwined with the brainâ€™s oscillatory mechanisms.

5. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Neural Synchrony
The note's exploration of potential BCI applications through neurofeedback also aligns with SAN, particularly the Neo Mind Cycle initiative, which focuses on bridging brain-computer interfaces with self-aware neural networks. Both aim to optimize or interpret brain activity, but SAN takes it a step further by attempting to establish interfaces between human brains and artificial neural networks.

6. Oscillations and Brain Signal Interpretation
The note references how certain brain oscillations, like alpha waves for sensory input or higher frequency waves, could be key in understanding brain signals, which mirrors SAN's focus on how oscillatory patterns help the brain process sensory input. Specifically, SAN explores the phasic-tonic relationship and how oscillations create stable representations (tonic waves) while facilitating active perception (phasic waves).

# Whisper Transcript:

3D signal processing, okay so the human brain is like a 3D signal

processor each cortical column is dealing with

different information on six axis like front back signals, left right signals, up and down signals

and you can say that's not it's not equally true of every type of signal because there is somewhat of a direction for signals to travel

although there are feedback loops so there's processing loops and the whole like brain does like oscillating loops

but there still are directions for signals, there's signal paths and there's signal paths for motor signals and there's signal paths for sensitive signals

and there's signal paths that sort of refer to certain kinds of oscillations like beta oscillations in the hippocampus or delta oscillations in the thalamus

and we might have like sensory input, oscillations might be in alpha waves

but we might have much wider, much higher frequency

I'm gonna do the beginning of time story, I'm gonna do the beginning of time story and I'm going to, I'm gonna take that like, I'm gonna talk about Neo Mind Cycle: I go from like in 2012 and 2011 what I thought I was gonna do was I was gonna create a neurofeedback salon

and I spent some of the year doing, I spent some of that first year doing a lot of research and a lot of testing

in fact the first two years a lot of research and a lot of testing, I tested on myself

I'd have people that I met in San Francisco come to my office and test it out and they'd report back on their experiences

and we had one marco person who had tried the experience one time and then they went on to have some incredible breakthroughs in therapy where their multiple personalities coalesced into a single personality

and he was a trans man, San Francisco trans man that I met and who had tried

he's one of the rare people who tried Neomines cycle, that was my business

and the goal was to optimize brains but of course I couldn't figure out how to prove that brain optimization had happened

I couldn't figure out how to, it's like how do you look at brain signals and say this is good and this is better

that would require decoding what those brain signals meant and I wasn't at that place

and I hadn't really even fully grasped that this was the question in front of me

like it was just so abstract like what am I doing, how does this add value to the customer

what's the appropriate price to sell this for as an experience, can this really work as a narrow feedback so long, could I really optimize brains

what am I, what if I'm not optimizing brains, what am I doing

and so like and like trying to help myself like yeah there's this one person who's a day of amazing breakthroughs in therapy

this one woman she said that she started cleaning a lot

after she tried it she tried the session one time and she went home and she started cleaning like the whole weekend

like as if she had you know as if she'd like taken cocaine or something

she was just cleaning everything and I mean that cocaine speed

which speed is the one that makes you clean right, I don't know
