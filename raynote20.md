How SuperTimeGradient and QGTCD approach Quantum Tunneling

### Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) and Quantum Tunneling

**Overview of Quantum Tunneling**\
Quantum tunneling occurs when particles traverse barriers that appear impassable under classical physics. Traditional quantum mechanics explains this through the wavefunction's non-zero probability of existing on the far side of the barrier. Examples include Josephson Junctions, where electrons move between superconductors through an insulating layer without losing energy.

**QGTCD Theory: Gravity and "Frames of Time"**\
QGTCD proposes that gravity arises from a "relative acceleration of frames of time" in a particular direction. If more such time-frames accumulate in one direction, particles or masses are statistically more likely to move that way. In this view, gravitational attraction is a bias in the underlying temporal structure rather than simply a curvature of spacetime.

**QGTCD's Take on Tunneling**\
Under QGTCD, when a particle tunnels through a solid barrier, it is effectively moving through more, or "faster," frames of time than the barrier itself. These extra frames open small intervals of empty space at the quantum scale, letting the particle slip around regions that appear solid from a classical viewpoint. In essence, the barrier's position updates more slowly than the particle's local time-frame, so the particle finds a path that bypasses (rather than literally punches through) the barrier.

**Implications and Speculations**

1.  **Manipulating Tunneling Rates**

    -   Increasing the mass density or the "acceleration" of the barrier might boost tunneling rates by amplifying the difference in available time-frames. Conversely, reducing density or acceleration could decrease tunneling.
2.  **Electroporation**

    -   Recent findings suggest that electric fields alter membrane interfaces by reorienting water molecules rather than simply applying pressure. QGTCD hints this effect might be explained as adding extra local time-frames, influencing how particles move across the barrier (akin to a gravitational effect).
3.  **Further Research**

    -   QGTCD is speculative but offers a fresh perspective linking gravity-like effects to quantum phenomena. Future studies may test whether modifying the distribution of "frames of time" in a system measurably changes quantum tunneling or other barrier-crossing processes.

Overall, QGTCD reframes both gravity and quantum tunneling by focusing on the temporal underpinnings of particle movement. Rather than seeing tunneling as a particle punching through a barrier, it suggests the barrier and particle are advancing through time at different rates, creating brief "gaps" that allow seemingly impossible transitions.

In SuperTimePosition the superposition of the wavefunction is in a faster gear of time, so it's everywhere and no-where inside the circuit. We can't measure it's exact position because it's moving faster than our time frame. We don't update as fast in our time frame fps as it updates in it's time frame fps, except when we measure it then it syncs with our time frame.

This means that while we experience moments where it is seemingly everywhere at once, faster than us, it is experiencing us as something super slow, moving in slow motion or not at all, and that means it can possibly go inbetween our time frames, because there are moments in our oscillations when part of our structure does not exist.

-   **SuperTimePosition Concept**

    -   **Premise**: The wavefunction exists in a "faster gear of time" than our own reference frame.
    -   **Effect**: From our slower vantage, it looks like the particle is "everywhere and nowhere," because the particle's positions update more rapidly than our time slices can register.
    -   **Measurement**: When we measure the particle, we briefly synchronize to its faster timescale, forcing it to appear in a specific location.-   **Relative Time Gears**

    -   You're essentially positing discrete "frame rates" for reality. Our macroscopic world updates at one rate, while the quantum system updates at a higher rate.
    -   **Visual Analogy**:
        -   Imagine a very fast strobing light pointed at a spinning fan. If the fan spins faster than the strobe, it appears as a blur or "everywhere at once."
        -   But if the strobe flashes at just the right rate (like a measurement event), we suddenly see a single snapshot of a fan blade in one position.-   **In-Between Frames**

    -   In your model, there are "moments" (in the slower reference frame) where the object effectively isn't there---because the object has already "moved on" to a new time slice.
    -   **Implication**:
        -   During these fleeting intervals, the wavefunction can slip through what we consider a barrier, because from the particle's perspective, we and our barriers are updating "too slowly."
        -   It's like stepping through an automatic door if you can move fast enough in the brief instant it's open.-   **Why This Feels Like Tunneling**

    -   In usual quantum mechanics, tunneling arises from the wavefunction having a non-zero amplitude inside the barrier; classically forbidden but quantum-allowed.
    -   In your picture, "tunneling" might be interpreted as the particle finding a gap in the slower time slices. From its perspective, the barrier "isn't fully there" at certain micro-intervals.-   **Potential Challenges** (Even in the Thought Experiment)

    -   **Energy Conservation**: If the particle is in a faster frame, how do energy and momentum transform when it "jumps" to match our slow frame during measurement?
    -   **Synchronization Mechanism**: What physically causes the wavefunction's time gear to sync with ours upon measurement? Is it the act of observation? Interaction with classical measuring devices?
    -   **Consistency in Multi-Particle Systems**: If multiple particles have different "time gears," does that create contradictions? Or do they all share the same quantum gear?-   **Speculative Merits**

    -   It gives an intuitive, if highly unconventional, story: *"We see the particle as everywhere at once because it's updating faster than we can track. When we measure, we freeze it to our frame rate."*
    -   This might help some people grasp why quantum entities appear so elusive or superposed---though it's not a standard explanation.-   **Hypothetical Experiment**

    -   If "time gear mismatch" were real, we might imagine that changing the "frame rate" of the environment (whatever that means physically) would alter how we see tunneling.
    -   For instance, if we could accelerate our measurement apparatus to the same "faster gear," we might see the particle's actual path or position at all times, removing the superposition.

# Summary

Below is a **summary** and **thoughts** on the core ideas in this note, which explores how **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD)** and **SuperTimePosition** might offer alternative or complementary explanations for quantum tunneling, superposition, and gravitational effects on quantum processes.

* * * * *

1\. Key Points in the Note
--------------------------

### 1A. Quantum Tunneling Under QGTCD

1.  **Classical Tunneling Explanation**

    -   Standard quantum mechanics says a particle can "tunnel" through a barrier because the wavefunction has a non-zero amplitude on the far side of an energy barrier, making the otherwise "forbidden" transition possible.
2.  **QGTCD Perspective**

    -   Gravity arises from differences in "frames of time," and particles are biased to move where more "time frames" accumulate.
    -   When tunneling occurs, the particle is effectively moving "faster" through time than the solid barrier. Because the barrier's structure "updates" more slowly, there are brief intervals in which the barrier isn't fully "present" from the particle's viewpoint.
    -   This allows the particle to slip around or through what appears classically solid, rather than literally punching a hole.
3.  **Implications**

    -   **Tunneling Rates:** Potentially adjustable by changing the relative mass density (and thus the gravitational/time-density effects) of the barrier.
    -   **Electroporation Example:** External fields might reorder local water molecules (or otherwise change local "time density"), making it easier for particles (e.g., ions) to cross barriers.

### 1B. SuperTimePosition Model

1.  **Faster Gear of Time**
    -   The wavefunction or quantum entity operates on a faster temporal scale ("frame rate") than our macroscopic measuring apparatus. From our slower vantage, it appears "everywhere at once."
2.  **Measurement**
    -   Upon measurement, the quantum system "syncs" with our slow frame, forcing the wavefunction to look localized.
3.  **In-Between Frames**
    -   Because the particle's reference frame updates so quickly, from its perspective, we (and our barriers) move in slow motion. There are fleeting intervals where the barrier "isn't fully there," so the particle can slip by.

* * * * *

2\. Thoughts and Analysis
-------------------------

### 2A. Conceptual Merits

1.  **Intuitive Story**
    -   These ideas offer a narrative that resonates with everyday notions of "frame rates," giving a mental picture of quantum particles as "flickering" faster than we can observe.
2.  **Tunneling Rethink**
    -   Instead of wavefunctions partially penetrating a barrier, QGTCD and SuperTimePosition say the barrier itself is only "in the way" part of the time from the particle's viewpoint. This re-labels the phenomenon while keeping the observed result that particles appear on the far side of a barrier.

### 2B. Potential Physical Challenges

1.  **Defining "Frames of Time"**
    -   In standard physics, time is treated as a continuous dimension, not quantized into discrete "frames." Here, it's described more like "fps" (frames per second). That's a strong departure from mainstream relativity or quantum field theory.
    -   The note speaks of local "accumulation" or "density" of time. This is reminiscent of how general relativity treats gravitational time dilation, but the mechanism is quite different (QGTCD speaks of discrete frames, standard GR uses continuous curvature of spacetime).
2.  **Consistency with Energy and Momentum**
    -   If a particle is literally jumping into a "faster" time gear, how do energies transform? Would that imply exotic effects like indefinite energy gain/loss if you cross "time gear boundaries" frequently?
3.  **Experimentally Verifiable Distinctions**
    -   Standard quantum tunneling experiments are extremely well-tested and match quantum mechanics predictions accurately. Would QGTCD or SuperTimePosition yield new, testable predictions different from standard QM? For instance:
        -   A specific shift in tunneling rates under varying gravitational potentials that goes beyond the usual semi-classical WKB approach.
        -   A measurable difference in electron flow through Josephson Junctions depending on local time-density manipulations.

### 2C. Possible Avenues for Testing

1.  **Varying Gravitational Conditions**
    -   If the difference in time frames is truly tied to gravity, then quantum tunneling rates might show a small but detectable shift at different altitudes or in free-fall vs. on Earth's surface.
    -   While there have been some tests of gravitational influence on quantum states (e.g., neutron interferometry), dedicated tunneling experiments under varying gravitational potentials might be more direct.
2.  **High-Precision Josephson Junction Experiments**
    -   If QGTCD suggests that adjusting "frame density" changes tunneling probabilities, carefully controlling environmental conditions (temperature, electromagnetic fields, inertial frames) could reveal anomalies not explained by mainstream superconducting theory.
3.  **Ultra-Fast Measurement Approaches**
    -   If the wavefunction truly updates on a "faster gear," maybe extremely high-time-resolution measurements could reveal sub-cycles of presence/absence at the barrier. That would be quite a revelation if found.

### 2D. The Broader Picture

-   **Alternative to Curved Spacetime**: QGTCD frames gravity as a difference in time-frames rather than geometric curvature. This is reminiscent of "emergent gravity" ideas---though in a distinct, more discrete/time-slice flavor.
-   **Philosophical vs. Physical**: Some aspects of "time frames" may serve as a helpful metaphor rather than a literal discrete-time model. Even if not literal, it can be a conceptual lens for understanding how quantum processes might vary under changing gravitational or accelerating frames.

* * * * *

3\. Summary of Key Takeaways
----------------------------

1.  **Unconventional but Evocative**

    -   The QGTCD and SuperTimePosition approach recasts quantum tunneling (and gravity) in terms of mismatched time-slice rates. This is not standard physics, but it's an intriguing mental model.
2.  **Potential for Novel Predictions**

    -   The real power of any new theory is in making testable, quantitative predictions that differ from standard QM/GR. If QGTCD can propose a measurable deviation in tunneling rates under certain gravitational or acceleration conditions, that could be tested.
3.  **Helps Visualize Superposition**

    -   Seeing superposition as a "particle flickering too fast for us to pinpoint" is a nice analogy that can help non-specialists grasp why quantum entities appear in multiple states or places simultaneously from our slower vantage.
4.  **Next Steps**

    -   To move beyond speculative interpretations, one would want:
        -   Detailed mathematical formalisms for these "time frames," ensuring self-consistency with known relativistic/quantum laws.
        -   Proposed experiments or existing data sets (e.g., from high-altitude quantum experiments) where QGTCD's predictions diverge from classical quantum mechanics.

* * * * *

The note's ideas give an imaginative spin on quantum tunneling---**barriers "move slower in time"** so the particle finds open gaps. While it departs significantly from standard interpretations, it does highlight how we might look for gravitational or time-related effects in quantum processes. Ultimately, it poses the question: *Could there be subtle gravitational or "time-density" factors that tweak standard quantum tunneling?* Testing that empirically would be a fascinating challenge and, if successful, could reveal entirely new layers to the quantum-classical boundary.

# Günter Nimtz's tunneling experiments

Below is a concise **summary** of Günter Nimtz's tunneling experiments, how they fit into **standard quantum theory**, and where an alternative framework like **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD)** or a "faster-time" interpretation might enter to explain seemingly superluminal signals.

* * * * *

1\. Nimtz's Experiments in a Nutshell
-------------------------------------

1.  **Quantum Tunneling Setup**

    -   Nimtz and colleagues used electromagnetic waves (microwaves or photons) incident on a barrier or waveguide arrangement.
    -   Measured signals appeared to arrive earlier than one would expect if limited by **c**, the speed of light in vacuum.
2.  **Main Observed Claim**:

    -   The *group velocity* of the tunneled wave was measured to be faster than *c*, implying a possible superluminal transit time.
3.  **Mainstream Explanation**:

    -   **Phase/Group Velocities**: Exceeding *c* does *not* necessarily mean **information** travels faster than *c*.
    -   **No Violation of Causality**: The earliest part ("front velocity") remains subluminal, protecting causality.
    -   These results are seen as consistent with quantum electrodynamics and relativity, once one carefully distinguishes which velocity physically encodes "information."

* * * * *

2\. Why These Results Don't Break Standard QM or Relativity
-----------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Tunneling Time Ambiguities**

    -   The "tunneling time" can be effectively shorter than one naively expects if you track certain wave features (e.g., group velocity).
    -   However, the front edge of the wave---the earliest moment information could be transmitted---does *not* arrive faster than *c*.
2.  **Phase vs. Information**

    -   The wave peak or phase can appear superluminal, but the *actual signal content* or *modulated information* cannot outrun the universal limit.
3.  **Well Within QM Formalism**

    -   Quantum mechanics already predicts that certain definitions of velocity (phase or group velocity) can exceed *c*.
    -   No experiment to date has demonstrated *usable information* traveling faster than light.

* * * * *

3\. Could a "Faster-Time" Theory (QGTCD, etc.) Offer a Different Explanation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **QGTCD Perspective**

    -   QGTCD reimagines tunneling as a mismatch between the time "update rate" of the barrier and the particle (or wave).
    -   In principle, it might suggest that from the wave's vantage, the barrier "moves slower in time," creating gaps or shortcuts.
2.  **Potential Explanatory Power**

    -   Proponents of a "faster-time" model could say Nimtz's result is a partial manifestation of these time discrepancies.
    -   They'd interpret the superluminal group velocity as a sign that the wave is "jumping ahead" in time relative to the barrier's slow frames, rather than literally traveling faster than *c* in a single inertial frame.
3.  **What's Not Yet Resolved**

    -   Even if an alternative time-based explanation is invoked, one must still show that *no* causality violation occurs.
    -   Ultimately, QGTCD or any new approach must reproduce the same "no actual FTL information" outcome that standard QM yields---otherwise it would conflict with well-tested relativity constraints.

* * * * *

4\. Outlook and Testing Alternative Theories
--------------------------------------------

1.  **Mainstream Status**

    -   Mainstream physics largely considers Nimtz's experiments as consistent with standard QM: superluminal group velocities do *not* send classical signals FTL.
    -   No rewriting of quantum mechanics or relativity is strictly required to explain Nimtz's data.
2.  **If QGTCD Is to Provide More Insight**

    -   It needs to propose **unique predictions** about tunneling times or wave propagation---predictions that differ in some measurable way from those of standard quantum mechanics.
    -   Carefully designed experiments could test whether differences in "time density" or "frame mismatches" produce *small but observable anomalies* in the tunneling pulse shape, arrival times, or signal correlations.
3.  **Possible Experimental Signatures**

    -   **Varying local gravitational potential** (or an equivalent "time-density" environment) while measuring tunneling times.
    -   **High-precision correlation** between the shape of the input pulse and the output wave's earliest arrival features. QGTCD might predict subtle deviations in the way wave packets form and traverse the barrier.
4.  **Conclusion for Now**

    -   Without strong evidence that Nimtz's results *cannot* be explained by standard QM, mainstream consensus remains that these experiments do *not* violate relativity or classical causality.
    -   A new theory like QGTCD could still *reinterpret* or recast the phenomenon in "time gear" terms, but it must remain consistent with the same no-FTL-information constraint.

* * * * *

### Final Takeaway

**Günter Nimtz's tunneling experiments**, while initially raising eyebrows about superluminal travel, are widely regarded as another intriguing example of quantum tunneling phenomena that do *not* overturn relativity or standard quantum mechanics. An alternative framework (such as **QGTCD**) might reinterpret the wave's quicker-than-expected appearance as a manifestation of different "time densities" rather than "spooky superluminal travel." But to gain traction, any new interpretation must align with the same empirical facts: *no genuine faster-than-light information transfer* and *no causality breakdown.* If QGTCD or a similar theory can make distinct, testable predictions about tunneling under varied "time density" conditions---and those predictions are experimentally verified---then it would offer a genuine novel explanation rather than just a restatement of the standard model's result.

# Applying ***Micah's New Law of Thermodynamics*** to create a third approach.

Here is a third SuperTimePosition approach to Quantum Tunneling that eliminates the need for Tunneling through a barrier. Let's think about the Josephson Junction structure, we know it is made from atoms, in a chemical lattice, all those atoms are essentially synchronized which homogenous attributes which allow them to act as a single unified material, a material structure that have the fractal properties of its synchronized or let's say entangled parts. In ***Micah's New Law of Thermodynamics*** the atoms or particles essentially dissipate their phase wave differences whether those ****phase differences are described as heat, energy, or other material properties. The atoms or particles are distributed the phase difference between their properties to reach a state of equilibrium, this is what happens when a single gas is locked in a container, and it's what happens to a material. The heat or energy dissipates across it's surface as the atoms essentially pass the phase wave difference until the entire material has reached thermal equilibrium. A Josephson Junction is like this, in that an electron on one end is a perturbation of energy differential. Now the material already has electrons, but we know they are always jostling about, sometimes the electron inside a material structure is changing places with an electron outside a material structure, this might open up a space for an electron inside the Josephson junction on the side where the electron has been said to tunnel from, but the structure itself responding to the new configuration may push out an electron on the other side, not the same electron, but an electron matching the phase wave differential of the electron that entered, and it would be along the same trajectory like a pool ball, essentially a wave of electrons move through the Junction when tunnelling happened, but the electron that channels through is not the one that entered.

Finished thinking

Below is a concise **summary** and **reflection** on your **third SuperTimePosition approach** to explaining quantum tunneling---particularly in Josephson Junctions---where you posit that **"tunneling" need not be a single electron physically crossing a barrier.** Instead, the material collectively rearranges its electrons in response to a local energy (phase) differential.

* * * * *

1\. Main Idea: A Collective Electron Exchange
---------------------------------------------

1.  **Homogenized Material Structure**

    -   In a Josephson Junction or similar system, the atomic lattice is a **unified** structure with synchronized or correlated states (you liken this to phase coherence or entanglement).
    -   When an "outside" electron arrives with some energy/phase difference, the entire lattice "feels" that disturbance.
2.  **Electron "In/Out" Swap**

    -   Rather than the same electron "tunneling" through the barrier, your model suggests that one electron **enters** on one side, which triggers the **collective wave of reconfiguration** in the lattice.
    -   **Result**: An electron with matching "phase wave" properties is **emitted** on the opposite side---effectively the same final outcome as tunneling, but the particle that exits is not literally the one that entered.
3.  **Pool-Ball or Domino Analogy**

    -   You liken it to a chain reaction: one electron enters and pushes on the whole system, eventually causing **another** electron on the far side to pop out.
    -   By the end, from an outside viewpoint, it looks like a single electron "passed through" the barrier, but in your explanation it's an **exchange**---the material rearranged its internal electrons.

* * * * *

2\. Connection to Your "New Law of Thermodynamics"
--------------------------------------------------

1.  **Dissipation of Phase Differences**

    -   You argue that in any closed material system, **phase/energy differences** distribute themselves until thermal (or quantum) equilibrium is reached.
    -   In a Josephson Junction, the "barrier" region plus the superconducting leads form one coherent system; thus, **phase differences** (whether we call them heat, energy, or wavefunction phases) get dissipated or shared.
2.  **Microscopic Re-Equilibration**

    -   If an external electron injects a new energy/phase offset, the system redistributes it among the available electrons.
    -   Once the system reconfigures, an electron on the other side, matched to the new equilibrium, emerges.

* * * * *

3\. Relationship to Standard Josephson Junction Descriptions
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Conventional Josephson View**

    -   In traditional physics, the Josephson effect arises from a **coherent wavefunction** spanning two superconductors across a thin insulating barrier. Cooper pairs (electrons bound in a superconducting state) can move through the barrier without classical "tunneling" resistance, thanks to **phase coherence**.
    -   The macroscopic wavefunction effectively extends across the junction, allowing current to flow with no voltage drop (DC Josephson effect) or at a specific frequency (AC Josephson effect).
2.  **Your "Electron Swap" Angle**

    -   You're focusing on the idea that **individual electrons are not necessarily the same ones** that appear on the far side. Instead, a lattice-wide wave reconfiguration can produce an electron outflow.
    -   This resonates with the common statement in many-body quantum systems: "Electrons are identical particles," so when wavefunctions overlap, "it's meaningless to track which electron is which." The system's collectively shared wavefunction does all the heavy lifting.
3.  **Does It Contradict Standard Theory?**

    -   At the **quantum field theory** level, all electrons are indeed indistinguishable. One could interpret standard Josephson tunneling as precisely this wavefunction coherence, wherein "the electron that emerges" is not necessarily "the same electron that entered"---merely an electron in a correlated quantum state.
    -   Your framing is a more **physical, quasi-classical** way of saying: "The barrier never truly blocks a single electron if the entire system is phase-coherent. The wavefunction's collective property allows an electron to exit on the other side."

* * * * *

4\. Why This Might Eliminate the Need for "Literal Tunneling"
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **No Single-Particle Barrier Penetration**

    -   Instead of imagining an electron "magically crossing" forbidden energy regions, the barrier plus the leads form a single quantum system.
    -   Energy/phase differences move through the lattice, ultimately letting an electron appear on the other side. This viewpoint can feel more intuitive, as it sidesteps the notion that a particle has to pass through a "solid" region.
2.  **Phase Coherence & Material Equilibrium**

    -   If the system is already near a **coherent** equilibrium (as in a superconductor), small perturbations (like an incoming electron) can trigger a reconfiguration that "spits out" an electron on the far side, maintaining overall coherence.
3.  **Macroscopic Entanglement**

    -   In superconductors, large numbers of electrons share a phase-coherent state. That entanglement (or synchronicity) might effectively let conduction proceed without classical conduction channels.
    -   Your concept extends this to ordinary or partially coherent lattices, though a Josephson junction typically relies on superconducting coherence on either side of the insulating gap.

* * * * *

5\. Broader Implications
------------------------

1.  **Electron Indistinguishability**

    -   Electron swapping is consistent with the fundamental quantum principle that all electrons are indistinguishable---particularly in condensed matter systems with strong coherence or entanglement.
2.  **Alternative View on Tunneling**

    -   While standard quantum mechanics frames tunneling as "the wavefunction extends into the barrier with non-zero amplitude," your approach frames it as "the system's wavefunction rearranges so that an equivalent electron state emerges on the far side."
3.  **No Contradiction to Standard Theory**

    -   You aren't invalidating quantum mechanics; you're **reinterpreting** it. In fact, many advanced condensed matter treatments say effectively the same thing: "Electrons in a coherent state do not traverse in the classical sense. The wavefunction and boundary conditions define the allowed states, so an electron on one side can be replaced by an electron on the other side due to the system's overall coherence."
4.  **Connection to SuperTimePosition**

    -   If we incorporate your SuperTimePosition or QGTCD ideas, the entire system's "time frames" or phase states are synchronized. So from that vantage, the barrier is no real obstacle, because the wavefunction synchronization extends across what we call the barrier.

* * * * *

6\. Final Thoughts
------------------

1.  **Conceptual Clarity**

    -   This "swap" viewpoint can simplify the puzzling notion of single-particle tunneling. It's a legitimate way to visualize how conduction can occur in Josephson junctions (and, by extension, other quantum-coherent phenomena) without each particle individually traversing a classically forbidden region.
2.  **Matches Indistinguishability**

    -   Quantum field theory 101: "Particles are excitations of underlying fields; labeling them is an approximation." Your approach effectively exemplifies that principle in a real device.
3.  **Potential Experimental or Educational Value**

    -   Presenting tunneling as "reconfiguration + electron swap" might help students or researchers see that the barrier is not passively letting electrons through but is an active participant in a globally phase-coherent process.

In short, your **third SuperTimePosition perspective** on Josephson tunneling reimagines the event: rather than an electron physically crossing a barrier, the macroscopic wavefunction of the entire junction rearranges, ejecting a different electron with the same phase properties. This is consistent with how quantum many-body systems treat indistinguishable particles and could be a helpful "visual explanation" for what standard quantum theory formalizes through wavefunction coherence and boundary conditions.
