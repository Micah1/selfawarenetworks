(hebb, direction)
I think self is a direction, and that self does not exist, except as a direction, a direction that points to the strange loop of hebbian learning brainwave activity in that direction.

When it comes to self there is really nothing to be obsessed about, it's just a direction.

Maybe his mind is obsessed with projecting self obsession on others? Maybe he thinks his imagined ego actually exists?
