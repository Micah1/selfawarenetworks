Gen William Taggart made false claims on Facebook that "I discovered that my posit" was a "copy" of his theory from 48 years ago, and at the sametime he also calls it "pseudoscience bs" given his lies and his aggression I decided to document how his work is different from mine. He mentioned that his theory is from 1977 and I could find out everything about it from his Facebook page "Time Density & Mass" https://www.facebook.com/TimeDensityMass So I copied everything from his facebook page and fed it into ChatGPT o1 Pro and asked it to make the comparison.

One major problem with his theory is that he needs to point to the 4th spatial dimension to explain his theory, my theory doesn't require additional dimensions. His theory is supercomplicated like the crazy planetary orbits when earth was posited to be the center of the universe. My theory is like when people stopped trying to make earth the center of the universe and then you didn't need a bunch of crazy terms, higher dimensions, scaling space-time. Instead my theory is simple and it makes sense just like the solar system makes a lot more sense when earth and the other planets are all orbiting the sun.

Below is a neutral summary of the main contrast you’re highlighting between your own theory (e.g., SuperTimePosition or QGTCD) and the other party’s TDM approach, particularly regarding dimensional complexity and explanatory mechanisms.

1. The Core Point: Additional Dimensions vs. Simpler Framework
TDM’s Extra Dimensional Explanation

According to your description, TDM (Time Density & Mass) relies on concepts such as “scaled space-time,” which can imply some form of higher-dimensional interpretation or at least complicated transformations.

You see it as analogous to the elaborate epicycles in the old geocentric (Earth-centered) model of planetary orbits—lots of added parameters or geometry to explain observations.
Your Theory’s Approach

In your view, SuperTimePosition/QGTCD does not require introducing extra spatial dimensions. It remains in a framework of standard 3D + time but reinterprets how time (or “time density”) influences events and quantum phenomena.

You compare it to the simpler heliocentric model: once you place the Sun at the center, you no longer need complex epicycles. Analogously, you say your theory removes unnecessary assumptions (like 4th spatial dimensions, extensive scaling factors, etc.) to explain quantum/gravity phenomena more directly.

2. Key Differences as You See Them

Complexity

TDM: Involves references to large-scale or higher-dimensional vantage points (“scaled space-time,” “preferred universal metric”), which can sound complex or contrived.

Your Theories: Argue for fewer added structures—no special extra dimension is needed, no universal vantage. You treat gravity and quantum phenomena via “denser time” or “faster time-frames” within the usual 3+1 dimensions.

Analogies

Epicycles: TDM might be akin to medieval Ptolemaic astronomy—complicating geometry (extra loops and circles) to salvage geocentric assumptions.
Heliocentrism: Your model is said to be more “straightforward,” akin to heliocentrism: a single conceptual shift (“time density” or “SuperTimePosition”) removes the need for multiple patches or extra dimensions.

Philosophy of Explanation

TDM: Potentially sees the entire universe from a single, expanded frame, implying “scaling” or “summing the finite universe.”

You: Keep each observer local in standard 3D space, focusing on how time can vary or accelerate in ways that handle quantum tunneling, entanglement, and gravity, without extra geometric constructs.

3. Observational or Experimental Distinctions

Testable Predictions

If TDM relies on a 4D or “scaled” vantage, it might predict certain illusions of faster-than-light travel or cosmic bridging, but would need to show how that’s reconciled with no actual FTL signals.

Your approach would aim to show how “time density changes” alone account for phenomena like quantum tunneling or black-hole time dilation.
Simplicity as a Theoretical Advantage

The simpler a theory’s assumptions (while still matching experimental data), the more appealing it often appears in physics. You emphasize this as a strength of your model relative to TDM.

4. Concluding Analogy

Epicycles vs. Heliocentrism: You argue TDM is adding layers of geometry (akin to epicycles) to preserve a certain viewpoint; your theory is like the heliocentric switch that naturally simplifies the system.

By removing the need for a 4th spatial dimension or a universal scale vantage, you believe your approach streamlines the explanation of quantum and gravitational effects, without losing empirical accuracy.

Final Takeaway

You see your theory (SuperTimePosition/QGTCD) as simpler—it stays within the standard dimensional framework and interprets phenomena via “time density” or “faster-time frames,” whereas TDM relies on what you consider a more convoluted 4D or “scaled” perspective. The analogy is that TDM’s extra dimensional constructs are like epicycles, while you claim your model is the heliocentric shift that cleans up the complexities.

You are always so wise Pro.

Okay let's escape the past narrative and focus on professional dialog going forward. Help me defend my theory against him trying to retroactively claim that my theory was his theory. We are using the next prompts to build a case for the Epicycles vs. Heliocentrism analogy. 

His time-density concept has nothing in common my concept of time frames, density of time, or density of time waves changing the odds or particle or object travel. He says nothing about how time density causes the curvature of space, or unites gravity with quantum physics. He might be using the phrase time dilation, but he's not using it in the right way. He needs the fourth dimension to argue that interference patterns from an electron that isn't moving at all. Which is almost opposite of what I argue with SuperTimePosition which is that the electron is moving in a faster frame of time. 

His Time Density Concept is defined as follows

"Time Density Concept: 
Definition: Time density is a measure of the interactions between objects of similar scale within space-time. These interactions affect the local perception and progression of time and are influenced by the totality of the finite universe.

Direct Interactions: The conjecture emphasizes direct interactions between objects, explaining how these interactions occur at any perceived distance without the need for quantum mechanical descriptions." - Time Density & Mass Facebook page.

The following is all the next I could find about his theory from Gen. William Taggart's Facebook page "Time Density & Mass" https://www.facebook.com/TimeDensityMass use it to document why his theory is nothing like mine:

In case he changes his TimeDensityMass facebook page I am preserving a copy of what I found there online in this time stamped pdf on github. This serves as proof that his theory as it was when I encounted him in January 2025 was nothing like mine.

Below is a **professional, structured comparison** that uses the **"Epicycles vs. Heliocentrism"** analogy to contrast **Time Density & Mass (TDM)** with your **SuperTimePosition** (STP) and **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD)** approach. The goal is to show how TDM's added complexity (like the 4th dimension, universal scale frames, etc.) parallels the unwieldy *epicycles* of medieval astronomy, whereas your framework is more akin to *heliocentrism*---it achieves the same or better explanatory power with far fewer complications.

* * * * *

1\. High-Level Analogy: "Epicycles" vs. "Heliocentrism"
-------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Epicycles (TDM)**

    -   In Ptolemaic astronomy, *epicycles* were circles upon circles invented to preserve the idea of Earth as the center of the universe.
    -   Each new anomaly in planetary motion required extra loops, making the system more and more **convoluted**.
    -   **TDM**: Emphasizes expanded frames, infinite scale states, 4D references, and "direct interactions" that negate standard quantum mechanics. Each new phenomenon requires additional scale logic or "instantaneous universal vantage," reminiscent of Ptolemy's *epicycle stacking*.
2.  **Heliocentrism (Your STP/QGTCD)**

    -   Copernicus showed that placing the Sun at the center was **much simpler**: many epicycles vanished, and planetary motion became straightforward ellipses under gravity.
    -   **Your approach** likewise keeps conventional 3D+time but interprets "time density" or "faster frames of time" locally---**no** special 4D vantage, no universal finite sum, no "direct interactions overriding quantum."
    -   The result is a more **economical** framework: phenomena like tunneling, interference, or gravitational effects follow naturally without introducing complicated scale states or 4D expansions.

* * * * *

2\. Comparing Definitions and Core Elements
-------------------------------------------

Below is a side-by-side outline:

| **Category** | **TDM (Epicycles)** | **Your STP/QGTCD (Heliocentrism)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Premise** | "Time density" arises from a **universal vantage** that sums the entire finite universe. \nObjects interact via "direct interaction" across scale frames. \nQuantum mechanics is claimed superfluous. | "Time density" or "faster frames of time" exist **locally**; gravity is a result of differences in time flow (time gradients). \nNo universal vantage needed; normal 3D + local time suffices. |
| **Dimension/Scale** | Relies on a *4D or higher-dimensional* viewpoint (scaled space-time). \nInfinite states: TDM State ±1, ±2... each with an altered "density of time." | Remains **within standard 3D + time**; no additional dimension introduced. \nFocus on **time dilation** or "faster frame rates" rather than entire new scale universes. |
| **Mechanism for "FTL"** | Apparent FTL arises by jumping scale frames. \nDistance or barrier is "bypassed" because the object no longer interacts with matter in our TDM state. | No literal or "apparent" FTL. \n**SuperTimePosition**: the particle updates in a **faster local timeframe**, so from our slow vantage it seems everywhere or can skip barriers, but no universal vantage or multiple scale states required. |
| **Quantum Tunneling** | States that no wavefunction probabilities are needed; the entire barrier can be bypassed via scale shifting. \nSpeaks of "direct interaction" across large or small scale frames, so the barrier effectively doesn't exist. | The electron (or particle) is in a **faster timeslice** than the barrier. \nFrom its perspective, the barrier "lags" in time, leaving "gaps" that appear as tunneling. \nStill consistent with standard 3D geometry, just new time-flow ideas. |
| **Gravity & Relativity** | Presents itself as a "functional metric for scaled space-time predicted by GR." \nEinstein "hid" scaled space-time, so TDM "restores" it by using a universal sum reference that *exceeds* Lorentz Invariance's usual remit. | Treats gravity as *time density* differences. \nNo claim that standard relativity is incomplete---just that "denser time" can unify quantum phenomena and gravitational bending in a simpler 3D+time approach. |
| **Complexity** | Requires: \n1) Expanding a reference to encompass the **entire** finite universe. \n2) Defining infinite TDM states for smaller/larger scale frames. \n3) "Direct Interaction" disclaimers to preserve Lorentz Invariance. | Requires **fewer** assumptions: \n1) No universal vantage. \n2) No infinite stacked scale states. \n3) No fundamental rewrite of quantum mechanics---just a new interpretation of time in standard 3D+time. |
| **Philosophy** | A **global** perspective: TDM posits a cosmic vantage that automatically sets each local scale. \nAction at a distance is "classical," ignoring wavefunction. | A **local** perspective: everything can be explained with different rates of time flow, with no need to unify the entire finite universe into one vantage. |
| **Analogy** | **Ptolemaic Epicycles** -- each phenomenon might need more scale sub-states, 4D interpretive leaps, or "direct interactions." | **Copernican Heliocentrism** -- removing Earth as center drastically simplified models. Likewise, removing "universal vantage" or scale frames drastically simplifies time/quantum phenomena. |

* * * * *

3\. Why TDM Feels Like "Epicycles"
----------------------------------

1.  **Layer Upon Layer**

    -   TDM's premise that you must "expand your frame to encompass the finite universe," then subdivide reality into infinite scale states **resembles** the old practice of adding epicycles to preserve geocentrism.
    -   Each phenomenon (tunneling, entanglement, etc.) gets re-explained with "direct interactions" or "4D objects," requiring new elaborations.
2.  **Unnecessary Complexity**

    -   Much like how epicycles saved geocentrism from immediate collapse but at the price of great complexity, TDM "saves" a classical worldview (no quantum randomness) by positing universal vantage and infinite states.
    -   That might be possible, but *Occam's razor* (preferring the simpler explanation) makes the approach suspicious to many physicists.

* * * * *

4\. Why Your Approach Feels Like "Heliocentrism"
------------------------------------------------

1.  **Fewer Extra Constructs**

    -   You remain in standard 3D + local time, focusing on *differential time flow* or "time density gradients."
    -   No infinite series of TDM states, no universal vantage frame---just **one** reference frame at a time, with time dilation reinterpreted or extended for quantum effects.
2.  **Unified Explanation**

    -   Helioentrism unified planetary motion elegantly under universal gravitation. \n- Your QGTCD or SuperTimePosition similarly proposes a local "faster time gear" that automatically accounts for tunneling, entanglement, or gravitational attraction, without flipping between infinite scale states.

* * * * *

5\. Implications & Takeaways
----------------------------

1.  **Testability**

    -   *Epicycles vs. Heliocentrism* historically resolved with better data on planetary orbits. In modern times, either TDM or STP/QGTCD must make distinct **testable predictions** vs. standard quantum/relativistic models.
    -   If TDM demands a "universal vantage" or 4D references, where is the experimental signature?
    -   STP/QGTCD demands that "time gradient shifts" be measurable. Where might that show up in real experiments?
2.  **Philosophical Differences**

    -   TDM tries to keep classical determinism, dismissing quantum probability. This is akin to forcibly preserving "Earth at the center."
    -   STP/QGTCD is more open to standard quantum outcomes, but re-labels them in simpler time-flow terms. That's akin to adopting a new vantage (the Sun at the center) that clarifies many phenomena without extra overlays.
3.  **Clarity**

    -   Both TDM and your approach want to unify quantum phenomena with gravity/time.
    -   But your claim is that TDM's framework is overly complicated, requiring partial redefinition of relativity and an entire "stack" of scale states---**whereas** you propose a simpler, local-time-based method.

* * * * *

6\. Concluding Analogy
----------------------

-   **Ptolemy's Epicycles** kept the Earth in the center, leading to a tangle of circles upon circles.
-   **Copernicus's Heliocentrism** shifted perspective, greatly simplifying celestial mechanics.

**Similarly:**

-   **TDM** piles on scale frames, 4D vantage points, and universal-sum definitions to preserve "classical direct interactions" and discard quantum mechanics. \n- **Your STP/QGTCD** opts for a simpler shift: local time differences and "faster frames" that naturally produce phenomena like tunneling or entanglement---no new dimension or universal vantage needed.

Hence, from your point of view, TDM is the **epicycle** approach: elaborate and unwieldy. Your approach is **heliocentric**: a more parsimonious, direct explanation of quantum effects via time density or faster-time frames---staying well within standard 3D + time.

* * * * *

### Final Note

The **Epicycles vs. Heliocentrism** analogy highlights that **Occam's razor** typically favors the simpler theory that explains as many (or more) observations with fewer extra constructs. You see TDM's reliance on 4D expansions, infinite states, and universal vantage frames as analogous to epicycles---an overbuilt system maintaining a classical "direct interaction" worldview. By contrast, your SuperTimePosition/Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation is akin to the Copernican revolution: re-centering the explanation around time-density shifts that remove the need for elaborate scale expansions, thereby streamlining the explanation of quantum phenomena.

In plain language explain how your analysis of the document shows this statement is essentially true "This serves as proof that his theory as it was when I encountered him in January 2025 was nothing like mine."

1\. Different Definitions of "Time Density" vs. "Faster Frames of Time"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   In **his** Time Density & Mass (TDM) approach, "time density" involves expanding a reference frame to encompass the entire finite universe, creating a metric that supposedly replaces quantum mechanics.
-   In **your** approach (SuperTimePosition / QGTCD), "time density" or "faster frames of time" refers to local differences in how quickly time flows, explaining quantum tunneling or gravity **within** standard 3D + time.

**Why they're nothing alike:**\
He emphasizes **universal frames** and discarding quantum mechanics entirely. You focus on **local time differences** and reinterpret tunneling or superposition without scrapping standard quantum rules.

* * * * *

2\. Extra Dimensions vs. Staying in 3D + Time
---------------------------------------------

-   **He** repeatedly discusses a sort of "4th dimension" or infinite scale states, each requiring a global vantage that lumps the entire universe together.
-   **You** do not invoke higher dimensions. Instead, you describe particles moving in "faster" or "denser" time cycles, but still in ordinary three‑dimensional space + local time.

**Why they're nothing alike:**\
His theory complicates space‑time geometry via "scaled universes;" yours works with **no** extra dimension---just different rates of time flow in the same 3D space.

* * * * *

3\. Discarding QM vs. Coexisting with QM
----------------------------------------

-   **He** says TDM "renders quantum mechanics superfluous" and explains all quantum effects in a purely classical framework.
-   **You** maintain that quantum mechanics is valid but reinterpret phenomena (e.g. tunneling) by arguing that particles occupy a "faster frame" of time, *still* consistent with existing quantum principles.

**Why they're nothing alike:**\
One theory tries to **replace** QM; the other attempts to **enrich** or re‑explain QM phenomena **within** a new perspective on time.

* * * * *

4\. Complexity Level
--------------------

-   **He** needs infinite scale states, "direct interactions," and a universal vantage that bypasses Lorentz invariance, which is reminiscent of adding epicycles in medieval astronomy.
-   **You** use a simpler explanation (like heliocentrism), focusing on **local** changes in time density---fewer assumptions, no elaborate framework of infinite nested universes.

**Why they're nothing alike:**\
TDM is structurally more complicated and claims to override many fundamentals; your model stays close to standard physics and makes minimal changes.

* * * * *

5\. What the Documents Show
---------------------------

Reading his Facebook posts and TDM write‑ups reveals:

-   He bases everything on an "expanded" single frame that includes the entire finite universe.
-   He insists that quantum mechanics can be thrown out.
-   He repeatedly references a "4D object" explanation for entanglement, or "direct interaction" that bypasses wavefunctions.

By contrast, your SuperTimePosition or QGTCD ideas:

-   Emphasize local "faster times" for particles to slip around barriers or appear in superposition.
-   Operate under the assumption that standard quantum mechanical results remain valid---just newly interpreted.

**Hence**:

> "In January 2025, the version of his TDM theory we see in his public writings shares virtually **no** core resemblance to your SuperTimePosition concepts."

* * * * *

### Bottom Line

All these contrasts show that **TDM** and **SuperTimePosition/QGTCD** aim for different goals, use different assumptions, and claim different things about quantum mechanics, spacetime, and dimensions. There's little overlap beyond both using the word "time." Consequently, the statement:

> "This serves as proof that his theory as it was when I encountered him in January 2025 was nothing like mine,"

is accurate based on the stark differences in how each theory is defined and what each claims to explain.
