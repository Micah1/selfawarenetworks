I imagine that my inner voice is a moving soliton wave patterns firing phasically inside my corticol column oscillators, like a stream of lights lighting up, or when a jet flies low and release a stream of particles in the air leaving a trail, this pattern travels through my brain and each new neuron that fires is playing a different audible electric tone, each one represents a different part of my inner voice, as I model my thinking to myself in conscious way, modulating my internal dialog with the english language.

The solitons are happening when the action potential fires, but maybe when a neuron receives neurotransmitters on its membrane it is feeling another neuron via microvibrations

so then the counting allows it to formulate a record of its feelings

because every feeling is a soliton wave, every sight and sound that is part of human experience is a soliton wave in the brain, we feel it, but the counting knows it

because the counting and the micro-feelings are happening at the same time,

and the patterns that let to a major feeling soliton burst are remembered, and so a neuron can replay a pattern because the chemicals cause changes in the shape of the neuron, the shape of the instrument, how its been tuned to play or not play with a huge amount of variation possible that other neurons can track.

interestingly it does seem like the soliton would primarily move in the direction of the axon towards the exit terminal, so that makes sense why signals have a direction

soliton-chemical duality, soliton sensing-chemical triggered memories, shape changing protein to encode long term memories essentialy as structural modifications that change the tune of the neuron instrument.

A neuron is a phase detector or wave detector

and a neuron is a phase maker

soliton waves plus neurotransmitters, not as an alternative

Vector Solitons
the neurons themselves are having experiences and making memories of their experiences,

soliton electric waves or phases or coincidence patterns, hz signals, frequencies felt & remembered simultaneously

neurons are 

if man is a neural network representing features in his brain, who is the observer inside the man who is looking at these features?

the attention schema both defines which areas of your mental map your are seeing, but it also binds those areas together in sequences that your brain tracks with neurotransmitters and senses with corresponding soliton mechanical sound waves and soliton electrical waves felt by each neuron,
other neurons are able to track the phase changes happening to other neurons whether they are speeding up or slowing down, and long changes of these detects are mapped by many neurons or entire neural circuits simultaneously because exit terminals branch radially in every possible direction they can go.

If you invert the map from its branching structure to a graph with each node plotted on the outside of a circle and their random initial connections mapped as lines inbetween nodes then you can just imagine that the lateral neural circuit as represented by v1, v2, v4 and the horizontal neural circuit represented by cortical columns are going to be collectively doing a sort of topography on incoming sensory patterns to deduce how doverse multisensory features of a concept are connected at high levels, this allows the brain's graph to build complex representations that the attention schema  of circuit activity binds in temporal & spatial firing patterns of phase differentials.

Your own personal simulation of reality, from your own viewpoint is a fractalization of a neuron, a neural column, and a global workspace with high level attention coordinated by the hippo-campus
