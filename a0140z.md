Brainwaves are thought patterns! That's consciousness, the electromagnetic wave in the brain. The river of frequencies, like a symphony of neural instruments. This device reads and interprets a person's conscious thoughts and intent http://www.emotiv.com/

I am actually this active vibration of energy interacting with memory-prediction brain tissue, taking up residence in a connectome with at least several hundred trillion connections. Thanks to IBM, we’re one step further down the pathway toward artificial intelligence. IBM announced its creation of “neurosynaptic chips”, which will allow computers function like the brain in terms of perception, action and cognition.http://www.theblaze.com/stories/one-step-closer-to-artificial-intelligence-ibm-chips-function-like-human-brain/ MIT Opencourseware can teach you some of the big ideas for free http://bcs.mit.edu/ you can also get a book called "On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkin" His website is http://www.numenta.com/

Does this not make Tesla's Ambassadors go OH WOW> TESLA the genius is so confirmed and realized by this technology. This is the front line of technology today, exactly where Tesla is! The electromagnetic universe! The electromagnetic human brain!!!! WOW WOW WOW!!!

Micah Blumberg
Wow you are so welcome Niko! I just love how there are so many intelligent knowledgeable people who are appreciating science, technology, and cutting edge contributions of Tesla and other scientists and enginneers who share his vision of a better world! An world of free electricity in an electric universe! Where so many amazing things can happen! Thank you for appreciating this post!

why not? oh because of films like terminator and the matrix? those were Shiva era inspired interpretations of artificial intelligence, but intelligence can also be good, have you seen films like Bicentenial Man or AI Artificial Intelligence, or I Robot, or Wall E?

Penny Repstock I've seen I Robot (although I like Alan Parson's album of the same name better :)) but the jury is still very much out in my mind as to whether the 'intelligence' of the humans behind this intelligence is truly capable of advancing humanity or simply further enslaving it. The bottom line, for me, is that I wish they would put all this time, energy and resources into promoting the works of Tesla and John Searle with the technologies they have brought to this world that have the ability to transform the world's populations in such an incredibly short space of time if we could eliminate the corporations, oil companies, agribusinesses, big pharma and the likes from the equation. As we all know, though ... that is a battle that has been fought by truly forward thinking inventors and scientists for decades now.

Great comments! I wonder though maybe no one understands how to implement Tesla's greatest inventions, like free wireless energy for the whole world. Was that ever completely completed?

Thought Patterns- A HABIT of thinking in a particular way, using particular assumptions. Brain Wave- A rhythmic fluctuation of electric potential between parts of the brain, as seen on an electroencephalogram. Reading or interpreting brain waves are not the same as someone's thought pattern.

This technology is in the wrong hands and as a result is extremely dangerous. This should be in the hands of the people, but it is in the hands of the elite to our collective detriment. Just look at the history of the attempt to give the people free power and how the elite managed to keep it away. Here we have a reverse situation where cheap IA chips are used in a variety of ways to control us without our even knowing. This is written through and through with sinister.

I appreciate everyone's comments, it's so amazing to me to see how unique everyone's point of view is. Will there be a time when new forms of life emerge, smarter than 10 billion humans combined, in a single body the size of a cat? Something that is able to be aware in multiple places at once, on many planets throughout the entire galaxy.

brilliant people are nice because that's the most rational thing to do, the more developed a mind gets the more tolerant it becomes, it's just a matter of having a mature assessment of the situation called life, enlightenment is the mark of the true elite, the those people who have more integrity, more vision, more honor, and more hope in their hearts than the multitudes of angry finger pointers accusing the world of not being better, instead of standing up and doing something to help out. On one side of the looking glass people are unhappy complaining about the powers that be because they see themselves as victims to bad service, on the other side of the looking glass you have people who are humble enough to not take all this for granted, who acknowledge what they see with their own eyes and ears, people who are grateful, because gratitude means happiness, people who lead others to joining programs like Reliv that my friend JC and his family does www.leaderinhealth.reliv.com because they help feed 42,000 otherwise starving kids every year. So you can be stuck in the delusion of ego, suffering, for decades in fear from the latest global conspiracy this week, or you can be the sovereign conscious creator of your own happiness, your own world view, to attract the vision, and action, that you are focused on!

so every possible way in which this technology will be used or abused will probably happen, but most likely good will win out, and enlightened beings far smarter than us will set things right again, someday

Lets not celebrate the dark vision of Tesla's persecutors, let's deny that false reality, and instead live in, and promote the happy world view, where free electricity, water, food, air, freedom, opportunity, and happiness for all people is what we are focused on, what we are talking about, and what we are summing into our vision and summing into the imaginations of those people who will follow someday!

there is a middle ground though Micah, and those enlightened of old and of today would decry such an invention, arguing that the mind is already prepared to be perfected without tech. AS THEY DID!! and we still ignore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Matt Mandell it depends what those ideas are... usually new ideas or concepts replace the old... that is actually the whole point, but when these ideas conflict with their oppositely held ideal, we get conflict, and hopefully the new ideal sits in the middle of the two so as to benefit most involved...if old ideas are not in line with reason and truth, then yes, they will be destroyed... if they hold weight, then they will merge with the new concept of reality...

do you sing a lovely mantra to yourself while you sit in self awareness? Besides the bio-neurofeedback loop that balances the brain through improved cross talk, it has the potential to be a very pleasant, enjoyable experience, you will feel happy about doing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSR1L9IN03g&feature=share

my advice is if you feel an involuntary negative feeling, you welcome it, you feel it, you allow it to be ok, you ask your inner self, why is this here? can I let it go, will I let it go, when? and watch Pema Chodron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4slnjvGjP4

I recommend humming, murming, and singing to yourself, technically it's a form of bio-neurofeedback, a process that helps balance the hemispheres of your mind. Best done while meditating, perhaps as a chant or song you enjoy. Something soulful. The frontal lobes can turn the volume down on the angry amygdala, if they have a chance. For this reason meditation, with soft singing, while sitting and listening with curiousity can aid in the cross talk inside the mind, so the different brain parts can balance each other, you begin to feel happier. The negative feels will dissipate.

also Try placing a pencil in your teeth for a few hours, there's some neuroscience behind that idea as well. there are dozens of low cost to no cost ways 

getting better nutrition, more d-ribose, reading the book from fatigued to fantastic, having enough of the right house plants to clean the toxins from the air of your house or office, fasting often enough so the body can detox cleanse, more hugs, buying gifts for friends or family, there are many low-tech ways to find enlightenment and peace, many cost nothing except time and effort.

I prefer to think that a mis-communication or unexpected result is neither your failure or mine, I prefer to think there was just some missing information between us, and when we discover what that info was all will be well again.

Micah Blumberg
so let us blame only a missing abstract of knowledge in the link from one person's understanding to anothers, happens all the time. I just know in my heart, that we are all doing the best we can with the information we have, automatically, and while it's easy to see blame in other people or in ourselves, I think it's even easier to blame missing info instead, once we see the benefit that non-identity based metaphor to identify problems and solutions. Hope you like the idea.

perhaps where some focus on his effects and scientific manifestations that are STILL controlled by the leading powers, I prefer to consult the inner processes that brought him to his findings.. in line with the wisdom of those that helped keep this wisdom alive, and That wisdom Tesla was privy to... THIS is the only wisdom worth providing every Man, as he then becomes his own producer instead of a consumer only, and of other peoples products... other than that I dont disagree with anything you have said Micah, just coming from a different and more personal 'tesla' angle... I am not putting your view down, nor would I unless you were being unreasonable... I simply dont see the tech as the cause of something better for the world, I see it as a way to learn about ourselves so we wont need it!!!
Micah Blumberg
It seems like Tesla would see technology as a way to create something better in the world. It seems like the Buddha with his realization of oneness under the tree looking up at the planet Venus would never think for a second that some "disowned negative authority figure is keeping the works of Tesla from the people" because being one with all that is means you are the earth, and you are every man, every brother, every sister, you are the authority, you are the people, all of it. G-d's saying to himself "let there be light" and there was light, then G-d's saying to himself "let there be an authority keeping Tesla's work away from the people" and so their was, and then G-d said "open my eyes, so that I can see what I am creating, with the scenario that I declare to the obedient universe"

Matt Mandell which one of his current inventions used today has had and is having a positive impact on our society? ... keep in mind that inventions that have improved the quality of life for some have reduced the quality for others... please name a few, so we can get back to his Nature and his beliefs...

DTI Brain scans, as well as the older MRI machines are medical technologies that are possible because of Tesla's pioneering research into electromagnetism. These machines save lives, helping doctors to make better diagnosis, and more accurate treatments. There are thousands of such examples when science has out done spirituality. For one example when science proved germ theory, we could stop believing finally that demons were causing disease. Saving many lives that by having people wash their hands, lives that were unavoidably lost during the ignorant religious times of the black plague, when people didn't know about germs. So you can promise me tech is not going to save this world, you can promise that? Please are you placing yourself on the same pedestal as all the great thinkers in human history or something, because how else can you promise something like that?
