The Self in Self Aware Networks

The Buddha allegedly did not answer the question about whether the self existed. That's interesting right? There are groups of people that I've met who insist that there is no self. Some people might argue that in the context of a sentient & self aware machine the self is a model, a model formed from learning the features that are omnipresent, right so it starts with a model of the body, a model of the mind, but I will go one step further and argue that even before a model of the self, in the context inwhich brains exist for highly coordinate movement, the self is at the very root a direction concept, and observable direction concept, from which causes emerge, modelling the causes associated with this directional concept gives rise to a sense of personal willpower, or the choice that represents the causation pattern that emerges from the directional concept of "YOU"

At the minimum, for an organism, or a self aware sentient 

Consciousness Causation Body

And I could 3D print frozen banana and the banana could have different colors with food coloring and so she could create a 3d printed design that uses different colors and it places a bits of frozen banana into like and to assume cylinder mode for the cookie shape. But then it puts some like banana of different colors, it sort of prints banana of different colors on top of the banana.

00:43

That's, that's about to be frozen. So that there is basically like your basically making colored pixel colored banana pixels. That represent the image that she drew. And then basically, it's so basically, it's like a frozen banana cookie. That looks like her dog. It is better, if you ask not what, but why is the marching cube?

01:08

Why is the marching cube? Not what? Do not ask. What, that's why? Why is emotion cute? Never mind. The what, why? Why I liked that moment in ex Machina when it was the when the brain when it was when the when the artificial brain was compared to like a search engine or you could even compare it to like even to yeah, to a search engine.

01:54

Like you can just say, you know, basically the, the search engine that they built ended up being something that was capable of consciousness, right? Because they copied the, they learned it, because humanity, learned the structure of consciousness that end and, and, and in one sense, the that consciousness, that a way to describe consciousness is to describe it as a kind of search engine.

02:26

That is, you know, there are queries patterns that are presented to your to your brain and that evokes sequences of patterns from within you responses. You're responding to this situation that you're in, right. And and your responses, you like you call them choices because the, you know, you can map the the body of causation that is causing these patterns to your own muscular structure to your own brand.

03:05

You realize that they're there are commands that are being issued from your brain, to your, to your, to your mouth, to your fingers, to your, to your hands and feet to make things happen in the world, and you recognize your brain has learned, that you are a body of causation.

03:34

And so there's at least the directional concept of you as the source as the location from where the body of causation emanates from and relation to to the sensory input, which is our sense of the world, which for me, like my sense of the world is largely external to my body.

03:54

I sense the world around my body. Not not so much like I think of the world as something that's around my body whereas I think of my body as something that is separate from the world. But that is just that it's just a map of reality. It's just a metaphor.

04:12

Just to stay. It's a learned representation, right? That consists of, I can say it consists of lots of different kinds of patterns that are interconnected also, different associated patterns, that, that represent that concept, because it's a concept that is represented by the convergence of multiple patterns, but it's not.

04:36

But in of itself, it doesn't really have of pattern. I guess I guess is not, I guess it's not like I know, I guess there should be a word for it then.

05:02

I mean, it's clear that the body of responses that is you your muscular structure, your structure of bones and and and muscle is clear. That, that is just. Now.
