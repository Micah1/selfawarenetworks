Consciousness Neurons Tactile Patterns

So in fact, I have multiple theories for for neural function, I multiple potentially compatible theories for brain function for neurofunction and so the thing is like I'm presenting an idea that could be right. Could be wrong but but also could work differently. There's like different possible configuration ideas. So for example, like I'm proposing that basically the basis of storage stored memory is in the, the configuration of the.

00:42

Synapses of each neuron. That that is where the storage of the information pattern that describes a room, a perspective in a room. That's a perspective in four dimensional space. Yeah. So I mean like yeah I imagine like like I don't know how many dendrites is going to take to represent a four-dimensional space but I imagine it just won because because you're just representing like just representing one perspective in space time that includes the dimensions of space for one interval of time, rendered from the perspective of your sensory organs.

01:28

So that includes that includes like the coincident coincidental data from from visual neurons and from we neurons that are focused on your touch patterns and neurons that are that are focused on learning your audio patterns that you could have, you know, maybe just want, maybe maybe, maybe you'll have like, one frame of consciousness from what that represents one perspective.

02:06

Is represented by one sit-ups, but then variations on that perspective like each each variation, that represents a different view, right? Could be represented as a as a pattern in another synapse, you could have lots of overlap between representations of patterns in in one area and patterns in another area.

02:38

So if you walk past marble and then you walk past brick and then you walk past stone and you walk past all these different materials. There's like metal and there's concrete plastic paper and so on and so forth. You walk past all these different materials and it's like there could be pieces of patterns that are sort of like stored at, you know, the lowest levels of the cortex.

03:20

But then here at the higher levels, how those pieces fit together is sort of, like, mapped in the same way as how the small pieces of so it. Yes. So like, yes. So it goes back to, like, sort of higher for learning where the lowest levels of a neurosurgeon will capture the smallest details and then the the higher, the higher you go up.

03:48

It's going to capture basically, the relationships between those low level details and and then it will it will activate those level low level details and a sequence that plays out in and the oscillator that's giving you the perception giving the organism, the perception of of reality perception of seeing hearing smelling tasting and seeing reality basically as the the playback of patterns rendered in in the the brains oscillations which makes really like a lot of sense, right?

04:28

Because if you think of what you're seeing is like a series of patterns that are being played back to you like a volumetric video, right? If if your senses are creating a volumetric video for each instance of time, but the volumetric video includes, like, patterns for sound patterns for feelings for what you were feelings, are for what your chest feels like tactile, sensations are being modeled with the sensor race.

05:02

And the sensor raise are constructing. The mentional representations of the tactile sensations, which are vibrating with the tactile sensations of light that are bumping into the retina of your eyeball. That's right. And light is a, it can be can also be kind of described as tactile. Sensations also, as if your hand is, if you're just here right now is a hand, it's really just an array but the sensors on your hand are really just an array, the sensors on your tongue, your taste buds.

05:40

That's that's the like a sensor array. The hairs in your ears that react to sound waves. That's an array. And so we are covered in a race that are creating these basically pattern representations is scale invariant overlaying pattern representations that are. Mine is able to make distinctions from that are traveling through these patterns or traveling through our neural circuits so that we can have an inner voice by having different different different parts of our.

06:30

Our phasic firing basically sand patterns, that that flow throughout the brain through the brain. Neural circuits. And so you might have your inner voice, might have a direct sort of correlation to a certain string of neural firing.
