focus "CA1 hippocampal and layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons"

"Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some share functional principles (such as) the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity (...) a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to action potential generation. These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity"

"This raises two interesting questions: do neurons with more dendrites (and therefore more synaptic inputs) fire more than those with fewer dendrites? If not, how is firing maintained at the same rate?"

EPSPs seem to be used to excited neurons based on incoming sensory data, getting them ready to fire. It's another way for predictive coding or memory-prediction-rendering at the synapse.

"a recent patch-clamp study demonstrated that excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and sparse firing were evoked in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex in response to activation of the principal whisker and several surrounding whiskers16. The dendrites of these neurons were restricted to a single barrel column, whereas their axons extended to surrounding columns, implying that the receptive-field properties could be explained by a combination of primary innervation for the principal whisker and secondary innervation from surrounding columns."
