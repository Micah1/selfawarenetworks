Okay, I understand you're looking for a very concrete, simple example of how a shape like a "flat sagittal sheet screen" would be encoded within the Self-Aware Networks (SAN) theory, using its specific terms. Let's break this down based on the concepts we've discussed.

It's crucial to remember that in SAN theory, this "screen" isn't a physical object or a literal display in the brain. Instead, it's a *rendered experience*, a dynamic pattern formed by your brainwave activity. Reality, including any perceived shape, is "rendered in the phase variances of your brainwave activity"¹.

So, how would a "flat sagittal sheet screen" be encoded?

1.  **The Foundation: The 3D Rendered Phase Field & Canvas**

    -   Imagine the overall conscious experience as a "volumetric 3D rendered phase field" -- a dynamic 3D grid pattern defined by interacting frequencies and their phase relationships³, ¹⁴, ⁴². This is the broader space within which any specific percept, like your "sheet," exists.
    -   The "canvas of consciousness" is the underlying "low frequency, high magnitude tonic oscillation"¹². This is the stable background upon which more specific, changing patterns (the "movie" or content) are rendered.
2.  **The "Sheet" as a Specific Oscillatory Pattern:**

    -   Your "flat sagittal sheet screen" wouldn't be a static structure. It would be a specific, coherent, and relatively stable *pattern of phase wave differentials*² appearing on that canvas of consciousness¹².
    -   This pattern is a "render change"¹⁰ -- a set of differentiated phase patterns distinct from the baseline tonic oscillation².
3.  **Encoding "Flatness" and "Sagittal Orientation" through Phase Wave Differentials:**

    -   **Phase Wave Differentials are Key:** These are the minute differences in phase timing between oscillating neural arrays, and they are the crucial elements for encoding distinctions and features like shape⁷, ¹¹, ¹².
    -   **"Flatness":** This property would be encoded by a specific set of phase relationships among a large number of synchronized neural oscillations. Imagine many waves interfering in such a way that they define a planar surface within the larger 3D phase field. The coherence and specific phase alignments among these contributing oscillations would define its "flatness."
    -   **"Sagittal Orientation":** This orientation would be encoded by *which* neural arrays are contributing to this pattern and their learned spatial relationships. Cortical columns are described as dealing with information on six axes (front/back, left/right, up/down)²². The "sagittal" aspect would arise from the coordinated activity of neural arrays that represent that particular spatial plane relative to your brain's internal model of your body and its orientation (your "body schema and posture schema"). The specific phase wave differentials generated by these arrays would collectively define this orientation⁷.
4.  **Tomographic Construction from "Slices":**

    -   The SAN theory proposes that the brain constructs 3D perception using "oscillatory tomography"¹⁵, where "traveling wave differentials act like the cross sections detected in tomography to build the 3D model"²³.
    -   For your "flat sagittal sheet," different neural arrays would contribute their "phase patterns" (representing learned data or features). These are like different 2D perspectives or "slices" of information.
    -   Through "brainwave synchronization and oscillatory physics"³, these individual contributions (phase patterns from different arrays and cortical columns) are bound together to form the coherent representation of the "sheet."
5.  **Role of Neural Arrays, Neurons, and Dendrites:**

    -   **Neural Arrays as Processors:** Information is processed by "highly organized neural arrays"⁷, where neurons act as sensors and transmitters⁹.
    -   **Dendritic Encoding:** Each neuron's dendrites and synaptic connections encode context or state, acting like a "localized vector space" or "dendritic embedding"¹⁰, ¹¹. They learn specific patterns. So, neurons within arrays contributing to the "sagittal sheet" percept would have dendrites tuned to features relevant to that sheet (e.g., its boundaries, surface properties, orientation).
    -   **Phase Changes as Broadcasts:** When a neuron detects a relevant pattern with sufficient confidence, it triggers an action potential, creating a "phase change" that is broadcast to the next neural array¹⁰. These are "inceptive fields"¹⁰.
    -   **Scaling Up:** This pattern scales up from individual neurons to entire arrays through NAPOT (Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography), where synaptic memories become conscious memories via these rippling waves¹⁸.
6.  **Achieving Persistence and Becoming Conscious Content:**

    -   For this "flat sagittal sheet" to be part of your conscious experience (the "screen"), its corresponding pattern of phase wave differentials would need to become a "Dominant Phase Wave Differential Rhythm (DPWDR)"²⁰. This means it achieves sufficient spatial and temporal persistence to be a stable "object" in your awareness.
7.  **NDCA: Interpreting the Pattern:**

    -   The Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) is the computational process that would interpret this complex, multi-array, dominant oscillatory pattern as the meaningful percept of a "flat sagittal sheet". It makes "meaningful distinctions from 3D sensory representations, manifest as manifolds in cortical column brain activity". Your "sheet" would be one such manifold.

**Relating to Your Ideas ("Voxels," "Schemas," "Marrying"):**

-   **"Voxel Address":** SAN theory doesn't describe traditional, fixed voxel addresses. Instead, the "location" of any part of your "flat sagittal sheet" within the rendered experience is defined by its position within the overall 3D rendered phase field. This position is determined by the specific configuration of synchronized phase wave differentials from the contributing neural arrays. The "address" is implicit in this dynamic, relational pattern. It's more about how patterns and concepts are mapped in a high-dimensional semantic space mediated by oscillatory timing and phase relationships.
-   **"Marrying each voxel on that slice to the right voxels of body schema and posture schema":** This aligns well with the SAN concept of "binding" disparate features through oscillatory synchronization⁷ and integrating sensory data with internal models and predictions (the predictive coding aspect of NDCA )²³. The "schemas" (body, posture) would be represented by their own complex, learned phase patterns or attractor states. The "marrying" happens when the phase patterns representing the "sheet" become synchronized and coherently integrated with the phase patterns representing these schemas. This creates a unified percept.
-   **"Receptive field for each voxel of each schema... burst together intelligently to illuminate the marriage":** This resonates with how individual neurons (via their dendritic embeddings¹¹) become tuned to specific features. The "bursting together intelligently" is the synchronized, phasic firing of these neural ensembles, creating the DPWDR²⁰ that "illuminates" or constitutes the bound percept.
-   **"4D intersection of a 2D slice thru each schema":** This is conceptually similar to how NDCA is described as dealing with "cross sections of unified attractor states" or representing slices of a 4D space (3D + time) and combining tempo-spatial patterns. The "sheet" could be seen as such an intersection or a specific manifold defined by NDCA.

**In Super Simple Terms for the "Flat Sagittal Sheet Screen":**

Imagine many different groups of tiny musicians (neural arrays) all playing specific, rhythmic notes (oscillations).

1.  The "flatness" and "sagittal orientation" of your "sheet" are like a unique, complex chord or melody (a specific pattern of phase wave differentials) created when particular groups of these musicians synchronize their rhythms in a very precise way.
2.  Each musician (neuron) learns to play its part when it "hears" a specific cue (dendritic detection of patterns).
3.  This combined musical pattern (the DPWDR) is what your brain "renders" or experiences as the "flat sagittal sheet." It's not a physical sheet, but a persistent, coherent pattern in the "music" of your brainwaves.
4.  Other musical patterns representing your body schema and posture schema play in harmony (synchronize) with the "sheet" pattern, making it feel correctly oriented and integrated with your sense of self.

This is a dynamic process. The "sheet" exists as long as those specific oscillatory patterns are maintained and remain dominant.
