When you put your finger on a cup, as your as your thumb touches the cup that is going to activate in the cortical column that's representing the cup for that moment is going to activate a pattern a tactile tempo-spatial pattern that represents your finger sensation.

That finger sensation is still going to come in to this to the somatosensory cortex S1. It's a mechno-sensor array triggered touch, mapped in the Somatosensory Cortex of the brain.

FROM S1 it is going to ripple across the whole brain. Memories are rippling across whole brain. You could have a distant cortical column that is integrating the incoming the incoming sematosensory signals with the incoming visual data and the incoming audio data.

By ripple I mean there is a spike train that is creating large inhibited regions of neural activity.

The spikes in some neurons will trigger inhibitory circuits, that develop the patterns of your mind,

The canvas of the mind is dotted with rippling patterns that alternate between excitation & inhibition "high-amplitude cofluctuations involving large sets of brain regions." https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2109380118 phase variances pass between cells.

A nice video explaining "GABA - The Inhibitory Neurotransmitter" which is going to be related to how waves eminating from action potentials are going to create larger inhibitory waves, that trigger more action potentials, that create the patterns of the mind that this book is all about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV-gCH4O0Os

Somewhere, maybe the TPJ Tempo Parietal Junction, there's this transmitted convergence of rippling wave signals what you are touching, what you are seeing, what you are hearing. This convergence of signals is going to represent the aspects of your sensory input as tempo-spatial patterns in different oscillators that are all talking to each other simultaneously.

But the one that it that you're focused on at that interval in time is the pattern that is active at that endpoint in time, in terms of your tempo-spatial phase patterns in your brain.
