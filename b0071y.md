When you put your finger on a cup, as your as your thumb touches the cup that is going to activate in the cortical column that's representing the cup for that moment is going to activate a pattern a tactile tempo-spatial pattern that represents your finger sensation.

That finger sensation is still going to come in to this to the somatosensory cortex S1. It's a mechno-sensor array triggered touch, mapped in the Somatosensory Cortex of the brain.

FROM S1 it is going to ripple across the whole brain. Memories are rippling across whole brain. You could have a distant cortical column that is integrating the incoming the incoming sematosensory signals with the incoming visual data and the incoming audio data.

Somewhere, maybe the TPJ Tempo Parietal Junction, there's this transmitted convergence of rippling wave signals what you are touching, what you are seeing, what you are hearing. This convergence of signals is going to represent the aspects of your sensory input as tempo-spatial patterns in different oscillators that are all talking to each other simultaneously.

But the one that it that you're focused on at that interval in time is the pattern that is active at that endpoint in time, in terms of your tempo-spatial phase patterns in your brain.
