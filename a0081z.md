Choice refinement theory satisfies the religious concept of freewill with determinism, because it suggests that deterministic self-aware agents can continually refine their choices with each successive iteration of computation by incorporating new variables into the awareness equation thus improving choices with new information. It's the adjacent possible theory applied to self-awareness and phenominal consciousness.

The way Richard Feynman pronounces words when he speaks in the Feynman lectures: it's as if each major point in his rhetoric was a powerful particle collision in his mind. What if particle collisions in our brains are infact activated soliton wave collisions in the brain. The waves from phasic firing neural paths intersecting with oscillating edge communities.

So lets say that the meso scale includes edge communities which are the same as arrays of neurons, and that these are also sections of cortical layers inside cortical columns.
