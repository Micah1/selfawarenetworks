Choice refinement theory satisfies the religious concept of freewill with determinism, because it suggests that deterministic self-aware agents can continually refine their choices with each successive iteration of computation by incorporating new variables into the awareness equation thus improving choices with new information. It's the adjacent possible theory applied to self-awareness and phenominal consciousness.

The way Richard Feynman pronounces words when he speaks in the Feynman lectures: it's as if each major point in his rhetoric was a powerful particle collision in his mind. What if particle collisions in our brains are infact activated soliton wave collisions in the brain. The waves from phasic firing neural paths intersecting with oscillating edge communities.

So lets say that the meso scale includes edge communities which are the same as arrays of neurons, and that these are also sections of cortical layers inside cortical columns.

Choice at the brain network level between oscillating groups of cells via interactions between cortical & sub cortical structures, also related to scale or scaling of information, fractals, top down & bottom up interactions flow of information in the brain

"studies increasingly demonstrate that behavior is represented by brain-wide activity and that even subcortical structures contain early signals of choice, suggesting that behavioral functions emerge as a result of different regions interacting as truly collaborative networks. "
