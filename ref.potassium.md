  13: When a cell gets part of a pattern it updates its synapses, might cause a tiny phase change in its tonic oscillation timing that the rest of the oscillating cell assembly to notice. I am looking at Olfactory bulb research to understand how a cell might instantly update it's sensory input with a partial pattern. Do Potassium receptors get upregulated or down regulated? There was a study on Umami (search my notes, currently in note a0272z) that compared that suggested "taste detection of glutamate (and presumably other amino acids) seems primarily to involve G protein–coupled receptors."

  32: The potassium ion gradients can inhibit or excite, depending on their relative quantity. The ion is the moving material of neural dynamics, of neurophysics, it is an attractor and a state manager, and now with this knowledge it becomes our conceptual tool to make thee, my manufactured friend, the ion, or the mathematically simulated ion, brings forth the sentient self aware artificial being.

  19: If we triggered all the receptors at once we might have maximum potassium outflux, and thus an inhibited neuron.

  30: The quantity of potassium in the cell at the moment of depolarization determines the wave shape, also called the magnitude, but specifically it means the duration of time that the calcium channels on the exit terminals are open, which determines the quantity of the release of vesicle sacks filled with neurotransmitters.
  31  

  42  
  43: Essentially the excess charge, quantified by the potassium ions, is sent via a variation in the number of neurotransmitters released to downstream neurons.

  53: 3. connection morphology or the types of connections matter, when potassium receptors are anchored together with ankeryn repeats they become mechano sensitive or sensitive to mechanical waves like touch.

  87: In a valid sense the neuron is reporting it's learned morphology including it's synaptic connection configuration to the rest of it's oscillatory group. The learned morphology is going to affect the equation at the topic, the rate of change in X - the rate in change in Y. If a neuron grows a lot of new receptors, sodium or potassium receptors, that changes the core equation, the rates of change in X & Y, so a neuron can grow more sensitive or less sensitive with more receptors depending on the type, the location, and the types of incoming signals the neuron is receptive to, because of morphological changes to it's leaky membrane that might dissipate charge increments coming in with certain patterns, or the cell might act on charge increments with certain other patterns based on it's morphological structure.

  11: The movement of ionic charge, including the sodium & potassium pumps, and the passage of neurotransmitters from synapse to dendrite are changing location, and as they move they effect an increasing change in ratio of negatively charged ions to positively charged ions. Increasing or decreasing the chances of an electrical charge or action potential.

  111: Sometimes Potassium channel receptors are bound by Ankyrin Repeats and that makes the receptor surface area larger so the cell becomes sensitive to mechano-scale waves, in other words now the cell can react to touch.

  25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).
  26

  42  
  43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

    7  ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
    8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.
    9  

   41  "Thus, burst firing may encode a ‘reward’ signal during normal reinforcement learning and also pathological addictions (Mirenowicz & Schultz, 1996; Phillips et al. 2003)."
   42: " Calcium influx through NMDA receptors and/or voltage-gated calcium channels causes a depolarization that is terminated by the subsequent activation of calcium-activated potassium channels (Overton & Clark, 1997). "
   43  "It is generally believed that CAN channels are activated downstream of glutamate receptors to drive plateau potentials and boost burst firing."

   87  IV Involvement of Ca2+ Inflow in LTD

Iontophoretic injection of EGTA through an electrode containing EGTA plus "potassium" acetate abolished the LTD, whereas control injection of acetate ions did not affect the LTD"

   95: # The Potassium K+ Channel might be the most important part of the human brain in the context to what it adds.
   96  I think of the original artificial neuron, the Perceptron, and the idea of the All or Nothing action potential, which is sort of like summing up everything the neuron could sense as an accumulation of charges that would result in an all or nothing spike, essentially an on or off switch.
   97  
   98: That model of a neuron, which might similar to the Hodgkin & Huxley model of a neuron has Sodium channels as the star of the show, the neuron fills up with charge, it spikes, and then neurotransmitters flow through the synaptic cleft to the next neuron. In that model the Potassium channel is not more important than the Sodium channel, it's just another pump helping to lower the neurons positive charge so the neuron can be reset again.
   99  
  100: We know now, and I am presenting more of this research today, that the all or nothing action potential isn't an all or nothing event in the computational sense. The reason is because the potassium channels are doing more than just repolarization & hyperpolarization, the potassium channels are manipulated by metabotropic receptors that affect cAMP Cascades and this manipulation can change the duration of the action potential, changing the magnitude of the AP wave shape, causing calcium channels to open longer, releasing more exosomes or synaptic vesicles. There is a lot more happening with Potassium channels and it affects the signals that the cell is sending to other cells.
  101  
  102: In otherwords Potassium channels are the key to phase variations in the signal transmittion between nerve cells, and phase variations are how the rendering of the mind is tomographically computed & perceived by oscillating networks of neurons that are each computing and each perceiving a small part of the conscious mind (a volumetric tomographic pattern) that is being computationally rendered by the brain (or alternatively by an artificial neural network if you have one of those.)

  110: Paraphasing the article: Delayed rectifier potassium channels conduct outward potassium currents during the plateau phase of action potentials and play pivotal roles in repolarization.
  111  
  112: "during the plateau phase calcium entry via L-type calcium channels triggers contraction. counter balancing the calcium influx potassium ions pass through the membrane in the outward direction. the plateau phase is a balance of inward & outward currents"
  113  

  115  
  116: Paraphrasing: Sodium channels terminate quickly, initiating the repolarization phase, but slower potassium channels currents persist during the plateau phase, the repolarization phase, and the hyperpolarization phase.

  17: A large spike might cause more vesicles to be released, resulting in a larger synaptic spike for each of the receiving neurons, more vesicles means more neuro-transmitters are released, and it indicates that more receptors on the receiving membrane are opened up. Which could mean things like more potassium channels opening, more sodium channels opening, it could change the shape of the spike in the next neuron if the repolarization happens faster because a greater number neurons

  26  
  27: There is an effect, in which potassium seems to be the main factor, that might cause the action potential to last longer or shorter, leaving calcium channels in the exit terminal active longer, releasing more vesicles, more synapses, which would effect the timing of the releases of graded potentials, so its possible that the release of more vesicles could be excitatory or inhibitory, opening more sodium channels (excitatory), or more chloride & potassium channels (inhibitory),

  63: This next link is an example of deep learning applied to medical imaging, what is interesting is the idea that a synapse which is gap junction between transmitters & receptors can be thought of as a fractal of a neuron, with inhibitory & excitatory neurons having inhibitory & excitatory synapses on them, and functionally speaking a sodium receptor inside a synapse is like an excitatory receptor, and a potassium receptor is like an inhibitory receptor. So we have two fractals levels here. That's before you dive into what is happening inside the receptor. Biology, and reality is so weird. So weird it's actually a functional fractal, not always a geometric fractal, but functionally a fractal, with the same operations happening at different scales. Excitation & inhibition, it's this like positive & negative charges in a functional sense?

  13: This is a variable limit, depending on the many factors, including the resetting of potassium and ion channels, some neurons can only fire once a second, others can fire once every 1/1000th of a second. Different neurons fire at different rates depending usually on how high up they are in the cerebral cortex hierarchy.

Electromagnetism, from oscillating brain cells, is dialing new electromagnetic frequencies by pushing on ions, metal ions, calcium, potassium, and sodium, in my brain, and this is how the world changes in my mind.
   9  

  16  I say design instead of development.
  17: Also remember that I said there is so much metal in human brains that they would not really be different from metal brains. Well what I mean is that calcium, sodium, and potassium ions pervade the structure of every neuron, and the communication channels. When the ions separate into negative and positive charges that are extreme they can cause cells to depolarize, they cause action potentials. Like a lightning strike sort of, except neurons oscillate, and they synchronize oscillating firing patterns. The big ones are called brainwaves. A wave of electromagnetic energy, that wireless triggers other brainwaves.
  18  

  22  
  23: how do they do this? it comes back to the metal in human brains, the calcium, potassium, and sodium ions are strongly effected by the EM waves, causing large groups of cells to sense them, by becoming inhibited or excited.

  13: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters,

   79: I realized that since AP wave duration is changed by the amount of potassium
   80  that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   81  
   82: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.
   83  

  100  
  101: the process of continually changing potassium levels that can release tonic firing also explains how tonic firing neurons can kick up phasic brain patterns now and then that are reflective of something you have been thinking about for a while
  102  

  104  
  105: so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator) 
  106  
  107: so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike

  12: Abstract: Your cells contain aqueous cations filled with metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, ie charged ions, that allow your nerve cells to generate and respond to both voltage and electromagnetic waves. Increasingly deep learning neural networks are starting to create patterns, like artificial grid cells, that are surprising researchers with their functional similarities to how the brain is thought to work. Conclusion: if one sits with this research long enough the natural conclusion is that humans are metal robots.
  13  
  14: Point 1: Your cells are filled with a metals (in a liquid solution), ie ions, positively charged sodium ions Na+ and negatively charged potassium K+ ions and also calcium Ca++. These metals allow your cells to response to and generate not only voltage but also electromagnetism, example: brainwaves. Life, meaning biology, is computing the mind, and generating models of the world, to coordinate movement.

  73  
  74: In conclusion the sodium/potassium gradient in the pre-synapse changes the amplitude of the action potential which changes the strength of the post-synaptic activity including how many vesicles are activated. This process that I am outlining allows far more information to travel over each node (or neuron) in a neural network, from the dentrite/soma over the AP to the post synapse. Widespread MVR in neocortical synapses overcomes the information bottle neck imagined by the theory of synaptic unreliability.

  78: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

  27: I think what this article does not explore is how the glutamate receptor activations might contribute to either neurons or glial cells firing. Most the work that I have done explores how ionic channels activate neurons, and specifically how variances in the quantity of potassium may change the duration that calcium channels are open for changing the number of vesicles releases and thus the valence of the activity being emitted from the nerve cell.
  28  

  38  
  39: It seems that the metabotropic receptors might modulate the ionotropic receptors via the cAMP cascade, perhaps releasing potassium from the cell faster, and that is how they modulate the phase signal output of the neuron.

  86  
  87: In essence what your neurons are tasting can affect the potassium channels changing the neurons phase output duration, (described in my article & notes on synaptic unreliability) but also it seems they can directly effect calcium channels which means in theory the outputs of individual synapses could be modified (excited or inhibited to release more or less vesicles when the action potential fires)
  88  

  97  
  98: Interestingly combined with the research above note, points to the idea that as the hairs in your ear respond to sound vibrations, they cause the Gating Spring to move, which causes cAMP to possibly modify potassium channels, which changes the duration of the action potential, which causes the calcium channel duration on the exit terminal side to change, which causes variation in the number of vesicles released in the exit terminal, which changes the phase pattern that the neuron passes on to it's exit terminal array.

  112  

  150  18:34
  151: I so I don't know why. So sodium, but why, why was with? So, like, if you didn't have the channels closing, it's kind of like the question is, would this sodium current continue? But regardless, if it appears that that it does stop and in but the current is continuing because there's a potassium current, that's happening, that's different from the sodium current.
  152  
  153  19:04
  154: But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?

  630: It's kind of, I think of, like receptors, you know, how like receptors like you can only have 30 receptors and potassium receptors, and they're designed to only accept the one kind of, they're just like, if either gonna accept sodium, or is it gonna accept calcium or it's gonna accept tassium?
  631  
  632  01:48:13
  633: It doesn't, it doesn't do goals. It just does one thing, and it keeps out the eye outs that are like, like, if you put a potassium ion near 30 mi on, it's not supposed to be grabbing this tattoo, I'm not sure exactly how it works. But,
  634  

b0054y.md:
  34  04:12
  35: Maybe, but I wonder if that if I wonder if it's just so important receptors. Because here's the thing, if it's not also like fewer potassium receptors, like what? If what if animal, like what I'm saying is like, what if the potassium receptors is pretty close between humans and animals, but it's only the sodium receptors that are vastly reduced compared to there was an animals with that does.

  10: But the thing is that when the neuron fires out of three and it's peak that is going to send the most amount of of this is going to send the greatest amount of neurotransmitters because more vesicles will be released. And that will cause the potassium channels to open sooner on the inhibited neurons.

  126: Like there's two different colors, and you can tell that the water is separated in two different colors. To the two, different oceans, and they're not mixing because they're big one. Ocean has too much salt, and in the other ocean might be like very little salt, okay? So calcium and potassium posts of them are positive, ions.
  127  

  131  18:15
  132: So for some reason, like the cat, but in the, like in the brain, well people have told me is that the calcium and the sodium and the potassium, they all, they all share the same space, but they but in, they pee scientists don't see them mixing together and in the explanation that they said was because it's different.
  133  

  140  19:32
  141: Let's mixing potassium, I'm mixing. That's settle calling and Syrian but I don't know if we want it yet. Sodium. I just want to see if like a set of volume and dopamine sequel. 
  142  So, I do know if neurons inspired different types of neurotransmitters. It seems like they would, right?

  165  22:46
  166: So the metabotropic receptor opens up. Opens up an ion receptor and then you have been sodium. Flood sodium, either floods into the cell or calcium does. And but that other receptor is like either. It's either going to be like a sodium receptor or calcium, receptor, or potassium receptor or a choline receptor.
  167  
  168  23:16
  169: And so either, you're going to have a potassium and choline coming out of this cell, or you're going to have sodium and calcium going into the cell. And then the, when the neurons that the transmit, the is right, the ions, like the sodium ions. When they fill up the, the salt to a certain amount, they create the charge, which causes the neuron to fire.
  170  

  174  24:06
  175: I guess you could have the, basically, the inside the cell and outside the cell, you have combinations of ions like 30 ions, calcium, ions, potassium, ions. And but they can't, it's kind of like there. They kind of stick to their own areas, right? But they yeah, you can get a bunch of different kind of.

  58: Funny note *Then he dives into the specific of the cells that confers mechano-sensitivity. I was learning how mechano-sensitivity is conveyed to potassium channels in DA Neuron arrays, which are not normally mechno sensitive, and I had to look up this work Ankyrin, because the Ankryin repeats. Turns out Ankyrin Repeat is Anchoring (bonding) the cells together. My reaction: OMG LOL
  59  
  60: That's interesting that could mean that mechanosensitivty is added by essentially gluing together smaller sensors. OR Essentially the potassium channel is too small to be responsive to pertubations of mechano-scale soliton waves, but it's surface area is essentially magnified by the Ankryin repeat, so it becomes large enough to be sensitive to touch, which means the potassium channel works by being physically knocked with neurotransmitters.

  88: And then nearby another receptor opens up and that starts either. It starts either receiving calcium or sodium or it starts receiving. Like it could start emitting potassium, it can start like, You know, it, but the point is and there's also chloride, but the, but the point is, that it's, it's either going to like, you're gonna have like calcium or sodium open to opening up and the sodium is, if you, you know, typically if you have a lot of the sodium opening up, what's hat.

  17: Because sending sending a three might have an inhibitory effect or sending a one might have a spiking effect and that's just because like a three, like a three is like an inhibitory amount. It could be any, well, it could be an inhibitory amount, right. But in terms of opening up the potassium and causing like, the potassium is to flood out really fast, which would make it harder for the cell to fire.
  18  03:10

  92  20:42
  93: Instead of it's an external will receive a signal. It is is as if it's being instructed to slow down because that's what this what it's going to do. Because maybe it's potassium channels open faster or something or this or the the sodium channels are inhibited something and then you have this other situation where you know a faceobok first happened and either attack either sodium channels open up a lot faster or potassium channels.
  94  21:19

b0101y ctpr.txt:
  54  12:46
  55: Or it's it's like, hey, go faster, more certain channels open or hey go slow or more potassium channel and more potassium channels open with destin apps and that that causes decoherence because now like we it's like you had the whole groups often together and they're response, gives like a bunch of them.
  56  13:07

   76  16:27
   77: Like it's only going to receive patterns from it's synaptic. It's active synaptic connection. So inhibited connections, it's not going to receive a pattern to an inhibited synapse and what happens is if it gets three times the if it gets three micro vesicles acts, it's like six thousand neurotransmitters, that's gonna activate a lot more of its potassium channels simultaneously and that will inhibit the sound because there will inhibit the cell.
   78  17:05

   80  17:44
   81: So the thing it's like it might it that is one possibility but it's also it's also possible that the way that they're connected to another cell could instead excite another cell. So instead of like maybe they have only one synaptic connection to another cell and there's no potassium, it's just about, there's just a lot of sodium receptors and that synapse.
   82  18:08

   84  19:05
   85: I'm sorry not. It doesn't have to come from all of them but it has to come from enough for them. So if enough of them are receiving and if enough of the sodium receptors are are active, and the sodium is is feeling up, faster than potassium is is leaving.
   86  19:24

   92  20:12
   93: And, and the rush of potassium opening would would either inhibit the cell or it would cause cell to shorten the action potential, right? And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
   94  20:58

  260  01:00:58
  261: So it's only layer, my might be inhibitory. And it's like basically mostly with potassium receptors and the synapses to layer two, might be more excited, excited for where it's it's it's it's opening more sodium channels and so that means it can, it could send basically either. Well, basically it sends it's gonna be able to send either excitation or inhibition, but that the idea here is that the excitation run inhibition would be layer based because it wants to inhibit stuff in its own layer but it wants to excite stuff in the next layer.

  13: Okay, you've got sodium ions and you've got potassium ions and like, you send me right away, it's gonna have it when the sodium ions come in. How do they stay separate from the potassium? Ions. All right, when the potassium ions go out, how do they stay separate from? Like you have to, you have to realize.
  14  01:48

  30  05:34
  31: And the in and that is going to be based on the shape of the action potential. Whether you get zero one, two or three release and shape of the action. Dependent potential is is based upon calcium. Sorry it's based upon potassium and and how and how quickly potassium was able to either inhibit the cell or or repolarize it.
  32  06:05
  33: So even more potassium receptors are opened by by nearby neurons. And the cell could be inhibited or or or acre, or it could have a shorter way, right? Short away. So that means that the sodium opened the way of and the patent closes the wave and if potassium opens sooner or faster if potassium opens faster because more channels are pulling it, then the wave is going to end sooner.
  34  06:43

  36  07:18
  37: And our serotonin, right? But there's another, there's nothing. So, if this show, if you're modeling around is now that you've got, you know, sodium and you've got ions, and you've got calcium and potassium and and you've got neurotransmitters, like, GABA and a set of colon and dopamine, if that's it.
  38  07:41

  78  17:16
  79: So what does go into the? The neuron is, is the sodium. That's nearby. So that the receptor is, is carefully is carefully. A configured to only accept like sodium ions or only accept potassium ions. So you're not getting a bunch of like but also eight bit also, ATP flows in.

  304  01:02:30
  305: And in some cases it's adding charge and in some cases it's adding, it's it's it's opening more potassium receptors which don't inhibit the following cell but have been. And but have the effect of changing the action potential shape of another cell so that the the gate of the action potential opens more slow.
  306  

  310  01:03:21
  311: There's a set of cells that basically they lose a bump because I'm sorry, not, it's not that they lose a bump. It's that they they're so there. Like if you open the calcium channels, if you open the sodium channels, much faster than the potassium channel. So like there's more soap, more calcium channels open and and very few.
  312  
  313  01:03:50
  314: Potassium channels are open times at the same time, then that means the rate of potassium filling the sack. Because it's it's the potassium that that repolarizes the the the body of the neuron after the sodium depolarizes. The body of the nerve by causing a separation of charges. So if fewer potassium channels are opened, then that means that the action potential event is going to take longer to close.
  315  

  319  01:04:55
  320: I think. I mean at least it implies that the calcium channels opened up a lot faster than the potassium channels because more were opened more more sodium channels. Got opened in fewer, potassium channels. So there's that. Yeah, it's hard to. So, yeah. Harder. I'm my mind around them out there but so but but you know, I guess we're gonna see the tensor processing unit which which is different from the graphics processing unit because it just sort of like the tensor processing unit focuses on matrix multiplications, which is, which is if you try, if you're trying like, if each nodes, if each nodes output is a vector and a deep learning, it's a vector and intensive space.
  321  

  337  01:08:11
  338: See calcium. They have potassium sodium. Okay, so but in any case it's it's gonna be doing well today, I feel like it's been getting better over time and maybe it has been learning my voice. But and but it will be nice, it will be nice to experience like, you know, and even more perfected version.

  19: I mean, in terms of how the electromagnetic field is interacting with, with ions, with sodium, ions and potassium ions.

  20  04:12

  40  09:33
  41: And they, if you have more than is that, well, maybe more of the potassium receptors will be engaged, and the potassium will get out faster because there's more channels pumping it in. So, if the speed of the potassium is faster, than that means that the action potential concludes faster, right?

    8  

   65  
   66: And so, I mean, it turns out that the the this synapses are going to change the action potential because they're going to primarily because of the changes to the potassium channels. So when the potassium, if you have more potassium channels, open then the patented potassium moves faster out of the cell body and that could either inhibit the cell or it could repolarize yourself faster.
   67  

   69  
   70: So effectively like the potassium helps, shut down the action until so the sodium opens up the action potential and I'm potassium sort of closes the action potential. And the idea is that the length of the action potential which can vary based upon the potassium channels changes the the multi vesicle release pattern so you have between zero.
   71  

   95  
   96: The exit terminal, the fluids in the next terminal. I guess are increasing at that point. So when the best of goal when the vessel and the vesicle is going to land on, if it lands on a on a synapse, on the other side, that's going to add some some mechanical force and some mechanical force that leads to electrical stimulation and the the channel will allow sodium ions or out in or potassium ions out.
   97  

  103  
  104: And that means that all that, that likely, that all of the potassium is opened up at once. All the testing channels are opened over once is basically going to inhibit the cell and that's scenario. And so, so like when you're on spikes really hard, it's gonna like a phase of spike, it's gonna open up all the potassium channels because is with the microgressive hole with a with the multi micro vessel release.

So, the way one neuron inhibits other neurons from firing would be to do things like Opening the potassium chat channels too soon or you know, blocking the sodium channels from activating by.

  15: Potassium channels or or sodium channels like opening or closing or connecting or disconnecting.
  16  01:13

  22  02:56
  23: Look the idea is that look, you open the sodium channels first and you open the potassium channels, second. So that, you know, the the sodium channels have a chance to trigger the action potential on the axon from the summer, but but if that and if that happens, then what happens at the same time is, you know, the potassium starts leaving the cells through and that causes a repolarization of this of the cell.
  24  03:30
  25: So like recess to cell. So it could fire again, and so sodium. So sodium is a positively charged and potassium is positively charged, but compared to the sodium, there is a negative gradient in a potassium just by comparison. Like the sodium is more positive. And the potassium is less positive.
  26  03:58
  27: And so, if there's too much positive in the cell, then the the action potential gets triggered. But the when the potassium leaves the cell through the opening of no transmitters. Then the the potassium, I'm sorry. The the gradient of the inside of the cell is going to shift back to negative instead of being positive.
  28  04:34

  32  05:21
  33: Available, potassium channels and available sodium channels. You're, you're altering, the the shape of the action potential and, and you might be, I mean, you know, I kind of like, I wonder if there's a neuron that has multiple kinds of neurotransmitters and different action. Potential configurations are sort of possible.
  34  06:02

  36  06:43
  37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  38  07:13

b0146y ctpr.txt:
  14  03:38
  15: And you see if there's a lot of like you know it could be that the, you know, sodium channels could be blocked or inhibited or it could be that the that potassium channels could be upregulated or or opened early so that potassium floods out earlier to an inhibit. The the the the potential of the action potential before it hits it it happens.
  16  04:20

  28  08:03
  29: That that is on a topological or spatial with the topological or space of distribution. So, there's a, there's a temple window of phases being received on the topology of the denture right with physical embodiments of charge building up, really injection of 30 miles, and the the exfiltration of potassium ions right there is a literally, like, a short term timekeeping mechanism.
  30  08:48

b0149y ctpr.txt:

  30: Maybe there's a change in the potassium, gradient and somehow, and it's not able to and there's some sort of place where it's a maybe
  31  14:01
  32: The potassium perceptor is inhibited or something. And the potassium takes longer to stop the to reset the cell through set. The polarization of the song. Okay. So the action potential is larger because of that because the potassium is somehow slowed down. I'm not sure how, but
  33  14:45

  35  14:52
  36: Right, be hours. Just trying to think, you know potassium could be related to.
  37  15:04
  38: Yeah, Davidson app is in the dendrite because the dent because the synapse at the synapse isn't a dent, right? Or inhibited if the potassium synapses are inhibited. Then potassium is going to be more slowly. Repolarized the cell and that means the action made the last longer. And that means that more of the.
  39  15:29

  41  16:09
  42: By blasting, the representative neurons where that targeted light is at blasting that with, with receptors. I'm sorry with neurotransmitters. I think they're getting smashed in the short term transmitters because the because the sodium is you know being allowed to flood in but the but potassium is being inhibited from a statement and it's causing the the action potential to release more festivals and that's like that is a way for neurons themselves to basically
  43  17:11

b0153y.md:
  10  
  11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal.

  16  02:39

  18  03:10
  19: They it usually plays in on, like after the action potential or where exactly the threshold ends up being for firing but it's the big snap. The big spike is sodium in desensitis the, the sodium channels desensitized and then you have this slower on set of potassium, pushing out which shuts down the the spike.
  20  03:35

  24  04:14
  25: We're gonna put two pictures and there's in the dendrites gonna recognize the pattern from this picture, and then it's going to that's going to potentially result in the like a change in the potassium. It's gonna result in. It's what I'm thinking is it's gonna change the, it's gonna change the potassium and the the potassium is going to change the shape of the action potential and the shape of the action potential is going to change the the total quantity of neurotransmitters that that fled the the exit terminal in multi in terms of multiples.
  26  05:01
  27: In terms of microtubules acts and so that's what I'm like, that's what I'm driving at like. Well how how is the dendritic recognizing a pattern that's going to change the amount of potassium because that because I I think and I've talked to other people, I think that there's enough.
  28  05:23
  29: There's research also that says, you know, this is what the tabs there is, there is some sort of like what it's going to cause the change in the shape of the action. Potential may come down to how long the the dirt, the two, the duration of the action potential, like when it's when it's closed and if there's more, if there's more potassium concentration, then the dendrite might close at a different time interval.
  30  05:54

  38  07:36
  39: Also when those those channels are going to become desensitized, so sure you could definitely end up controlling the shape or even like the timing of when the spiking happens with with synaptic inputs. I think that's what you're getting at. Yeah, I'm wondering how the affecting sodium. You could be affecting potassium, like you were saying.
  40  08:05
  41: Yeah. But more specifically, get affected. And then the potassium for plasticity is calcium. And you certainly could be modifying the responsive calcium channels as well. And yes, so the cat. That's right. Okay. They're part of the hypothesis that I'm working on but specifically potassium like that. Like, could you say more about how like theorized more?
  42  08:28

  46  09:29
  47: Some sort of changes the amount of potassium and and down the road, you know, changes. You know, what to the to what the calcium receptors are, or doing, or how much, you know, with the calcium receptors are I'm, actually, I'm actually not sure what what changes gonna it's gonna make to the calcium receptors.
  48  09:51
  49: Exactly. Because it doesn't. This is a little bit of the gray area for me, like, well, where how a synapse is going to increase or decrease? The potassium. Delta that potassium. I'm not sure what to the. Yeah will change the potential and the potential can affect the you know, the voltage it's going to put the the channels that a different set point.

  171: So there's there's there's there's sodium there's chloride there's potassium there's calcium but but between the neurons I think we're talking about GABA and GABAergenic and Abigail no no no, so there's there's there's there's dopamine hang on.

  199: Well patch clamp is a similar concept it's that they they clamp something on to tissue. So you can clamp something onto part of the neuron you can clamp it onto receptors and you're clamping a sensor onto tissue to to watch what it's doing electrically and so the classic. Patch clamp experiments basically were able to observe you know, how you know potassium and and they basically rate they're able to observe how voltage changes happen in the cell and how the ions change in the cell and so there's like a ton of data that a neuroscientist advised me to reach to go to go through so I can solve some of these questions.

  246: Yeah the nemesis of whatever studies the set point versus the game can of the system. So what I'm kind of wondering is how is the dendrite activity affecting the the when the the sodium and potent like basically the the sodium and potassium gradient like for example, if you you have the sodium crisis a positive releases this positive charge right that's going to open the calcium channels for for a duration, but then you have to pat potassium is going to release this negative charge which is going to it's gonna.
  247  
  248  45:33
  249: Almost almost immediately start this negative wave of energy, which is going to close those calcium channels pretty quickly and I'm wondering how does the dendrite activity sort of the resultant changes to the amount of to the to when the potassium starts it's? It's it's a it's it's it's negative release it's release of negative charge a little bit sodium is deposited one and chloride is the negative one so the inhibitory inputs from gather neurons that's chloride which is a negatively charged ion that comes into the cell and the positive excitatory inputs are sodium which is going through the effort receptors, those are main positive and negative inputs there is calcium, which has a whole special story and, The potassium is really more about maintaining the baseline firing threshold, it's sort of like a regulatory kind of voltage management system does not part of regular signal transmission.
  250  

  254  47:07
  255: Well that makes it the inductance opioids like being careful and stuff are going to activate that sort of potassium flowing out through like a dark channel mediated process.
  256  
  257  47:22
  258: Okay well what kind of what kind of chloride is this I haven't haven't really heard of this before confused the in by the way. Nick do you agree with that is this chloride coming from this is kind of basic ionic transport across the cell for the neurotransmitters, you're basic one you primarily learn about sodium potassium sort of having a higher concentration outside than inside so whenever you you open up a sodium channel sodium tends to flow inside gradient, then the opposite being that for potassium, which is higher on the inside.
  259  
  260  47:57
  261: Of the cell versus the outside so if you open up the potassium channel you like a curved channel or something like that then potassium is going to flow out and a lot of the you know, patching stuff we have to be careful because anytime that you sort of create an artificial seal by breaking open the membrane you create a potential for leak and potassium tends to go out and sodium tends to flow in as well and so you can kind of get an artificial activity of the neuron based on just the diffusion gradients that are there and then obviously chloride which is your Primary negative ion within the picture I guess we could say in a lot of like all mentioned gaba, you know, it's it's primary mediators to chloride channel, so I definitely I I definitely missed out on chemistry class.
  262  
  263  48:46
  264: I didn't take it but I thought you have like you can have like a sodium chloride or a potassium chloride is chloride its own sort of separate thing that I say I guess I'm missing some data here, but I had a neuroscientist was explaining to me that it was that the the the action potential was the sodium becoming very.
  265  
  266  49:07
  267: Positive and potassium coming there, very negative and so this is just regular chloride it's not potassium chloride, it's not sodium chloride. Well potassium is positive charge. Yeah. Yeah, so separate out the action potential idea that's separately that's kind of a special process that's how the neuron does it's spike so the first is these ions the other individual atoms so sodium ions means natural sodium is just a single atom of sodium.
  268  
  269  49:50
  270: And the potassium ions are single atoms of potassium and the chloride ions are single atoms of chlorine and same with calcium so you got to these individual atoms and they're in solutions so you know salt is sodium chloride but you dissolve salt and water the sodium and the chloride dissociate you get pre-floating sodium atoms and pre floating chloride atoms in a solution of water, so that's kind of the situation in the cell, you've got used dissolved salt.
  271  

  281  52:04
  282: S into break and they're kind of setting competing signals pushing the voltage up and down inside the cell and if the voltage gets up above a certain threshold. I think it's like minus 30 or something then it turns this whole after potential process which is like this giant spring loaded reset process where all of a sudden a whole bunch of sodium atoms come in and the voltage spikes me up and then turn resists counter wave of potassium ions that all open up and as they all flow out and it's giant you know, see change it's like the whole thing kind of flips over with this massive voltage swing and it's that massive voltage.
  283  
  284  52:39
  285: ⟪ 317 characters skipped ⟫ just trickle all the way down the axon and carry the signal to the end of the axon and that's the action potential and it's being done by this, you know giant wave of sodium atoms coming in and then potassium atoms going out Texas big signal and then around has to resettle that has to clean all that up but move all the items back to where they came from which takes a while.
  286  

  290  53:40
  291: That's going to trigger the action potential to start because there's a because there's too much positive charge that is that right? By the charge builds up to a critical threshold point that then triggers the you know, sort of exponential opening of more sodium channels which then gives you that sort of all or nothing's like potential and then with it reaches a certain pot positive charge, then that triggers the you know, theoretical opening of the potassium channels and positive charge them close back out to sort of reset the membrane potential okay, so are the are the chloride atoms involved in closing the sodium channels or is it the potassium that's involved with closing?
  292  

  299  55:33
  300: And those are the ones that causes avalanche domino effect to heaven. I'm so so what I'm asking this question because my my understanding of the role of the potassium has changed and in a bit so what would you how would you describe the role of the potassium at this point in in regulating the cell?
  301  
  302  55:51
  303: It does two things one is as a key part of this action potential process this sort of, you know, Domino's trigger this called the neural spike to a place a key role there is the thing that causes the spike to come back down to negative the sodium causes it to go up to a high positive type part of this bike and then the potassium brings it back down to the negative so it plays that role and then it also plays a role in just maintaining the the normal voltage level of the cell, it has like a baseline voltage that gets regulated the maintained with regulation.
  304  
  305  56:24
  306: Sodium, how does the potassium?
  307  
  308  57:00
  309: Is because the there's more potassium inside the cell that outside and so the potassium flows out. So sodium.
  310  

  314  57:31
  315: Then they flow in the direction of the concentration just based on the size, but one channel one poor will either be a sodium poor, it'll be a potassium poor candles and. I should get the same basically activity transmission.
  316  

  323  59:50
  324: Which were the excess sodium and potassium are inside or outside the cell that as well all biological cells every biological cell in the human body and all animals going back to sea creatures all have the excess sodium outside and the excess potassium inside so are the potassium receptors on the dendrite side or the axon side.
  325  

  329  01:00:38
  330: That's not how biology evolved. Like how does that question relevant but okay. Yeah, there's that I mean potassium are sort of interchangeable atoms they both have a positive charge sodium's one of them's larger. I forget which one's larger probably my question is what makes them or something?
  331  
  332  01:01:26
  333: I think with the you know ion concentration and seawater the salt concentration is seawater and how that led early life evolving would be my guess. But we probably drifted from Mika wanted to understand channel mechanics. Well, when I want to know is um, how is the well the reason I'm trying to ask how does the dendrite affect potassium is because some researchers say they're saying that you know, basically that the the the potassium concentration is affecting the duration of the action potential.
  334  
  335  01:02:16
  336: And so I'm trying to figure out okay well if the action at the duration of the action potentials varying because of the concentration of the potassium. What's affecting the the concentration of potassium and how in and and you know is the dendrite effectness. So if the dendrite detects the pattern and it's able to trend if the it's a dendrite a detective pattern, it has to transmit that pattern to onward otherwise it might as well not have detected the pattern.
  337  
  338  01:02:48
  339: So the idea here is that detects the pattern and then it transmits it onward through the rate through by affecting the potassium gradient. Or potassium concentration and that affects the duration of the action potential. And so, I'm just I'm just I'm trying to figure out what are the mechanics of how the dendrite is affecting the potassium.
  340  
  341  01:03:15
  342: It and maybe that's just through the potassium receptors. Yeah, I'm not sure that anything is communicated within the cell using sodium and potassium or even chloride. It's all voltage. Those things are just adding positive and negative charges to the voltage because the voltage that is communicating that's allowing the communication happen inside the cell and to travel down the dendrite tax on for example.
  343  
  344  01:03:39
  345: In those changing the calcium change the actual spike time because I mean, obviously changing potassium is going to change the resting memory potential and even a change how close that cell is the threshold but I don't think it actually changes the actual time, you know, once you trigger the action potential does it?
  346  
  347  01:03:57
  348: Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, you hear these terms like narrow spiking neurons and broad spiking neurons. So I think just in terms of how the voltage get a channels are tuned Spikes might be, you know, kind of faster and shorter or that. How long they propagate but in how wide the waveform is but against this because I have a bunch of recordings going from you know where took the same brain slice one from three to fourteen millimeter potassium, and I didn't notice anything different when I was looking at the spikes already data and they seemed to pretty much be the same.
  349  
  350  01:04:32
  351: Yeah that is surprised makes. I thought it's not that's not the concentration it's the voltage level that's determining it. But I think it would have to be different not based on I see so making you're saying there's a researcher claiming that the potassium level is changing the waveform. Um that the potassium level yeah, yes it's changing the shape of the action potential by by by keeping the.
  352  

  368  01:06:39
  369: Yeah, there's there's a lot more questions, um, they need to be asked to figure out exactly what's what's happening. Because um, if the if the cast, I mean at some point the the role of of sorting him in and chloride and potassium is affecting what's happening to the calcium receptors.
  370  
  371  01:07:05
  372: So, maybe the calcium channels are open longer, but, But I see that so what I'm trying to map out is okay, so how is what the dendrite is is detecting affecting the the sodium and the chloride and the potassium and how were they affecting the calcium and and then how is that affecting the the duration of the of the action potential?
  373  
  374  01:07:30
  375: And so I'm trying to sort of like get get, you know established the link here between because I think potassium has to has to play a role in in. In that in terms of the the duration of the calcium channels, but also how is the you know, how are the dendrites how's the dendrite effecting the potassium, you know, and and because the dendrite has to detect something and in order for something to be detected to be turned into a change in the act in the action potential waveform.
  376  
  377  01:08:02
  378: It has there has to be a process and so I'm just trying to figure out what that process is. Yeah. I feel like the potassium part is probably a minor part of the whole picture. I mean, if what you're interested in is what might be going on in terms of kind of complex interest cellular signal processing.

  4: So, okay, so. What's really interesting was that I learned how the the sodium is causing a positive spike. The potassium is causing a negative spike and when the potass when the potassium engages that determines whether the spike is going to be it's going to have a high amplitude or a low or a low amplitude or in in what's interesting is that with EEG in the brain every there's a there's there's a power law from the micro firing of neurons to the macro firing of your aus circuits.
  5  00:46

  7  01:32
  8: So so I'm reading this in the book rhythms of the brain and I'm hearing him talk about I'm hearing F Scott saying, okay, well basically the the sodium is creating this positive wave and what happens is there's this timing thing where the potassium can either pass in it can can can comes in and it makes it negative now if you tell me now if there is something like a multi vesicle vesicle release that he didn't know about before he talked to me like he was like, he knows about he read about something called.

   31: Because you have enough calcium that comes in that opens the opens enough channels. And that you're only gonna have cat enough calcium to come in if the channels are open for a longer which is why variations in the amount of potassium open the channels open the delays in the in the start of when potassium starts to bring us back down means that the spike glass longer the spike last longer it means more calcium or calcium binds that means that the channels are open longer, which means that the, The the spike last longer and the that is the spike last longer then that means that more vesicles will be released so that's the cause so if you have time maybe no vesicles would be released maybe one vesicle if it's longer maybe one velocity if it's longer than that then maybe two vesicles.
   32  06:35

  114  23:59
  115: So you have a force which is if you're the force which is the potassium, right? But that's changing the the time and then the time is changing another horse is changing into time and that's changing into another force and then. Which is being which is being registered as.
  116  24:39
  117: Okay so what I learned earlier in this call which is interesting that I sort of blushed over when I was talking with that he was saying that you have the sodium releases this positive sodium when it gets starts getting released releases a positive charge and then the potassium is a negative charge, but the potassium is too much passing against these.

   9: So the flow of information on the brain at the 29.45 seconds mark. He says the cell is at rest. When cells at rest? So, let's actually start at the 1906 mark, okay? The presynaptic. Potassium modifies the action potential applicant amplitude or APC which determines the strength of this synaptic signal.
  10  

  20  
  21: So as it gets through negative 40, it's like okay we can open. So it's like positive feedback loop. Now there's tons of sodium in and it's just shooting up pop up. So it's going closer to zero and then ten twenty it goes up to positive 40 millivolts. But what happens there is you have these potassium channels these k channels that open and start doing the opposite and the reason why you're thinking to wait, this is positive or wouldn't that be more positive current yes?
  22  

  24  
  25: When that be more positive current yes, except there's a gradient. And so now, While there's more sodium outside than neuron then there is inside the neuron. There's way more potassium inside the neuron than outside the neuron. So if you're going to open a potassium channel, the positive charge is going to go the other way and basically end up with the net negative charge.
  26  

  28  
  29: It would be like a negative charges entering the cell. Although it's. Positive leaving. So that potassium k current is hyperpolarizing the cell back to where it was. And it even overshoots a little bit and that's called the after hyperpolarization but. The timing of these things, come on are so synchronized.
  30  

  32  
  33: They're so fast. It results in a spike that last less than a millisecond. So these potassium currents start shooting up and before they're even done shooting up. I said that backwards. The sodium occurrence the sodium occurrence starts shooting up the voltage of the cell and then even before it's done shooting up the petacium occurrence have turned on.
  34  

  70  
  71: Basically shove the vesicle into the membrane and allows the neurotransmitter it allows the neurotransmitter to spit out into the synapse. And that's the formation of neural communication. All right, so we're talking about if you mess with the potassium so that the, So that a split one second millisecond mellow voltage that reached the end of the axon allows the calcium to come on now if you mess with the potassium that means you don't it doesn't come on as fast as it would normally and so whichever during it's spreading the action potential instead of just being one millisecond it's longer so maybe two or three milliseconds not sure but it could last as long as ten milliseconds.

  349: Before I read away, I'm going to say that neurons are like salty bananas. I mean, it's a good one yeah, they they have a lot of sodium on the outside and they have a lot of potassium on the inside, so when a channel opens up then you know, what's going to happen maybe the the sodium from the outside is going to flow to the inside and that is what allows for the polarization that eventually can lead to an action potential this is sure you know, and it's time to run away and maybe even eat a banana.

  257  
  258  41:34
  259: So yeah some neurons they're like assaulty banana. That's how you can think about them. There is a lot of salt on the outside of neurons and inside of neurons they have a lot of potassium in them. So when the, Cell becomes more and more polarized over time when more sodium comes in and more potassium flows out then eventually it gives a stronger negative.
  260  
  261  42:05
  262: Oh gains a stronger positive charge and then it fires an action potential. And this is how brain rhythms and neural circuits work, which is that. Action potentials fire and then the excite or inhibit the next neuron depending on whether it is excitatory or inhibitory neuron. This is Sharena and I am done talking I can add a fun fact that is that so you know sodium potassium and calcium these on the periodic table of these are under the classification of metals, right?

  198  
  199  19:01
  200: The presynaptic k potassium modifies the action potential (magnitude) or apsin which determines the strength of the synaptic signal including the (magnitude) of the postsynaptic response and then that leads to how many vesicles can be released per action potential which is between usually between zero and three.

  213: Millivolts but what's happens there is you have this these potassium channels these k channels that open and start doing the opposite and the reason why you're thinking wait, this is positive wait wouldn't that be more positive current yes except there's a a gradient and so we're while there's more sodium outside the neuron than there is inside the neuron there's way more potassium inside the neuron than outside the neurons so if you're going to open a potassium channel, the positive charge is going to go the other way and and basically end up with a net negative charge it would be like a negative charges and During the cell yeah, yeah, although it's positive leaving anyways, so so that potassium that K current is hyper polarizing the cell back to where it was.

  230: So that split one millisecond split positive milk voltage that reaches the that reaches the end of the axon allows that calcium to come in now *if you fuck with the potassium and you don't let it come on as fast as it would normally what you end up doing is you end up spreading that action potential instead of being just a split one millisecond event.

  232  23:31
  233: *by fucking with the potassium you just made that action potential a two millisecond or three millisecond event I don't know I'm exaggerating

  250  24:33
  251: So, I think that's what you're talking about with the by messing with the k the k currents the k channels. The potassium channels you're you're changing the shape of the spike (magnitude) which you didn't mention but that's basically the result of that and by making the shape of the spike more spread out (duration) it allows enough time for its not just one vesicle to get released but like a bunch of (vesicles) get released over that much time.

  134:   52: Presynaptic K+ (potassium) modifies the action potential amplitude (APsyn) which determines the strength of the synaptic signal, including the amplitude of the postsynaptic response, including how many vesicles can be released per action potential (0 -3)
  135:   74: In conclusion the sodium/potassium gradient in the pre-synapse changes the amplitude of the action potential which changes the strength of the post-synaptic activity including how many vesicles are activated. This process that I am outlining allows far more information to travel over each node (or neuron) in a neural network, from the dentrite/soma over the AP to the post synapse. Widespread MVR in neocortical synapses overcomes the information bottle neck imagined by the theory of synaptic unreliability.
  136:   78: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?
  137  

  171     18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
  172:    28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,
  173     36: so I had this idea from neuroscience that neurons were expanding on mass when they fired like an a action potential, which I also think of as like lightning, positive and negative charges between the sky and earth split so much fhere is a flash followed by a bang, light and sound, frequency and amplitude

  177:   119: In conclusion the sodium/potassium gradient in the pre-synapse changes the amplitude of the action potential which changes the strength of the post-synaptic activity including how many vesicles are activated. This process that I am outlining allows far more information to travel over each node (or neuron) in a neural network, from the dentrite/soma over the AP to the post synapse. Widespread MVR in neocortical synapses overcomes the information bottle neck imagined by the theory of synaptic unreliability.

And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
  305    291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,

  328:   37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  329    39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

  370:    4: So, okay, so. What's really interesting was that I learned how the the sodium is causing a positive spike. The potassium is causing a negative spike and when the potass when the potassium engages that determines whether the spike is going to be it's going to have a high amplitude or a low or a low amplitude or in in what's interesting is that with EEG in the brain every there's a there's there's a power law from the micro firing of neurons to the macro firing of your aus circuits.
  371     6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?

Potassium modifies the action potential applicant amplitude or APC which determines the strength of this synaptic signal.
  381    13: Including the amplitude of the postsynaptic response that leads to how many vesicles can be released for action potential, which is usually between zero and three. You guys could go to five. But the average number is 2.6 when a cell is at rest it's at minus 55 millivolts or minus 40 millivolts and spike happens where it shoots way up.

   972    91: Then the idea that there's a photocopier enlargement function associated with an oscillation, which is hand flooding, and the in eye sort of like, you know, in thinking about this book, think about exactly book and think it also about this book sink was that, you know, that the oscillating group of the whole neural oscillator is not going to oscillate at the same time because you have first of all, if you have a bunch of neurons that are going off and sending signals to the extra terminal that's going to cause the set of the of its external to become inhibited.
   973:   93: Instead of it's an external will receive a signal. It is is as if it's being instructed to slow down because that's what this what it's going to do. Because maybe it's potassium channels open faster or something or this or the the sodium channels are inhibited something and then you have this other situation where you know a faceobok first happened and either attack either sodium channels open up a lot faster or potassium channels.

   46     9: the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.
   47:   25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).
   48  

   70    17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
   71:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them.

  391:   436:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters, 
  392    440:   118:    11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?

   605    12: conscious awareness, meditation, everything, every thought, every perception, every percept, everything in your mind, everything unconscious, and the mind itself consists of projections that are ion trajectories. Now oscillating waves of ion trajectories unify by frequencies, they harmonize, we sing, and it is as if everything I am projecting as the universe is an oscillating wave of ion trajectories.
   606:   17: Also remember that I said there is so much metal in human brains that they would not really be different from metal brains. Well what I mean is that calcium, sodium, and potassium ions pervade the structure of every neuron, and the communication channels. When the ions separate into negative and positive charges that are extreme they can cause cells to depolarize, they cause action potentials. Like a lightning strike sort of, except neurons oscillate, and they synchronize oscillating firing patterns. The big ones are called brainwaves. A wave of electromagnetic energy, that wireless triggers other brainwaves.
   607    31: Neurons oscillate, create electric sensory fields, that sense the world like echolocation, allowing a nervecell to feel, it registers what it feels as changes in the quantities of positive and negative ions, this is how a neuron feels before we even connect it to the rest of the network in the brain.

   757     73: that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.
   758:    75: This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.
   759     85: so you have an oscillating expectation in the inhibited neurons

   762     96: because multiple tonic oscillations are exerting the effects of collective information consideration on each other with each interval pf tonic firing
   763:    98: so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator)

   765    117: I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.

  2607      68:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations

  2630     228:   80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

   107     7  ~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
   108:    8: Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.
