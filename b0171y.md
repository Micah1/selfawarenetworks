I I'm smiling because I used an insight used an insight from my work from the book that I'm working on, which part of it covers, the topic of the human brain. And I had an idea about what might be going wrong in someone else's brain. And that gave me an insight into my own brand because I took the same sort of, like, I imagined a process of how that other person's brain was not performing correctly.

00:44

And,

00:49

I used what I learned from that analysis. I came out with a new conclusion. I'll call it.

01:03

It's it's weird. It's not that it's a new conclusion. It's that it's a conclusion from another point of view that I had in another area. So it's like taking it's like saying well I'm making this assumption about what's going on. When people talk to each other, I'm making an assumption about what's going on between different cortical columns.

01:28

I'm making an assumption about what's true, right? In terms of the importance of my own ability to put together complex information, right? All those ideas are related and the relating factor is time temporal synchronicity. And if that moment, I knew how it was going to do this book. I knew how I was going to accomplish this book.

02:09

I knew how I was going to put together, I knew how I was going to put everything together because I saw this human mind as a graph, a spectral graph, which means that you would have a concept of something appeared in one part of the graph. And a concept is something I'm here.

02:24

Another part of the graph. And then later on, when the graph learned, how those two features were connected, it would bridge the two. But although they're located apart by a distance, the brains concept of space is also something that's learned there's not an innate knowledge of space. And so, I think that this space is something that's learned that we learn with spaces.

02:56

But based upon observational patterns, right? The brain puts together the concept of a space. And we think that consciousness has to include space released, I I thought it did, I thought that space was part of it and I was really confused when I tried. So I'll be a divanorum and I could no longer tell the difference between one thing and another and the same thing happened when I tried the

03:30

The same thing happened when I when I tried the DMT. Did you see what I'm saying? This, I saw the walls to my right into my left, they disappeared. And I suddenly I was in a vast space, my sense of space was completely changed with the Salvia with not being able to see the difference between any two objects.

03:58

So it's like that would implied that the observer cell. It's not fundamentally connected to like the space or empty space. Because there's been a lot of there was a lot of that preaching, like the like there's the content of the mind and then there's the empty space that contains the content of the mind.

04:23

And there was it just it actually didn't occur to me that space itself or space time was also the content of the mind and not the mind itself. And and that means that it's content lists that the mind itself is content lists, that means there's no there's no there's no sense of space around you when your content list.

04:59

Contentless means no sense of space. It's like that story that they go is like people think that blind people our our in darkness like when you're in a like when you're seeing persons in a lit room and you turn out the light, you're in darkness. These think that blind person feels like they're in darkness, but they don't feel like they're in darkness.

05:25

There's this no sense of light or dark, there's no sense that they're not sensing that they're missing something. And by the same token, like the actual content of the observer, That content isn't space time. It the observer doesn't create space time, that's the contest content in the side, that's learned content.

06:00

And that's the key to understanding the graph is that it's there is no sense of space. It is learned and has to be that way, because it is a computer computer. Does not have an innate sense of space. Why would it? And so that's not. So, it's not that they're it's not that the oscillations are

06:35

Conscious. It's that they're frames. They are frames in a consciousness that a whole brain consciousness, the frames it, okay? But it's a pattern that we can reason is there. It's an invariant pattern learned by the whole brain, which is somewhat invariant of the cortical column somewhat. Although some cortical columns may have features that others do not.

07:09

So the capabilities, but it's an but patterns that are invariant across cortical columns. That would mean that like, you have the cortical column for sawdust and the cortical column for rain, would be able to have, you could have a pattern in the rain that appeared in the sawdust, and therefore, a pattern could transfer from one cortical column to another.

07:31

And ideally you'd have, if you're seeing rain, it's all us at the same time then, each one is represented, at least by the patterned activity of a cortical column. But either one of those columns could represent that data. But the thing is that data is being represented with a certain bias towards some texture or material or concept or pattern tree.

07:57

I think mean, if on neurons, I mean, if it, like, overall we I say this because it's like, yeah, there are examples of when Civic moments. See, that's the thing. Is it matters a lot? It like there's been a lot of neurosciences has been. Okay, we're going to basically study this patient after they've had such, you know, surgery or they've had such such injury.

08:36

We're gonna study them for certain amount of time, but that's not necessarily going to be a long-term study. It's not necessarily going to be a rigorously done study and we may go back and say, okay, we need to do the study bigger with many more patients, but we just can't because you just, you can't make up injuries to study.

08:57

So you got. So a lot of sense, a lot of scientists been done. Learning nurses has been done on what the on the patients that doctors had access to and that fundamentally is an issue when we look back and ask ourselves is the data that they found, that was relevant to the patients, inability to speak words.

09:22

For example, or inability to remember features of language, or inability to perceive the world in a coherent way, like maybe, like, whatever whatever the issue is, is it possible? But I want to know. It is.
