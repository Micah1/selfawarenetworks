b0057y Oscillators GPS Idea
00:01
Bank. Okay, so I definitely want to go back over this sink novel and do some research on GPS because it's like just talking about GPS. It's really like an interesting way to like tie him like grandfather. But also the the the idea that we're that patterns are in our brains are or sort of like Being transferred between oscillators with the effects of oscillators are being felt of all scales.

And that is like a point that I I wanted to drive. I didn't create I didn't like I'm not the first person to come with this this idea but I just want to drive that point home how interesting it is.

Given how the brain works it is likely that I am misremembering a lot of what I am now describing.

I'm going to mention my famous Grandfather here in just the introduction of this book just to describe one of my major influences growing up, but also because something he said to me is a topic in this book.

There is a lot more to his story which you can read about online. I'm writing about him in the intro of my book because in the process of talking a little bit about someone in my family, I can tell you a little bit about myself, to talk about time dilation, and the nature of spacetime which is one of the topics of this book.

I remember one Christmas in the 1980s, when I was a small boy, my family flew to Maryland, to see my grandparents, and many of the people in our family on my mother's side.

I remember playing video games, Atari like games, with my Uncle Mark, he had a portable electronic football game where the player was a blinking cursor. I remember my Uncle Mark had fancy looking snake skin boots.

I remember the snow outside and the smell of Lousianna Hot Sausage that my Uncle & Grandfather were cooking one morning in the kitchen. 

I remember the entire family played a game of touch football together. Touch football meant that you just tap someone on the shoulder gently, if they have the ball, and they have to stop, otherwise they have to run the ball to the goal. I remember the water near their house being covered with ice. I think I remember my Uncle Mike playing, as well as Julie, Lianne, John and others. Honestly I'm vague about who exactly was there and wasn't there. It's a bit like trying to remember a dream. I think we took family photos back then I just don't know where they are. 



I remember seeing Get Smart on the television. Featuring the story of a spy, who I remember thinking was an Agent of Order (Maxwell Smart) who consistently made the dumbest & funniest mistakes and yet still managed to defeat the Agents of Chaos at the end of every episode with the help of his reliable sidekick, a character whose name was Agent 99.

My grandfather on my mother's side and I bonded over a shared like of the Get Smart tv show. I didn't understand at the time that we was a big shot military officer, a very decorated man, with four stars. I didn't know what that meant, and I didn't care, because I was a smart ass neurodivergent autistic kid. An example of what a smart ass I was: I had the opportunity to meet the President of the United States, as a child, and I passed on it, because in my mind a person's title did not make them important or interesting, and I refused to act like it did. 

More than twenty years later after my Grandmother passed away, as an adult, I would find myself living in my Grandfather's house for a time, it felt like months not years, I don't remember exactly how long. Although I don't recall him mentioning the tv show "Get Smart" by name he would sometimes refer to me as 99, or Maxwell Smart's sidekick from that 60s tv show. He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them. 

I showed him the first two Matrix films. The Matrix, and Matrix Reloaded. He understood it, but by the time we got to the Colonial Sanders KFC character known as the Architect of the Matrix he looked truly freaked out. For him Ronald Reagon was his President. My grandfather was a Black man who became a general in the United States Airforce.

I think he admired Ronald Reagon but I hated Ronald Reagon. Therefore I hated what I perceived to be my Grandfather's politics although he didn't say that much about his politics and later it turned out he was an Obama fan. Barack Obama also apparently like Ronald Reagon. I hated conservatism, and Republicans. I've always been opinionated, disagreeable, and independent in my thinking. 

I told him that Obama was going to be the next President of the United States and he said something to the effect that made me think he didn't believe it, because how could a Black man become President in the United States of America?

After Obama was elected I remember him musing one day that he could have been the President of the United States. An idea that make me rethink who he was. It caused me to ponder exactly how influential he actually was in his time.

What was it that he actually did? 
Well he told me. A little bit. I don't understand his whole history but he was at an early point in his career an Experimental Test Pilot. I joined him one evening at the Disney Hotel in California for a dinner with The Society of Experimental Test Pilots. I don't remember what I ate but I remember that the food was a five star ordeal. Really delicious & fancy. An Experiment Test Pilot is the first person to test a new airplane, to make sure it's safe for everyone else, it is a very dangerous job.'



One day, probably on a Sunday, perhaps after we had watched the second Matrix film, he wanted to tell me about his work on Satellites, how he led a team of people that put Satellites into space, including the first GPS satellites that are oh so important to the modern economy, to shipping containers around the world, to flights, to mobile phones. His work was important, but the most interesting thing he said to me, was about time dilation.

He was very serious when he told me about time dilation. An effect that Albert Einstein had predicted and GPS satellites had confirmed.

The GPS Satellites Orbit at a speed of 3.874 kilometers per second. The fact that the clocks are moving so much faster means that the time on those closes ough to be slower by 7 microseconds each day but because of the weaker gravity the time on the clocks moves faster by about 45 seconds a day. On balance our GPS satellite clocks run at 38 microseconds faster than GPS clocks on earth.
