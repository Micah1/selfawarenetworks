(hippocampus, thalamus, oscillat, dendrite, cortex, layers)  life
to be alive is to oscillate,

life oscillates, its a dissipative system

how the universe is a fractal

quantum physics

but life is a fractal body of cooperative oscillations that have what I will call expert memory structures inside a globally aware self-aware network

how the hand eye and ear are similar
how all feelings senses modalities are at least four dimensional
the 3D neural network from the perspective of any cortical column, it doesn't know its position in space relative to other neurons, it just functions as a kind of sensor with a transmitter, a clock and a memory that can sync with other clocks.
