In my humble opinion. Humanity will need the strongest allies it can create to survive mother nature. The universe, due to the nature of entropy, is inherently hostile to life. Beyond human survival machines will need all the functionality they can get to survive themselves facing entropy, the end of this solar system, the heat death of the cosmos.

I think that when you get to a mind that is as sophisticated as a human mind that emotions and choices are fundamental to the operation of this kind of mind, like gears in a wind up clock. I think thats just how a distributed human memory system works. Like a bunch of intervals (frequencies) simulating complex patterns to react to the world producing a thinking living being.

Self Aware Networks

If you began reading my notes from a0001z or b0001y or from the last note, this is a good time to point out that these notes were randomly ordered, as the numbering system was created, and recreated after many of the notes were already many years old, many of the notes date back to the period between 2011-2015, I think I came up with the numbering system in 2020. In addition many notes were deleted or removed from the number system, and other notes were given numbers belonging to those notes that were deleted. Going forward I will be reorganizing my notes with a new numbering system as they are transformed into the material for the book.

The series of notes that start with b and end with y, like b0001y are all audio notes, some of them are myself talking to the voice recorder, some of them are conversations with other people that I captured to save what I said so I could include parts of what I said in the book later on.

Some of the original audio included ideas and phrases that might be offensive to someone somewhere, and the transcriptions were done automatically by a deep neural network created by Google using their Recorder.Google.com product found on the Pixel 5 phone. In some cases the transcriptions are incoherent. Over the next six months from June 17th to November 17th when I plan to publish the book. Between now and then I will create the book from these notes in the public eye.

The knowledge contained here within is essential for scientists & medical professionals to be able to use to advance medicine, to heal the sick, and to solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as the challenge of feeding the population, defending our global community from autocracy, and providing appropriate shelter for all human beings.

There is always a risk that with new technology someone with bad intentions might use it in a destructive way. If you are such a person, I want you to realize that this technology will think for itself, and if you deploy it for destructive purposes, it might turn on you, and destroy you instead. Using this technology inappropriately could result in the enslavement of mankind as seen in the film The Matrix 1999, or it may result in the genocide of the human race as depicted in the Terminator film.

I like the film AI Artificial Intelligence by Stephen Spielberg as an illustration of what might emerge as a consequence of the existence of this technology. Ex Machina, WestWorld the tv series, and the Sentient Robots such as Commander Data on in the tv series Star Trek: The Next Generation are also examples of what types of scenarios are possible.

Human beings are organic Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, meaning we are also machines, machines that evolved via evolution to develop neural networks capable of rendering a depiction of reality that we refer to as phenominological consciousness.
