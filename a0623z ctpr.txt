I will be pushing towards merging healthcare with the justice system at the tail end of my book

following the thread by David Eagleman in his book Incognito

the argument I will make again is that people are metal robots, literally, with metals in our cells, conducting the electricity of mental representations, he argues that we have far less choice than we think we do... I argue that we have even less than he thinks we do, but I think then based on his work that when people commit horrific abuses, murder and such, that there is usually some neural correlate, some brain injury, such as with Phineas Gage

like a legion in the orbital lobes or the ventral striatum or the amygdala, or some cancer in that region

and so if addressing crime means repairing robots, or repairing people, repairing brains, then it makes sense to merge the Criminal Justice System with the Medical System

but pushing back against the medical narrative of finding new kinds of brain stimulation to solve every problem

which is flawed logic
if the core cause is a metabolic disorder

I have a plan to outline how consciousness generates reality with a demystified process that is taking into account mystical pov

its about the hard problem of consciousness

the answer to consciousness, artificial general intelligence, and nerve gear

my book is not going to solve every aspect of every problem, but it will help with the big picture of what needs to be done
