(oscillat, array, dendrite, qualia) dendrites
He does not think about oscillations, or gamma waves as having a role in readying cells to receive and rapidly erase what they are seeing, so what I am saying is that the firing of a neuron imprints a qualia representation of reality onto the live oscillation by having that one neuron step out of the regular oscillation it makes a difference in the temporal pattern that the neurons would detect materially.

thalamocortical network, global phenonominom.

so everything that your eyes see, the collected patterns that move through layers of networked neurons, those patterns are bound into a mind space image when the dendrites flash, and the oscillating bundle of neurons takes notice and notices that flash because its the only thing not in oscillation, then it gradually merges back into oscillation, but the oscillation itself is integrating information live in consciousness.

the global workspace theory
