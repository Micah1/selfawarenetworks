Fantasy section for the end of the book that links into mythological ideas (or maybe not for the book, maybe this is just a server note that I leave out of the book, I think its cool but perhaps incidental to the book)
(oscillat)

I like to imagine that once upon a time there was an ancient doctor who deduced that the universe is a fractal oscillator from stars to atoms, and he used this intuition to develop the ability to fix and repair the human body as if it was just a clock, or a mechanical robot, but humanity wasn't ready to understand this technology, so this healer passed a dramatized message down through time by turning medicine into a mystical novelty that would tickle the human mind for centuries until some future medical professional deduced the real non-mystical origin of the original message. 

We can say that what defines any religion under the sun is that each is a collection of novel concepts that tickles the human mind for centuries and millenia, each branch of each religion has a different perspective to share that is a configuration of a set of mind expanding concepts that develop civilization.

The stories that unite us are not just stories, they are stories that contain attractors that link to transcendent or timeless oscillators that help to shape cultures across time, but interestingly if the brainwaves in the human mind represent a story, that contains attractors that drive oscillations and drive actions, and these stories working on multiple time scales as explored by Dr. Karl Friston (who does not have a PhD) then perhaps the stories of our mythologies represent attractors that drive thinking patterns on time scales that exceed human life times.

Perhaps the common story of a shared mythology is capable of driving human behaviors on ultra long time scale exceeding human lifetimes.

The good thing about new quantum gravity physics equations is that they don't take up a lot pf space in a book. They are very small and efficient equations. This is just humor I am still trying to wrap my mind around what the real scale of this new 4th section to my book is going to be.
