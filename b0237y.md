Oscillation Washboard Calories

00:00

Frame state band. It's like,

00:09

Bring state land, he's like

00:15

It's like imagine it's like imagine you wake up and you see like I never know why you say how long is it gonna take you to get to playing to stay that? And by state land is like, where you have like necessarily amount of food, you feel like you've had at least 600 calories.

00:38

You're not starving, you're not super full so good, smart calories, like protein and and omega-3 and

01:01

Yeah. Sure your Samsung insurance and taking care of yourself, working out, washing your calories.

01:20

Spending your money wisely, you're spending money wisely, or spending money, and you're spending money on.

01:35

You to increase during the work and you are finding the shortest path back to state line. So bring state land is the state that your mind is in when you are working and without doing creativity. I'm running a book. I mean maybe you listen to creativity, vibrations?

02:03

And you're taking your life therapy is to like make sure you have for their brand to talk to most state this internet music and nice headphones. He really an amazing city.

02:35

Asparagus. Like when you wake up, you wake up in your have had. It's like as if your memories were from the previous interview were wash them. Really think the fact that if

02:55

Whatever. Like it's like is it still not coming? Is like something on the washing on the washboard change, right? Okay. Other than like it's like within the washboard is decoration. I've had an average with patterns fading away, so we go back to oscillating with nothing. There. Something, is that?

03:22

And then it's sort of like just fade away like the signal, is there for a second that could deviations there but then researcher like, brush it away. I start to look at feedback into the group oscillation and so we have the group isolation dynamics happening. Now, where some group isolations?

03:46

And lives. With other group with other different group oscillations, We have two different groups of oscillations that are interacting and the could be, it could be entertaining the same speed, or a difference leads.

04:09

And it could be that they are, there's no possibility that they'll merge, maybe they're just

04:23

Because of the structure there's no possibility of a larger between the two sections. So there's like, there's always going to two sections with their sort of like like we can oscillate a different frequencies but they sort of like there isn't, there is a sort of clockwork, interaction happening sort of should have, you know, there's a relationship between the rate of one oscillation and the different rate of another large group oscillation.

05:05

It's, it's like, you have two stars that are orbiting each other but at different speeds, but they are gravitational effects affect one. Another. And so there's some interesting gravitational effects happening when you're to stars that are sort of like, within each other's gravitational effects. And so weird things that is necessarily mean that the merge maybe they're not going to my title.

05:41

No, exactly or maybe. They're going to merge eventually but not for the end of the year. Maybe they're locked in a good or better round each other for really long time and

06:05

I don't know.
