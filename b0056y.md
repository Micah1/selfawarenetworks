# 1. Summary 

The essence of your argument revolves around oscillatory patterns and their role in cognition, memory, and decision-making. You delve into how different "chambers" or oscillators represent different features or possibilities being considered. This can be likened to how the brain evaluates various scenarios and pathways, such as navigating a street and deciding the optimal course of action based on proximity and timing relative to others.

You highlight that people often process life on varying levels of awareness. Some operate consciously, analyzing potential outcomes and seeking the "best feeling" course of action, while others may traverse life without much reflection, relying on implicit routines. You touch on the mystery of the world, noting that many people lack a true understanding of its intricacies and caution against being a "know-it-all" or overly judgmental.

In terms of brain function, you propose that oscillations transmit energy across a global network, with patterns and connections constantly changing. This dynamic process enables synaptic growth between highly active neurons and explains how memory circuits can shift, involving different neural sets depending on the context. Despite variability, certain core elements may remain consistent across patterns.

Your broader idea appears to examine how oscillatory networks, memory, and consciousness interact to create our perception of possibilities, preferences, and actions in a continually evolving landscape of thoughts and experiences.

So different, different chambers reach different piano sequences. That's not right. It's different chambers, different piano sequences.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Different chambers, different piano sequences.
I was making an argument about different chambers, different piano sequences.
Okay, so different oscillators, different oscillators would have different, would represent different features that are being considered.
So if you're considering two different patterns, right, like if you're considering, okay, like, okay, so I'm in a scenario and it's a street.
Now, there's a person over here and a person over here and a person over here and a person over here and a person over here and a person over here.
And you're considering, okay, now this person's trajectory, if I go towards this person, I might actually walk close to this person.
Do I want to risk walking close to this person?
You don't want to allow them to be nearing.
And so you think, or do I want to cut a path so that either it is behind them so that I arrive at the store at a different time than they arrive at it?
Or do I want to just allow myself to be on the path that I'm on and arrive close to the same time that they're arriving?
I mean, does it even matter to me? Would I rather be in front, would I rather just get to the store faster and not worry about this?
Right, like, there's all these, like, I think, possible thoughts that someone can have.
And then that they sort of like think, oh, these are all the possible, these are all the different possible things that I could do.
But what is the thing that feels the best to me?
What's the best feeling? How is the best way to get through the next moment?
Some people are not sort of operating on this level of conscious awareness and they're not even, like, when they go through life,
they don't have a description of the sequences that they encounter and the subroutines that they encounter and the sort of mystery.
There is a sort of mystery to the world, I think, that you assumed that you're, I think when you grew up,
you assumed that the people around you understood what the world was about.
But they don't, like, regular people don't really understand what the world is about.
And really, like, you know, don't, like, don't be a know-it-all.
I'll be like, oh yeah, it's this religion or that religion.
That's just, it's annoying. So don't be a know-it-all, right?
And know-it-alls are annoying. And be like, yeah, well, you know,
you're just saying, like, it's like a comparison thing, like, yeah, it's like a...
judgment and comparison thing.
Why am I talking about this? But, well, yeah.
So the idea is that, you know, to compare two stacks of information.
So the thing is, like, okay, let's say you have a sequence.
And this sequence is a certain, like, let's say the sequence could be associated with something that your brain is tracking.
So it could be an oscillatory sequence that represents some pattern that your brain is tracking.
You know, this pattern will be, will have a pathway that basically gets...
that circulates into the brain if it's a relevant pattern.
Okay, I'm just going to leave this gone.
It's fine. I know how the fast forward button works.
Okay, let's get back into a more concrete example.
Okay, so what I'm saying is that the oscillations...
they transmit their excess energy to other oscillations, right?
It's like there's this global network where every array is connected to it, every other array is in some way.
Like, it's like the pattern of connections actually changes constantly.
Synapses grow between very active groups of neurons.
And it's interesting to think that some memories don't always, like...
they don't always, like, have the same firing pattern.
So sometimes the firing pattern will be one neural circuit with a bunch of neurons in it.
It'll be another... sometimes a different, you know, different set of neurons will be involved, right?
Like, maybe the two sets share, like, something in common, like one character in common,
but they aren't.
Thank you.
