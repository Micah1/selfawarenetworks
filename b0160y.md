Okay, so let's talk about the structure of the book. So we have and multiple scales.

00:20

To talk about the different categories. So we've got to talk about the grade-like structure of the brain.

00:32

Cameras have like, what is what's waking consciousness? But we need to talk about fractal ice with the different scales, or fractal, play that and crackle patterns. And functional functional.

00:58

Fractal. Functional and isomorphic, fractal patterns at multiple scales, nice and more functional practical isomorphism, right? Or fractal functionalized basically their fractals. But so we can talk about. Yes. So talk about the highball in the brain and but also we can talk about poor calm development and everything. All the above being like nested embedded crackles.

01:38

Another, okay. And we're going to need to talk about. What the self is in terms of being like you know it's not just the rendering but also like it's rendering this combination. It's combined association. Subcortical motor controls with the visual with the sensory input. So that combination is the key part of the development of the, the knowledge of us of self.

02:29

Because if you think about it, like, you know, from sensory since we perception that how do you make connections between what your muscular doing, and what your senses are telling you, that gives the creates this sort of, like Tracy's pattern associations between I'm certain behavior, certain motors that you're that, you're that are coming from self and certain results that are coming from sensors.

03:06

And and so combined, which you have by combining basically the motor controls with the. Since the sensory collection, the sensory data is you have the ability for the computer to connect those representations and then it's a matter of allowing quant the okay. Any deposit here because

03:49

Okay. And right, this is recording film.

04:03

Okay around. Okay. So then the point is that is that our is that a so we have basically like you know when you have when you have a narr and our you haven't not ever cursing our network but a A reinforcement learning network. So reinforcement learning is like, okay, well, what combination of which patterns are going to yield?

04:45

rewards, right? So, I'm looking for the best reward, that's where my mind is seeking is the best for the best. Rewarding combination of motor controls and most rewarding combination of motor controls. And, And athletes to produce good results. Short-term, and long-term for the

05:24

Short term, a long time for the organism. So yeah. I mean, their situations where

05:37

Anyway, so the point is that your predictions about what's likely to happen. Our quantified and multiple scales and perhaps they're quantified and ordered to determine the likely rewards or like, sorry, likely consciousness, whether those are good or bad confidence, okay? See these quantified protections and an example would be like, there's two doors, okay?

06:11

And one door beats the death and the other door leads to life, and if you don't pick a door as you'll definitely also got it. So, you've got to pick a door, can see, you're predicting that there's one door that's gonna leave in the life. And that's the door that your brain ends up picking.

06:34

Is that door? And it does this because your choice is like any sort of like stuff. That was my biggest concern and like the game theory since you're choices sort of like driven years driven by your predictions and your brains ability to predict what what, what the future. So your brain is considering many different possible features and all brands are and choice is your brain.

07:14

Selecting one of those is one of those is the teacher, that is the brightest and most appealing choosing you the brightest and most appealing path chooses you. So like, for example, like, if you know that a certain path could be rewarding on a short term but so really awful in the long term and you're predicting that you're going to be around in the long term, then you're going to have situation where you make really bachelors, but if you predict that you're only going to be around the short term, I mean, you make you make better, you make you make choices that have a greater long current value, all right.

08:10

08:42

I mean, the placement of that you might be around a lot longer than think, might create. It's kind of prediction that if you're if you're behaviors near decisions decisions are like planned future behaviors if they actually plan it's like remember she the secret remembered future beginners take your remembering what you what patterns you're going to evoke in the teacher in order to to achieve certain results.

09:15

And you're singing together many sequences of behaviors that you're total. Calculation is predictable lead to some kind of result. So you could have situations where you are doing, where the predicted result is really good result. But you're doing lots of stuff that you don't really like on the way to that.

09:40

Really good result. Because you're you've got more of your prediction is in the, the eventual goal. And so that kind of sort of like explains why, you know, you have longer term. You have organized, this making longer term investments, right? Such as building a home building, that's investing in land.

10:07

Selling crops trying seeds, that will become crops later doing work now to reap the rewards later. It's it's investment thinking. Anyway, okay, I'm gonna do the hard stuff now. It's very because reward will come later or if I did the easy stuff. Now, then it would be harder later on.

10:35

10:43

And it's not too, it's not simply the facts that it's not simply a situation that that drives what people do. It's not simply the situation. Okay. It's it's that person's it's all that person's combined experiences plus that situation, which is resulting in and whether decisions are going to be.

11:11

So so yeah. So in essence, it's a lot. It's, you know, but the point is that process. Okay, involves your brain. Making lots of predictions of teachers and comparing that to previously learned experiences that that brain has had. And in the combined calculation, you might result in a unique behavior pattern, a unique behavior pattern.

11:59

That's that's unpredictable to other human beings, but it can make sense, dynamics and behavior could be concerned. Could you please? Repeat yourself. Systematic, programmatic, calculator for decision. Making. That's based in physics and doesn't really give you require choice to be free from physics. And in a sense, we we have to ship the liabilities to from a character that the gravy character.

12:47

That is a it's soul, right? Like in a man like imagine person and she got towards it's more of us system. More of a complication system. Got it is has the system has liability within the innocence of like if the self-driving if it's still driving car has causality that then then or a robot has causality like it's intakes information and makes a decision.

13:38

Then it has light abilities. As a computational system or resource Even though that, even though physics thing that there's no choice except it from physics that it couldn't have.

14:02

It mean it couldn't have decided otherwise other than how it happened. Unless because that was the path that physics come and within. But that's not to say that that the observer machine is. Okay, let's go do this first.
