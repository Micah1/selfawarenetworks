In y0016 I describe cells in the hand as being conscious without self awareness
so there is conscious perception, and intelligence, but no self, but the feelings in the hand will compute autonomic nervous reactions, its internal representations are limited to sensory feelings or sensory distinctions without identity or other context. its an argument that living meat is base level conscious without personhood, identity, or goals
so there is intelligence like in an artificial neural network, then attention, then there is sensory awareness which is base level consciousness or perception without identity or purpose, then there are temporally persistent oscillating learning patterns that develop contextual meaning and give rise to the development of goals & a self identify

y0017 - I'm describing a thousand brains theory mostly with a blend of other ideas.

b0116y - speculation about electric soliton waves, the shape of the bouton having acoustic properties, then philosophy about thoughts being distinctions that divide the indistinct holon of reality into distinct parts, this talk seems to apply philosophy to functional anatomy & the division of throught applied to decoherence of waves in the brain, I argue that vortices are oscillations, then I try to talk about the natural selection of spacetime but its a lot of air time with little to say.

b0146y - Graziano 25 min, this is an early argument that tries to make the case for synaptic transmission being utlized for tempo-spatial phase change pattern tracking, building on Peter Tse's work and Hawkins/Predictive Coding, something about the TPJ, Observation is reporting or rendering reported to sensation or perception in a loop, observation is a loop of reporting & detection, observation is a loop of rendering & perception, observation is a state of detection frames coupled with rendered frames. Like frames of a movie, except a movie is rendered frames only, an observer is a strange loop of detection frames interlaced with rendered frames where the detection frames are updated at each interval by the rendering updates, but the updating itself is the process of detecting the next frame of the rendering of the looping observer in time, to say it another way my obervation must exist somewhere in spacetime first for me to be able to report it to someone else. The neural correlates of cognition are sufficient in detail to match the complexity of what a human being reports as their observation.

b0153y almost following up perfectly from note b0146y, but I make the argument that the sparse distributed representation of the pixels of the frames of consciousness are not creating a holographic rendering but a tomographic rendering in the minds eye, attention schema helps define a tomographic map in each oscillator that makes up part of the whole experience of consciousness. With the idea being that I can track a room full of people or a street full of cars because each entity, object, car or person is independently represented by an individual oscillating pattern, a traveling pattern

b0154y - recorded October 9th, 2021, the tectum of a frog is a good analogy for the tomographic map, I want to review Michael Graziano's discussion of the frogs tectrum again, I argue that the receptive field inside consciousness is placecell information and the map tracking content outside phenomenological consciousness is grid cell information. I return to the argument that IIT's Phi could be one part of a measurement of the resolution of the rendering inside the observer. Of course the resolution ought to be increasing over time (in a healthy brain) so the rate of growth to the brains neural network may require an observation or tracking of minute changes to the synapses & dendrites & braincells. The tectum illustration of attention schema allows the neuron the fired, that inhibits its neighbors to set the sensory trajectory of movement, when a neuron fires it is determining the sensory pattern that your brain is attending to at some low level, a sequence or sharpwave ripple is a sequence or a sort of collapsing neural pathway that defines a MPRS memory prediction rendering sequence. Your brain is capable of rendering a lot of different patterns but the neuron that fires first in an oscillatory is the one that closest resembles the incoming sensory pattern, and the next neuron that fires is the one that closest resembles the part of the sequence, in this way old learned patterns can be triggered in a novel order, a nonlinear activation each part of a sharp wave ripple, that
