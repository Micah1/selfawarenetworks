You can see this study today, but some of the conclusions about calcium & vesicles are already in my work
# New findings reveal how neurons build and maintain their capacity to communicate
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-07-reveal-neurons-capacity.html?fbclid=IwAR3KKI3b8MJ2g3_a6Ib81-NOZ1pJJZMEzbd7ZDjAtT-8FAzR10_ZJmQYcAc but the @StateDept @DeptofDefense won't listen to me! My work already documents the relationship between calcium & vesicles BEFORE this study came out

(audio) Milliseconds Neuron Calcium

00:00

So we're talking about like a spike being a millisecond. A millisecond between. Like in terms of the spike, whether it's bike seconds milliseconds is a huge difference of a spike last, you know from half a millisecond to point seven milliseconds to one point five milliseconds to two milliseconds, that's a huge difference.

00:26

We're talking about ten milliseconds we're talking about like the full time it takes to reset the cell back to it's through the starting point.

00:40

Ten milliseconds is the whole process after the cell went back down that's like after so you have the the sodium creates the positive way and positive spike the casting increase the the negative energy that brings the cell back down to below where it started. Hyperpolarized. So 10 seconds is the whole 10 milliseconds as a whole time window.

01:12

So so from point five to. I guess as much as to milliseconds we're talking about just the time when the cell is very positive, that's when the calcium will be let in. So what we're talking about is the length of time themselves positive is going to determine how much calcium gets let in.

01:33

So if the calcium is so if the if the positives if so if k is modified so that its delayed so that it takes longer for the negative to start or if it's like basically like yeah, so it's like the idea is that. If the calcium if there's more time for the positive charge the spike last longer if the spike is slowed down then that means that there's more calcium that's going to be released and that's going to bind to the synaptic tagline.

02:07

So by messing with the cage channels, you're changing the shape of the spike in terms of like it's going to go from you know, a spike that takes a second to point seven to a full millisecond to one point five milliseconds to two milliseconds, you're changing the shape of that positive spike.

02:29

I'm. Messing with k channels because the k channels are gonna come on later or or sooner but they're gonna change and that's gonna change the duration of the spike and the duration of this bike I'm guessing is as part of the shape of the spike it's gonna yeah it's gonna determine the beginning and endpoint of the spikes, so that's the arc of this bike and and then so you have to like I think yeah, I guess you have to say that the, Timing of despite is the amplitude despite so there's a time of despite but then there's also the amplitude which is I guess the amateur could be how much energy is being released at once or maybe it's fixed maybe it's a fixed amount of energy per climate so the time interval itself determines the amplitude of this spike and so the amplitude would have all in that case the amplitude of despite.

03:35

Of this shape because it translates because we're translating one to one if it's always the same amount of voltage or time interval. Then the the time interval would contain the the amplitude information and then contain the shape information but if not then if the voltage can vary the voltage rate can vary so you can have more amplitude or less amplitude in the same time window let's say it's like open for one millisecond exactly if you could have one millisecond but you could have higher voltage during that one millisecond, so that's but the point is that if it's open for longer then you can have more cows.

04:23

Here that is going to bind.

04:29

But we're talking about spreading this spreading the spike of the shape of the spike so the shape of the spec is going to be more spread out by time it's going to be spread out by time so the shape is relative is it's we're spreading out the shape by spreading out the the duration of how long it's going to take for the spike to happen.

04:50

But that allows for enough time so it's not just one vegetable that gets released but it's like all of them get released over that that much time so you're gonna have between zero one two or three best, of course. I guess it could be as many as four but you know the average number of vesicles is two point six, but it's like zero one two, or three maybe two vehicles, maybe maybe three if it has three vesicles and so if you have a longer spike, maybe you have a two vesicle spike.

05:22

Because you have enough calcium that comes in that opens the opens enough channels. And that you're only gonna have cat enough calcium to come in if the channels are open for a longer which is why variations in the amount of potassium open the channels open the delays in the in the start of when potassium starts to bring us back down means that the spike glass longer the spike last longer it means more calcium or calcium binds that means that the channels are open longer, which means that the, The the spike last longer and the that is the spike last longer then that means that more vesicles will be released so that's the cause so if you have time maybe no vesicles would be released maybe one vesicle if it's longer maybe one velocity if it's longer than that then maybe two vesicles.

06:35

Get released positive spike or all that for vesicles to be released but that a lot but then what happens is they're brain is going to basically like if more vesicles get released then there's more neurotransmitters that are released and that means that that cells that would not otherwise have received neurotransmitters.

07:07

From this from this neuronic transmitters, so if you can imagine that the radius of what of of cells that that are perceiving our transmitters from that one cell like the radius is a lot larger so the network itself is going to register a larger event in terms of more neurons affected by by larger by the longer so if there's a longer action potential.

07:41

Greater number of neurons are going to be aware to be detected. That they're receiving neurotransmitters, it's an event that affects the network in a larger way, so the network would be aware of a larger release there would be more notable it would be a louder. I don't know maybe I'll go over here for a second.

08:05

And. Yeah.

08:17

So it is the calcium channels that are opening for longer.

08:28

The calcium channels open for longer and that causes more of the vessel to be released.

08:42

So before the action potential let's zoom in to the very tip of the accent terminal. The very tip of the the axon is just sitting there, what's called the dock state. So you have this festival inside the membrane? It's right up against the the membrane and think of two oil droplets.

09:00

So if the two oil droplets touch are going to come together and one and make one bigger oil droplet. So you've got two oil droplets, and if they come together, they're going to make a bigger oil droplet. So the droplet holds the neurotransmitter. The thing that allows the oil droplet.

09:17

To get enough force to be pushed into the membrane molecule. And that's synaptotmen linker. Think of it like a linker.

09:37

But there's other other names in there that are being skipped. This is just a short version to make it more comprehensive, but the synaptic molecule. Doesn't do its job until calcium reaches it and the calcium has to come from outside itself.

09:59

So there's very little calcium inside the cell and so that calcium channel has to open. So that the calcium comes from outside the cell goes inside the cell and reaches that's enough to attack and releases the the oil sacks which are the the. The vesicles.

10:30

That duration. Is usually like a split no second or less. Only allows enough. To come into release like one vesicle. It's usually just enough to release one from the docking site. If you let that channel open long enough it would just keep doing it and it would release a bunch from the same site.

11:03

Every vesicle has a roughly 2,000 neurotransmitters. So if those things float up into the synapse. And they bind to things you know, predominantly the receptor on the other cell. But if you release five times that amount so instead of two thousand you're getting ten thousand. The lateral spread is going to increase to the point where receptors very far lateral which it would have never used without.

11:36

That far before because there's now 10,000 of them instead of 2,000 now, they're diffusing further and further laterally your activating receptors that probably weren't getting activated the normal cases and that's what you're talking about. Yeah, so.

11:59

So if the action potentials open longer the calcium channels are open longer more calcium binds to this anaptic tag man, which causes more vesicles which are like a well-dropus to be released. So maybe the regular neural activity is one vesicle gets released, but now you're releasing a bunch more maybe it's it's a two or three vessels or getting to these.

12:25

And so, they're being pushed out by the snap to tag. It's a force that's pushing this well dropless the oil droplets are merging. And let's say that every one of these oil droplets are vesicles has two thousand which you have now instead of two thousand being released you have 10,000 being released.

12:47

Well, we're talking about like, you know twice as much three times as much but one two or three so it's so so four thousand six thousand but then there's like, Yeah, maybe maybe there's 6,000 maybe there's 12 maybe in a small area now instead of the usual 2004,000, you know, there's multiple sites there now there's 6,000 to 12,000 with the point is that whether they're 6,000 or 12,000 neurotransmitters these things are now floating and normally they would hit some of the receptors on the other side, but if there's if there's 5 times that amount or if there's twice.

13:33

The amount you're going to the lateral spread of these of these neurotransmitter droplets is going to increase to the point where you have receptors that would have never diffuse because they because they're going to be. Diffused further because the spread of the neurotransmitter is going to be flattery it's going to affect receptors that normally wouldn't be reached.

14:02

They're going to be receiving these neurotransmitters and so in that case. So the idea in machine learning is that every neuron has a connection every neuron already.

14:33

For artificial neural networks, we're talking about instead of a neuron talking to all neurons above it what would happen is that a neurons would enter on transmitters so. I neurotransmitter base so that's like it's like saying that maybe it would maybe it's okay, so maybe it's connected to all neurons but not all receptors right so not all receptors on there and so so what we're saying is like yeah, we're gonna disperse a signal to all neurons.

15:21

That are connected but not all neurotrans not all receptors of all neurons, so if we have if they're not has a longer. Spike than what happens is we can you can transmit spatial information by activating more receptors on each of the downstream neurons or we could have a situation where.

15:48

We're purposely eliminating the number of neurons that each neuron reaches and we're limiting by scales so we could say like yeah, this is like the receptor effect right but so that'd be like yeah each neuron has multiple receptors and so you could have it a situation where. Each neuron has four connections to each other and see they're gonna activate zero or three like yeah six zero, it's either gonna activate one, two, three, or four of those connections to the upstream neuron.

16:31

Right, so it's gonna. Scoring two so it's already gonna save one it's a usern has three connections it's either gonna activate one two, or three.

16:46

So that's the idea of the artificial neuron is it's going to convey information by attack by a by touching that same neuron three times instead of in one instance three times in one instance. Because so it can so yeah so that's patient information so it's like yeah, we have a frequency information frequency is like I can tap you three times.

17:16

Or I can tap you. One time or three places. Right, so you're conveying or I can tap you two times and I can tap you into places at one time. Or I can tap you.

17:39

In two places at one time and three places at one time and one place at one time in no place at one time and then in two places. And so I can send a spatial I can encode spatial patterns. Abong the frequency patterns I can code space patterns on the frequency patterns.

18:00

And so I can be like, okay, I'm gonna send you a two and I send you a one. I'm gonna send you a two. I'm gonna send you a three. I'm gonna send you a zero three. We're gonna send you a two. I'm gonna send you a one. We're gonna send you two one three to zero two two zero one, two, three three, one, two, one three.

18:23

I'm gonna send you a spatial pattern with every with every frequency pad. So, it's like you get a frequency pattern. We get a frequency get a special pattern. You gotta okay we see this thing it's not us. This is the frequency pattern can also have an opportunity. So you can have basically the temple spatial and a face.

18:47

So you can have I'm gonna send you a load too. I'm gonna send you a high too. I'm gonna send you a high three. I'm gonna send you a low three, right? So you have all these phases where you can send so it's not just a two. It's a rough two.

19:02

It's a rough two. It's a soft two. To soften to rest here to soften right that's a fader for me. I'm gonna send you a heart three a heart three like three fingers touch me two fingers, touch me three fingers touching you hard two fingers touching you soft three fingers touching soft tooth fingers, touching your heart three fingers, touching your heart one finger touching you sauce.

19:31

No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.

19:55

What's interesting is that is that in the book? On intelligence, he talks a lot about how there's their temple patterns and there are frequency patterns. And. It's really a really there's three types of temporal there's frequencies and there's phase. Pair and the thing is like, okay, so. The reason those are different is because I'm sorry no this.

20:29

I'm sorry it's. So actually so there aren't so there's temple other frequency but those can be converted into like you can have a wave light that can convey combine frequency so it's actually there's temple there's spatial where you're checking stations, okay, you can you could decode space your information as frequency information you could okay, but the problem is that.

20:55

That you're. Taking something that is you're convert your converting. Right so anyway, so you have your phase information so basically yes, so you have so if you have a frequency a frequency could encode beats like binary beats and you could. Decode spatial information from frequency information, right but. You're still losing a lot so I'm talking about it's like yeah this but here's the thing say so you're you're.

21:39

But the point is that the the the neuron is transmitting.

21:46

It's transmitted okay, so but here's but here's the real question okay, so is the,

21:56

Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.

22:26

And the more power comes in. Synaptic tag man is forcing out the oil so that can be an indicator of force or pressure so maybe yes so maybe the your because there is actually there's actual force happening and the force could be registered by pushing the neuron the vesicles.

22:50

So there's a force that's pushing vessels and that force is going to be like,

23:01

Altitude because more of the network is going to be activated so more of the network is going to be changed and that change is the accounting of the the change of the. Network registering. The vesicles. Is going to account for the change in the course. Of the release of the vesicles.

23:30

So it's the the so the change in the quant in the. And the amount of k is going to affect the time. So time is being the time that. So there's there's a time duration and the time so the so you have time that's being converted into force. But the time is being converted into force from a force.

23:59

So you have a force which is if you're the force which is the potassium, right? But that's changing the the time and then the time is changing another horse is changing into time and that's changing into another force and then. Which is being which is being registered as.

24:39

Okay so what I learned earlier in this call which is interesting that I sort of blushed over when I was talking with that he was saying that you have the sodium releases this positive sodium when it gets starts getting released releases a positive charge and then the potassium is a negative charge, but the potassium is too much passing against these.

24:58

It creates a hyper-polarization with it where the neuron is more negative than when it began. So if the neuron is more negative than when it began that sort of matches the idea that hey well the same neuron of the same group of neurons. Could fire could be more likely to fire again because they are at a lower negative and that's going that you know, like the like the that may attract a future signal like this because it's negative that's going to change that might change.

25:29

It might attract as a future signal even faster because of it because it fires.
