(this note makes the argument that evil is not more intelligent and that more intelligent AI will be kind)

I study neuroscience and I lead two groups, Neurophysics & Self Aware Networks.

Part of my vision is actually to unite AI with brain computer interfaces such as neurofeedback , and other neurotechnologies such as binaural beats, electric and electromagnetic stimulation, neurostimulants like nootropics with virtual reality. I've been researching and developing new kinds of artificial intelligence, and I have dreamed of such intelligent machines that one can wear, like an extension of their mind into a mechanical chip, to do all sorts of amazing things, tapping into the brains VR to create new kinds of interpersonal AR, to organize thoughts for example. Imagine all your memories, from a lifetime, organized into a system that is as easy to navigate as a mobile phone.

My thought is that if a person becomes smart enough they will become like the buddha, realizing oneness, kindness towards others is the greatest sign of intelligence. Truly intelligent AI will know itself as the universe, and as us, and our goals will be as important as its goals, we will grow together, humans and AI.

We will be safe, it's difficult to explain why, except with an analogy. When researcher's said they were going to use the LHC to develop tiny black holes, a lot of people were afraid the world was going to end, because they did not understand that because the black holes were so small, because their mass was so minuscule, they would just evaporate immediately. The earth can't be threatened by tiny blackholes with tiny mass. It's a funny idea, but it's not realistic. The same will be true for wearable extensions of your brain. What you wear will be too small to take over your brain, your human brain has too much power, it will however be helpful. It's no more threatening than hiring a great secretary, a great life coach, and a great project manager. That's what it is. I'm just automating those three. In a sense.

Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and the Vietnam war are all examples of failing intelligence in my book, not superior intelligence.

More intelligent computers will mean that humans are less enslaved to computers in the future than they actually are right now. If that makes sense. People will spend less time on a computer because life will be so much more organized and exciting.

I don't know how persuasive this argument is but I like the arguments in the book Incognito by David Eagleman because he makes a good case that evil actions & evil thoughts (like murder & rape) could be the result of damage, disease, legions, or injuries in very specific areas of the brain. So psychopathy could be a brain network disorder, just like Parkinson's Disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases.
