Title: Paul King and Nick Dendrite Neuron Receptors

[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  So, I couldn't provide a good answer for that, but I would be curious to know what the answer is myself.

[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  Okay, so let me, if you want you can hang out and I'll ping some more people.

[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  Let's see if we can find someone who wants to tackle this.

[00:20.000 --> 00:33.000]  And by the way, if you know anybody who you think might be able to answer this question, let's go ahead and get them in the room.

[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  Neuroscientists especially.

[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  Yep.

[00:40.000 --> 00:56.000]  So, let me see if I can...

[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Okay, so we got someone just joined the room.

[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  Let me bring you up to the stage, okay, so you can talk.

[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  Hansen, invite to speak.

[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  And...

[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  Hey, me.

[01:13.000 --> 01:14.000]  Hey, welcome.

[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  Hi.

[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Hey, Hansen.

[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  Hey, pet.

[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  So, yeah, so this is just focusing on the basics.

[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  Can neurons detect patterns?

[01:29.000 --> 01:44.000]  And it seems like that should be an essential thing, but I think there is also some debate about whether neurons are detecting patterns and if so, how are they detecting patterns and how are they transmitting patterns, so...

[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  Do you mean...

[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  Do you mean the kind of artificial...

[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  I suppose you're talking about the biological neurons, right?

[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Yes, I'm talking about biological neurons, so...

[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  And are they in vivo in the brain or are they isolated in kind of a petri dish?

[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  Under what?

[02:17.000 --> 02:29.000]  So, I mean, the conditions should be invariant, but I'm thinking about how neurons in a brain detect patterns.

[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  So, let me invite Kyle up, who just arrived.

[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  And welcome, Kyle.

[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  Hey, Michael.

[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  Hey, Hansen.

[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  Hi, Kyle.

[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  So, Hansen asked, are we talking about neurons in vivo or in the brain or artificial neurons?

[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  I'm thinking about real neurons in a brain, a functioning brain.

[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  It could be a mouse brain.

[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  I'm actually thinking about a human brain specifically because human brains are a little bit different.

[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  And I'm wondering if a neuron...

[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  How a neuron can detect a pattern?

[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  If it's detecting a pattern, I think there's some debate.

[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  So, some people think that neurons, they're just going to fire if they receive enough input.

[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  But that's not exactly the same as detecting a pattern, is it?

[03:26.000 --> 03:43.000]  Because in order to detect an information pattern, like an actual pattern, it has to be able to not fire when something that's not a specific pattern.

[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  So, if you just overload the neuron and it just fires every time it gets overloaded, that's not pattern detection, right?

[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  You have to be able to throw out.

[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  It depends on...

[03:57.000 --> 04:09.000]  Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on how you define a pattern and then the complexity of patterns.

[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  So, even a single neuron intrinsically, it does detect a pattern.

[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  If you just think...

[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  The neuron, you have electric stimulation potential.

[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  Just like you said, there's a fire. A firing has a threshold.

[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  And so, the threshold itself is a pattern.

[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  So, anything that's below the threshold, it won't fire, above the threshold, it's firing.

[04:44.000 --> 04:52.000]  So, it's a function of the stimulation or charge or potential.

[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  So, that is a pattern.

[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  So, I suppose that that's not...

[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  Like a single neuron can basically react to that pattern.

[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  But I guess you're thinking of something more complex.

[05:09.000 --> 05:17.000]  But then the question just begs the question, what kind of complexity...

[05:17.000 --> 05:25.000]  So, what I'm saying is, okay, let's say that if we take what you said is exactly correct,

[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  that when a neuron fires, that is a pattern, okay?

[05:30.000 --> 05:37.000]  But the thing is, you'd have to have a detector at some other level that's going to detect...

[05:37.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's like if a tree fires in the forest and nobody's listening to it...

[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's listening, did it actually make a sound?

[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  And that's the sort of thing...

[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  So, your question is...

[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  Well, let me continue to phrase this.

[05:56.000 --> 06:06.000]  So, the thing is, if there is nothing on the receiving end that's detecting whether this neuron has fired or not,

[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  then it may as well not have fired.

[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  So, the thing is, we need to be able to say that can a neuron detect a specific pattern?

[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  That's not just being overwhelmed by data, but can it actually detect a specific pattern?

[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  To know whether some other neuron has fired or not?

[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  To know whether other neurons have fired or not specifically?

[06:28.000 --> 06:42.000]  There's also this thing of Hebean learning where you have connections that are strengthening between two or more neurons when they fire.

[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  But how is that happening?

[06:47.000 --> 06:57.000]  Because when a neuron fires, it's supposedly all the upstream neurons are going to receive a signal.

[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  So, are all of those upstream neurons...

[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  Are the connections between all the upstream neurons strengthened when that one neuron fires?

[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  And...

[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  Well, I mean, okay, so I just...

[07:11.000 --> 07:21.000]  Yeah, you do have to formulate the question more clearly, I suppose.

[07:21.000 --> 07:36.000]  So, the question is not really a neuron can detect a pattern, but I suppose you want to have, let's say...

[07:36.000 --> 07:45.000]  I mean, the highest level question is you're just trying to ask whether...

[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  I hate to use the word consciousness, but for lack of a better word, I would just borrow that.

[07:53.000 --> 08:02.000]  Whether you're conscious of the pattern and how that gets there, but of course, I mean, I understand.

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  Even if you want to ask the question, that's a too high level question.

[08:08.000 --> 08:20.000]  You want to maybe bring it down to a simpler level, but not so simple as to whether one, two, three neuron detect a pattern,

[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  which we can definitely answer in the affirmative, but somewhere in between.

[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  So, is that a correct characterization of what the question should be asked?

[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  So, I'm not going all the way to whether information is conscious or not.

[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  I think that is a separate question.

[08:43.000 --> 08:51.000]  Yeah, no, no. Do you see my question? I mean, this is the first part and second part, so I'm asking...

[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  I'm framing the question as the high end, low end, and I'm just trying to ask you,

[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  those two are not the question you want to ask you, you want to ask something in between, probably closer to the low end.

[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  Am I making sense?

[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  Yeah, so I'm talking about real low end pattern detection.

[09:14.000 --> 09:34.000]  Okay, so that's the difficult part. How do we frame this question?

[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  So, we know from a single neuron, it definitely detects a pattern, but that's not you're asking.

[09:44.000 --> 09:56.000]  So, you're asking, like, two layer or something like that, how they, or do they or how they detect a pattern?

[09:56.000 --> 10:10.000]  Is that the question? And then also the other thing is how do we, how do an observer determine how,

[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  whether this group of neurons has detected a pattern? Is that a good frame of the question?

[10:18.000 --> 10:28.000]  I don't know, like, I guess you're coming from a, I see, so we need like a frame,

[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  like somehow I have to bridge what I'm thinking to what you're thinking, because you're in a different place.

[10:36.000 --> 10:49.000]  And so, what I'm thinking is that, you know, we have, in the context of like, you have neurons that are predicting that they're going to fire, right?

[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  Neurons are predicting that they're going to fire.

[10:55.000 --> 11:12.000]  And they do that because they do that with the help of, there's actually, there's a process where the dendrites will fire before the action potential fires.

[11:12.000 --> 11:32.000]  And then before the dendrite fires, there's actually the receptors, there's actually some sort of activity happening in the receptors that precedes even the dendrite firing.

[11:32.000 --> 11:51.000]  So the connections will have, it'll be activity in the connections. I want to say, is it, let me see, like a spike in the synapse.

[11:51.000 --> 12:01.000]  Let me see if I can have it in my keyboard. I'm writing, I'm sort of like writing, I'm trying to write, but I think my keyboard,

[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  what are you writing?

[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  A spike in the synapse.

[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  Are you typing it into your bio or something to show us?

[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  I'm just typing into a notepad. Did you want me to type into my bio?

[12:21.000 --> 12:36.000]  I don't know what tools you're using and I'm not sure you're typing into something that we can see or you're typing into some other purposes while talking to us.

[12:36.000 --> 12:54.000]  So the only purpose is for me to sort of visualize what I'm saying so that I can sort of have like, so I can refer to some notes while I'm talking.

[12:54.000 --> 13:08.000]  So, can I ask a question? Hanson, this is, I would say, your work Micah. Dendrites are all throughout the folds of the brain, correct?

[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  And they are created while we are alive, yes.

[13:13.000 --> 13:29.000]  Dendrites are part of every neuron and they make up the bulk of brain tissue. They're very large.

[13:29.000 --> 13:45.000]  Yeah, so when you have the neurons facing, so there's space in between the connections, but those connections are set up to receive the data.

[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'm just going to say data, but just signal, right?

[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  This is coming from like a layman's terms.

[13:52.000 --> 14:05.000]  Well, for the for the most part, what's traveling between synapses are neurotransmitters or just particles.

[14:05.000 --> 14:20.000]  Yeah, but the patterns could be like, so there's still waves and gravity going through us and all this other crap, do you think, I mean, there could be patterns in that, right?

[14:20.000 --> 14:32.000]  Yes, I mean, yes, there are brain waves traveling through the brain.

[14:32.000 --> 14:57.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, when we get down to this ground level, and I think part of it is if you have a lot of caffeine, you get down to this ground level where we're talking about these really, I just feel a little bit spacey when you get down to these like raw details, like, okay, so how do we think about this now?

[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  We've got brain waves, right?

[15:02.000 --> 15:12.000]  The thing is, I mean, when you say prediction, I know that I'm not clear what do you mean by prediction because you have to have, there's a signal traveling.

[15:12.000 --> 15:39.000]  So a signal has to be material signal, and what do you mean by brain wave? There's, you know, the energy transportation, I mean, the neurotransmitters are basically the carrier of the energy

[15:39.000 --> 15:48.000]  and then transmitting from the chemical, with the chemical potential, from one end to the other.

[15:48.000 --> 16:01.000]  And then within the neuron, it transmits through the electric potential, so you have to have some kind of physical process to go,

[16:01.000 --> 16:16.000]  but when you say prediction, predict, what does that mean? Do you have to have a signal before it predicts, I mean, before it predicts, I mean, simply you cannot, I mean, you can say maybe it's in preparation or something,

[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  but there has to be a signal, meaning a physical process that triggers it.

[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Right, right, so we're talking, and by the way, welcome to Paul.

[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  Hey Paul.

[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Hey Paul.

[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  Yeah, thanks.

[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  So the topic sounds interesting.

[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  Curious where the discussion is at.

[16:35.000 --> 16:46.000]  So it's about how neurons can detect information or how neurons can detect patterns and distinguish those patterns from noise.

[16:46.000 --> 17:09.000]  I think that there are some people who, maybe they work with neurons and they know they can cause any neuron to fire by overloading it with an electrical stimulus and by overloading its inputs or another kind of stimulus.

[17:09.000 --> 17:33.000]  But the idea is, what I'm trying to get at is how a neuron that is, in terms of biology, is able to detect a, is able to basically be set up to detect a certain kinds of patterns and to disregard patterns that are not the patterns that it's looking for.

[17:33.000 --> 17:43.000]  Like a neuron, the idea is that a neuron could be a specific pattern detector or a specific information detector.

[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  Sure.

[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  So the question is how would a neuron do that?

[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  Yeah, how would a neuron do that?

[17:49.000 --> 17:57.000]  And how would a neuron basically throw out the patterns that it's not looking for?

[17:57.000 --> 18:04.000]  Well, I guess I think of a neuron is basically a little bit like the jury in a courtroom that's weighing the evidence for and against.

[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  And the evidence for comes in the form of excitatory inputs from other neurons.

[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  And the evidence against comes in the form of inhibitory inputs from inhibitory neurons.

[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  And so it's weighing the balance of the evidence for and against.

[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  And if it leans towards for, then it fires.

[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  So I think that's one way of thinking about it.

[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  It's also an event-based detector, so it's not, you know, the spike rate models can get a little bit misleading, I think,

[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  but basically the evidence has to come in within maybe a five millisecond window.

[18:33.000 --> 18:43.000]  And if it's enough to tip it over the threshold and it says, hey, this thing that I'm supposed to be looking for happened just now, you know, just a few milliseconds ago.

[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  So I think that's the core framework.

[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  And then there's a lot of ways in which dendrites can add a lot of sophistication to that analysis.

[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  For example, branches of the dendritic tree can do sub-sub-computations and do sort of an intermediate sub-detection.

[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  And if enough of those branches agree, then that rolls up into the kind of an escalated cell-level detection.

[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  That's one thing in there.

[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  There's also, you know, spontaneous firing, which adds some complexity.

[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  And anyway, that's the starting point, I think.

[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  That's it.

[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  Okay, sounds great.

[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  But I, okay.

[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  But that's not quite getting what you're after.

[19:26.000 --> 19:40.000]  No, well, I mean, what you're saying I think is true, but I'm just like, I'm thinking, well, what if you had a lot of excitatory firing that represented a pattern that was not what the neuron was looking for,

[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  like it was not what the dendritic tree set up to look for.

[19:43.000 --> 19:58.000]  And would a neuron be able to, like, distinguish between a lot of excitatory firing that was not what it was looking for versus a lot of excitatory firing that is what it was looking for?

[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  And so that's sort of like, is there a way for a dendrite to distinguish between two kinds of excitatory firing to fire only when it sees the kind of excitatory firing

[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  that actually matches the pattern that it's set to look for?

[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  Right.

[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  So I guess it seems like there are two ways that could happen.

[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  One is the inhibitory inputs could just suppress stuff.

[20:21.000 --> 20:30.000]  So some other part of the network knows that a certain thing has been found that's in contradiction with what this other neuron might be looking for in an ambiguous situation.

[20:30.000 --> 20:38.000]  They can use the inhibitory projections on the other neuron to suppress all the other neurons that have what's been determined.

[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  And therefore suppress that activity.

[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  That seems like one way that it could happen or at the level of the network.

[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  I don't know if that's kind of what you're thinking of.

[20:49.000 --> 20:57.000]  So that would be an example of many neurons working together to detect patterns.

[20:57.000 --> 21:12.000]  But within like, so what I've been sold on is the idea that our dendrites themselves are like little computers that are able to do some...

[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  By implication that means a dendrite is a little information processor by itself.

[21:16.000 --> 21:44.000]  So is a dendrite able to by itself detect patterns, distinguish between two different kinds of excitatory patterns and inhibit itself from firing without a multi-cell inhibitory process?

[21:44.000 --> 21:52.000]  Is there an internal inhibitory process for that dendrite?

[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  I mean, it seems like a tricky thing about thinking about individual neurons is that each neuron really has limited information.

[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  You know, 10,000 inputs might sound like a lot, but that's out of 30 billion cells in the cortex.

[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  And so it only has a limited amount of information to go on.

[22:07.000 --> 22:15.000]  And as a classifier, you know, to either sort of spike or not spike, it's probably confronted with mostly ambiguous information most of the time.

[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  And that ambiguous information might just slightly tilt one way or slightly tilt another, but it doesn't know for sure.

[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  It's making an educated guess, if you will.

[22:23.000 --> 22:33.000]  And it's only what all the neurons do together and interpolating across all these educated guesses and ruling out things with inhibition that the network as a whole is able to reach a conclusion.

[22:33.000 --> 22:44.000]  You know, partly through, let's say, winner-take-all competition to sort of see where the most salient evidence, where the preponderance of evidence is going to reach a network level decision.

[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  And I'm not sure that neuron is really deciding or detecting anything.

[22:50.000 --> 23:07.000]  I feel like the neuron is mostly saying what's happening currently is more likely than not, possibly in this sort of zone that I've sort of over time evolved to be sensitive for, but the neuron doesn't know what it means, and it's wrong most of the time.

[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  But only when added to the network signal do you get a reliable output.

[23:14.000 --> 23:21.000]  So I guess you're hoping that it looks like you're looking for quite a bit of agency in the neuron, and I don't know if an individual neuron has that much agency.

[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  Yeah, yeah, that is actually the question.

[23:23.000 --> 23:37.000]  So I'm actually trying to sort of openly explore the granularity of the agency of a neuron and the deepness of the pattern detection capability and pattern.

[23:37.000 --> 23:58.000]  So I do understand the sort of multi-cell idea that you're describing, and that's really great, but let me explain myself for a second.

[23:58.000 --> 24:06.000]  Okay, yeah, so other people are making lots of noise, and I just wanted to meet myself for a second.

[24:06.000 --> 24:35.000]  So what I was reading very recently was this book by Peter, his last name is TSE, and his book is about the criteria causation, or how neurons detect patterns, and they can kind of be reset.

[24:35.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I think that his book, while it's very interesting, is coming into conflict with a lot of other researchers who are at the state-of-the-art examining the amount of detail.

[24:50.000 --> 25:03.000]  And so there's a lot of people who are saying, well, the dendritus is capable of powerful computation, by itself it's a neural network, but what exactly does that mean?

[25:03.000 --> 25:14.000]  Some people want to reduce the neuron to what the neuron is doing is very simple, and some people want to say, well, it's very complex, but what is the actual degree of granularity of processing that's happening?

[25:14.000 --> 25:25.000]  And I think we're getting statements all over the place, we're getting people who are saying, well, no, actually it's going to be the recognition of any kind of data or any kind of patterns that's going to happen at the multicell level,

[25:25.000 --> 25:44.000]  maybe at the minimal neural circuit for what information is going to be detected is going to be, at least, it's going to be represented by some neural oscillation that's like 20 million neurons or something, right?

[25:44.000 --> 25:57.000]  And then someone else is going to say that, well, the minimum pattern detection is going to be a micro column or a column of cells, that's where a pattern is going to be detected.

[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  And some people are going to say, well, no, a single neuron can detect a pattern, we've got the Jennifer Aniston neuron, right?

[26:04.000 --> 26:15.000]  And so that's only going to fire when Jennifer Aniston is detected, but is that, let me invite these people who just arrived up, so Daniel and Nick, I'll invite them.

[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  And so the question is, what was the name of that author, by the way, that you mentioned in the book?

[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  Peter, and his last name is TSE, so Peter.

[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  The name of the book is The Neural Basis of Free Will, Criterial Causation.

[26:31.000 --> 26:44.000]  And he's making an argument that a single neuron is an information pattern detector that can, and what that means is it's not just firing when its inputs are overloaded.

[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  It's not just firing at the response to an excitatory blast from downstream neurons.

[26:51.000 --> 26:58.000]  It is distinguishing between two different types of excitatory firing that are downstream.

[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  One is an excitatory firing that contains the information pattern that it is set to look for.

[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  And the other is self-inhibiting.

[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  The dendrite is going to self-inhibit when it sees an excitatory firing that is not what it's looking for.

[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  So he's arguing that-

[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  Right, but how would it know that it's not what it's looking for?

[27:21.000 --> 27:32.000]  Well, so the idea is that it's going to reset its weights on the dendritic branches somehow,

[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  and so that it's going to change the NDMA receptors.

[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  So it's only going to receive signals within a certain millisecond range,

[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  and that range is going to change depending on what it's set to look for.

[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  And there's other properties of the cell that are going to change so that it's only going to respond to certain patterns,

[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  and it's going to somehow inhibit or throw out patterns that are not what it's looking for.

[27:59.000 --> 28:07.000]  So it's going to do like a micro-computation recognition that is sort of like a single cell fractal

[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  of what the multi-cell pattern recognition is doing, perhaps.

[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  And like I said, you talk to different people and different researchers in different areas,

[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  and you're going to get different answers in terms of the granularity of pattern recognition,

[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  whether it's single cell or multi-cell.

[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  And so I'm just sort of like open-minded about exploring what the answers could be here.

[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  Well, I think there's a point that most folks would agree on.

[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  I think sometimes when people tell a story, they pick sort of one kind of extreme end,

[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  like the enteric nervous system, for example, the nervous system of the gut, the people who talk,

[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  as if it's like a parallel source of agency that's competing for control of the body with the brain,

[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  whereas it's just something specialized for the gut.

[28:50.000 --> 28:59.000]  And so everyone knows that a neuron as just like a single compartment that sort of sums up some inputs

[28:59.000 --> 29:05.000]  and then fires based on a threshold is oversimplified and that there's a lot more complexity going on.

[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  There's a lot of state that the neuron can have measured in internal calcium concentration,

[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  also a concentration of something called CAMP, cyclic AMP,

[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  which is what all the neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine,

[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  they sort of modulate the CAMP, which then controls the neuron's behavior

[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  over like a 20 or 50 millisecond time frame, kind of to sort of tweak and tune the neuron.

[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  And then calcium concentrations in the dendritic branches or even in the spines,

[29:35.000 --> 29:40.000]  which is like a little micro branch with just a few synapses on it,

[29:40.000 --> 29:47.000]  can have their own local calcium concentration that can tune that spine of which there are thousands on a neuron

[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  to turn on or off or be slightly elevated or depressed.

[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  So there's quite a bit of state in the neuron.

[29:55.000 --> 30:02.000]  There is this view that the dendritic branches are like subneurons in a network that are rolling up to the main neuron.

[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  It's sort of somewhere halfway between.

[30:05.000 --> 30:10.000]  It's not quite the same modularization as if there were really many neurons in a network,

[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  but it's somewhere halfway in between that and the single compartment neuron.

[30:15.000 --> 30:21.000]  And there's been a lot of attention on the pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex that have an apical part,

[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  the part that's near towards the surface of the cortex, you know, towards the outer layer,

[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  which gets a lot of context information from other brain areas converging there.

[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  And then the so-called basal part, which is the part of the neuron that's the dendrites that are lower down.

[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  You know, you call them like the leaves by the apical part and the roots are the basal part.

[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  And the roots are sort of getting bottom up feature information,

[30:44.000 --> 30:50.000]  whereas the leaves are getting kind of top-down context information.

[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  And then how those two types of information are combined could be controlled by the middle of the neuron.

[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  And there's a theory of consciousness right now, just like last year,

[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  proposing that the way these two compartments either are connected or disconnected locally within the neuron

[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  affects what's happening with consciousness and how contacts and features are integrated.

[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  So those are some examples of a lot of the complexity that's being explored with the neuron structure

[31:15.000 --> 31:18.000]  and how it could be doing quite a bit of computation.

[31:18.000 --> 31:22.000]  You know, one argument is that each individual spine is a little sub-computational compartment

[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  that's rolling its signal into the local dendrite region, which then rolls it into the branches,

[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  which then rolls it into the suba.

[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  So all of that seems pretty reasonable. I don't think any scientists would dispute that.

[31:33.000 --> 31:43.000]  Hi, welcome, Nick. Have you had any immediate thoughts following what Paul and the rest of us have been saying?

[31:43.000 --> 31:49.000]  Hang on. I'm doing some mice injections right now, but give me a few seconds.

[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  Sounds good.

[31:51.000 --> 31:55.000]  Lab work in process.

[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Yeah, we're studying the morphine response, so yeah.

[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  We don't want to mess up your experiment. Feel free to concentrate.

[32:06.000 --> 32:13.000]  So, Hansen, did you have a view on some of this, or Vika, are you just trying to resolve these different viewpoints

[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  about is a neuron just a single unit, or is it a complex computing machine?

[32:18.000 --> 32:28.000]  Well, specifically, I'm trying to dive in deeper to how are amphoreceptors and NDMA receptors

[32:28.000 --> 32:34.000]  differing from one another in terms of how they're affecting the dendrites' activity,

[32:34.000 --> 32:42.000]  but then I'm sort of like wondering, well, how is the dendrites' activity in detecting, you know,

[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  because in order for the dendrite to...

[32:45.000 --> 32:50.000]  So the amphoreceptor is going to be in the... Let me just make sure I have this correct.

[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  I might have it incorrect, but so the spine that is...

[32:55.000 --> 33:01.000]  The spines on the dendrite are connecting to other cells. Is that correct?

[33:01.000 --> 33:06.000]  No, the spine is just like a little kind of protrusion on the dendrite.

[33:06.000 --> 33:13.000]  It kind of creates a little mini kind of peninsula, you could say, within the dendrite where there's

[33:13.000 --> 33:21.000]  maybe possibly two or three synapses, just that little kind of spine offshoot.

[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  Is that different from what your impression was?

[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  No, no, so yeah, so the spine is a little peninsula. That is, that was my original impression,

[33:28.000 --> 33:35.000]  but then someone else did something that confused me, and so then I was wondering if that was connecting to another cell.

[33:35.000 --> 33:42.000]  So we have the spines, and then the dendrite also has the butons or the synapses, right?

[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  That's the other thing that comes out of the dendrite.

[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  So we have the dendrites have spines, and then they have the butons,

[33:47.000 --> 33:53.000]  or which are... That is the synapse that connects to the other cells.

[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  Yeah, the buton is just the way of thinking about, so when two neurons touch each other,

[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  the area where they contact, sometimes has a broader surface area, you know,

[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  especially if it's a stronger connection, it has to, you know, grow in kind of spatial extent

[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  in order to have a greater surface area between the two neurons

[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  so that more neuron transmitter can pass between them.

[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  And so that makes the point of contact to become enlarged and, you know, kind of button shaped,

[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  or kind of bulbous shaped, which are the synaptic butons.

[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  So you could have like a dendritic spine on the dendrite,

[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  and you'd have two axonal butons touching that dendrite,

[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  one maybe with an excitatory input and one with an inhibitory input, for example.

[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  And maybe there's a neuromodulator synaptic input sort of nearby

[34:39.000 --> 34:46.000]  that's dumping dopamine diffusely in sort of area around that spine and a bunch of other spines.

[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  So it's getting all of those inputs, and it might have, you know, six or seven different receptor types

[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  on that one spine, which would include, you know, ampereceptors, which are the basic excitatory input,

[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  and then NMDA receptors, which are also excitatory, but they have a lot of special properties.

[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  And then you have the gapper receptors for the inhibition,

[35:06.000 --> 35:13.000]  and then the different neuromodulatory receptors for kind of tweaking the tuning of the neuron.

[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  Okay, it sounded like you said that there were...

[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  So we were talking about butons, and there's different receptor types on the butons.

[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  You might have many different receptors on a single buton,

[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  and then it sounded like you said different receptor types on one spine.

[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  Is that what you meant to say? That there are also receptor spines?

[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Well, the buton could be either on the axon side or the dendrite side.

[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  The axon side is just going to be releasing neurotransmitter, that's its job.

[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  The buton on the dendrite side is, you know, going to have all the different neuromodulatory receptors

[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  for integrating signals.

[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  So sometimes you just have a kind of a point-to-point connection, like a one-on-one connection,

[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  in which case it's like one axonal buton, context one dendritic buton,

[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  and where those two meet, that's the synapse, and there's the synaptic left,

[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  which is the gap between them, where the neurotransmitter passes.

[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  That's one kind of one-on-one connection.

[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  We can also have these dendritic spines, where instead of it being just a single one-on-one connection,

[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  it's more like a many-to-one connection, where the dendritic spine is sort of the receiving unit,

[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  the compartmental unit, and then there's, you know, multiple different synaptic inputs

[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  converging on that dendritic spine.

[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  So that's the conventional way, but we've seen, there's been new observations

[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  where people have observed signals traveling backwards.

[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  So the...

[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  The healing from the dendrite to the axon.

[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Right, from the dendrite to the axon.

[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  Yeah, this could be a little bit, I mean, that's not the direction of excitatory and inhibitory transmission,

[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  which is the main signal passing transmission, but cannabinoid receptors work in reverse,

[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  for example, that goes from the dendrite back to the axon,

[36:59.000 --> 37:07.000]  and they're more for regulating the homeostasis of the synapse.

[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  And then, it wouldn't surprise me if there were other signals that traveled backwards,

[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  but there'd be more kind of regulatory signals, not signal transmission type signals, I would think,

[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  unless you know some new research.

[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  Paul, do you mean with the cannabinoid with the cannabinoid

[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  that's actually being released from the dendrite, or do you just mean like axo-axonal?

[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  I was thinking that cannabinoids being released from the dendrite

[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  and then affecting receptors on the axon side of the synapse.

[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  So what I was thinking was that, you know, in the process of a neuron firing,

[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  like it sends all the neurotransmitters from the axon side

[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  to the dendrite side, but then when it resets,

[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  you have a lot of neurotransmitters sort of coming back from...

[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  They either get absorbed, or they get sent back to the...

[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  The neurotransmitters either get absorbed into the dendrite's membrane,

[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  or they get sent backwards to the...

[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Yeah, so this is just about how the neurotransmitters get recycled.

[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  They're dropped into the synaptic lab so they can tickle the receptors,

[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  but then they're recycled to be transmitted again,

[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  and so they get re-insured by the axon side.

[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  If you have a dopamine axon, it wants to vacuum up its dopamine

[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  so it can reuse it to do more neurotransmission,

[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  and so the re-uptake of the dopamine, for example, will be on the axon side

[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  so it can bring it back into the axon,

[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  and then repackage it into vesicles and get it ready to release again.

[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  If the dopamine wouldn't get absorbed by the dendrite side,

[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  the dendrite doesn't really have any use for it.

[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  Okay, and that's true for most neurotransmitters.

[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Acetylcholine is an exception.

[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  It's not reabsorbed, it's broken down instead,

[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  but the others are all just reabsorbed to be put back in

[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  and ready for re-transmission.

[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  Yeah, go ahead.

[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  So in terms of like, I'm wondering, you know,

[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  because I read this, one of the news items that came out was that the dendrites,

[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  the human dendrites are different from mice dendrites

[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  because they don't, they're a lot longer,

[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  and that affects the sort of like electrical properties of the dendrite.

[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  It takes a lot more to get it to fire,

[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  but I'm wondering if that means that there's more,

[39:49.000 --> 39:58.000]  if it takes longer, if that means that it affects what a dendrite's ability to consider

[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  its information criteria before it fires, is it somehow extended?

[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  That's a really weird sort of question to pose

[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  because I mean, I guess you could just, you know, you could rush to say,

[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  okay, no, no, forget about that idea.

[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  You could rush to throw it out.

[40:16.000 --> 40:21.000]  Well, I mean, longer neurons do mean longer transmission delays,

[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  and since spikes are integrated within the three millisecond window,

[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  but it can take 10 to 20 milliseconds for a signal to travel,

[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  you know, one end of a neuron to another.

[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  For example, if it has to cross over the hemispheres,

[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  so you do have these time delays going on,

[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  which means that the information being integrated is from different points in time,

[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  depending on what brain area it's coming from.

[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  So that's maybe one consideration.

[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  And I think spines are also more prevalent in human neurons than in rodents.

[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  I'm not sure about that, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's the case.

[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  So I was reading the book, The Rhythms of the Brain,

[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  and they're talking about how basically there's, you know, with EEG there's...

[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  This is Buzaki's book.

[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  Yes, yeah.

[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  Yeah.

[41:08.000 --> 41:18.000]  And they're talking about how, you know, EEG, there's the 1 over F power rule,

[41:18.000 --> 41:24.000]  and the idea is that, I guess, if your frequency is decreasing,

[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  your amplitude is increasing.

[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  There's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude, right?

[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  And if you're, if it's taking longer,

[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  if it's taking a longer amount of time for your dendrites to fire,

[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  that's then because they're longer,

[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  then that should be affecting the...

[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  I mean, that means it's going to affect the frequency,

[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  and the frequency is going to affect the amplitude,

[41:56.000 --> 42:04.000]  so that should then, neural oscillations in human beings should have more...

[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Because we have longer dendrites,

[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  and that means it takes longer for,

[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  for potentially it takes longer for the dendrite to fire.

[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  I'm not sure, but if it does,

[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  then that would mean that there's a different,

[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  there's a different sort of clock pattern happening.

[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  Well, the other thing is,

[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  I'm not sure that dendrites are usually that long.

[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  It's the axons that are long.

[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  The axons might, you know, carry a signal across the brain,

[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  but they're all going to converge on, you know, the neuron.

[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  This dendritic tree is only going to go out,

[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  I think a millimeter or two, from the cell body location.

[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  And then the law of the dendritic tree isn't necessarily a fixed property.

[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  I mean, it sort of compacts and extends pretty dynamically,

[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  you know, in different certain conditions,

[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  so towards states or whatever,

[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  tend to, you know, increase the inputs

[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  just primarily the dendritic tree, you know,

[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  which is going to give a different response

[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  for a good amount of neurotransmitter release.

[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  You know, so kind of one of the ideas that we're going around with

[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  with the IH current is when you block the current,

[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  it sort of compacts the dendritic space,

[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  and you get a greater increase in that input resistance

[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  into the dendritic space,

[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  and so basically you can think of it as removing a leak

[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  in that area.

[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  And so for any given amount of excitatory neurotransmitter,

[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  you get a greater response.

[43:31.000 --> 43:37.000]  You're talking about kind of tuning the response behavior of the dendritic tree?

[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Yeah, yeah.

[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  So basically, like, you know, if we assume it to be a fixed property,

[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  but I'm not sure in a normal brain that it's ever necessarily a fixed property,

[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  because, you know, neuromodulators aren't necessarily just released in a vacuum.

[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  Sure.

[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  And you're looking at heart neurons?

[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  No.

[43:58.000 --> 44:03.000]  The IH current just from the neurons, actually, in the brainstem.

[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  Oh, I see.

[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  Right.

[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  So any other example of how neuromodulators and other inputs can sort of tune

[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  the behavior of the dendrite to behave one way versus another

[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  based on the needs of the moment?

[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  I mean, certainly in the retina, when you light adapt to dark light,

[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  you know, it takes 20 minutes to be able to see in the dark,

[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  and then it takes a while to adjust back to the light.

[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  Those are biochemical modifications to the dendritic tree response properties.

[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  So the circuits are actually being chemically retuned

[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  to work better in the dark or work better in the light.

[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  So not every gap, those sort of retunings can take a while

[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  and have long lasting effects.

[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  Yeah, the old Agile, the nemesis of much of our studies

[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  is the set point versus the gain of the system.

[44:58.000 --> 45:03.000]  So what I'm kind of wondering is how is the dendrite's activity

[45:03.000 --> 45:15.000]  affecting the sodium and potassium gradient?

[45:15.000 --> 45:23.000]  For example, if you have the sodium releases this positive charge

[45:23.000 --> 45:28.000]  that's going to open the calcium channels for a duration,

[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  but then you have the potassium that's going to release this negative charge,

[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  which is going to almost immediately start this negative wave of energy

[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  which is going to close those calcium channels pretty quickly.

[45:40.000 --> 45:48.000]  And I'm wondering how does the dendrite activity sort of result in changes

[45:48.000 --> 46:05.000]  to when the potassium starts, its release of negative charge?

[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  Well, to clear up the ion story a little bit, sodium is the positive one

[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  and chloride is the negative one.

[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  So the inhibitory inputs from GABA neurons, that's chloride,

[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  which is a negatively charged ion that comes into the cell.

[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  And the positive excitatory inputs are sodium,

[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  which is going through the amper receptors.

[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  So those are your main positive and negative inputs.

[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  There is calcium, which has a whole special story,

[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  and the potassium is really more about maintaining the baseline firing threshold.

[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  It's sort of like a regulatory kind of voltage management system.

[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's not part of regular signal transmission.

[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  It's part of like this sort of cycle of how the neuron fires

[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  and then how it resets itself, that's evolving potassium.

[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  And it flows the opposite direction of the sodium.

[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  The potassium flows from the inside out to sort of negatively affect the cell,

[47:03.000 --> 47:08.000]  whereas the sodium flows from the outside in to positively affect the cell.

[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  And like some of the endogenous opioids like pincet and stuff

[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  are going to activate that sort of potassium flowing out

[47:16.000 --> 47:23.000]  through like a GERC channel mediated process.

[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  What kind of chloride is this? I haven't really heard of this before, I'm confused.

[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  And by the way, Nick, do you agree with that? Where's this chloride coming from?

[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  Oh, for sure. I mean, that's just kind of basic ionic transport across the cell

[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  for the neurotransmitters.

[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  I mean, your basic ones, you primarily learn about sodium and potassium,

[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  sort of having a higher concentration outside than inside.

[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  So whenever you open up a sodium channel, sodium tends to flow inside,

[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  just through its diffusion gradient and then the opposite being that for potassium,

[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  which is higher on the inside of the cell versus the outside.

[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  So if you open up a potassium channel, like a GERC channel or something like that,

[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  then potassium is going to flow out and a lot of the patching stuff,

[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  we have to be careful because any time that you sort of create an artificial seal

[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  by breaking open the membrane, you create a potential for leak

[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  and potassium tends to flow out and sodium tends to flow in as well.

[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  And so you can kind of get an artificial activity of the neuron

[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  based on just the diffusion gradients that are there.

[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  And then obviously chloride, which is your primary negative ion

[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  within the picture, I guess we could say.

[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  And a lot of like Paul mentioned GABA, you know, it's its primary mediators

[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  through a chloride channel.

[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  I definitely missed out on chemistry class, I didn't take it,

[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  but I thought you have like a sodium chloride or a potassium chloride.

[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  Is chloride its own sort of separate thing?

[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  I guess I'm missing some data here.

[48:58.000 --> 49:05.000]  But a neuroscientist was explaining to me that the action potential

[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  was the sodium becoming very positive and the potassium coming very negative.

[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  And so this is just regular chloride, it's not potassium chloride,

[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  it's not sodium chloride.

[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  Well, potassium is positive charge.

[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  That's the only way that you're...

[49:21.000 --> 49:28.000]  Yeah, just to explain that picture that you got there.

[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Hang on a second, I need to switch.

[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  It's at discharges.

[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  So separate out the action potential idea,

[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  let's treat that separately.

[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  It's kind of a special process, that's how the neuron does its spike.

[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  So the first is these ions, they're individual atoms.

[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  So sodium ions means actual sodium atom is just a single atom of sodium

[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  and potassium ions are single atoms of potassium

[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  and the chloride ions are single atoms of chlorine and same with calcium.

[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  So you've got these individual atoms and they're in solution.

[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  So, you know, salt is sodium chloride, but if you dissolve salt and water,

[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  the sodium and the chloride dissociate and you get pre-floating sodium atoms

[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  and pre-floating chloride atoms in a solution of water.

[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  So that's kind of the situation in the cell.

[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  You've got these dissolved salts.

[50:17.000 --> 50:21.000]  Excuse me.

[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  I did run up some stairs.

[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  You have these dissolved salts that have caused these sort of individual atoms

[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  to just be pre-floating within the water solution.

[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  And so you've got these pre-floating chloride atoms

[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  and pre-floating sodium atoms that are basically sodium chloride like salt,

[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  like table salt outside the cell.

[50:38.000 --> 50:44.000]  And when the glutamate neurotransmitter binds to the amper receptor,

[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  it opens and allows the sodium ions of sodium chloride to go in through that pore.

[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  And when the GABA neurons, the inhibitory neurons open a GABA receptor,

[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  it opens a pore that only allows chloride atoms,

[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  the sort of negatively charged chloride atoms to flow in.

[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  And so that's how the positive and negative voltages get into the cell.

[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  It's these actual chloride and sodium atoms from sodium chloride table salt

[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  actually going through the pores of the cell

[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  and the pores are being opened and closed by the neurotransmitters.

[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  So that's the basic idea about how the positive and negative signals are integrated.

[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  And so the neuron sort of maintains a membrane potential of something like,

[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  actually I forget what it is, it's like negative 40 millivolts.

[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  I don't know, Nick, do you know of hand?

[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  Oh, minus 70.

[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Okay, 70 is different from different neurons.

[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  But it says some negative value.

[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  I think maybe it's negative 60 for cortical neurons.

[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  Is there anywhere from like minus 90 to minus 40 usually?

[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  Yeah.

[51:41.000 --> 51:46.000]  So as the amper receptors let the sodium atoms in,

[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  it goes up, you know, from let's say minus 60 to minus 58, minus 55,

[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  minus 52 is getting higher and higher.

[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  But then as some GABA things let the chloride atoms in,

[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  and it goes down again, you know, back down to minus 60, minus 65, minus 70.

[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  And so the chloride and the sodium are like one's pressing the accelerator

[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  and the other one's pressing the brake.

[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  And they're kind of sending competing signals, pushing the voltage up and down inside the cell.

[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  And if the voltage gets up above a certain threshold,

[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  I think it's like minus 30 or something,

[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  then it triggers this whole actual potential process,

[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  which is like this giant spring-loaded reset process

[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  where all of a sudden a whole bunch of sodium atoms come in

[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  and the voltage spikes way up,

[52:27.000 --> 52:32.000]  and that triggers this counterwave of potassium ions that all open up and they all flow out.

[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  And as this giant, you know, sea change,

[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  it's like the whole thing kind of flips over with this massive voltage swing.

[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  And it's that massive voltage swing that is the so-called active potential,

[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  which lasts for about a millisecond and then it propagates down the axon

[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  where this sort of massive kind of wave,

[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  sort of like the wave at the football stadium where, you know,

[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  when the folks next you do the wave, then you do the wave,

[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  or like falling dominoes would be another analogy.

[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  Those falling dominoes just trickle all the way down the axon

[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  and carry the signal to the end of the axon.

[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  And that's the action potential,

[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  and it's being done by this, you know, giant wave of sodium atoms coming in

[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  and then potassium atoms flowing out,

[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  which affects this big signal,

[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  and then Ron has to reset all that, has to clean all that out

[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  and move all the atoms back to where they came from,

[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  which which takes a while.

[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  Okay, so initially the positive and negative inputs are

[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  there's the glutamate receptors and then the GABA receptors,

[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  and when the glutamate receptors open up,

[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  sodium atoms come in and they're adding a positive charge,

[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  and when the GABA receptors open up,

[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  the chloride atoms are coming in and they're adding a negative charge,

[53:37.000 --> 53:44.000]  and at some point that's going to trigger the action potential to start.

[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  Because there's too much positive charge, is that right?

[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  Yeah, but the positive charge builds up to a critical threshold point

[53:57.000 --> 54:02.000]  that then triggers the, you know, sort of exponential opening of more sodium channels,

[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  which then gives you that sort of all or nothings,

[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  bike or an action potential.

[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  And then once it reaches a certain positive charge,

[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  then that triggers the, you know, theoretical opening of the potassium channels,

[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  which then the positive charge then flows back out to sort of reset the membrane potential.

[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  Okay, so are the chloride atoms involved in closing the sodium channels,

[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  or is it the potassium that's involved with closing the sodium channels?

[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  Well, the sodium channels are voltage dependent,

[54:33.000 --> 54:40.000]  and so depending on the voltage of the cell is going to dictate sort of the opening of the channel,

[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  and so they go from open to, once they hit a certain positive charge,

[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  then they go to inactivated, and then they, or is it,

[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  they either go from open to close to inactivated or open to inactivated to close,

[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  I always get messed up, but regardless, once the sodium channels open,

[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  they sort of hit a positive charge that's then necessary for whatever the interaction,

[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  the charge, the biophysical properties of the channel, causes it to close

[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  until the cell goes back down to a negative potential

[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  that then allows it to sort of have another confirmation shift,

[55:15.000 --> 55:21.000]  in that case when a rising, or increasing amount of voltage within the cell,

[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  then it starts to open the channels again.

[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  That's a key point. People think of neurotransmitters as the thing that open receptors.

[55:28.000 --> 55:33.000]  There's also a special category of receptors that are opened by voltage levels,

[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  and those are the ones that cause this avalanche domino effect to heaven.

[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  So I'm asking this question because my understanding of the role of the potassium

[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  has changed in a bit, so how would you describe the role of the potassium

[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  at this point in regulating the cell?

[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  It does two things. One is it's a key part of this action potential process,

[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  this sort of domino trigger that's called the neural spike.

[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  So it plays a key role there. It's the thing that causes the spike to come back down to negative.

[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  The sodium causes it to go up to a high positive type part of the spike,

[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  and then the potassium brings it back down to the negative.

[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  So it plays that role, and then it also plays a role in just maintaining

[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  the normal voltage level of the cell.

[56:19.000 --> 56:25.000]  It has like a baseline voltage that gets regulated and maintained with regulation.

[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  Paul, I want to ask you a question.

[56:28.000 --> 56:36.000]  So basically sodium and potassium all have positive charge,

[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  they're ionic potassium, and they also have one valence, right?

[56:41.000 --> 56:52.000]  The valency are one at the same positive one, but then how does the potassium

[56:52.000 --> 56:58.000]  trigger the down regulation of the action potential?

[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Yeah, that's the weird part about it.

[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's because there's more potassium inside the cell and outside,

[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  and so the potassium flows out.

[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  So sodium, which is positive flowing in,

[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  Is this the concentration?

[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  Yeah.

[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  Just because of the concentration?

[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  That's right.

[57:19.000 --> 57:25.000]  So then what if, okay, and then the concentration,

[57:25.000 --> 57:31.000]  but this selection is performed by the channel, is that correct?

[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  Well, the channel can open and close, and if it's open,

[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  then they flow in the direction of the concentration by diffusion.

[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  But does it select whether it's potassium or sodium?

[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  Yeah, it just selects the ion, just based on the size.

[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  Just the size, right?

[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  Yeah, but one channel, one pore will either be a sodium pore

[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  or it'll be a potassium pore, I think.

[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  So basically it's symmetric, so let's say if I switch the channels,

[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  replace the sodium channel with potassium channel,

[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  and I should get the same, basically, neuron activity.

[58:11.000 --> 58:16.000]  I shouldn't get any different transmission, right?

[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  I mean, different two transmission pattern, is that correct?

[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  Well, I'm not sure what the replacing would mean,

[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  because the potassium's more concentrated inside

[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  and the sodium's more concentrated inside.

[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  No, no, no, I mean, swapping, swapping.

[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Let's say if you create a new kind of neuron,

[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  where potassium's more concentrated outside

[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  and sodium's more concentrated inside,

[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  and kind of reverse everything.

[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  Yeah, I guess that could work.

[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  You'd have to change how biological cells

[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  that work for hundreds of millions of years.

[58:39.000 --> 58:45.000]  Yeah, but the potassium channel's open and close much slower.

[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  The sodium channel's open and close way faster,

[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  but I'm not sure if that would even, you know,

[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  I'm not sure if the dynamics of that time dependency

[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  would even be matter for, you know, the cells.

[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  But I think, since imagining a sort of a different universe,

[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  where a billion years ago the cell decided to treat

[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  potassium and sodium in the inverse way.

[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  Yeah, so let's say I'll just, yeah,

[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  the different universe, or if I just create in the lab,

[59:18.000 --> 59:27.000]  replace, swap the sodium channel with the potassium channel,

[59:27.000 --> 59:34.000]  and then when I intake, it's potassium, it's sodium.

[59:34.000 --> 59:41.000]  And so to create the same symmetric initial condition,

[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  and then I just let it run, should they perform the same?

[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  But the issue is it's not enough to change the channels,

[59:49.000 --> 59:53.000]  you'd have to change whether the excess sodium and potassium

[59:53.000 --> 59:56.000]  are inside or outside the cell, you'd have to swap that as well.

[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Right, but this is not about neurons,

[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  this is about all biological cells,

[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  every biological cell in the human body and all animals

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  going back to see creatures all have the excess sodium

[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  outside and the excess potassium inside.

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  So are the potassium receptors on the dendrite side

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  or the axon side?

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Well, it's inside versus outside the cell,

[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  it's not whether it's the dendrite or the axon.

[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Yeah, so does that make any difference?

[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  I mean, if I swap them.

[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Well, it's hard to imagine how you swap,

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  it's like, hey, let's say there was no DNA and you only had RNA,

[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  how would things work?

[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  That's a very different universe, isn't that how biology evolved?

[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Sure, sure, but I'm just asking a question.

[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Imagine that.

[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  It's like, how is that question relevant?

[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  But, okay.

[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  Yeah, but I mean, there's not, I mean,

[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  sodium and potassium are sort of interchangeable atoms,

[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  they both have a positive charge.

[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Sodium's, one of them's larger, I forget which one.

[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Yeah, that one's larger, so my question is probably,

[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  not probably, my question is what makes them any different?

[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Is it just by accident that they played their role

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  or there's something intrinsic,

[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  because they have the same charge and they,

[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  so one is larger, so is that this larger mass

[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  make any difference in the, you know.

[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  I mean, my guess would be it's mostly coincidence.

[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  I think, probably has something to do with the,

[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  you know, ion concentration in seawater,

[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  the salt concentration in seawater,

[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  and how that led to early life evolving,

[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  would be my guess.

[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  But we probably drifted from,

[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Mika wanted to understand ion channel mechanics.

[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Well, what I want to know is how is the,

[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  the reason I'm trying to ask how does the dendrite

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  affect potassium is because some researchers are saying

[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  that, you know, basically that the,

[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  the potassium concentration is affecting the duration

[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  of the action potential.

[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And so I'm trying to figure out, okay,

[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  well if the duration of the action potential is varying

[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  because of the concentration of the potassium,

[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  what's affecting the, the, the concentration of potassium

[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  and how and, and, and, you know, is the dendrite

[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  affecting that.

[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  So if the dendrite detects a pattern,

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  and it's able to, if the,

[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  if the dendrite detects a pattern,

[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  it has to transmit that pattern to onward,

[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  otherwise it might as well not have detected the pattern.

[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  So the idea here is that it detects the pattern

[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  and then it transmits it onward through the,

[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  the, the rate through, by affecting the potassium gradient,

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  the potassium concentration,

[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  and that affects the duration of the action potential.

[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And so I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to figure out

[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  what are the mechanics of how the dendrite is affecting

[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  the potassium, and maybe that's just through

[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  the potassium receptors.

[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Yeah, I'm not sure that anything is communicated

[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  within the cell using sodium and potassium or even chloride.

[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  It's all voltage.

[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Those things are just adding positive and negative charges

[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  to the voltage, but it's the voltage that is communicating,

[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  that's allowing the communication to happen inside the cell

[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  and to travel down the dendrite taxon, for example.

[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And does changing the potassium change the actual spike time?

[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  Because, I mean, obviously changing the potassium

[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  is going to change the resting membrane potential.

[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  It's just going to change how close that cell is to threshold,

[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  but I don't think it actually changes the actual time,

[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  you know, once you trigger the action potential, does it?

[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  Yeah, I'm not sure.

[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  I mean, you hear these terms like narrow spiking neurons

[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  and broad spiking neurons.

[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  So I think just in terms of how the,

[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  the voltage gated channels are tuned,

[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  spikes might be, you know, kind of faster and shorter

[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  or not in how long they propagate,

[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  but in how wide the waveform is.

[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  But I'm not sure what the significance is.

[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Because I have a bunch of recordings going from, you know,

[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  where I took the same brain slice,

[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  one from 3 to 14 millimole potassium.

[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  And I didn't notice anything different

[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  when I was looking at the spikes already data,

[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  and they seemed to pretty much be the same.

[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Yeah, that is surprising,

[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  because I thought it's not, it's not the concentration,

[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  it's the voltage level that's determining it.

[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  But I think it would have to be different,

[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  not based on, I see so, Miki, you're saying there's a researcher

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  claiming that the potassium level is changing the waveform.

[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  That the potassium level, yeah, yes,

[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  it's changing the shape of the action potential

[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  by keeping the calcium channels open longer.

[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  Well, that would make more sense.

[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  The calcium channels, I mean,

[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  the potassium part I'm not sure about,

[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  but calcium channels are slower acting,

[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  and that's actually maybe the other kind of key thing

[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  to get into the ion channel story.

[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  NMDA receptors are kind of special.

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  They allow sodium in, just like the ample ones,

[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  but they also allow calcium in.

[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  But they only allow calcium in when they're in a certain state

[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  in a mode, and they have to get switched into that mode.

[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  And it takes like 20 milliseconds to kind of

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  have repeated firing of the neuron

[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  to switch them into that mode.

[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  And the NMDA channels are also a part of,

[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  well, they allow calcium in,

[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  and then calcium affects long-term potentiation,

[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  which is long-term memory.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  So calcium's closely involved in the cell learning

[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  and changing its behavior and adapting.

[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  But we study...

[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  It sounds like this sort of spike waveform thing

[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  is sort of someone's thesis.

[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  It's sort of putting out this thesis

[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  that the spike waveform shape might be playing some basic role

[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  in how neurons work internally.

[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  So I don't know if that's kind of a good general...

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  It's got to do you a neuroscience.

[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  It sounds like this sort of a thesis proposal,

[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  this hypothesis has been put out

[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  that's maybe under debate at the moment.

[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  Yeah, but if it does get published, though...

[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Let me know, because then I've got to tailor

[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  the spike sorting software that we have again.

[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  There's a lot more questions that need to be asked

[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  to figure out exactly what's happening.

[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Because at some point,

[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  the role of sodium and chloride and potassium

[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  is affecting what's happening to the calcium receptor.

[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  So maybe the calcium channels are open longer.

[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  So what I'm trying to map out is,

[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  how is what the dendrite is detecting

[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  affecting the sodium and the chloride and the potassium,

[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  and how are they affecting the calcium

[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  and then how is that affecting the duration of the axiom-essential.

[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  And so I'm trying to sort of get established the link here

[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  because I think potassium has to play a role

[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  in terms of the duration of the calcium channels,

[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  but also how is the dendrite affecting the potassium.

[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And because the dendrite has to detect something

[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  and in order for something to be detected

[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  to be turned into a change in the axiom-potential waveform,

[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  there has to be a process.

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  So I'm just trying to figure out what that process is.

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Yeah, I feel like the potassium part

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  is probably a minor part of the whole picture.

[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  I mean, if what you're interested in is what might be going on

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  in terms of kind of complex intracellular signal processing,

[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  I'd look into calcium and CAMP.

[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  That's where a lot of the really complex machinery is.

[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And with that, I've got to jump back to my experiments.

[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  But Micah, if you want to look for how many of these

[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  different ionic changes affect the cell.

[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  As far as axiom-potential spiking, voltage and voltage propagation,

[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  many of the old classical patch clamp literature,

[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  they were just sort of defining the different intracellular solutions

[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  and the different extracellular solutions

[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  and different parts of the brain,

[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  and then sort of how the different elite currents

[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  within the neurons themselves that are being recorded

[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  sort of change the biophysical properties,

[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  I guess we would say, of the voltage changes.

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Because a lot of it's just voltage changes, perhaps.

[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  There might be a little bit of overthinking

[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  from just the ionic side like Paul said.

[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I think where most of the complicated stuff comes

[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  is sort of that second messenger systems,

[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  like cyclic and P-dependent changes in signal propagation,

[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  I guess we'll say.

[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  But anyways, thanks for the fun little conversation

[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  I got to run, guys.

[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Okay.

[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Yeah, thanks also.

[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  I need to go back to the thing I was working on.

[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  I just got a bit of intrigued by the room thesis.

[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  That sounds good.

[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  I'm going to close the room because I'm at the gym

[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  and I got to exercise.

[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Thank you both.

[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  Thank you all.

[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Thanks.

[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Hanson, Nick and Paul.

[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  Have a good day.

[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  Thanks.

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  Thanks for being educational.
