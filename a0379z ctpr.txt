In the Neural Lace Podcast: Episode 3 Realizing Neural Lace

In this episode we talk about how the Nvidia DGI-1 Super computer can be used to solve Neural Lace.

Guest: Eric Matzner doesn't just study neuroscience he lives it working through his nootropics company NooTroo on a quest to enhance the human brain.

We talk about how technology being developed by Richard Marks at PSVR can be used to solve Neural Lace.
We talk about HypeVR's VideoGrammetry as a tool to solve Neural Lace.
We talk about new kinds of Tractography, diffusion tensor imaging and we touch on tensor calculus, but the math of Neural Lace is something we will dive deep into on another podcast.
We talk about the nutrition of neural lace, the power demands of the brain, and what part of the brain we should target for Neural Lace.
We explode the idea that there is a secret sauce for Neural Lace.
We dive into the quantum mechanics of Neural Lace and we explore the idea that the cosmos consists of ones and zeroes with particles representing ones and waves representing zeroes.
