hofstadter & hawkins
I learned 2 great things from author Douglas Hofstadter. One is the power of using analogies for effective communication, and two of course he is right about the self being a strange loop. What he did not provide was a neurological definition for how the strange loop of self functions in the brain but I think neuronscientists around the world have filled in the gaps to the degree that we can correct his analogy with what is known about the brain.

Jeff Hawkins books On Intelligence and A Thousand Brains helped me to really embrace the concepts of predictive coding, biologically plausible neural networks, sparse distributed representation, and reference frame functions with cortical columns grid cell & place cells
