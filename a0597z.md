link together "3d protein structure" with "interception of cell communications"

monitor/medical imaging
communication signals
3D biological structures
biological functions which amount to signals triggering structures to transform producing new signals
then talk about decoding this

A cell is a clock
Individual cells clock mechanism is based on timed feedback loops consisting of interacting genes. A gene is triggered producing a protein or RNA which triggers a second gene which stimulates a third gene in cycles that could last 24/7/365.

"Molecular tags" placed on proteins (that might protect DNA) are part of these protein/rna/chemical feedback loops

cells have to know their location, and they have to know where they are going, this location is often derived from a chemical gradient, a quantity of some chemical such as retinoic acid ends up being used as a measuring tool

in a fetus for example a traveling neuron, or stem cell, must know where it is and where it must end up in a developing brain

the metoblic pathways that produce retinoic acid gradients are regulared by protein/rna feedback loops

cells pick up vitamina A to produce the retinoic acid

the gradient molecute

The daily maintenance of all tissue structures in the body is dependent on measurements and signals.

The world is on the cusp of completely reverse engineering the human body. We are getting close.

each cells has a clock but in essence also is a clock, a clock that operates with timed feedback loops of interacting genes, proteins, rna, chemical messages, and chemical gradients, with the quantity of chemical gradients perhaps serving as a function timer

the gradients could consist of a chemical like retinoic acid, the signals from which might cause cells to grow until the gradient runs out.

then there are gene activation sequences where one gene triggers another and another in clock cycle that might last 24 hours, or some other length of time,

the communication between cells is affecting the start times and stop times of various cell functions, 

Cells attract or repel other cells like White Blood Cells or Neurons with Chemical Gradients. Signals from these chemical conversations can create sticky protein molecutes so for instance they could grab onto cell lining and move even against the flow of blood. They can roll or crawl on the lining cells, as if pulling on a rope against the stream of blood.

 3D light Neural network is an example that a neural network doesn't have to be electronic. 
 What I'm proposing is that every cell functions as a chemical neural network
Each cell has threshold functions, it has to detect what its encountering, and it does so by "considering" its activated receptors, its receptors are 3D protein structures that are encoded with learned information, receptors learn with coincident detection that indicates certain patterns that a receptor has been engineered (by evolution) to detect

Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory
Hebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb’s theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:
“The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become ‘associated’, so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.” (Hebb 1949, p. 70)
“When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.” (Hebb 1949, p. 63)
Gordon Allport posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows , beaded jump rope .
“If the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly interassociated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements

cancer starts through random mutations

The extent that a group is consideredd to be one entity rather than a group of many individual entities. Also called entitivity.

Cyclic ENTITATIVITY: "Entitativity deals how groups of people are perceived as a group or as a mere aggregation of individuals."

I need to show that 
are mixed synapses, electrical and chemical used in every sensory organ?

Measurable brainwave 
synchronous oscillation travels short or long distances

brain wave communication
one group of neurons sends 
1-4 osc per second
7-10 freq per sec
oscillation multiple ways
rhythmic pulses waves

waves can add together and become stronger

slow and fast waves can interact and travel together

fast waves first focuse attention to receiving region

fast waves long range associations
relevant regions during day dreaming

shapes of sound waves determine quality of sound

complex shape variables, shape 

delay attack decay release sustain release 

neurotransmitters can affect firing of a group of neurons
they can tune brain regions to receive info from another region
regularint columns in vision

brain electricity potentials
local electrical fields, differences in charges across regiong

signalling functions in these fields

electrical gradients platelets and immune cells navigating toward inccenctions

gradients 

they help cancer cell navigation

it includes input from electrical synapses

the after effects of axon spikes

shapes of neurons and time of pulses affect intensity

asymmetrical neurons in cortex

large flow of ions inbetween cells
symmetrical neurons do not add charges together

in hibitor neurons type of graident between cell body and dendrite

short electrical events do not add to the charge

New cells respond to new data and make old memories more specific such aas adding discrimination details

supportive brain cells contribut to this activity
again more on glial cells

when new minted neuron arrives it is inhibit

adjusted to new envorinment

as new neuron establishes more connections and receives more signals a

likely hood of new cells being taken into neural circuits and surving increases

in animal experiments they pay attention to specific details

Neuroplasticity and new brain cells
and between the right & left brain mechanisms

most brain activity involves circuits 
not known how this is coordinated

dendrites rapidly alter their shape

each sensory regiong is multisensory and multimodal
signals from these reigions are sent to other areas where a variety of informatio is integrated

a center for unified experience has not been found
descartes thought it was the pineal gland
PTJ Parietal Tempral junction

more than 30 neurotransmitters
 10 most prominent

 The next chapter is promoted t

 astrocycles can contributed to the formation of brainwaves
 new neurons are used to remodel old memories or produce new memories by rewiring neural circuits

 astrocytes tell blood bessels to up to supply oxygen and nutrients then to close once the neurons are full

write down what you said to Anna-#21 Sensory Input Arrays
Our cells are 
cells can reprogram themselves
basically are making decisions via something like natural selection
our cells are computing
we make choices and refine our choices
our memories are past memories are driving our future decisions
they are attractors for our future decisions

The objective of neo mind cycle is to create software for brain computer interfaces and also for neural networks
machines that can think that are phenominally conscious
creating the software
the book is a step towards
part of the research that I've been doing for the past 10 years
its about the human brain, how the brain works, bci hacking the brain, and artificial brains
closer to humans

conscious machines
collection with the whole system
what our cells do
which is co
every part of the machine can connect as a single sensor
anywhere on your body that is touched with your finger for example
because your whole body is connected as a single sensor, part of the reason is because your cells are oscillating together
they are also collecting data (variances in signal transmission information theory) 
neurons 
when you touch your finger you are touching a sensor array
the cells that you are touching fire together (talk about touch screens here)
so they all fire together
and send signals to the rest of the bodyh
the rest of the body feels that because of how cells are connected, because of how cells are communicating
transmitting signals
because all the cells are linked together, because they are all sending signals to one another, you can feel every part of your body, that is your body can feel every part of your body.
it will get to the point that not only can we build machines that are like people, but we can link to them, we can connect our minds to them, we can connect our minds to each other.

if you connected to me you could feel whatever I feel
because we would become a single sensor, we would become connected

the signals that touch my arm are transmitted throughout my entire body, my entire body knows about it

not just my brain
but those signals if we were connected, wirelessly or directly, then you would feel what I am feeling
because the signals travelling to me would travel to you

neuralink is the kind of technology that would facilitate this
