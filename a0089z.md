(all or nothing)(physics)

General Relativity is an equation that describes the relative relationship between mass and energy, showing that they are the same thing at different speeds, that energy is mass times the speed of light squared, which is the same thing as saying energy is mass moving much faster than mass, or that mass is energy moving more slowly.

So to have a theory of general relativity that extends to quantum physics would be about describing the relationship between energy and mass at the scale of quantum physics

I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.

In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between ~~amplitude~~ magnitude and frequency

Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.

(the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.

What is interesting is that at the neuron level, when the action potential fires, the Amplitude is pretty consistent, it's so consistent that they gave it a name, the all or nothing principle, either the neuron fires or it doesn't, this became the basis of the Perceptron which arguable was the first model of an artificial neuron, sort of the base idea for all artificial neural networks that have been created since.

So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?

With the all or nothing principle the idea is that once the threshold of a neuron is reached it either fires or it doesn’t but that it doesn’t change in amplitude. but why is Amplitude changing at the group neuron scale and not at the individual neuron scale?

The idea is that because of the All or nothing principle the duration of the action potential is more precisely inverse to the frequency. 

So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h

However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.

There is an effect, in which potassium seems to be the main factor, that might cause the action potential to last longer or shorter, leaving calcium channels in the exit terminal active longer, releasing more vesicles, more synapses, which would effect the timing of the releases of graded potentials, so its possible that the release of more vesicles could be excitatory or inhibitory, opening more sodium channels (excitatory), or more chloride & potassium channels (inhibitory), 

So the idea is that when we have high frequency bursts the duration will be lower, and when we have low frequency bursts the duration of each burst will be higher, because there is an inverse relationship between the duration & frequency. 

I remember playing a video game with fighters where you had fast weak punches, or strong slow punches. 

Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

Neurons are divergent & convergent at the same time, when they receive signals they are converging them, when they distribute signals they are diverging or bifurcating them, and when the signals amplify in duration they amplify in strength with the release of more neurotransmitters in some diverging area of the network that is now converging signals into some other signal array
