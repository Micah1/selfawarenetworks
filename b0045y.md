This was a clubhouse conversation.

Title: Neurons Photon Inputs (Dec 16, 2021)

Summary:

The conversation revolves around Dr. Spencer Smith discussing his work on advanced two-photon microscopy techniques for neuroscience research. He explains the development of a two-photon microscope equipped with two independent scan engines, enabling simultaneous imaging and optogenetic manipulation of neurons with micron-level resolution across a large field of view. The system utilizes resonant scanning for speed and adaptive optics to correct aberrations, enhancing image quality, especially at the edges of the field.

Dr. Smith elaborates on using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) to visualize neuronal activity by detecting changes in intracellular calcium concentrations during action potentials. He addresses challenges such as low photon detection rates in two-photon microscopy and the need for multiple samples to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. The conversation also touches on the limitations of intrinsic imaging techniques, the potential of multiphoton optogenetics for targeted neuronal stimulation, and the difficulties in mapping complex, distributed neuronal networks.

Participants inquire about integrating other imaging modalities to overcome depth limitations caused by tissue scattering and discuss the potential use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and other fluorescent reporters. Dr. Smith shares insights into his career path, emphasizing the importance of learning on the job and pursuing individual research interests.

...goes to a Y scanner, and then pivots in the other direction.
So, yeah, we used the resonant scanner to go fast,
and then the slow X we used to impart an offset laterally
along that same resonant axis,
and then another low-speed Y mirror, Y scan.
And so the resonant is operated at eight-quarters to it,
and it scans bidirectionally,
so that's giving us 16,000 lines per second.
And then those are divided into multiple frames.
And then the X galvo is not really moving most of the time.
It's just a position, the field of view.
And then the Y galvo is scanning at whatever our frame rate is,
so, say, 30 or 60 hertz.
Wow, excellent.
I'm sorry to hog bandwidth here, but this is a fascinating field.
I'm so delighted to listen to your work.
I'm just wondering, can you also do this as image,
besides imaging, can you change it, let's say, to an NDAG
and start using these for a focal ablation in your work?
Yeah, absolutely.
And there have been experiments where they do photoablation of, say,
dendrites or different components of a cell,
and then see how that changes activity in the network.
That is manipulation that's used.
What's used even more often are optogenetics,
which maybe some of you are familiar with.
This is a way that you can genetically engineer neurons
to express proteins that gate current flow across the membrane
based by the presence or absence of light.
And so, basically, you can use light to turn neurons on or off.
And those types of experiments,
or exactly why we built this with two independent scan engines,
the idea being that we could use one of those scan pathways
to be turning neurons on and off with light using optogenetics,
and the other pathway to be imaging neuronal activity
and see how turning on and off individual neurons
changes neuronal activity across this large length scale
and still maintain that mind-arm resolution.
Holy shit.
Well, can I interrupt?
If you want, I'll give it a...
What was that?
May I interrupt, please?
I had a few questions.
First of all, to both of you, your professors.
So, I wanted to ask,
how do you guys study in order to grow as a researcher?
Because Professor Hiroshi, if I'm not butchering your name,
I'm so sorry if I am,
and Professor Spencer,
both of you are doing research work,
and I am interested in that,
but I'm trying to understand
how does one grow in that field.
One, and two parts,
and second part is related,
I'm sorry, I got tension shift,
because I got into,
I was trying to understand the conversation that both of you were having,
and I was having a hard time.
Another part is...
So, sorry,
did I interrupt someone?
Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead.
You're doing fine.
Okay.
Then,
Professor,
could you please comment on sensitivity,
and as well as noise,
as we know that it's,
I mean,
from the stability and the fluctuation point perspective?
So,
could you please comment on these two aspects,
and then I would want to understand from signal integrity,
and...
I'm sorry,
I'm having loss of thought.
I was writing while you were speaking,
so...
It's okay.
So,
let me answer a part of that,
and then,
if I miss a part,
we can come back and pick that up.
So,
so one part was,
was my career trajectory,
right?
So,
I mean,
my brief background is I studied physics and math for my undergrad degree,
and then went to a neuroscience program for my PhD,
and there was a,
I did a small MEMS project while I was there,
and,
and then went through my,
sort of the tail end of my graduate school,
and then my first postdoc started getting into,
multi-photon imaging,
and just sort of built what I needed to do the experiments that I wanted,
and then,
as I got grants,
and as,
like,
the brand initiative came along,
we elaborated that work.
It's,
you know,
it's a lot of learning a job,
and not everything,
you know,
I'm,
I'm a big believer in,
in people finding their own path,
so,
I mean,
this is what worked for me.
I'm not,
I'm not endorsing this particular pathway for anybody else,
but that's what I did,
and it was,
you know,
recognizing the moment that you're in,
recognizing what works,
what you're good at,
and,
and trying to capitalize on that,
trying to do the things,
things that you can get traction on doing.
It's not always going to be what you want to do right off the bat.
So,
that's,
one small comment on that,
that part of your question,
about the,
the stability of the signals.
So,
it,
that's an interesting question.
So,
these,
these pulses are coming at 80 megahertz,
and I mentioned that,
the,
the likelihood of a two-photodom event is very,
very low,
right?
And then,
even if one happens,
you also have to detect that photon.
It has to,
get caught by your,
get back to your objective,
and get caught in your collection pathway,
and make it to whatever photodetector you're using.
And,
that's a rare event.
Most of the time,
in most people's two-photon microscopes,
the average number of detected signal photons per excitation pulse is less than one.
Oftentimes,
it's much,
much,
much less than one,
which is something that surprises some people.
They don't,
you know,
they build these systems,
and they,
they don't necessarily quantify that.
But if you do,
that's,
that's typically the fluxes that we're dealing with,
particularly when imaging neural activity and EVO.
And so,
that the,
that's why we need,
multiples per time point,
in order to make a decent signal,
right?
You need,
you want to have on the order of,
at least dozens of photons,
per sample point,
to have something that has a decent signal to noise.
So,
if you're limited by shot noise anyway,
then you're,
the maximum signal to noise you're going to get is,
is,
is where,
um,
and being the number of photons you detected.
So,
if you're only detecting a few photons,
the signal's going to be so noisy,
it's going to be hard to make sense out of.
And so,
that's why we,
um,
have a,
we need to extend the dwell time per pixel,
or have multiple samples per pixel,
and have multiple samples per neurons,
so that we can pool those together,
and have enough photons,
um,
to have a signal with fidelity,
um,
for our measurement.
That's great.
Is,
is this,
um,
so,
is this,
is this what you call,
um,
optical coherence,
uh,
tomography?
So you're just the more,
you're just doing,
like,
tomography on lots of different,
uh,
light samples?
No,
no,
this is,
this is regular,
uh,
laser scanning two-potom microscopy.
Actually,
Roshi,
who's,
um,
who just spoke,
um,
he,
uh,
he's doing OCT,
or it's one of the things that you mentioned that he does.
Okay.
Um,
and what are you,
what are you imaging exactly when you say you can image the brain's oscillation?
You're talking about blood flow,
right?
No,
this is neuronal activity,
and,
um,
usually what we do is we have,
um,
genetically engineered mice that are expressing a calcium indicator,
so a protein that,
um,
has a,
uh,
fluorescent component,
um,
derives from,
from green fluorescent protein from aquaria,
uh,
victoria jellyfish,
um,
and,
uh,
calmodulin,
a calcium binding protein,
and that protein fluoresces more when it is bound to calcium,
and,
uh,
it turns out that neurons increase their internal,
their intracellular calcium concentration,
you know,
10 to 1,000 fold,
um,
during an action potential,
very briefly,
but,
that's a big change,
and so that's a nice,
big,
meaty signal,
um,
that these,
uh,
calcium indicators can pick up,
and give us a decent,
uh,
signal that we can pick up,
pick up with microscopy.
Yeah,
the other,
um,
idea that I heard was that the neuron expands when it fires,
and,
right,
and that would be another way to detect it,
potentially?
Yeah,
so those signals are really low,
so I've,
I've done,
so this sort of family of,
um,
techniques where you're measuring neuronal activity,
or brain activity,
using these intrinsic,
you know,
that,
where you don't put any indicator in,
we call it intrinsic imaging,
um,
and,
there's lots of different signals,
signal sources,
one,
like you said,
is cell swelling,
there's changes in birefringence,
um,
you can also look at changes in blood oxygenation,
that is,
that are then correlated,
you know,
at,
at a larger length scale,
anyway,
with,
with,
uh,
neural activity.
those signals are on the order of,
you know,
like one part in 10,000,
they're very weak signals,
and typically you can't separate out individual neurons in vivo and in dense neural pill,
um,
so the calcium indicators let us do that.
You're right,
that there are other optical signals there,
but they're typically so weak that we can't really use it in intact tissue.
And,
and not for cellular resolution,
anyway.
We still do intrinsic imaging in my lab all the time,
using a,
um,
uh,
hemodynamic signals around 700 nanometers,
of course,
um,
blood,
deoxygenated blood and oxygenated blood have,
uh,
fairly different absorbents of 700 nanometer light,
and we use that as a contrast mechanism for mapping out,
kind of macroscopic brain's,
um,
activity,
but that doesn't give us cells.
I had a micro question real quick.
What,
what did you say?
Vib,
uh,
vibring,
vibringence?
What was that word?
Oh,
birefringence.
Birefringence.
Could you spell that?
Um,
yeah,
sure.
Um,
let,
let,
let,
let me just,
I'll check this one real quick.
Okay,
yeah,
B-I-R-E-F-R-I-N-G-E-N-C-E.
Thanks very much.
So,
so,
yeah,
this,
this is just,
um,
uh,
this is light that has,
so it's a property,
crystals have it,
typically crystals have it,
um,
any anisotropic material has it,
it's,
uh,
the,
um,
the numerical,
uh,
well,
the index of refraction that light experiences depends on its polarization.
That's what that,
um,
property refers to.
So,
as,
as polarized light,
people arise light experience different indices of refraction.
Thanks for that.
Due to anisotropic,
yeah,
in the,
in the material.
So,
um,
thank you,
um,
Dr.
Smith,
like,
I've been listening attentively,
in fact,
like,
um,
um,
sort of like an optics slash optics person,
biomedical engineer,
optics person,
who's as well as interested in neuroscience.
It's,
it was very illuminating.
I had,
um,
some few questions.
I think like there's,
uh,
sort of like a confluence between what hero she was asking,
but,
uh,
it's kind of like taking notes with that.
So,
first thing is that I'm really surprised that you were able to,
um,
implement adaptive optics.
It's such a small scale using MEMS,
which is,
uh,
quite a feat on the to itself.
But,
um,
does that help you to kind of increase the,
um,
depth information?
Because that's what,
um,
adaptive optics is kind of,
um,
more geared towards to,
especially like in astrophysics.
Um,
so does that increase your,
you know,
that depth information,
or the lack of depth information that you,
clearly suffered from like a two foot tall microscopy?
So,
uh,
yeah,
so first we're using an off the shelf deformable mirror.
So this is from Boston Micro Machines.
Um,
I,
I didn't build a novel MEMS,
um,
deformable mirror for this.
We,
we bought what,
what,
um,
Boston Micro Machines already sells.
Uh,
and,
and we also have an Al Powell one.
Uh,
this is a French company,
um,
to make these,
uh,
much larger stroke.
They're not MEMS based,
but they,
they have a much larger stroke.
So that can give you more defocus.
But yeah,
for those who are listening,
who are not familiar with adaptive optics,
um,
so really astronomers,
uh,
developed this.
So the,
the atmosphere distorts imaging through it.
And,
and what you can do is you can,
um,
you can shoot a laser up into the upper atmosphere and make sort of a guide star.
And then you know that that should be a point source.
You can measure the,
the aberration making it to that,
um,
and being an image of that,
what should be a point source and then make the opposite aberration on a mirror.
And all of a sudden you get sharper pictures through your telescope.
Um,
and so this is something that they've developed.
You can make this whole thing closed loop so that you measure what the aberration is and correct for it right away.
Or you can have an open loop where you just kind of step through a,
um,
you know,
some sort of orthogonal basis set to figure out how to deform your mirror to correct whatever aberrations you will have.
So in this system,
we're using the deformable mirror,
um,
you know,
in the middle of the field of view and for most of the,
the Z range,
even it,
it doesn't make much of a difference where really,
um,
becomes powerful is if we're imaging a sample that has some,
some,
um,
something about it that is causing aberration.
So sometimes that's the tissue itself.
Sometimes it's the way the cover slip is on top of the brain or something.
Um,
the deformable mirror can help a lot with that.
And the other place that it helps is at the edge of the field of view.
So all microscope objectives that you buy or anybody makes,
they,
they're all optimized to work well on axis.
And to some degree,
their performance falls off as you go off axis.
One of the things that we did in the design of both this system and the Trepin 2P is that we've really optimized all of the optics so that they would work as well at the most extreme edge as they do on axis, which usually you don't do.
If you're Zeiss or Olympus or Nikon or something,
you,
you want it to work well on axis and you know,
there's going to be a degradation of performance as you go off axis,
but nobody really cares as long as it's not too bad.
And,
uh,
what we did,
usually try to get as good as we could.
Um,
but you know,
there's still a degradation as you get off to the edge.
Once you start,
if you've got precision optics,
you start building stuff,
there's,
there's limits to real world optics and how precise you can position them.
And so,
um,
when we're really at the very edge of the field of view,
actually even outside of where we expected to be,
let's see,
neuron.
So we're up like three and a half.
This is five millimeters by five millimeters.
So,
off in the corner,
we're up like 3.5 millimeters off from the center.
Um,
we had some pretty bad aberrations,
just regular,
um,
you know,
uh,
optical aberrations that were well characterized by,
um,
Zernike coefficients.
And so we were able to kind of step through,
um,
Zernike coefficients and find a,
uh,
a command to send to the deformable mirror to cancel out that aberration and
recover high resolution imaging at the very edge of the field of view.
Um,
and then that's what we typically use a deformable mirror for.
Um,
it's just squeezing out a bit more resolution,
a bit higher fidelity,
um,
you know,
a little bit of brightness,
uh,
when we're,
when imaging conditions are,
not ideal.
We can also use a fast Z translation.
Um,
but yeah,
we,
and we didn't read that paper,
but in practice,
we don't typically need to do that.
Yeah.
Um,
great.
So my other question is that have you experimented with some kind of,
uh,
exogenous fluorophores as opposed to calcium imaging,
of course,
calcium imaging,
as we know,
it's,
um,
sort of well-established imaging technique,
but I've seen some research papers where they kind of boosted the amount of
intracellular calcium that would have some kind of trade off between cell site,
uh,
uh,
cell toxicity.
Um,
uh,
but,
but yeah,
do you think that,
uh,
implementing your technique,
um,
as,
as two photon would work well with,
uh,
endogenous,
like,
uh,
endogenous or exogenous fluorophores,
and if you've explored that,
that route.
So I've done a little bit with like trying to,
um,
there is an endogenous autofluorescence and some of it is coupled to metabolism.
Um,
and I've tried to image that before,
but the,
but the endogenous fluorescence is really weak.
Um,
so we have done some with,
uh,
second harmonic generation that,
that we've done.
I don't know if that,
um,
is of interest of you,
to you,
but that's,
uh,
um,
that's something we've done.
We've also imaged,
um,
you know,
fluorescent proteins that are not reporting it,
that are not calcium indicators.
So we've,
we've done just plain GFP,
um,
and as far as the label animal to,
to look at,
um,
very fine structure.
So sub micron,
um,
uh,
dendritic spines,
but,
uh,
yeah,
as far as endogenous fluorescence,
uh,
it's typically so weak.
It's not something that we've spent a lot of time on.
Uh,
this system was really built for calcium imaging.
And what's special about this is that it has,
you know,
25 square millimeters over which we have,
um,
micron resolution and,
um,
and,
and we can capture things simultaneously.
We've got multiple beams going into sampling.
Most of the time you don't need that,
right?
So if you're imaging dead tissue or something that's,
that's happening much more slowly on a multiple seconds,
timescale,
you can use other instruments.
You don't need this,
right?
We had,
we had to build this because we needed sub second resolution,
um,
over a large field of view and high resolution.
And that particular constellation of,
of parameters,
um,
wasn't,
wasn't fit by anything that we could just buy.
And so that's why we had to build it.
So,
uh,
the other,
um,
I think difficulty when it comes to buy,
like imaging type tissue is the,
the scattering effect.
Like the,
you know,
human tissue in general has a large scattering coefficient,
um,
or reduced scattering coefficient.
Um,
but,
uh,
do you think that you can achieve more,
you know,
better resolutions by implementing,
um,
uh,
other imaging modalities along with the two photon microscopy that you just
developed?
Like,
for example,
uh,
I've seen,
um,
applications where acoustics was actually used to kind of guide the
light into,
uh,
deeper tissue where,
um,
they were able to kind of achieve,
um,
deeper,
deeper imaging,
and also stimulation.
So do you think you can,
your system can actually benefit from these kind of,
um,
modalities that are like in conjunction with the two photon that you
just developed?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I know some of that work actually.
I know some of the people who do that work.
Um,
that's really cool.
Using ultrasound to kind of make sort of a guide star deeper,
modulate fluorescence and have that tagged so that they could
image deeper in scattering tissue.
Yeah.
So some of those techniques,
and to briefly answer your question,
some of those techniques are compatible with the system.
Uh,
not all of them,
but some of them are.
We haven't done much with,
with implementing them.
We've been doing mostly vanilla,
um,
two photon imaging where we are,
um,
you know,
it's,
it's fairly easy to see five,
six,
700 microns down.
And that for,
for our,
on the neuroscience side of the lab,
that gets us the,
the,
the data that we need.
Um,
we haven't done much with three photon imaging,
although we do have,
this is all in published,
but we have a,
uh,
three photon version of this system that,
that we've recently,
uh,
um,
fabricated and are still,
um,
testing.
But,
uh,
we haven't done anything with the more exotic kind of,
like,
who are younger or,
um,
or some of the,
the photoacoustic type techniques for imaging even deeper in tissue.
But I,
I like that work.
It's,
it's fascinating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This will be my sort of like last question,
at least for now.
But,
uh,
do you think,
um,
he can actually achieve,
um,
as far as we know,
like,
you know,
the optogenetics is like you kind of,
um,
you need to have,
um,
uh,
optical fiber guided into,
um,
transgenic model,
mice model,
or,
uh,
whichever model that you have.
But,
uh,
basically you need some kind of light source,
um,
that's going to be guided in right now.
I think like,
we have,
um,
diodes that are kind of really tuned to that specific wavelength that,
that options can be,
um,
stimulated.
But do you think that you can achieve this using,
uh,
two photon instead of like imaging as opposed to imaging,
you can just,
uh,
stimulate options.
Uh,
in a more directed way.
Well,
yeah,
I mean,
we've,
um,
the field has been doing multi-photon excitation of opsins,
um,
for a while now.
And it's,
it's challenging,
um,
but you can do it.
The,
the challenges that you need to activate.
So,
um,
so,
so I,
I've,
I've mentioned before,
I'm just around the people who are listening.
Um,
you're,
you're clearly sophisticated about this,
but for others that are listening.
So optogenetics are,
are a way that you can genetically engineer neurons to express proteins that gate ion flow across the membrane,
um,
when,
um,
when they're stimulated by light.
And there's some that suppress neural activity and some that activate neural activity.
For most experiments,
people are doing this with one photon excitation.
They're genetically engineering some neurons and some board in the brain.
And just,
just like,
uh,
um,
the,
the,
uh,
our colleague just mentioned,
they put a fiber optic in there to flood the area with light with one photon excitation.
In a smaller number of studies,
uh,
multi-photon excitation has been used.
And what's nice about that is that then you can target individual cells and you can say,
I want to turn on or turn off these three cells and leave all the rest untouched.
And that's,
of course,
that,
that level of precision is,
of course,
um,
uh,
very powerful.
Um,
I think the field is still figuring out how to use that and,
and make use out of it.
Um,
most of the experiments that I've seen to date have been,
um,
you know,
in,
in terms of their,
their theoretical framework,
have,
have been fairly basic.
Um,
but the,
uh,
uh,
and I don't,
don't mean that in a,
in a negative sense.
I'm just trying to,
to be descriptive.
It's,
um,
they've been,
uh,
uh,
it's still early days of figuring out what are the good experiments and how do we get insight from that approach.
But that's what we built the system for.
So we have two scan engines going in there.
We can have one scan engine dedicated to stimulating or suppressing individual neurons,
um,
and leaving everything else untouched.
Um,
and then the other pathway imaging general activity in that same population.
Thank you.
Um,
if anybody else has questions,
please,
um,
do ask.
Thank you for your questions.
This is fun.
That is really cool with just stimulating one neuron.
Um,
especially if you would have,
um,
expressing different inputs coming in,
whether,
you know,
I did that,
like I injected different inputs that come into the striatum.
And what I couldn't do was,
um,
stimulate them separately very well.
Um,
you know,
of course you can use TTX and stuff like that,
but,
um,
that would be actually really very useful if you,
um,
inject,
um,
different options and different inputs,
you know,
that are excitable at different wavelengths.
You know,
nowadays we have like options that you can stimulate,
um,
um,
with different wavelengths that,
um,
you can detangle them apart,
but then also to,
um,
to be sure that you're only stimulating that neuron and not the other one right now.
Or,
um,
that,
that would have been very helpful for me.
Yeah.
Maybe in the future again.
Yeah.
You know,
um,
back in 2007,
when,
when some of this stuff was still,
was just kind of coming out,
um,
Michael Heuser and I wrote a little,
uh,
uh,
news and views for,
uh,
actually the first paper that had,
uh,
by direction control from Diceroth's lab,
of Veng Zhang and,
and,
um,
and colleagues and,
and Carl Diceroth.
And,
and we were,
you know,
our mind was racing with,
as soon as this technology was developed,
we wanted to be able to kind of play the brain like a piano,
just kind of,
um,
you know,
really orchestrate neuronal activity and really test theories of,
you know,
coding.
Um,
and what we,
we being not only Michael and I,
but the whole field have realized is that it's much,
it's much easier to daydream about that than it is to actually develop
experiments and execute them,
um,
and,
and gain insight.
It's,
and,
and one of the difficulties,
there's multiple difficulties,
but one of the difficulties is that for any neuron that you might be looking at,
it's receiving input from not only the local area there,
but a large fraction of its input is,
it's coming from millimeters away.
A lot of it is subcortical.
Um,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's really tough to encapsulate what makes a particular neuron fire and
neuronal activity or neuronal circuitry that underlies complex behavior is
widely distributed in the brain.
Most of our tools are really designed to look at one little part of the brain at a
time.
And so in recognition of that,
that's why we wanted to make a system that,
that could capture the dynamics across a larger field of view,
but this still doesn't solve all the problems.
It's an improvement.
It helps,
but it's,
it's still only capturing cortical activity in this large area.
It's still not capturing subcortical activity.
Um,
you know,
it's,
I,
I like that it's giving these individual cells with high fidelity.
Um,
but it's extremely frustrating that it's basically limited to cortex.
Um,
we could,
we can also image through grand lenses and things to look at,
at subcortical structures,
but even that,
then,
then you're,
you're looking kind of through a,
a tunnel at a small population of neurons.
It's still really difficult to reconstruct the,
the large scale neuronal activity that underlies complex behavior.
Yeah.
So could you under anesthesia,
I don't know.
Um,
is it different?
Is it easier than anesthesia?
I mean,
I,
I,
what I was referring to was mostly in slice,
um,
or in cultures,
you know,
where you,
even there,
if you could,
um,
easily,
um,
stimulate,
uh,
one or two neurons,
but separately,
you know,
that you know exactly,
just stimulating that one and not the others.
Yeah.
And then look at the network and the slice,
that,
you know,
I'll just explain really briefly.
Um,
I did like a very experiments where I injected like two regions and then looked at,
um,
which two regions combined,
um,
could,
um,
generate an upstate easier in like spiny,
uh,
projection.
And,
um,
um,
because I saw in vivo that when I combined,
um,
behaviors,
um,
um,
um,
um,
and then with sensor and motor inputs up to genetic,
um,
stimulation,
like LTP,
or just LTD stimulation,
I could,
uh,
just with a few seconds a day get it into a compulsive behavior.
Um,
and then I looked into the slice and then,
um,
repeated,
you know,
two inputs.
And then,
um,
I saw that there's two different inputs like the amygdala and the sensory motor input would generate way higher upstates than all other combined two inputs that I injected.
Okay.
But I could never dissect out.
I could never make a time or dissect out which input I'm stimulating because I injected in two and,
um,
I could never dissect out,
you know,
doing things like this timely manner.
Um,
I'm stimulating this and then,
you know,
a millisecond later,
I stimulate that at that frequency.
And this is what's giving me upstates and stuff like that.
So I was thinking about those experiments.
But,
um,
yeah,
I would imagine if you would be,
would be also cool to do that to,
let's say,
stimulate,
um,
one or two or three,
um,
and so on and so forth until you get that threshold to turn things into compulsive behavior and stuff like that.
So can you also do that?
Like you can,
um,
do like one,
two,
three up to whatever you need.
You're right.
And I,
I think you,
you've got a good experiment though that you just outlined.
Um,
I've seen that mechanistically,
that experiment done in cortex where they stimulate one,
two,
three or four until they get like an avalanche of activity or some large amount of activity.
And they just kind of see where the threshold is.
Um,
but that's in a,
in a cortical region,
which is not necessarily dialed into behavior and same sort of phenomena that you're talking about.
Um,
so that,
that's a great example of where I think somebody should use,
you know,
an optical cannula or a grand lens or something like that.
Um,
in order to,
to ask that question in vivo and,
and,
uh,
in an intact animal in that subcortical structure,
a single photon.
I don't recall off the top of my head,
anybody doing single,
um,
doing,
you know,
single neuron resolution optogenetics,
multi-photon optogenetics,
the grew,
a grand lens,
and demo.
Um,
it,
you know,
on first principles,
it seems like it should be possible to do.
Um,
but I,
I can't recall.
Well,
the case where I've just done it yet.
Yeah,
no,
but I think it would be really interesting.
because there's a paper from my barring with,
um,
I guess cortical regions that,
um,
influence quite significantly,
like,
let's say,
compulsive behavior.
It's just a good model,
right,
to have,
um,
because first it's just a regular behavior,
and then you'll kind of have a certain type of system going on,
like,
with those behaviors.
And,
you know,
one could repeat those experiments,
and then check out
how many neurons do you have,
and then check out how many neurons do you have,
do you need to actually,
and their timing,
and then maybe some retrograde,
um,
stuff,
and,
you know,
how much is labeled,
and where,
um,
I don't,
I,
okay,
yeah,
I'll,
I'll let other people see,
but,
yeah,
this is,
this is,
this is Suzanne Tamari's paper,
is everything?
Yes.
Yeah,
she's great.
Yeah.
Hi,
this is Roche again,
sorry,
I'm immensely enjoying this conversation,
so,
but,
um,
just,
let me make a quick comment,
regarding Katarina's work,
that may be applicable,
is that she's doing a lot of LTP,
clearly the traditional way of looking at,
for example,
calcium influxes,
uh,
working on the NMDA,
maybe one,
but,
you know,
I actually made a career studying nitric oxide synthase,
because we're the first to knock out those genes,
um,
that's probably about 20 years ago,
and,
uh,
one of the things that I have to say,
that,
you know,
relevant to Spencer's,
uh,
technology,
uh,
being,
uh,
one that can look at the fluorescence,
uh,
capability,
is that you can use reporters,
such as,
uh,
let's say,
uh,
uh,
um,
um,
uh,
FURA-2,
or some other,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,
reporters,
that then can,
um,
look at nitric oxide activity,
so,
there are many,
uh,
I guess,
in GES ways that we,
you could use different reporters or excitable,
you know,
um,
reinforcement proteins,
et cetera,
uh,
that can take advantage of what fast scanning and functional imaging will do.
That's one thing that my ideal,
of OCT cannot do because,
you know,
it cannot,
uh,
respond to fluorescence.
Um,
and a quick comment about auto fluorescence is sometimes,
you know,
if you look at different organs that does have a lot of relevance in my field and gastroenterology,
you know,
when we're looking at,
for example,
eosinophils,
they auto fluoresce very well,
so,
when we use convocal endomicography,
we're able to use that in enumeration for such diseases,
eosinophilic,
uh,
esophagitis and things like this.
So,
um,
you know,
sometimes what you see is disturbing,
which luckily the brain is relatively low on these kind of auto fluorescence matters,
but,
uh,
sometimes they have clinical relevance in another organ.
and,
and,
um,
and just reflecting on a business comment about,
you know,
the scatter,
um,
you know,
in my field,
you know,
that we,
we also have,
uh,
elastic scatter spectroscopy,
um,
you know,
in our,
uh,
endoscopy unit,
and,
uh,
we use that actually because the major scatter is the nucleus,
and we can use that to look at,
for example,
dysplasia and disease and early cancer.
So,
again,
you know,
what you see as a problem can sometimes be a tool,
like,
you could look at,
too.
Well,
just a few thoughts.
I'm telling you about it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
And one quick,
in an addition,
could you also use that,
um,
for rent,
actually,
uh,
like,
modulating,
um,
yeah,
yeah,
you,
yeah,
you,
you asked for a rent,
right?
What the hell?
Can you use a rent?
Yeah.
Yes,
there are some indicators that are,
are rent-based indicators,
um,
and,
uh,
so there's rent-based calcium indicators,
and there's rent-based indicators for,
you know,
other,
intercellular processes as well.
Uh,
most of our work to date,
we haven't used it that much,
but they're,
they have their place where they can be extremely important.
Um,
you know,
Riohei Yasuda is,
is one name that comes to mind,
who's,
who's gotten,
um,
um,
a lot of use,
uh,
a lot of,
a lot of us have,
a lot of front reporters for different types of biochemical cascades that take place inside of cells,
and neurons in particular,
uh,
around synaptic,
plus Disney changes in the strength of connections between neurons.
So we have,
we haven't done projects on that just now,
but that's,
you know,
it's,
it's all the same equipment.
So there's,
uh,
there's nothing in the way of,
of,
of,
we just need to get a mouse and put it on and image it.
But,
uh,
yeah,
it's going to be the same way.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah,
I worked,
um,
during August and November.
I did this too.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know,
I don't know,
I've got an eye on it.
I've got it.
And,
um,
yeah.
And it would probably be cool to see,
like,
inhibition spread all throughout the world.
I think inhibitionists,
I know the study,
but it would really be cool to see,
but,
what we did with inhibition,
it would work,
obviously.
Yeah,
I agree.
It's,
um,
lots of the worst few times they've just been,
There's just been many calcium indicators inside of inhibitory neurons,
in particular, the different kind of genetically target subpopulations
of inhibitory neurons, and that's been, you know,
some of that's been hard to synthesize across multiple studies
and have kind of varying results.
But another way to look at it, like you're saying,
is looking at, you know, chloride signaling inside of individual cells
or kind of what's the pattern of input that's inhibitory inside of a single cell,
and that I've seen much less, and I think there's actually, like you said,
I mean, there's kind of deep, you know, sort of thing that takes more.
Yeah, to, I don't want to ask you, I mean, develop that,
you know, like, of course, and we kind of, we try to enhance it,
we try to tag it to different cover risk,
because there's been disability work,
like the end of the brain that she doesn't have to write,
but then to the work of some of the things that have nice work to help me.
So, for now, that's the best for, like, genetic work indicator,
and I don't currently know, because I'm currently working
to the disability also, and it would be interesting to see.
Yeah, I agree, I agree.
Yeah, Rush, do you want to ask a question?
You need to cover the chat, yeah.
Yeah, Rush, we can't hear you.
Yeah, um, maybe he'll be back soon, because, uh, all of you is here.
We can't hear you earlier, so if you want to ask a question, please ask it now.
Yeah, thanks, um, okay, I think I'm audible now.
Um, so I just want to understand the, uh, independent scan engines, uh, um,
I had to fully follow the paper, but is there something like, um,
using two independent signals to generate an interference pattern?
No, no, sorry, not an interference pattern, but basically you're measuring two independent,
um, variables at once, and using that to, um, using both the results to extrapolate what
you're actually looking at.
Is that, is that correct?
Uh, not quite.
Right, so, so basically each scan engine acts like a single scan engine would in a conventional
laser scanning microscope.
So the laser, um, is scanned in raster patterns, so just line by line across the tissue, uh,
to measure changes in, um, calcium indicator dynamics.
And the second pathway can do the exact same thing, um, and it's, it's completely independent.
So there's, there's, uh, we're doing temporal multiplexing, so there's tiny little time windows,
so 6.25 nanosecond time windows, uh, that, that switch between the two pathways so that
they can scan simultaneously, um, but they're completely independent.
So one can be scanning a few cells, and the other one could be looking at a completely different
part of the brain and imaging that.
So, so that's what we meant by them being independent scan engines.
We're not trying, we don't need any kind of interference pattern between them at all.
They don't need to cooperate at all.
They're completely independent samples of everything within that same field of view.
So they both have access to the same optical volume, and they can measure neuronal activity
in whatever neurons are in that optical volume, in that, that, that field of view.
Now, we've been talking a lot about object genetics and, um, manipulating neuronal activity.
So there's, there's spectral separation in there.
So, um, we can have one pathway be a, uh, uh, uh, uh, activating neurons, and the other
one then imaging activity in all those neurons.
Now, what's, the way that's been done in the past is that you have both lasers going in
one scan engine, and you just, uh, gate one or the other, and you have both, um, so for
example, you could very quickly activate a few neurons and then go back to the other
wavelength in the skin.
And so this one, I, I don't mention this, I didn't mention this at the beginning, but the
way the beams are being combined is with polarization.
It's not with wavelength.
So, you can actually set up an experiment where you have an octogenetic laser going in for
manipulating neural activity and an imaging laser going into both pathways.
You can have four lasers going into this and do a very complicated experiment where you
are manipulating a very neural activity in two different brain areas at the same time.
And that's really amazing, just to say, because it's always a problem in my experience.
There are two ways to get the cutoff signal, because I had to play, and it takes a few more
seconds to transition, and the PNTs get that much, and so on, so it's really cool.
Yeah, I've experimented with different ways to do, um, to, I mean, it's one night,
the biggest thing about doing multi-photon optogenetics is that you don't have to keep
the PNT, you do one photon optogenetics plus 2% of the PNT, like you said, you need a shutter
in front of the PNT, or you need some fast one, I, I did, I did build a rake that was
based on switchable PNT, but even that, I mean, just the, there's a big compromise on
the calcium imaging doing that, so doing everything multi-photon, kind of helps a little bit.
And, um, and, you mentioned you were taking advantage of, um, fluorescence, um, but, um, so,
you said specifically with calcium, so, um, to, just to clarify, you're, you're measuring
mostly, uh, photons, and, um, you're, um, you're measuring, um, well, it's an image, right,
so you're basically capturing an image of the fluorescent, uh, photons that are emitted by
the calcium markers, uh, is that correct, or is there anything else that's also being sensed?
Uh, I, I, I think kind of basically, right, so I, uh, there's a calcium indicator protein
that is a fusion between, uh, the green fluorescent protein and calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein,
and to get a fusion protein, fluorescence more misbound calcium, and so that's reducing
to report changes in calcium concentrations thatself.
Um, it may, may use a diode, but, um, but, uh, yeah, that's what we're talking about.
Okay, awesome, thank you, and, um, one last question, I think, uh, Clarissa signed us out.
So, calcium deposits, and in my understanding, um, calcium is sort of like, uh, um, when the brain
successfully, rather, um, successfully carries out a pathway, um, it reinforces that pathway
with calcium, saying that, okay, this was, this worked last time, so let's look at this
more actively next time. Um, is that correct? Now, so, whenever we have brain activity,
we generally have calcium deposits that go along the pathways that the successfully triggered.
Uh, so, it sounds like you're talking about synaptic plasticity, and sort of the,
you know, the reconfiguration of the circuitry, and the operating and the memory, and,
for a lot of those, like, two little cascades, and the process is calcium as a major player.
Um, it's not the same process that every neuron has done.
It's not a lot of repeating pathways that also use calcium, so it's complicated.
Um, but the initial answer is, you know, calcium is a huge player.
