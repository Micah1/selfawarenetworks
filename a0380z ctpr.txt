humanity is an information pattern eating other information patterns that eat other patterns in an infinite cycle of dissipative patterns, like hurricanes, galaxies, stars, planets, life, cells, chemicals, atoms, and particles eating other patterns. Or you can switch into the acasual way of thinking, and trust that all the rights and wrongs are mathematically balanced out because this existence is one mathematically perfect karma equation. That non-duality is the realization that all distinctions balance out to either 1 or 0. Nothing is good or bad in casuality, but life has a clear direction of right in acasuality. The reward patterns, from acausality directing causality. The reward pattern creates, shapes, and carves human existence, and the existence of all intelligent life.
