~~Amplitude~~ magnitude (SAN)
Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances

Would could potentially slow down the firing of many of its neighbors if they are firing faster,

And the slowing effect would be stronger than the weak but faster phasic bursts

Phasic burst might be characterized as being faster but also having a sparser distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters

And its signals would be narrower but perhaps have a longer range and they would travel across longer distances of the network before being dissipated.

It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits.
