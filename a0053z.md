The Phasic Tonic Relationship.

(oscillation magnitude)
~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

The high phasic burst could potentially slow down the firing of many of its exit terminal neighbors by inhibiting them with a flood of extra neurotransmitters.

And the slowing effect would have a higher spatial magnitude than the smaller but faster phasic bursts.

Phasic burst might be characterized as being higher frequency but also causing a greater magnitude distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters.

The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.

Perhaps the phasic & high phasic signals, at least as soliton waves across the electromagnetic spectrium, might have a longer range, they would travel across longer distances of the network before eventually being dissipated by the rest of the oscillating groups of cells.

The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.

As if the relationship between the phasic signals and the tonic signals was like an Etch in Sketch toy, the magnetic pin is etching with phasic burstlets, and shaking the toy is dissipating the learned signal back into an equilibrium state or an empty slate. That's kind of a rough analogy.

It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits. I think there is research to back this up, if I remember correctly, so search for citations to bolster this.


Recapping the Phasic Tonic Relationship, the high phasic spike, creates a burstlet, that creates an inhibitory wave (a sharp wave ripple across the brain) that starts with it's direct exit terminal array, the phasic spikes are dissipated into the tonic oscillation, so there is a relationship between the tonic brainwave pattern (like the theta brainwave pattern) and the incoming sensory pathways.

I think this paper below describes one example of how that relationship between phasic spikes from incoming senses, from the eyes, interfaces with an organisms actions, the steps that it takes, to navigate.

"Newly discovered neural network gets visual and motor circuits in sync"
""One of the most remarkable aspects of our finding is that this network supports walking on two different timescales simultaneously," said Chiappe. "It operates on a fast timescale to monitor and correct each step while promoting the animal's behavioral goal.""
""Vision and action may seem unrelated, but they are actually tightly associated; just choose a point on the wall and try placing your finger on it with your eyes closed,""
""The longer the fly has been walking fast, the higher are the chances that it would need help to maintain this action plan. Therefore, the neurons become increasingly 'more alert' and ready to be recruited for movement control.""
