The Phasic Tonic Relationship.

(oscillation magnitude)
~~Amplitude~~ Action Potential Magnitude Effect (APME)
Its possible that a high magnitude vesicle release is more likely to open potassium/sodium channels at the same time in some instances. This could cause the inhibitory or shutdown effect. Like overwhelming or flooding the gates, which would take more time to clear & reset. Temporarily slowing down that gear in the clock mechanism so to speak. So my hypothesis or conjecture is that the phasic or high phase action potential burst leaves the calcium channels open longer resulting in 2 or 3 vesicle sacks being released, resulting in inhibition of array represented by the exit terminal of that neuron.

The high phasic burst could potentially slow down the firing of many of its exit terminal neighbors by inhibiting them with a flood of extra neurotransmitters.

And the slowing effect would have a higher spatial magnitude than the smaller but faster phasic bursts.

Phasic burst might be characterized as being higher frequency but also causing a greater magnitude distribution of vesicles and neurotransmitters.

The signals that cause a Phasic or High Phasic spike might require higher frequency signalling that has a lower magnitude of neurotransmitters per interval.

Perhaps the phasic & high phasic signals, at least as soliton waves across the electromagnetic spectrium, might have a longer range, they would travel across longer distances of the network before eventually being dissipated by the rest of the oscillating groups of cells.

The higher magnitude tonic signals are the oscillating groups of cells that are leveling out or dissipating the energy which represents the incoming phasic signals.

As if the relationship between the phasic signals and the tonic signals was like an Etch in Sketch toy, the magnetic pin is etching with phasic burstlets, and shaking the toy is dissipating the learned signal back into an equilibrium state or an empty slate. That's kind of a rough analogy.

It would be the phasic signals that travel between oscillators, cortical columns, rich clubs, default mode network, majority networking areas, and interneuron neural circuits. I think there is research to back this up, if I remember correctly, so search for citations to bolster this.
