(neurotransmitter)
I got into a random conversation with some woman at the mall the other day. She is majoring in mathematics of all subjects, about to begin studying calculus. I told her I did neurofeedback and she wanted my business card. A card that is now almost two years old. Later after she was gone I really looked at that old card again. What it promised, what it was all about, what inspired me in the first place. I had a lot of skepticism. It drove me deeper into my research. I've had amazing experiences but that wasn't enough. I needed to understand the mechanics of what was happening. How neurofeedback and brainwave entrainment effected braincells, metabolism, spiking, frequencies, neurotransmitters, cortical thalamic loops, large brain structures, and large regional activity. More than that, I needed to know what it was doing to a person, to a neuromorphic dynamic attractor soul. The past two years have been like falling through a seemingly endless rabbit hole, with each new scenario more strange, more frightening, and more interesting than the previous. It seems like some new bigger idea has to peak in my mind, totally overtaking it, becoming dominant, displacing other ideas, as a pre-requisite to another threshold of the mind. So I find myself flying, quite without realizing it, a revaluation is taking place. Here I was trying to hold on, and all I needed to do was let go.
