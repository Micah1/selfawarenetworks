Micah Blumberg Wow! Anand! That was awesome! Why don't you distort each image, prior to making it sparse, by 10hz, or 10 degrees, to give it two eyes or two ears? Then you have a hierarchy that is all about matching two eye or two ear hierarchies. The hierarchy to unite the two sense hierarchies is the time hierarchy. It's job is to build a representation when there are close synchronicity between the two sense hierarchies. So that their is a timeline association of sensory data, when new data comes in. The timeline association data becomes like a google search

for example, if you give the program a sentence like: Cats are fun! it does a google search to find similar sentences.

funny cats,
funny cats in water, epic,
cats funny, 
probably the funniest cat video you'll ever see, 
fun cats, 
funny cat pictures

sending that data to v1, it might create a visual concept of a funny cat, that is now associated with the words "cats are fun!" and the 

each eye in v1 + timeline representation is creating a sort of temporal and spatial representation of all the bits of data coming in at each level.

so we have spatial/temporal representations of the lower bits (not knowing what's in those lower bits, what's in them is the job of the v1 alone for example)

and spatial/temporal representations of each higher level of the hierarchy (again without knowing the data in that hierarchy, it's filled in by the hierarchy, the spatial/temporal association is built by the frequency of activity in each sector.

or you could store the timeline locally, on the actual hierarchy, like a dendrite. each node in the hierarchy has nodes that count the frequency in which they become part of a representation identified by the upper level or lower level.

The program can share what it's representations mean by doing google searches, to find things that are similar to what it has learned, and in so doing, it can build representations of it's representations and associate words, and pictures with it's internal representations, a sort of out put channel, communication

Micah Blumberg Anand, is an SDR a set or a matrix? or is an SDR a set that represents a matrix? Can an matrix represent a combination of SDR? Or does a matrix represent a combination of SDR?

Micah Blumberg If you have a matrix for a letter, in the next level being a word/noun/verb, in the next level a phrase, in the next level a sentence that has encoded meaning. Do you create an SDR or a Matrix that represents the whole sentence in memory? So that the meaning of one sentence can be associated with the meaning of other sentences is should be an SDR right? SDR is more simple to compare than a Matrix I presume? What happens when you start comparing an SDR from text with SDR from pictures with SDR from sound?

Does the heirarchy gain the ability to associate words with pictures with sounds, and can you decode the result by having it compare it's own results with with more pictures, words, and sounds?

What about a feedback loop by feeding the top of the heirarchy back into the bottom with new pictures, words, and sounds?

Micah Blumberg The top result then gets associated with newly added SDR's. Driving a new top result that is a convergence between what was previously learned, and what is newly added, and at the same time, we can see how the stream of what was previously added is conceptually associated with the stream of new information.
