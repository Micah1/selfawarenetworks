a0312z "Consciousness a memory system" paper review + "The Physics of Representation" paper review

"If you couldn't remember the immediate past second of external inputs and thoughts/memories/... triggered by them, could you still say that you are conscious? In other words, does anybody debate that short term memory is a pillar of consciousness?" some random guy on twitter

# Consciousness as a Memory System
https://journals.lww.com/cogbehavneurol/fulltext/9900/consciousness_as_a_memory_system.19.aspx

The distillation of this paper ^ above, is that it is describing consciousness as a memory system, and it's positioning the memory function as the primary purpose of the function of consciousness. It is essentially a redundant argument as no educated reader would dispute that memory, specifically episodic memory plays a role in human cognition and the experience of being someone ie phenomenological consciousness.

What remains after distilling it is essentially a philosophical argument about the role of memory, and a conjecture that this change in perspective (which is not really a change in the perspective of the educated reader) somehow resolves confusion around the timing of events in human cognition studies.

It's interesting to read if you are still puzzled about how your mind works, but nothing in this paper qualifies as a discovery.

I don't think the ideas are new, I don't think it adds anything new if you have already read existing books & literature on the topics of consciousness.

# Choice as a memory system.

I feel that this paper echoes my own earlier arguments about choice in the context of studies that show that the neural correlates of a decison can appear before someone knows what choice they are going to make. My conjecture was and is that we are pre-planning our choices everytime we think about the future. The brain takes general pre-planned choices, and then it customizes them in real time to real events faster than we are consciously aware sometimes, but in both situations, our choices that we are conscious of, and our choices that we are subconscious or unconscious of, the situation is that choices are computated, and they are computed the same way either way. With phenomenological consciousness becoming important as a sort of higher threshold, higher bandwidth, choice making mechanism.

One of the latest ideas that I have about choice, is that it becomes easier to change when we consider the behavior outcome we did not want as the unacknowledged aggregate summary of a grand choice that is essentially a dominant phase wave differential rhythm. 

What ideas are in this paper for example that do not exist in Daniel Dennet's book "Consciousness Explained" 1991 for example? I can't think of anything.

# Is phenomenological consciousness a memory system or for high level function or for highly coordinated movement?

Perhaps the philosophical argument here could be added to the argument that consciousness enables higher level functionality (Peter Tse: The Neural Basis of Freewill Criterial Causation), and that consciousness is for highly coordinated movement.

This was early work to try to bring what was known about artificial neural networks back to biology. They were trying to connect the concept of inference (think of Jeff Hawkins On Intelligence & Predictive Coding) to the concept of brain representation or internal representation.

Self Aware Networks goes further and argues that the Neural Networks of the brain are accomplishing actual computational rendering to images, sounds, feelings, tastes, smells, and so on.
