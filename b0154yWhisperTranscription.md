# b0154y Concise Summary:
The electro-spectral graph functions as a virtual tectum—a neatly organized map of the sensory field analogous to a frog's tectum that coordinates muscle movements and scene formation. This map, representing the resolution of consciousness, is built from both place cell (where you are) and grid cell (where you’re not) information, allowing selective attention through focused neural firing and inhibition of surrounding areas. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is likened to a skeletal framework that hints at measuring the resolution of these conscious maps at both macro and micro scales.

So the electro-spectral graph, the electromagnetic spectral graph, serves as a temple-spatial virtual tectum, a neat orderly map of the sensory field, or perceptual field.

Okay, so the interesting thing is that the tectum of frog is a good analogy for the graph, for the spectral graph, creating a map for the coordination of muscle to the coordination of muscle movement, and then a scene.

The resolution of consciousness is important because it basically serves as a map, a surface map for the coordination of muscle movements, so consciousness serves as a map for muscle movements. And Michael, Michael essays attention schema, sort of like illustrates how neurons can selectively pay attention to certain areas of the map when they are firing, basically, but also inhibiting the surrounding neurons to be, to be quiet, or basically inhibiting their tonic firing.

That draws attention to part of the map, but the map is a map of the receptive field. It's actually a map of the potential receptive field, because the receptive field is like what's in front of your eye, for example, or what's in front of your ear, but that's like place cell information. The receptive field that you're not paying attention to, you're still mapping, and that is like grid cell information, and it's like a map of where you're not. So the place cell is like a map of where you are, and the grid cell is like a map of where you're not, so that you have a navigating sense of where you are and why you're not simultaneously.

If IIT is a skeleton, it's a skeleton; and inside, if IIT is a sketch of a skeleton of complex of what the resolution of brain activity could be, the her interval based upon the complexity of the connections with the ability to create the maximal number of patterns—the maximal number of memorable spectral patterns.

So if IIT is like a vague, sort of like allusion to the sample spatial cutting activity of many that leads to what could be a measurement of what could be a future tool in the measurement of the resolution of the map of a frame of consciousness at one particular scale—at the macro scale.

Okay, but it could, it could allude to also a map of micro scale frames.
