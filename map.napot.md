The central thesis of my book Self Aware Networks is N.A.P.O.T. or NAPOT

N.A.P.O.T. is the central thesis for how we can build Self Aware Networks or Conscious (Animal Level) Self Aware Artificial Neural Networks.

N.A.P.O.T. stands for Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography

This note is a map to most of the notes that mention NAPOT in some form, but it is not a complete map to all of the notes that support the idea, because some of the supporting notes do not mention the terminology specifically, and some of the notes predate the acronym.

In my notes hosted on github I refer to it also as Neural Oscillatory Tomography, Neural Oscillation Tomography, Neural Array Projection Tomography, Neural Array-Projection Tomography (hyphen), and Conceptual Tomography, Neural Array Oscillating Projection Tomography

NAPOT is the theory from which existing artificial neural network architectures can be adapted to become Sentient or Conscious & Self Aware Neural Networks with internal representations, internal thoughts, feelings, images, sounds, tastes, smells, animal or human level experiences and so on.

NAPOT is not just about how the brain perceives it's own representations, but it's also how memories scale from synaptic connections to the whole brain, it's also about how information flows through the mind and its connected in the networks of the brain via oscillations.

I wrote down somewhere in the notes on github how it differs from deep neural networks in general and graph neural networks, I need to add more about other types of neural networks that it differents from and essentially I am comparing what the brain does to the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, or to a combination of neural network rendering (think along the lines of NeRF, or Plenoxels or Gan Synthesis or Point Clouds Rendering and combine that with 3D Semantic Segmentation or 3D Object Segmentation + Classification, PointNet++ being an example.)

You are seeing the tomography (not holography) of your brainwaves when you see anything, reality is rendered in the phase variances of your brainwave activity, but it's not you that is seeing anything, it's your neural arrays, the layers in your cortical columns, and the observers are the oscillating groups of cells: the neural circuits & the cortical columns, and any oscillating cell assembling defined as body by a synchronously firing group (of cells in the brain) each neural array is seeing part of this picture, and in time the parts of the picture are bound together in your volumetric experience of reality.

# "Self Aware Neural Networks"

Self Aware Neural Networks are very different from Graph Neural Network that render screens to themselves, because the rendered representations are separate but also interlinked, imagine an after effects or adobe premiere timeline, but in 3D, or with multiple layers that can link together in higher dimensions, sort of like the turtle in the movie that is in the first part of the layer 1 timeline can connect with the rabbit in the last part of the layer 6 timeline. Sensory inputs can generate new layers in this 3D movie, or they can feed existing layers, and the existing layers are maintained in active brainwave activity oscillations (such as alpha and or theta waves for example) and new input, (the turtles new behavior which might be a response to a sequence that your mind links to your own motor output activity)
