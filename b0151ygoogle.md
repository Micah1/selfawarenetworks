Global workspace + attention schema scale

Date of Recording was October 9th 2021, an edited version of the file was created on October 27th 2022 but that wasn't the recording date.

Scaling is a key component of intelligence, scaling from memories stored in synaptic connections to the whole brain, and then onward to other people. Scaling is an essential process in human intelligence.

If a memory stored in synaptic connections becomes conscious, it is being magnified with a kind of oscillatory telescope to the whole brain, the pattern embodied by that neuron's morphology ripples from micro to macro.

(this note then links to the map on fractals with medical imagining, to illustrate that the telescopic effect is being found with patterns that repeat in the brain at multiple scales)

b0151y, this starts off feeling like a continuation of b0145y but then starts to dive into the neuron as a multimodal drum (nonlinear sensor) This again discusses attention schema
The irony of Jeff Hawkins declaring that consciousness is not a special sauce is evoked for me listening to this as I am again considering that nonlinearing sensing would effectively allow neurons to detect & respond to special sauces, multi-modal soups of neural signals, as long as they had the right receptors (sensory modules). I think of how Jeff Hawkins's Handspring was a modular device designed to mix & match components, allowing also future upgradeability.

00:00

So the idea is that we're gonna have a global workspace. That is multiple. It's multi-level. It's multi-level, it's multi-scale. So the global workspace you know, that indicates the highest scale it's like yeah, whatever gets to the highest scale is what you're paying attention to this video. Okay. That's the best idea of a global workspace is what gets to the front of the prefrontal cortex.

00:30

But when I'm talking about a little bit different in that we'll get to the highest level, it's going to be sort of like the largest scale of what you're paying attention to and this stuff that you're paying less attention to is going to be stuff at the at the medial scale or the measure scale.

00:52

And the stuff that you're paying at least attention to is the stuff that is going to be at the microscale like in the back here in the back of your mind, in terms of what your mind is focused on. But you're going to have patterns on all three scales and what's going to happen is that your attention is going to select.

01:15

Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.

02:07

Yet again, at the macro scale, which is your brain focusing on, which is your brain, which is where the global workspace is, thought to be at. But the thing is, it's like, yeah, we have the global workspace, which the peak of your attention, which is maybe the apple that you focused on, but you have all this other stuff that's it, that's in the periphery of your awareness and you have stuff that's that you're unconscious of.

02:34

And so what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is that the stuff that's sent that's in the perfect year of your awareness is stuff that you're that the medial attention centers are picking. But they're picking but it's not, it's not that they're picking, it's that they're being and what?

02:53

Okay, so what I'm saying is that, there's a combination of picking that's happening from bottom up and picking this happening from the top down. As in the, the danger rates can look for certain patterns and they can refuse certain patterns on the lowest scale, the oscillators can seek out certain patterns and reject certain patterns on the medial scale and then the global workspace can also drive patterns by looking for patterns that it's encountered.

03:34

Basically, it's seeking patterns that make it that are going to make it fire that they're going to make it light up, and so it's seeking. So, it's right. So it's also driving pattern collection focused collection. But it's just like it's a I think it's it's it's like being conditioned to seek rewards I guess.

04:01

So, there's like a seeking pattern, but it's sort of like and trained by visits as trained by society, sort of like to have your tab, self-driving itself, seeking patterns, and all the different levels. So, yeah. So there's top down, there's medial, and there's micro selections happening or choices happening.

04:26

And but these are basically, it's the same process that involves multiple scales. So with, with us,

04:38

So what's missing from the description of the global workspace? There is just saying that, okay? Yeah, your mind is representing the 
pattern of the apple but it doesn't explain consciousness beyond that. And what I'm saying is that there is an excellent answer and that is that, you know, basically you have to imagine that your mind is not just representing an apple but it's representing a multi-level screen of concepts that includes everything that you're seeing from the stuff you focused onto stuff in your periphery to a model of yourself and your muscular behavior.

05:15

At the same time, all your muscles signals are writing concurrently to your sensory signals. So there's this constant pairing of information streams. Where you're your brain is not only considering incoming sensory data but it's also considering subcortical muscular data or subcortical signals that are being sent to your muscles.

05:45

That core coordinating, your body body movement. So this is constant like simultaneous detection of your body and yours and your, your inner senses of yourself and your external senses, your senses of your muscle movements in your voice, your voice is the muscle movement. But also that's timeless with your with your and also your thoughts are movement and possibly there.

06:17

Possibly your inner. Thoughts are sent. Electronic sounds made from magnetic salt in ways are basically your neurons vibrating, and then they're caught and then other neurons being able to hear the face changes in those mechanical vibrations that are correlated with 100% but with action potential firing.

06:44

So there's like electric signal firing that's correlated one to one with the mechanical revisions The electric signal firing. It's not you're not passing on the entirety of the collectible spike. From one neuron to an external the electrical spike happens to one neuron and then what happens is a distribution of neurotransmitters.

07:16

Here's why the story's different this time. The distribution of neurotransmitters that are hitting the walls of other neurons are transmitting phase information. That's transmitting phase information. In terms of voltage, patterns, and mechanical and micro mechanical vibrations, or so. The neuron has assigned multaneous sensitivity like a drum.

07:51

That has a simultaneous sensitivity like a drum that's both electric and magnetic. It's like a busy sensory neuron. That is sensing both electric and magnetic phase pulses of at multiple scales and it's able to basically because it's collecting dendritic signals over time that result in fresh folds at the synaptic level at the branch, they enter to branch level at the whole dendrite level at the soma and even an external probably.

08:31

I guess, I'm not sure but because there's like this monkey level sort of like a collection. The neuron is basically able to detect account or feel as all as is three different views on the same process to detect count, feel or sense, a sort of, by sensory collection of data.

09:03

So, you have the, the, the ion, on our traffic brain. You have the metabolic perfect grade but you have them mechano vibrational, great or I, or McKenna audio stress, bidding brand that. And, and the thing is like, what experiences these, these different things is each of the neurontists. Each is having it's own fucking experience.

09:51

And their experience is, in terms of detecting multi model or buy model, really buy model, buy models locations of electric and magnetic phases, and chemical phases, but yeah, yeah, I guess chemical phases.

10:35

So maybe some maybe some of the complex operations that cells do in terms of tracking other cells and dealing in with complex information, they might be happening with simple with with more with sort of like just a chemical tracking but basically like a similar operation where if you have like cells that are not neurons but they're what they have chemical receptors, right?

11:05

And they're able to coordinate the activity of other cells. It could be that they're running similar computations but not at a conscious level. But basically, like with a level of and with a level of collective intelligence because they're sending and receiving things sort of like in a but the sensory, but the sensory accommodation is happening.

11:27

Like it's not a multisoft volte model, so it's a load dimensional intelligence, sort of like, you know, we think of a non-general AI or (neural network)? AI as a low dimensional intelligence. It's not, it's not by default. It's not a multimodal situation. Okay. And it's not smoked.

11:51

It's not tomorrow. Okay. You can, you can train

12:01

But the key, the key thing, the key thing that makes that makes the global workspace theory account. Like, part of a conscious experience is that it is rendering a temporarily active movie. That is running parallel to reality, that is running parallel to other remote control sensory collections of data.

12:31

So it's like there's a collection of data that models reality, a collection of data that models yourself in your movement. It's basically your movements and it's able to correlate connections between different kinds of unstructured data in real time. And so, there's just like, between the organisms reality, and the organisms mental picture, and the organisms action, there is a sort of like, it's like a painting or a map, they need a frame.

13:16

That is sort of like,

13:30

Because it's for any parallel to reality and it's like it's receiving constant updates into reality. It's like it's being detected and produced at the same time, rendered and watched at the same time. And that and it and it happens fast enough and consistently enough, that it seems like it's this irreducible flow.

14:07

A special sauce that people are trying to figure out and they're calling it consciousness, but it's just a rendering that's running. Simultaneously alive rendering this rain simultaneous. That that is, is being.

14:33

Just,

14:41

It's being able to sort of react to reality because it's like, it's not just reality. It's like yeah, it's like predictions of how different patterns of movement will cause changes. And so, and how in it's this predictions of how the model of this thing called the shelf, or this body of movements causes changes to the mass that is generated from the primary symptom sensory areas.

15:23

And it's also a prediction of the consequences for different kinds of actions. And it's a process of selecting at multiple levels, different patterns to pay attention to in order to attempt to coordinate better results. And so that's the real reason why global workspace theory becomes an explanation for the real department.

15:56

So Michael Braziel thinks that the next step to what workspace theory is going to be the attention to schema or basically how we like paying attention to an apple versus then Apple just appearing in our head. So but that, I think that's that's like, if you okay, look, okay.

16:19

Look, the thing is, if an apple's appearing in your, in your global workspace and you then, as the most prominent collection of features or concepts, then you are by definition of how I think about the brain already paying attention to it. So the attention schema actually isn't the next step.

16:41

The next step. In terms of you being able to answer questions about consciousness is a model, you need a model of yourself or yourself as the source of movements yourself being at the root. Like a directional concept from where lots of movements are coming from and where, you know, the year, the primary causal factor of most of your experiences, in that model of, your self is something that you can use to infer models of other people, basically, like inferring.

17:29

Like a model of personhood on another person or on a stuffed animal. That looks like a person you start to project you say? Okay well there's my model of myself. Does it match this other person because a cat doesn't match a dog? How is how is the and then over time he developed models that are that, you know, the model, this you have of you of of your yourself is going to be made up of components, that will be reused and recycled in the building of other models for other people or other kinds of life forms or even for.

18:17

They might even be recycled for robots and your computer. You might be mad at your computer. And that's that you are taking part of the model that you have developed for basically a causal source of movement that is combined with the directional concept of that. Causal source of movement being coming from this direction.

18:48

That's always where you are, right? And then projecting that outwards. I'm on things that are in other directions that you're navigating that you're causing. Body is navigating around things that are less persistent in your own persistence. And your own persistence is sort of chief in your mind because every time you're awake, there you are.

19:18

And a manner of speaking, we're there, there is that causal body of that source of actions. Is there a hand? Your hands are there. I mean, I guess you know I guess. Okay. Look. It's different. So, what's missing from this combination of global workspace and attention? Which is just like, for me is, it's like the really, these two things two concepts are accused together.

19:49

I don't know how you can't have it. I mean, I guess, I guess you could say it's like with with I mean I guess it's like I guess you have this idea that that it just doesn't make sense. Like if in the brain for a model to appear by definition, there's a suppression of what's not not apparent.

20:18

It is a model that exists as a differential pattern as a grid pattern. That's different from other patterns, that's the model. That's the, that's the, the, the model and the process of attention is the pattern of neural firing that's making that particular model appear at that moment in time and transform over time, in transform, from the multiple perspectives of multiple neurons.

20:58

So that there is a connection, a temporal connection between spatial patterns. And so that model is sitting there in space, and it's correlated with. So it's code develops with another with another stream of processing in your brain that runs in parallel, to your sensory inputs, which is your your motor outputs and you're the, the buildup of the motor outputs is helping the develop the model of self which correlate which is correlated with the sensory representation of yourself.

21:40

Like your bit, the official, like your muscle movements and your master, you're sensitive, your sense of your muscle movements. It's gonna be correlated with your wish with your visual awareness of muscle movements. So, you have correlations between different types to give and that you have, I saw more thick bits of vector, I saw it from patterns and multiple scales.

22:08

Coordinating, basically a physical analogy between one pattern at one scale and another pattern in another scale. So your brain is able to relate from my personal macro and basically relate one sort of analogy to another analogy in terms of different modalities or different sort of stories together. And this way of relating complex sets of data to one.

22:37

Another is what's happening at the macroscale when you have large areas of the brain or basically coordinated activities. Temporal spatial firing activities between multiple cortical columns and multiple oscillators across the brain. So when you have global brain activity in the global workspace, that's coordinating. A lot of medial brain activity and critical columns together and those are coordinating and paying attention to micro neuronal activity at the neuron is synaptic scale.

23:19

But all of that information is all, the micro information is being integrated at the, at the global scale, not simultaneously but like, a lens effect, where it is magnified. Where, what is magnified at the center has a representation at the medial scale in the microscale. But the vast amount of possible representations are stored at the microscale when they're not needed to.

23:58

When you are not when your attention is not needed. And so attention is basically. I think of the analogous multi-scale pattern. Replication pattern linking between microscale and macroscale, representations, or basically the fractal, the factory representations on multiple scales across the acrostic wrath, the multi-level graph networks of the brain. And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book rethinking consciousness, he says that there's, he says that the central idea of consciousness is of this right of attention.

24:44

Schema at a high level is not an eyeball moving this looking around, but like, in the, in a sense of like a frog and and it's, it's bringing that's creating physically a map of the difference as a surroundings. It's in, but they're actually, there actually is a mechanism in front of your brain.

25:13

That is that appears to be constantly looking around and seeking. He suggests there isn't one, but there is one and that, that is from new research, that would be the hippocampus. So hippocampus is able to, to run to basically activate areas of the neocortex, in sequences basically playing back different areas of neocortex and sequences and that could be an intent.

25:49

Like the inner, it could be the interval that is in a sense because it's constantly rotating through different areas of the cortex, in a sense, activating them to search for.

26:08

To search through different possible patterns, or different possible choices of things that it could play back, right? Different sequences that I could play back. So there is a sort of searching mechanism that is coordinated. That is the lower brain hippocampus, that is interfacing with the, the higher brain that the cerebral cortex.
