This book is volume one in a series.

Neurons are blowing your mind hehe. Thats a neuro-quantum-gravity joke.
My Quantum gradient time dilation notes talk about mass as a time crystal but this connects to neural function, and the notes on the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) and it means the neuron is literally warping spacetime.

# See Note "Time Crystals, Time Dilation, Quantum Gradient Time Dilation"

It's not only that dendrites expand, to transmit mechanical waves, but also the action potential or the soma burst comes with a volumetric expansion of the membrane of the neuron, this opens the door to the transmission of soliton mechanical waves being transmitted along the neuron body, through the synaptic fluid in the synaptic cleft to downstream neurons.

I reaized that I needed to get my work out asap. The world requires more advanced neural networks for a multitude of reasons. We need to solve medical issues. We need to build homes. We need to defend our countries. Basically every problem in the world can be addressed with advances in technology.

This technology can be dangerous in the wrong hands, but I believe that there will be a net good in the long term following the history of technology.

Spacetime is in a sense relative to our neurons.

In a poetic sense our thinking is unites with the fabric of spacetime, we are in a sense oscillating fractal folds of spacetime in an advanced information configuration that is defining space and ourseves at the same time

what makes humans different from the rest of spacetime is that our density and spatial configuration maximizes information in certain spatial frequence patterns that reflect spatial patterns

in otherwords as an oscillation pattern we are literally absorbing and emitting spacetime simultaneously it is moving through us because we are dissipative vortexes

These linked stories below ought to be linked to oscillations in my notes to receptor functions, to soliton waves, to plant growth, and to cellular oscillating tomography.

In effect this note shows that dna encodes the oscillatory properties of neurons, which is not surprising, but it supportive of the Cellular Oscillating Tomography theory.

we are creating spacetime at the same time that are created by spacetime

but the mind in particular is the vortex of the brain with its particular structure that warps space to cause the paths of information to flow into certain holograph patterns that represent a perspective on space/time

so the mind is a rendered perspective on spacetime in terms of being a computed phasefield

imagine the rest of space is also a computed phase field that is relative to the minds computed phase field but it does not have the same dense spatial frequency configuration that the brain has that allows for sophisticated systems like short term and long term memory, just like how a leaf does not do the same thing as a cpu you or a gpu

what our brains are doing to the structure of information configuration is not only specific to time/scale, it might also be inverted to the timescale of the cosmos

the funny thing about the mind blowing idea that neurons warp space is that neurons are literally blowing the space in your mind

One of the weird perks of having a new unpublished theory of quantum gravity is that I have new quantum gravity jokes that I can't tell you about yet (until after the theory is published), lets just say for now that these jokes are mind blowing.

along the axonal fiber of the neuron firing the moving charge is a magnetic wave, a soliton mechanical wave, a gravitational electric wave pattern.

the phasic firing produces the light that shines through the film of the synaptic pattern, magnifying its particular pattern in attention by inhibiting variations of the memory pattern that are similar, but when firing happens faster than the ionic gradient can reset that could result in a phase increase or decrease with each subsequent interval for that pattern

everything humans touch turns from light into time & matter, we are splitting the light phase field by observing it, absorbing electrons, releasing protons

Plasma, high density
interconnected whole

because entangled particles are a single particle flattened out, in a decoherence pattern, its split is from applied force

earth has superficial awareness on super short timescales, the smaller more complex configurations of oscillators in brains have magnified temporal awareness

I intentionally avoided talking to any experts while writing this book because I wanted to enjoy this fantasy if it was just a fantasy for as long as possible and I wanted to produce the most surreal story even if it wasn't correct because it was interesting. So I let my imagination fly.

Pretend this story is just a dream, and dream with me for a while that its all true. 

Neurons warp space
If its obvious that a mass such as the earth has gravitational force then it should be obvious that a mass such as a neuron has gravitational force, when a neuron fires it expands, the soma explodes, and the explosion has a direction which is the axon length. So a neuron is warping space like an exploding star warps space, the mass of the neuron has increased and therefore its gravitational force has increased.

if components of space like stars have linear behavior they would be incapable of complex behavior but its more like they are less capable of complex behavior because they are more linear

Unlike gravity, magnetism doesn't work for everything with mass. Magnetic forces only occur between specific materials (mainly iron and certain iron alloys). This alone is a strong argument that magnetism is not responsible for gravitational forces.

The force of attraction 

as space converges it pushes itself faster in time but slower in velocity

In short gravity is not the electrical force

its the attractive force of a spinning oscillator
which is diluting the power of electrical force

if a particle can randomly travel in 6 possible directions each direction has a 1/6 chance

however lets say that in one of the directions space contracts into mass and a time dimension is added in the direction of that mass because space is moving faster there so we get twice as many particles

I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties. 

Ultimately electrical force also stems as a property of the properties of its oscillator flow as well. 

This is why there could be a particle that matches the size and predicted properties of a graviton its existence might be incidental as long as the aggregate oscillator flow averaging all the forces contained within it add up to the force of gravity

Attractive and Repulsive Forces on Particles in Oscillatory Flow

In the same way that an accelerating elevator can mimic gravity, so can an oscillator flow that has a cycling 

the earth is flying through space which is energy

so its like condensed slow energy (mass) is pushing through lightweight fast energy, like a magnetic attracting and repulsing space, 

suppose repulsive force was like gravity assist

At the moment one of my new hypotheses about the cosmos is so far out that I'm not sure that I believe it, but neither can I dismiss it, so I will include it to the book with a disclaimer that its an interesting idea but far from a mathmatical proof.

We can extend natural selection and evolution to the cosmos and to human selection, to say that human choices are an extension of natural selection.

Humans predict multiple possible futures, they move away from futures they don't like aka fears, and they move toward futures they do like aka hopes.

perpetuating the climate change problem by not recognizing that by allowing rich people to dictate the prices of labor instead of the government the incentives flow to the oil & gas industry.

I make the argument that Space might have zero absolute and zero absolute time, just relative space & time, because they balance each other out like positive and negative charges, with space being more negative and time being more positivel Somewhere inbetween a moment that in summary equals nothing there is temporarily something. That something is a chaotic volumetric information pattern called mass in an otherwise harmonic & tonic oscillating spacetime field inbetween a single moment of nothing that is also, on the flip side of the coin, the ever present beginning of spacetime. 

imagine in theory that there was no 'absolute' distance or time between any two points in space, just the relative emergence of distance and time to the observer, us

the observer viewpoint is essentially a mini hologram inside a hologram (space) we are each the image of the spacetime cosmos and fhe product of spacetime cosmos, and a dissipative system in the spacetime cosmos which is an harmonic oscillator in total, with space and time being resonating oscillators

All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)

in an oscillating field oscillations grow together once they oscillate together
if they oscillate apart they grow apart

its about the idea that your exact location/scale in the universe is determined by your oscillatory pattern

the idea that we might be able to teleport through time and space is about the fact that each person is a phase field configuration state

if you could capture and reconstruct the phase field state you could alter it so that it has a new relative position in spacetime

Category theory: One function is composable to another function if it produces the same result as the other function. The common denominator allows us to compare & multiply unstructured data sets. Such as heart rhythms & brainwaves.

Two objects are composable in phase space if they have the same phase, or same oscillation, they can converge in space, expanding space & time around that convergence relatively speaking

If they have a similar oscillation they can get close to converging in spacetime, so there is a timespace gradient

there is a geometric field for time
