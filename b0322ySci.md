# 14 Part original ChatGPT 3.5 Summary Below (and below that is the original transcription)
"Part 1 (the text was fed with no instructions given):

ChatGPT 3.5 Rather, in the many worlds interpretation, every possible outcome of every quantum event already exists in a separate branch of the multiverse. So when a quantum event happens, the universe branches off into separate worlds, each representing one possible outcome. These branches already existed, and the universe simply follows one of them. So in this sense, the multiverse is not constantly expanding, but rather already contains all possible outcomes."

# Part 1: Summarize the arguments in a list form.

"ChatGPT 3.5: Neuralink is trying to decode neural circuit activity in the brain to understand how it correlates with external stimuli and potentially read thoughts.

Neuralink's miniaturization and electrode design make it a unique brain-computer interface technology that could benefit people with disabilities.

The high turnover rate of professionals at Neuralink may be due to the high expectations of Silicon Valley and the prolonged nature of scientific research.

Rupert Sheldrake's research suggests that the universe is like a morphic field that stores and learns from our experiences, which could be related to the holographic universe theory and the concept of a simulation.

The universe may be a type of hard drive that stores information and advances society, and the multiverse could be more differentiated than previously thought.

The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not involve new worlds popping up all the time, as the total number of degrees of freedom is fixed."

# Part 1: Make a comprehensive list of key points

"ChatGPT 3.5: The discussion covered a wide range of topics, including the potential of Neuralink, the nature of consciousness, the possibility of a creator or higher intelligence, and the holographic universe theory.

Neuralink is a brain-machine interface developed by Elon Musk's company that aims to decode neural circuits and individual neuron activity to read a person's thoughts and correlate them with external stimuli.

The miniaturization of Neuralink allows for precise implantation of electrodes and the minimization of impedance for better resolution in decoding single neuron inputs.

Neuralink also has the potential for stimulation, which may create new brain functionalities that we are not yet aware of.

There has been a high turnover of staff at Neuralink, which could be due to the high expectations for progress in a limited time frame or ethical considerations.

Rupert Sheldrake's research into the morphic field suggests that the universe stores all experiences and knowledge, and consciousness taps into this field to retrieve and upload information.

The holographic universe theory suggests that the universe is a projection and each constituent part can be used to get an idea of the whole.

The multiverse may be more differentiated than previously thought, with intentional creations and evolved universes, rather than an undifferentiated foam of nearly identical universes.

The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not involve new worlds popping up with new degrees of freedom, but rather a fixed total number of degrees of freedom."

# Part 2: (No instructions given to ChatGPT, so what you see is the raw response to the text.)

"ChatGPT 3.5: The higher order of reality is a Hilbert space with a fixed number of degrees of freedom.

Defining those degrees of freedom can be abstract and difficult, especially when dealing with entangled particles.

The universe can be thought of as a quantum simulation with interactions generating transformations within the Hilbert space.

Time can be considered an emergent property.

Sheldrake's experiments on morphogenetic fields and telepathy are interesting but have not been scientifically proven.

Anecdotal evidence exists for telepathy and precognition, but it is difficult to scientifically study and replicate.

The ability to read body language and infer thoughts based on context can lead to the illusion of telepathy.

It is believed that information can be exchanged through mechanisms we have not yet discovered, and discovering new information exchange mechanisms without breaking known physics will be challenging."

# Part 3 Summarize

ChatGPT 3.5: The conversation touches on topics related to psychic abilities, telepathy, and the scientific explanation behind them. One speaker argues that many psychic phenomena can be explained scientifically, for example, through a person's ability to learn patterns and rhythms, or through their brain's ability to make predictions based on prior experiences. Another speaker suggests that such abilities may be related to the fourth dimension of time, where organisms can learn rhythm patterns to predict future temporal patterns. The conversation also touches on the concept of quantum entanglement and how it might relate to psychic phenomena, and mentions the research conducted by Johns Hopkins on the effects of psilocybin on patients.

# Part 3 Make a comprehensive list of key points.

"ChatGPT 3.5: The idea that psychic abilities or telepathy are beyond scientific explanation is a fallacy.

Many phenomena attributed to psychic abilities or telepathy can be explained by normal information transmission from one point to another, even if it is at a low level or abstract way.

Human beings can record patterns or rhythms and make predictions based on those patterns, which can lead to an intuition or psychic prediction.

The brain is a prediction-making machine, and it can make predictions based on low-level, below-conscious calculations that can lead to an intuitive or psychic prediction of an event.

It is possible that the transmission of information can happen under certain conditions that we cannot control, such as in the case of quantum entanglement, but this does not necessarily mean that it is related to psychic abilities or telepathy.

Anecdotal support of telepathy or psychic abilities exists, but a scientific explanation can be found for most of these phenomena.

The fourth dimension of time can play a role in the perception of psychic abilities, as organisms can learn rhythm patterns, which are fourth-dimensional constructs that allow predictions of future temporal patterns.

The idea of radio waves interacting with the brain is not plausible, as the frequencies are vastly different and the brain is not tuned to that frequency.

The John Hopkins psilocybin trials showed that patients had similar experiences, but this can be explained by the drug's effects on the brain rather than telepathy.

The idea that a being living in a lower dimension cannot understand higher dimensions is a flawed analogy, as it does not consider the brain's ability to make predictions based on learned patterns and rhythms."

# Part 4: (no instructions given)

"ChatGPT 3.5: The conversation covered several topics including:

The possibility of a 2D being perceiving in 3D and how it could be possible for them to understand a 3D object using multiple 2D slices.

The limitations of human cognition and the brain's capacity for understanding and processing information in different dimensions.

The idea of quantum entanglement and how it may not involve the teleportation of information, but rather an initial condition set by the entangled particles that is reflected in their subsequent paths.

The question of whether we are living in a simulation and the possibility that a higher level of intelligence or complexity could be imagining us and experiencing the universe through our eyes.

The concept of a multiverse, which is composed of many universes, each potentially differentiated with different sets of physics and purposes, forming structures with different consistencies and textures."

# Part 4 Summarize:
The conversation started with a discussion about whether humans can perceive higher dimensions and the limitations of human cognition. The topic then shifted to the idea of living in a simulation, with one participant suggesting that the universe itself could be a computation of a higher containing multiverse. The conversation also touched on the possibility of quantum entanglement and how it relates to the concept of teleportation of information. Finally, the participants discussed the complexity of a simulation needed to match the laws of physics as we know them, with one participant suggesting that the containing multiverse could be the computer that generates the universe.

"ChatGPT 3.5: The human brain can see in four dimensions but it would require a lot more brain capacity.

A two-dimensional being can understand an unlimited number of 2D spaces and can reconstruct a 3D image with perfect accuracy if it sees the object in 2D from multiple slices.

The eye is capable of inferring 3D objects between the leftmost and rightmost sensors and could perceive and understand 3D with one eye, but it's not as wide a range of depth perception as two eyes would be.

The brain generates consciousness, and by virtue of generating information, we receive consciousness. It's possible that there's a being that's infinitely more powerful than we are or complex, and it's effectively imagining us.

The universe itself is a computation of a higher containing universe, which you could call the multiverse, and the structure of the multiverse composed of many universes could look like the structure of an organism in which you have differentiated component parts that form structures with different purposes, different consistencies, and textures."

# Part 5 (no instructions given)

ChatGPT 3.5: Yes, it's a fascinating concept! The idea is that the information of a three-dimensional reality could be encoded and stored on a two-dimensional surface, similar to how a hologram works. This is an example of how our understanding of physics can challenge our intuition about the nature of reality

# Part 5 Summarize it.

ChatGPT 3.5: The discussion covered a range of topics related to the simulation hypothesis, including the idea that a computer doesn't need to be bigger than the universe to simulate it, as seen in video games and other simulations.

# Part 5: Make a list of key points.

"ChatGPT 3.5: The discussion revolves around the idea of whether our universe is a simulation or not.

The size of the computer needed to simulate the universe depends on the level of precision in measurements of the universe.

Video games and virtual reality experiences demonstrate that vast landscapes and worlds can be experienced on a computer much smaller than the simulated environment.

Simulating the universe could be done by compressing data into a lower dimension or encoding it in a compressed form.

The experience of the universe could be rendered to the observer's perception, without having to simulate every detail.

The substrate used for the simulation could be something other than classical or quantum computing, such as organic or chemical substance.

The concept of black holes as a hologram is discussed, where all the information of a three-dimensional reality is stored in a two-dimensional surface.

Black holes could be like a hard drive that stores a representation of a three-dimensional reality in two dimensions, or in codes of representation."

# Part 5: Make a list of the arguments that appear to be the most novel or unusual from the previous conversation.

"ChatGPT 3.5: The possibility of simulating the universe using a computer that is not bigger than a laptop, based on the concept of procedural generation and compression of data.

The possibility of simulating the universe using a quantum computer instead of classical computing.

The concept of black holes as a hologram, where all the information of a three-dimensional reality is amassed in a two-dimensional surface that can reproduce the three-dimensional image."

# Part 6 (No instructions given)

ChatGPT 3.5: The conversation covered topics such as holography, string theory, higher dimensional spaces, and theoretical physics. Eric Weinstein's theory that spacetime is not fundamental was discussed, and it was noted that his theory is currently a work in progress. The conversation then turned to interpretations of quantum mechanics, with the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds interpretation being the most popular. Jeffrey mentioned that most quantum information theorists don't actually believe in objective collapse theories, and the conversation briefly touched on Bell's inequality and hidden variable theory. Finally, a speculative idea was raised that the reason we make advancements in detecting particles is because the supercomputer that runs our simulation is upgrading its speed and memory.

# Part 6 Make a comprehensive list of all key points.

"ChatGPT 3.5:

Black hole holography is dependent on string theory being the fundamental model of theoretical physics.

Holography has been a way to solve many interesting problems in physics, assuming that things are holograms, but most of those assumptions come from the idea that string theory is the theory of everything that unifies all the forces.

Depending on which theoretical physics theory one subscribes to, are we limiting this question of dimensions to three dimensions only? Regardless of how many dimensions you start with, these dimensions tend to fold up, so you end up with four dimensions.

Eric Weinstein's newly released paper posits that spacetime is not fundamental, but a projection map of this 14-dimensional space where all these different field theories are clumped up, and that actions within those spaces project down to a four-dimensional space where gravity is a constant.

Spacetime is not a fundamental concept according to Eric Weinstein's theory, and it is only a projection of a higher dimensional space.

Donald Hoffman's theory of spacetime not being a fundamental should be taken with a grain of salt, as it lacks the proper mathematical background and rigor to back up his theory.

There are two interpretations of quantum mechanics: the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everettian interpretation.

Quantum information theorists don't believe in objective collapse theories, and the decoherence program is generally compatible with the Everettian interpretation.

Bell's inequality is still unproven, and no experimental or theoretical observation has managed to disprove it yet.

The reason we make advancements with detecting particles and don't make faster advancements is that the supercomputer that the simulation is built on doesn't have the right memory yet and the right speed.

The universe seems far more complex in 2021 than it was in 1970.

As we understand more and tell things more accurately, we also gain more power.

Eric Weinstein's theory could fundamentally revolutionize the way that we think about geometry and higher dimensional spaces in fundamental and theoretical physics than we've ever done before."

# Part 7 (no instructions given, GPT is responding to the text of Part 7)

ChatGPT 3.5: Simulation theory suggests that our reality might be a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization, which is running on a super quantum computer or something similar. This idea proposes that everything we perceive, including our thoughts, might be the result of an elaborate simulation, and we might be nothing more than a series of ones and zeros. However, there is no conclusive evidence that supports this theory. While it is an intriguing concept, it remains a topic of debate among philosophers, scientists, and the general public. Ultimately, the true nature of our reality is still unknown, and we may never know for sure whether we are living in a simulation or not.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription:

# Part 1

So with Neuralink, we're talking about decoding, potentially listening to your thoughts, decoding

neural circuits, decoding individual neuron activity, and trying to figure out what is

the code for short-term visual information, audio information, short-term touch information,

and comparing, you know, looking for neural correlates between these low-level neural

circuits and things that are happening in the world outside a person.

So you're doing like a pattern-matching between how a person is interacting in the world,

what they're looking at, what they're touching, what they're thinking about, and you're matching

that to the neural circuit activity inside their brain with Neuralink, that you can't

measure this activity with something that's like ECOG, or EEG, or MRI, or, you know,

you're just not close enough to the neuron or the neural circuits to measure their individual

firing fast enough at a high enough bandwidth, and not even, you can't even do this with

DBS.

There's just nothing else that can give you this capability.

But even then, it's just like, you know, if you compare 10,000 nodes to the 86 billion

neurons in your brain, it's still a tall, like, if we're able to just decode like a

small amount of the brain in terms of like, you know, reading some of your thoughts, inner

thoughts, that would just be profound in changing the world and changing science, and that'd

be bigger than stepping on the moon, right?

But still, it's still like, you know, the research will go on for more than a hundred

years in terms of, you know, advancing to the point when we can do fantastic things

like, you know, some of the sci-fi things that I think you mentioned, Jared, I'll just

pause there.

Yeah, so this is the best, so I have, well, I guess, like, Micah did explain some of the

things that he said.

Hey, could you speak up?

I'm having a hard time hearing.

Oh, can you hear me now?

Yep.

Okay, great.

So, Micah said, like, most of the things that are important to be said, but I'd like

to point out some of the novelties of the neural link, at least, like, what they did.

One of the things is the miniaturization.

So the idea was that there's been several experiments that use brain-computer interface.

So what neural link group actually managed to do was miniaturize their device so much

so that they can localize their implants on a particular part of the brain.

The other one is they're able to use, you know, like, some kind of a threading machine

or, like, that actually uses some kind of imaging to avoid the blood vessels.

So the traditional method was that you have certain kind of arrays.

I think that one of the most common one is called the Utah Array.

It's like a 100 by 100 electrode that's actually jabbed into the brain.

So you would have the associated, like, some of the associated problems, like, for example,

having edemia in the brain.

But what the neural link does is that they're able to map out where the brain, at least

like what the vessels are so they can implant their electrodes in a more careful manner.

And if you look at their electrode design, they're actually designed to sit in such a

way that they can minimize impedance.

So that's one of the bigger issues, one of your design electrodes.

So if you minimize those, I don't know if there is anybody that has worked on neuroscience

that you use these very fine fibers called tetrodes.

And they have excellent resolution when it comes to decoding a single neuron input.

But the problem is that they're very fine, so you have large impedance that would cause

some kind of error correction in your classification algorithm.

So they use the speed like structure in the electrodes so that they can minimize impedance

on a micro column level.

So I guess like the sampling rate is also unique, I think they sample at a higher rate,

which means that they take more neurons, more neuron inputs to give you a clue like

the neurons would actually fire in about two to five milliseconds.

So they sample at about like 14 times that of a single neuron fire.

So that will give you a clue that they're kind of like over sampling, but it's fine

because they're able to process the whole data on board so they can do classification

on the device itself instead of the device transferring data to a computer and do the

classification over there.

But yeah, so these are some of the things that did stand out to me when they demonstrated

the neural link and when they first talked about it.

I'm really happy to see like where this thing goes, but I think it will have wider importance

and brain machine interface, especially in people that have disabilities.

I think that's actually one of the things that it's geared towards to.

But in addition to that, I'll really be happy to see where it goes because it does also

stimulation.

So that's also one of the things that I wanted to say that the neural link actually does

reading from the local environment or like the constellation of neurons where it's implanted,

it's also stimulating at a certain rate.

So this kind of interaction might create certain kind of brain functionalities that

we're not aware, but these are some of the things that did stand out to me, that's what

I wanted to say.

I'm done speaking.

Thank you.

Thank both of you for all of that.

I feel like I learned a lot, so yeah, that's really helpful.

I have a question to add to that.

It's just a question in general.

There's been a really high turnover of professionals at Neuralink.

I don't mean that in any way being degrading or anything.

I just love to sort of pose the question, is that because the product isn't developing

or moving forward or could it be because of culture or could it be because people are

branching off to do their own things because they're excited about the progress?

It's just really, you know, it's saddening to hear and see so many new jobs being posted

and so many of the key staff leaving.

What does that mean for the future of these developments and other steps really moving

forward?

It's hard to kind of learn amongst the heart, you know.

It also may be ethical considerations, doesn't it, people, sometimes it's because they don't

like what they are seeing happening.

Gotcha.

Great.

Any other insights there?

I hope it's not because there's no progress.

I hope it's something no different to that.

Maybe the expectation is high, that's one of the things that I fear because if you're

at Silicon Valley you're supposed to churn out so much progress in a very limited time

and this is a groundbreaking scientific research.

So if you have, you know, a substantial amount of staff that's kind of a point, like accustomed

to doing research on a very prolonged basis, like, you know, if you're doing your graduate

studies through a PhD or postdoc, that you will take substantial time in doing research

and publishing papers that if you're constrained with time, I guess that would create some

kind of stress, but that's my speculation.

Hi, I'd like to just welcome Yosha.

Thank you for showing up.

You finally found us.

And if you'd like to add anything, we'd love to hear from you.

Sorry, but if I hadn't listened to the questions on the pitch, I think it's probably better

if I learn a little bit and understand the context that you're talking about.

But thanks for welcoming me.

Well, Yosha, your microphone, I don't know, at least for me.

Oh, sorry.

Can we go now?

It's a bit muffled.

Can we go now?

Yosha's going to be like rolled out of bed or a cake or something.

Sorry.

Thanks for welcoming me into the room.

I have not heard at the beginning of the conversation, so I don't know what you have to be currently

discussing.

I probably should listen for a bit.

Good evening to everyone.

Good evening.

Sure, we've been talking about pretty much every aspect.

So we were discussing while Neuralink, we've discussed whether we are our own agents simulating

our own existence here in this world, or if there is a creator aspect that is in charge

or an alien species that is more intelligent than us.

So we've been talking for about three hours, I think.

We've covered a lot.

But yeah, anybody else have any comments?

The floor is open.

What kind of comment?

Sure, go ahead.

Okay, I'll throw in my two cents.

If you're not confused now, you will be more confused when I finish.

And Rupert Sheldrake has done a lot of research into what he calls the field as a morphic field

that supposedly we're consciousness.

That's where we tap into.

When we have experiences, for instance, and collectively we all deposit our experiences into like a universe of consciousness.

And his research seems to indicate that the universe is almost like a hard drive.

It collects all these experiences, good, bad, and different, love, hate, all these things are sort of like collectively stored in this field.

And we tap into it occasionally.

And he makes some pretty good cases to do certain experiments, for instance.

One experiment that people like to associate with Rupert Sheldrake is when you have your dog, your pet is waiting for you to come home.

And there's been certain situations where people have literally placed cameras near the show of the pet's reaction

from the moment that the homeowner decides, I'm coming home from work and I'm on my way home.

With a camera that's actually placed in the home clearly shows that the animal is reacting to that decision.

Now, it seems to indicate that through some sort of field, if you will, the animal is sensing from the point that the decision is made from the homeowner to actually come home.

And then the animal gets anxious and goes near the door, waits.

And he does a lot of statistical analysis to try to rule out chance and by showing, through continual repetition, that this seems to be indeed the case.

The universe, as far as I can tell, just may be a type of hard drive that's storing information and then learning from our experiences.

So that kind of like feeds into this idea that there's a processing, if you will, that takes place.

It takes all of this information and it advances our society by storing all these experiences over and over again.

And when things are repetitious in nature, then the universe knows that, okay, this is something that is common to our particular civilization in terms of the way we think.

It's funny because I put together an article in 2012 that tends to combine holographic universe, which you guys were alluding to when you talk about simulation.

It's basically, it's cooperated by the holographic universe theory.

And so I'm combining the holographic universe theory in addition to quantum mechanics, in addition to, we're taking a look at the brain and consciousness.

So I think all four of them could indeed be related.

And there's a lot of scientific work being done.

Alan Aspeck, I think his name is Alan Aspeck, David Bohm, as I mentioned, Rupert Sheldrake, even Dean Raiden over at the New Attic Science Institute.

All of these people are doing a lot of research and seems to indicate definitely that our consciousness is like in some sort of, it's almost like the occasion records you guys ever heard of, you guys ever heard of occasion records before?

It's basically this field where we tap into, to retrieve information from and to also upload information into it, almost like a cloud or something.

But I just want to throw that in there because there's a lot of good research on this topic.

And I think the holographic universe theory seems to verify that you guys could be onto something.

Because the pixelization on your computer screen, basically, the same thing as the simulation.

Each and every pixel contains a small portion of the whole.

If you can take a single pixel, you can duplicate the whole.

So if the universe that we live in, the reality that we live in is projection, then that pretty much says, okay, it's the same thing.

The projection that we're living in comes from somewhere else and each and every constituent part can be actually used to get an idea what the whole would look like.

So each and every pixel on your computer screen, each and every portion of our reality is a projection from somewhere else.

And the question becomes, where is that somewhere else?

But yeah, a lot of scientists have taken a look at the smallest subatomic molecules and such, and they don't seem to be space, empty space in between,

which means there's probably something that needs to be filling that space, which more likely is information consisting of our reality.

So, Monty, that reminds me, this discussion has come up a couple of times on Clubhouse and whether the universe is basically a giant computation.

And when I say a couple of times, it seems to come up on every single one of these talks.

But one thought I had was, I think when people think of the multiverse, most people imagine this undifferentiated foam of nearly identical universes,

such that, you know, here we are in our universe and there's one universe over where everything is identical except one little atom was slightly moved out of place

and just goes on in infinite directions in every direction.

And I think that's a pretty ludicrous way of looking at it.

I think that a better way of looking at it is if you imagine the organisms on our planet and all the objects, you have organisms that are, you know, purely evolved.

And then you have artificial organisms, cybernetic organisms, you know, you have machinery.

And I wonder if the multiverse is much more differentiated than we give it credit for.

So I expect there may be some universes that are intentionally created things, what the intention is, I don't know,

but they're created to perform some sort of a purpose.

And there might be others that evolved from other universes.

And everything in between, you know, entirely might be a spectrum.

I don't think we know yet which one of those our universe is.

But I'm just saying, I think it pays to start thinking about, rather than the multiverse being some sort of a foam, I guess,

think of it more like the cellular structure in an organism.

Are we the, you know, are we the mitochondrion? Are we the cell wall? You know, what are we?

What is the greater structure? I have no clue.

But if we think in terms of a structure in this universe as some part of that structure, that might go a long way to explaining what this place is.

It's something I do like to clarify for people when people bring up multiverse, or at least from the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

It's not that new worlds are popping up all the time with brand new degrees of freedom.

Like the total number of degrees of freedom is fixed.

# Part 2

It's just you, it's superposition.

So, I mean, you can kind of think of the higher order of reality instead of being space-time as a Hilbert space.

But the number of degrees of freedom in that Hilbert space is always fixed.

The degrees of freedom is never expanding as you move forward.

How do you define those degrees of freedom?

Well, I mean, that can be abstract.

I don't know if there's a way to actually make a measurement of clearly distinguishing all those degrees of freedom.

I mean, we can talk about particles, but it becomes difficult defining particles when things become entangled.

If you're talking about the universal wave function or something like that.

Okay, what you are saying is that particles have rules. It's not like...

Yeah, there is like...

Not anything goes over there.

Things go different over there, but there are just two certain rules.

And those rules are inside the freedom that you're referring to.

Isn't it? It's like that?

Yeah, I mean, if you think the world is a quantum simulation, the universe is a quantum simulation.

I mean, there exists a Hilbert space which has some degrees of freedom in there.

A state is defined as like a vector in that Hilbert space.

And then you have some sort of interactions that generate transformations within that Hilbert space.

Moving forward in time, interactions describe how the states of the universe transform each passage of time.

I mean, you can also talk about time being an emergent property too.

Things can get quite complicated when you're talking about how does space time emerge from a more abstract, abstractive reason for freedom.

And the way to respond to what Monty suggested about Sheldrake's experiments.

I found Sheldrake always a very interesting fellow, not quite of the idea of the morphogenetic fields.

I don't know what they are and many of the things that he ascribes to them, for instance, the regenerative abilities of organisms

where it basically tells to know which place they can go to have other explanations that are more plausible, the formation of eyes and so on.

I remember having read his book, Seven Experiments That Could Change the World.

And one of these experiments he describes the possibility that, for instance, pigeons could find the place

where they're supposed to go without having a map even when this place is on wheels and is moved.

And so he set out to perform the same experiment and then over a long period he basically tried to breed pigeons and make experiments with them.

But they always failed because something happened to the pigeons.

And he honestly describes these experiments and this particular part never worked.

I read about the dog. It was a single experiment with the dog that I'm aware of.

And the data were collected based on a particular dog owner who claimed that her dog was able to sense an advance when she was coming.

Somebody did this data and analysis and claimed that they could show that this was statistically significant

and they could show that 80% of the cases the dog was responding in this particular way.

And that they made controlled experiments where the time was varied, the vehicle was varied and so on.

And then there is another paper written by another author who looked at the data that they collected and found that the statistics don't end out.

So this experiment itself was not valid.

And you can find this on the internet. The author is R. Reisman where he discusses this second pet.

And it seems to be that this is a sound discussion of the whole thing.

I find occurrences of claim telepathy very interesting.

I think we should pay great attention to them because if one of them turns out to be true, we have to rewrite large parts of physics.

Which I consider to be a good thing, right?

We would create a tremendous advance in the sciences if you would find that there are different ways to exchange information over distances and the known ones.

And it just seems to be that in all the cases that I've looked in so far,

you know, statistical analysis and independent reports didn't really pan out.

But who knows, maybe we find something, maybe there are things which are under-reported and so on.

So what I find is exciting and very enlightening for the structure of the universe.

It do remain skeptical at this point.

Go ahead, Daniel.

Yes, quickly. What you're saying is that so far you haven't seen any study that definitively confirms something like telepathy.

You are still open to find that, but so far you haven't found something that we cannot contest.

I have anecdotal evidence in my own life about telepathy.

But I don't know in which way this is statistically significant, because all the other times when the telepathy didn't work, I didn't take a note, right?

So I don't know whether I can explain this with random events, that then the sciences appear to be extremely significant.

And then there's another thing, I typically did not perform a controlled experiment where I took notes before and double-blind things.

So I don't know to which degree I edited my own memories.

I agree. I have similar experiences to that and also some premonition.

But yeah, I totally agree with the other parts and conditions that are not replicable.

Yeah, thanks.

So, Yosha, I did want to talk about the precognition and telepathy.

I myself have had many instances where there is no explanation.

But what it does come in as is almost a picture of and a knowing that comes from somewhere else that proves to be true.

So how can you scientifically study that? It's kind of hard, because you would have to have a condition, right?

So there would be, if you brought somebody in and you were able to pick up on names or situations from their past and a knowing that you should not know, that is not consistent.

I mean, it does happen, but it's not something that's so consistent that it can be scientifically proven.

And, you know, cognitive bias comes in as well where you can read body language, where you're going to get a lot of people that claim to have that ability, but really do not.

And so it's a tricky subject, but I think that there are some people that have that ability, but they're just really not going to come forward and talk about it.

So in terms of telepathy, while you are looking at a person, it's possible, probably possible.

When we get older, we are able to infer based on their attitudes what goes on in the mind of a person.

And that's because the things that can happen in any given context in the mind of a person are somewhat limited, and the better we are able to make models of these things, the more we can narrow this down.

And so if we are in a very receptive state, we can probably entangle ourselves with the states of another person sufficiently well to limit it so far down that we can often get the thoughts of another person right.

It's just the curious thing would be what happens if this other person is at a distance and not in the same room.

So, you know, the thing on telepathy is there's a number, there's a lot of things going on here.

And one of them is, I certainly am a believer in the concept of it and the idea that information can be exchanged through mechanisms we haven't discovered yet.

I would say whatever those mechanisms are, it's almost inevitable there will be other mechanisms that we discover considering how little we know about the universe.

So, if there are...

I'm sure, I mean, we know that we have the standard model interactions right to many decimal places.

Discovering a new kind of exchange of information that doesn't show in the lab and doesn't break known physics is going to be hard.

# Part 3

So, we cannot just say that it's all that we know about the universe. This doesn't work. We know so much about the universe already.

I would like to maybe have a chance to speak and sort of maybe...

I want to throw cold water on the idea, but make actually a good argument.

So, just to relate, I've had a lot of experiences too.

I once had the intuition that my grandmother was dying and she died.

That was a very powerful, it felt like a very psychic premonition, right?

And of course, I've had the...

Anyway, so let me try to explain what I think could be happening.

So, you can have a situation that I guess somebody brought up that the guy with the Joker image, he was bringing up the idea that a dog could know when you're going to come home.

That they could sort of like intuit your mind.

But what if a dog...

So, the idea is like if you come home at five o'clock every day, a dog could remember that and expect you to come home at five o'clock every day.

And if a dog is paying attention to your nonverbal behavior, and if your nonverbal behavior is somehow communicating without your awareness that you're going to come home earlier.

You're setting your intention, maybe even below your own conscious awareness that you're going to come home earlier than five, then the dog's expectation changes.

And if you know you're going to come home later and that changes your behavior in such a subtle way that a dog can pick it up, then the dog will expect you later than five.

And so, I would just say instead of imagining that there's some telepathy going on,

just say maybe there was a message exchange at some point that set a long-term expectation, and this is sort of like the idea is that our brains are prediction making machines.

And there's predictive coding, which is a framework.

The idea is here we can all have an agreement, conscious or unconscious, that we're going to meet again and the meeting will have certain tones and certain vibrations.

And if for some reason, it doesn't match our expectations and we'll know something is different, something is off.

And so maybe I expected that eventually my grandmother would pass away.

And maybe the signs of her passing were worse.

It's like, you know, maybe I'm just sort of like paying attention to something at an unconscious level and my brain is making a prediction based upon,

okay, if I hear certain news, if certain events happen, then my brain is going to reach the tipping point where that prediction sort of appears.

And I'm not maybe necessarily going to have a conscious understanding of how my brain came to that conclusion because it was a bunch of low-level, below-conscious calculations

that sort of led me to what I experienced as an intuitive or psychic prediction of an event that happened.

And maybe in the case of like, you know, if your friend suddenly needs you and you realize it before they call you, like you're thinking of your friend and then they call.

Well, I mean, maybe it has to do with sort of like temporal expectations that you made with your friend at an unconscious level at some prior time.

And maybe the different aspects of your environments you interact with are informative enough that they can communicate stuff about other people at a sort of like,

at a really coarse-grained but extremely abstract and low-level way that's just like not enough information to be clear enough.

But still there's like a normal transmission of information from point A to point B that doesn't involve anything magical or anything unexplainable.

And I think to go to the set of saying, well, this has to be beyond science and beyond testability, that's just hand-wavy.

That's woo-woo. And I won't accept that anything is beyond the reach of scientific explanation personally.

Well, nothing is beyond the reach of scientific explanation in the absolute.

Many things are beyond the reach of scientific explanation at our current level.

I mean, we can't even cure cancer. We can't even get to Mars in a reasonable amount of time.

We sort of have the hope that we can explain, you know, even these phenomena are...

Ah, we've been locked up right here on COVID.

Yes, that's exactly the expectation.

If we're so backwards in this way, it's pretty humoristic to think, oh, you know, anything we can't test now is bogus.

So, what I do think, interestingly, on the psychic thing, there's so many things going on.

That's a straw man, by the way. I didn't make that argument.

I didn't think... I didn't think it would. But what you just said was, the way you worded it, said, I don't accept anything.

I was like, whatever, it doesn't matter.

So the fact of the matter is that a lot of things are getting completed into what's called ESP or psychic or telepathy.

That there probably are many different explanations.

Like, I don't know about anyone here, but I've had a lot of experience where I can predict what songs on the radio.

I'll have them come to me, I'll turn the radio on, and they'll be playing that song.

I don't think that's magic. I think, for instance, our brains can probably pick up radio frequencies.

It's on the electromagnetic spectrum. We're probably picking that up.

So that could well be, like, we could be receiving low-level electromagnetic signals in our nervous system somehow,

and that probably explains a lot of the permanence we have.

But that's worth considering.

Another explanation may be the quantum entanglement.

And the fact that it is so difficult to achieve would make it very random and difficult to invoke.

I mean, to... by willing to make sure it happens, maybe it just happens from time to time.

It would apply, I think, to most of the cases we are quite sharing.

And the quantum guys may have something to say about it.

What specifically are you referring to?

I mean, the possibility of the two brains are able to entangle, to relate to each other at some point.

And the fact that quantum entanglement is very hard to achieve in the lab,

and that's the whole imitation of quantum computer right now, doesn't it?

So we may be able to... to make... no.

It's not something that we're able to make happen.

Maybe that just happens under certain conditions, randomly, or not that randomly.

But, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, that's hard for me to parse.

Entanglement can be a bit tricky to talk about in that aspect,

because if you're talking about kind of... is there an entanglement between my brain and your brain?

Yes, and that may happen under certain conditions that we cannot control.

In one case, I can say almost absolutely yes,

is the fact that you're going to create entanglement by any particles interacting with each other.

But if we're talking about just my brain and your brain, we're washing out the rest of the universe,

and then any type of connection that's going to be exponentially suppressed,

given many other factors.

So do you feel like very careful about how you're framing that question?

Yeah, but you agree that that may happen sometimes,

that we don't have much control on that.

I mean, we know that quantum entanglement is not easy to make it happen.

We know for sure that so far.

So maybe it's actually very difficult, maybe it's something kind of rare at where we are.

And that may explain why these experiences are kind of random and not under our willingness to make them happen.

I mean, yeah, how those connections form in the first place,

if the universe as a whole is determined, then thank you.

There's no randomness there, but you can always have kind of, from global determinism,

you can have local randomness.

Yeah, again, it depends on how you're parsing that question.

Does anyone, I'm going to go take a little left turn here,

but the John Hopkins, they do a lot of research with psilocybin,

and a lot of the patients, the trials, they all have very similar experiences.

And I just wanted to draw that in there.

It's a little difficult to explain why all these patients have such similar experiences.

I don't know if that's related to maybe the telepathy route that you were going with in the conversation.

Hey, Nathan, can you describe what do you mean by they all have the same,

what are the typical experiences that you're noticing?

Well, John Hopkins, the patients were describing their experiences as if it was more real than life,

and they were describing meeting these...

Nathan, and what circumstances, what kind of patients were there?

You'll have to excuse me, I'm not too familiar with the research, but I just wanted to bring that,

throw that wrench in there to you guys.

I think everyone has probably some anecdotal support of telepathy or other examples,

and what Yosha was saying before was that when Nets looked at scientifically,

you can't isolate it to the point that you can't find a rational explanation.

I have twins who were separated from each other, one was with me and one was with their mother,

and they were somewhat distant from each other, and one of them got encephalitis,

and the other one immediately knew that her twin sister was ill, and they were both three years old,

and we have no reason to understand how that transmission of information happened,

but you can't scientifically exclude that there was something else about that situation

which triggered the other twin, and I think everyone has these examples,

and I feel like Yosha that there is a scientific explanation that lets us rewrite certain rules and understand them.

I have twins, and after three or four days we brought them home, we put them in the same crib,

and they started rotating at exactly the same rate,

so they moved when they were in the same crib for a couple of hours or 30 hours,

exactly at the same rate, so they started with their head pointing south,

and then a little by little they started rotating, and then ended up with their head pointing north without,

I mean, then we were just sleeping.

So I wanted to respond to both what David and Daniel were saying, and also to what Jay said,

so the first thing was the idea of radio waves interacting with the brain.

Our brain waves emit waves, of course, but we're talking 10 to 100 cycles per second,

and with the radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second.

It's not close to the same frequency of what our brain is detecting,

and also if you don't have a decoder, then that information means nothing.

It's like the bumps on a CD on a record, or the dots on a CD-ROM.

If you look at the dots on a CD-ROM, it doesn't look like music to you.

If you put your hand on a record, you don't hear music.

If you can have the radio waves enter your brain, it doesn't mean you understand the signals from the radio,

and your brain is certainly not tuned to that frequency.

But anyway, going back to what David and Daniel were saying,

and I was trying to explain this earlier, there is a very simple explanation.

The explanation is that human beings can record patterns or rhythms.

You can remember a rhythm that can be an expectation or a future prediction

of when you're going to receive a certain rhythm.

When does the next note in the song happen?

If that note doesn't come, then you think,

well, there's something wrong with the song.

In that sense, in a grand way, when you're paying attention to maybe the rhythm of the wellness of your family

that's at an unconscious level that a parent is transmitting,

and as soon as that rhythm of wellness stops, there might be some sort of intuition that is transmitted.

The rhythm of wellness and everything being fine with your sibling is something that is immediately...

The organism in the child is suddenly aware that something is not quite right,

because the note didn't sound quite right.

Maybe there's a very intuitive way that the brain is predicting these high-level patterns

and paying attention to the rhythms of the family or other nonverbal clues

that are supporting a prediction that is just very explainable.

What about the two babies that were just, I don't know, one week old

and started turning at the same pace and ended up in the same direction?

Yeah, that's again an example of two or more people learning the same rhythm,

learning the same expectation, and then their behavior matching that same sort of rhythmic pattern,

which is what you saw when they were facing the same direction.

My question is, is that quantum entanglement?

Is there something going on that we don't understand?

Well, obviously, nobody has the answers in physics completely, but we can all have theories.

So, I think what I'm curious about personally is,

if somebody has an ability that's a psychic ability or a telepathy,

or knowing something that they should not know,

and these things happen in like a skip in time where you can see forward maybe a day or two,

and that's repetitive in somebody's life.

Is there something in science that we need to understand how that works?

So, have you heard Carl Sagan's Flatland, have you watched a little Flatland video?

I have.

So, the whole idea is that if you take a person with a creature, a being that's two-dimensional,

and lives on a plane, if a three-dimensional being like yourself were to push that

two-dimensional being out of the plane into the world of three dimensions,

they'd be able to look down on their former home of two-dimensional plane,

and they could actually see like, you know, this map-like view of their world

that they didn't even think was physically possible, and we completely changed their outlook.

But the fact of the matter is, it's entirely possible that you're getting information from the fourth dimension of time,

or what we perceive as time, through means we don't yet understand.

So, if you have information that can see through barriers, whether barriers of time or space,

that you're going to interpret that as psychic or magic, or ESP, which I guess it is ESP in a sense,

but again, it's all working within the laws of physics rather than some extra physical and metaphysical.

I really love what you're saying, Jay, and I'd love to respond.

I think that, yeah, so what you've framed in terms of like, if you're a one-dimensional character,

and you can't understand the third dimension or something, I forget how the story goes, but you just explained it very well.

Yeah, that's a great idea. So the fourth dimension of time is exactly what I'm talking about,

where organisms can learn rhythm patterns, because a rhythm pattern is a fourth-dimensional construct, right?

You're making a prediction of the future based upon a learned rhythm that your brain has encoded,

and then sort of multiply it in order to predict future temporal patterns.

There is a mistake on the flat land proposal in the sense that a 2D being cannot see 3D,

even if we lift it out of the two-dimension.

It will see multiple two-dimensions one after the other, kind of a psychedelic experience.

There's a lot of different kind of related, but kind of superpose one after the other,

because the senses that this being has are only for two dimensions, not for three.

So no matter if you lift it, it will only see the same happen with us.

# Part 4

That's great.

That's great.

No, it's not true. It's actually not true.

It's surprisingly, basically your two flat lander would have a one-dimensional retina, right?

So basically it's a line on which it would scan the world.

And now if you lift it up, then this line would basically scan the universe in a similar way as a sensor

in the camera that reads out in the world line by line.

So if you know how you're moving that line, you can put the lines together

and understand what you're looking at, what kind of structure you're looking at.

But of course the requirement is that the computational structure behind the sensor

is able to discover this regularity.

And it turns out that our own brain can see in four dimensions.

It would be very surprising.

It would need a lot more brain capacity that it has.

So that's not obvious.

So if you give it a large enough brain, why not?

So maybe its brain has only evolved to a certain capacity and is no daughter.

But imagine you have a very, very smart flatlander, one that is in the same niche as us

facing generally intelligent, and it has the largest brain that you can give it in principle.

And now you give it access to data with a new structure.

It's just the structure that we find in the data.

Because exhaustively we don't see anything in 4D because there are no particles

that transmit information that are traveling in 4D that we can sense.

So if a 2D flatlander's brain can understand an unlimited number of 2D spaces,

then if you look at basically the projection slice theorem,

or Fourier projection slice theorem,

what that says is that a 2D slice of a 3D image represents the mid-intersection of that image.

And if you could get a slice from multiple different perspectives around that image,

you can reconstruct a 3D object.

And so if a 2D flatlander could see the object in 2D from multiple slices,

then you reconstruct that 3D image with perfect accuracy.

Yeah, and that's how we do it.

There's already, as I've already seen, in 2D, not really 3D,

and our brain makes a composition for the 3D,

but we have a much more complex brain, much more capacity than a 2D being full half.

And that's for an economy of resources.

We don't see the whole spectrum of light because what we see is enough for us.

We don't smell everything that there is because we smell and the dogs we have,

we can handle the world, so we go by what is more efficient.

Okay, a 2D being maybe able to experience,

simultaneously that if he does an extraordinary effort and has some kind of brain augmentation.

In the same way that I think, to a degree, we can experience growth on growth

higher dimensions already, but they don't make much sense.

We don't have the brain capacity, the processing capacity to handle it all at once.

So it makes some sense, but we don't have the resources.

Could it be an anomaly though?

Could it be, like you said, it's maybe a small percentage of people are able to do that?

I think yes, those who have more capacity power,

but even though I think let's talk in bytes.

So I'm getting 8 bytes for 2D and for 3D 32 bytes.

And for actually the next thing, it would be 128.

Some may have been able to overclock the 32, but it's an overclock.

And it's not the real thing.

Okay, I just want to say that I don't know any neuroscientists in the world

that's going to describe the process of vision as 2D slices as part of a Fourier transform.

That's not the current widely accepted understanding of how vision works.

And neither are the limitations you're suggesting in terms of human cognition.

It's not from what I've heard from neuroscience.

But I wanted to also, before you jumped in, Daniel,

I wanted to finish what I was saying about what Amy was saying about the quantum entanglement.

And I prefer David Baum's, he had this great hypothesis that when you had an entanglement,

basically one possibility is you could have particles that collided at some point,

and then they just sort of ricocheted off of each other in an asymmetrical way.

Basically wherever they collided and entangled, their paths from then onward

sort of like reflecting that point at which they connected.

And so you could read basically one of the particles,

and that would tell you basically the orientation

or other information facts about the other particle because they basically had...

But it wasn't basically information being sent from one particle to another.

It was basically like an initial condition that both particles set together when they were together.

And then so that when they're apart, you can figure out what the initial condition was

by reading one particle, and that would tell you what was true about the other particle.

So that's different from the idea of like the teleportation of information.

Yeah, but if people who can only see with one eye,

they cannot see it, they kind of see 2D, they don't see 3D, they don't see much space.

So it's actually possible to perceive space with one eye,

I mean to perceive, to understand 3D with one eye.

It's a little bit more difficult.

Actually I in fact sort of lost my depth perception in one of my eyes.

It's just that my eye is super blurry, but I still can't...

If I put on my glasses, things seem more 3D,

but even with one eye closed, I can still understand the world in 3D.

I still perceive the world in 3D.

And I think that if you dial down into what the eye is,

the eye is not like a single camera.

It's like there's millions of sensors in your eye.

So it is plausible that your eye could by itself infer 3D objects

between the leftmost sensors and the rightmost sensors.

It's just not as wide a range of depth perception as two eyes would be.

Yeah, so it's not quite the same.

And probably it's mostly because you already experienced both eye vision,

so your brain knows about it.

It may be different if you were born with just one eye.

But the composition of depth is made by the interaction of both eyes in your brain.

That's the point.

Not exclusively.

You know, yeah, not exclusively.

Um, if I'm going to turn on the raising hands,

so if anybody is in the audience and wants to come up, feel free.

We haven't heard from Chris and Cami.

Welcome to the stage.

Hi. Are we living in a simulation?

So I had a question about that since I joined the stage recently,

and it's not related to the recent thread.

Can we go back to the topic, or should we stick to the thread?

No, thanks.

So I just had a quick question, and I saw Jeffrey Flash as Mike.

I talked a couple days ago, when of all, and some other people were talking about quantum computing.

And Jeffrey actually got on stage and talked a little bit about quantum computing.

And the question came up, are we living in a simulation?

And one of the rebuttals to the idea that we are is that the computer to create the simulation would have to be as big or larger than the universe.

And I was just wondering if we posit that only the human observations of the universe are ever simulated at any given time,

so that then we actually have to exist only observations of it.

Would that make Chris answer your question?

So I put some thought into this actually, because the funny thing is, I think ever since I was about seven,

I wondered, are we living in a simulation?

But I was just looking at it in the bad way, like with the whole brain and the jar thing, which to me is kind of a crank theory.

And only in more recent years have I realized there's another alternative explanation

that could basically allow for the entire universe to be simulated in full.

And it's because if we're in a simulation, it's not a simulation on our own plane, but think of it this way.

Let's say you read a book, like a fiction book, and it's a really good book, it's engrossing.

So you start getting absorbed into the characters.

You start identifying them.

You start to forget the world around you.

In a sense, you're generating a consciousness.

As a sort of an artificial consciousness being placed into these characters,

the characters are capable of sustaining the consciousness by virtue that they have information.

They're made of information, and they're complex enough for you to be interested in.

And you can fill in the gaps, and you can basically create this soul, if you want to call it that, with your brain.

So if that's the case, if your brain is capable of generating consciousness,

even if it's a weaker consciousness than your own, it's entirely possible, and I would say likely,

that there's a being that's infinitely more powerful than we are, or complex,

it may be composed of more than three dimensions.

And it's effectively imagining us.

So we're real in the sense that we're matter, we're physical, we exist.

But there's something that exists outside the universe that is injecting itself into us, per se.

Our human brain generates more than enough information for this higher level of intelligence

to see itself through our eyes, the universe subject to be experiencing itself, hardly an idea you need to meet.

And therefore, first of all, when it does, it opens up the doors of possibility

that it's not just things with brains that have consciousness.

It could be silicon organisms, it could be networks of trees, it could be maybe a colony of ants.

But the idea is that by virtue of generating information, we receive consciousness.

So the thing that precreates the universe isn't a computer in the sense that we have computers,

but rather it's a computer on the level of a universe, and it's contained in a much larger multiverse,

which to the inhabitants of that multiverse is the universe.

Does that make sense?

You mentioned something about if you're reading a book,

it's like another consciousness is kind of injected inside your brain, right?

But I was wondering, isn't what happens in that new consciousness,

like that story that's happening in your brain, just the product of physical atoms and particles

that are composing the brain and that new conscious thing is like an emergent kind of quality

that's just based on the atoms in the brain.

Like it's not something that exists outside the universe, right?

It's something that, like you could imagine simulac actually creating a computer that matches the brain.

That's the intelligence, it's the mind, you're talking the mind, the thoughts, the emotions,

all of that's happening in terms of, you know, electromagnetic pulses.

But the subjective experience of those electromagnetic pulses that is your brain,

that's what I'm talking about.

So I think Chris, you were getting it more flicked up,

and we've made this distinction earlier between kind of the brain and the bat type of simulation,

which I think I call an active feedback type of simulation,

where you, your conscious brain has some sort of agency,

and then the environment, it's kind of like the matrix type simulation,

where it has to be kind of an active feedback between what the simulation is feeding into your brain

and what your brain decides what actions you're making on the environment.

So this is that constant feedback and more complex type of simulation,

and then there's the Nick Foster type of simulation.

The way I'm interpreting it is, you know, some initial state in the universe,

some degrees of freedom, interaction between those degrees of freedom,

you kind of just hit the go button and let everything evolve forward in time.

Yeah, so that's the second one.

Okay, yeah, and so there, I mean, I think we also touched on this a little bit earlier is,

I mean, from the perception of a human being, how complex would the simulation need to be?

Let's say like, for at least the laws of physics to be consistent, as we know them today.

So I briefed up the question of, you know, an upper bound on that simulation

as for the laws of physics, as we know them to be consistent for the rest of my life,

would you need at least to include the degrees of freedom that would be contained in the light cone

of where I am right now.

And then whether that can be compressed down or how much that can be compressed depends upon

kind of the levels of measurements I'm able to make in the universe to distinguish

whether the laws of physics are behaving correctly.

So if you put restrictions on what measurements about the world I'm able to make,

that may give you a limit to how well I can compress that simulation.

If you allow me, you know, arbitrary precision, arbitrary measurements to make

to verify the laws of physics as we know them, then I believe you may need to include

at least every degree of freedom within my light cone.

Therefore, you would need a computer that was the size of the universe

or at least the size able to compute the light cone.

That would be my naive interpretation if anyone else wants to comment.

So my assumption is that the computer that would generate the universe is the containing multiverse.

So the universe itself is a computation of a higher containing universe

which you could call the multiverse.

The multiverse could be potentially a product of an even higher universe called a hyperverse.

Wait, just to clarify for one second.

When you're referring to the multiverse, can you distinguish whether you're saying

like from the many worlds interpretation or just like there are many universes out there?

Yeah, the way I see it.

I don't know whose theory, like whose official theory this most neatly slides into,

but okay, the way I see it, every system of, every level of,

let's put this, of organization of subdivision is one level of a hierarchy

that's basically infinite in both directions.

So we know we're the organism, we're composed of cells.

The cells are composed of molecules, the molecules of atoms, atoms of electrons, subatomic particles,

and those are composed of quarks.

And so until you get down to plank particles or whatever they are called.

But as far as I'm concerned, that's our limitation that it only goes that far.

That you could theoretically break that level down further and further and further.

It's just that we being at the level of matter that we are, aren't capable of perceiving that.

And if it goes infinitely downward, I think it goes infinitely upward such that

here's our universe, the universe itself is like an atom in a molecule

that there's other universes in its local group.

And then that local group is differentiated.

Again, it's an undifferentiated foam,

but there could be totally different looking universes elsewhere that behave with totally different sets of physics

and they have different purposes.

So the structure of the multiverse composed of many universes could look like the structure of an organism

in which you have these differentiated component parts that aren't evenly distributed

in some sort of a matrix, but form structures with different purposes, different consistencies and textures.

That's my definition.

# Part 5

Can I explain why it's obvious that a computer doesn't need to be bigger than the universe to simulate the universe?

I would like to hear that.

Okay, so if you look at basically at video games today,

Julia plays a lot of video games and I was just reminded of one that Julia was playing that

your character walks through these vast worlds that if you are in virtual reality,

the amount of landscape is experientially, it's vastly bigger than your computer.

And there's one game in particular that I tried to bring up earlier, No Man's Sky,

which is extremely vast in terms of the amount of universe it has imagined,

but that's just, and I am not making the argument that our universe is similar to No Man's Sky.

I'm making the point that there could be some sort of procedural,

there could be something that is, you know, in terms of like,

you could have a computer the size of a laptop that has some sort of program

that will sort of virtually generate the experience of physics

and the experience of atoms and the experience of density,

but do it all in a lower dimension or encoded in such a way that it's very compressed

and it could fit in the computer the size of a laptop,

but it could represent the total amount of data that we experience as a cosmos

and perhaps much more.

There's no reason why the computer has to be bigger than a laptop.

That's what I was saying, it depends on what measurements I'm able to make of the universe.

Because if I'm able to make any abstract, you know, if I have access to particle accelerators or whatever,

like in the top of the line physics equipment,

if you put certain bounds on the precision of the measurements I'm able to make of the universe,

then I think the compression bounds change for me to be able to distinguish, you know,

what's simulated versus reality.

That's an interesting idea. I think what I interpret you saying is like,

let's say the measurements that we can make of the universe have kind of a rough resolution,

like they're not super granular, then that is in effect like a compression of the universe

and you only need to simulate up to the level of resolution you can observe or measure, right?

Exactly.

That's fascinating.

And interestingly, you kind of only need to render enough of the resolution of the universe

and all of its modalities for the observer to have the experience that the universe is there.

This gives me confidence that, oh sorry, I'm just going to say one thing, this gives me confidence that maybe it is possible to simulate the universe given some assumptions with the computer.

And I could ask many follow-up questions about this, but I don't want to interrupt the vibe that was currently going on in the room

and also Connie might have a question, but thank you all so much.

Yeah, I'll just add, it's probably much easier to, if you're not trying to measure whether the world is being consistent with lots of physics or not,

if you're just going about your normal day, it's probably a much easier compression than if you're actively trying to verify whether the lots of physics are being consistent in your reality.

And that probably goes back to what your conscious state is and whether you're actively trying to distinguish between them.

Right, exactly, yeah, cool.

If you're the only conscious being, Chris, then all the computers got to do is simulate the inputs for you.

Sorry, just playing devil's advocate.

That's like the solipsist, what's it called, solipsism or something, or like the idea that I'm the only one that exists and everything else doesn't really exist.

That's the simplest simulation of all, I guess.

Yeah, the brand name of that.

Right.

Has the discussion, has it already been discussed whether it, if it were, if we were living in simulation, whether the simulator was classical computing or quantum computing, just curious if anyone had discussed that.

I think it would have to be quantum for my next step.

And as a corollary, would this computing mechanism actually have to be made mechanical and could it not be made of a different substrate?

I mean, I brought up an example earlier, just a random idea that I heard that something could be represented in two dimensions on the surface of a black hole and in three dimensions at the same time.

There was just one example of how an observer could experience something in three dimensions, but someone else could see that observer in two dimensions.

And when I began to create VR applications with WebXR and AR applications as well, it brought home the idea for me that my two-dimensional code,

my two-dimensional code was also manifesting as a three-dimensional, four-dimensional experience at the same time.

I think I may have strayed from your question a little bit and lost it, so if you want to rephrase it, you can.

Well, it was twofold. One, has there been a discussion in the room about if we were living in a simulation with the simulator based on classical computing or quantum computing?

And then corollary to that is, if you were living in a simulation and it was computing, has there been a discussion whether that computing mechanism was of a different substrate,

for example, organic or a different type of chemical substance, if you will?

So to your black hole question, which I find pretty interesting because you had said C into the black hole.

Can you just explain what you mean by C?

I meant that the experience of entering a black hole for you or me, the personal one-to-one experience is different from someone else's observation of what's happening to us when we enter a black hole.

Someone else would see the spaghettification while...

And the fact that if I understand gravity is such a weak force in general because it doesn't have an opposing force, so just trying to understand if you're saying that that would have an influence.

Patty, are you trying to clarify what spaghettification means? What exactly that term is supposed to mean?

Oh no, I was trying to understand Micah's analogy because I thought it was enormously interesting, but the part I didn't understand is to see, and you said to see in 2D.

So are you talking about a scientific observer? I'm just trying to understand Micah's analogy with the black hole a bit better and just understand why it was a black hole example.

Is there any tie-in with gravitational force or something else?

There is, but it's also about... there's a gravitational force in terms of...

But also it ties into general relativity, how your perspective as you're moving through space is going to be different from someone else's perspective.

And so while someone else would perceive you, might perceive you being basically spaghettifying your experience, while I paused, I was actually trying to find the article that I read this from.

But maybe what would happen if you fell into a black hole from astronomy.com? Eventually you're going to be pulled apart by gravity, right? But they were just saying that as you enter the horizon,

you are not going to initially notice that you've entered the horizon of the black hole from your own perspective because of the...

I'm not... I just like... I read this and so I'm just actually... I read this like years ago and so I'm sort of trying to find the exact reference to sort of answer your question and maybe I can get back to...

Let me just do a screenshot of your...

Jess, do you have any insight into black holes?

I have been hearing this idea that this is something akin to dimension and the collapse that we can make 3D or 4D collapse into 2D.

I don't know much about that but I find the concept very, very interesting. Maybe somebody can talk about that.

Sorry, Jeffrey, but before that Daniel, was that a question of reference to me or not?

It was to Kami and Mika when they were talking about how from some perspective is 3D and another 2D and something related to black holes.

Yeah, it was intersecting that with the idea of dimensionality collapse.

Well, now I'm going to have to read that because that is so interesting.

Sorry, sorry.

Josh, you can go ahead, Josh.

I just meant before that, Jeffrey, I thought that you had asked something about black holes before that.

Oh, I was just, I'm not sure what your background is because I don't do any work really on black holes if you have just more insight into the black holes and its context.

Sure. So Kami, about the whole black hole thing, because of the way that black holes work space-time, as you get closer to it and there's an observer that stands far away from it,

that observer will essentially watch your infinite descent into a black hole because he'll never be able to actually observe you across the event horizon.

But as you're falling to the black hole, it will essentially take seconds for you to, more than seconds, like microseconds to observe what's actually happening to you.

But the actual process of spaghettification, which is like this term that consists used to describe what would happen if any organic matter came close to the black hole,

is that because a black hole warps space-time differently at different points, what would essentially happen to your body is that it would get stretched, some arbitrarily length long.

Imagine three miles long, but it would be thinner than a piece of paper or something like that.

And the reason that this is happening is because gravity is acting differently at different points on your body.

So you would experience completely different gravitational pulls and completely different micro densities at your body.

But the observer would not necessarily see this because he's observing you in one particular inertial frame of reference as you're falling infinitely closer towards the event horizon without actually reaching it.

Wow, that's a great explanation. Thank you, Josh.

And Jeffrey.

Oh, that was all Josh there.

Okay, I think I found what I was thinking about earlier. So there's this article you can look up called black holes are like a hologram, and this was June 5th, 2020.

And so it says the theory of relativity describes black holes as being spherical, smooth, and simple, and quantum theory describes them as being extremely complex and full of information, and new research proposes a surprising solution to this duality.

And so the idea is, so three research scientists in Italy were saying that black holes could be like a hologram, while all the information is amassed in a two-dimensional surface able to reproduce a three-dimensional image.

And in this way, cosmic bodies, well, so basically the black hole could be sort of like a hard drive that stores a representation of a three-dimensional reality in two dimensions.

And, or at least, or perhaps even just the, you know, in codes of representation of that reality.

But anyway, if you want to look up the whole paper, just type in black holes are like a hologram, and the article is dated June 5th, 2020.

Thank you, Micah. I absolutely understand what you were saying now, and I get it, and that is such a cool concept.

# Part 6

Because that would kind of go online towards, I wouldn't say supporting the simulation, but just adds more intriguing thoughts to that.

So I love that. Thank you.

One kind of caveat I would add with that is black hole holography is dependent on string theory being the fundamental kind of model of theoretical physics, because holography as a mathematical model or a holography as a principle only really comes out if string theory is true or not.

But holography has been a way of, we've thought a lot of really interesting problems in physics using holography and assuming that things are holograms, but most of those assumptions come from, you know, that string theory is truly the theory of everything for physics that unifies all the forces.

Thank you so much for that, Josh, because that is a big gotcha.

And it actually led to my second question, which was, we are all talking 2D, 3D, but depending on which theoretical physics theory you subscribe to, are we limiting this question to three dimensions only?

So in terms of dimensionality in physics, what we tend to see is that regardless of how many dimensions you're starting with, like, you know, there are types of string theories where you have, you know, 18 dimensional or 11 dimensional symmetry M theory, which is probably like the most popular version of this is based on 11 dimensional supergravity.

What tends to happen is that, you know, these dimensions are really tiny and they tend to fold up, so you iterate to eventually on a macro scale, what you have is four dimensions, regardless of how many dimensions you start out with.

The only existing theory I know of which there is fundamentally more, you know, theoretical representations of spacetime that doesn't fold up, that actually is more fundamental than the four dimensions that we see is actually Eric Weinstein's newly released paper, which posits that.

Right, hang on that dash, because I was just about to mention, when you mentioned that it tends to go, you know, fold and de facto become four dimensions, it's actually that geometric unity, Eric Weinstein's theory actually pops into my head and say,

aha, interesting, wonder if there's a connection, so what a coincidence. He was actually in the room earlier, I sent him an invite, but he didn't come home. Well, you should call him back.

We have a question for him. Yeah, so Eric's theory is really interesting because it actually doesn't posit that dimensions fold up, so I found, like, I got a copy of his working paper and I've kind of been working through it to try to understand his theory.

It's complicated. Did you get it through the website? Yes, GeometricUnity.org, yep. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so it's available there, but Eric's theory is really interesting because what essentially says is that spacetime is not fundamental, it's actually a projection map of this 14 dimensional space where all these

other different field theories are clumped up and that actions within those spaces project down to a four dimensional space where gravity is a constant.

So Eric's theory is actually only here, I know those cells are, which argues that spacetime is not a fundamental, but rather a projection of a higher dimensional space.

So Eric's theory right now is very much a work in progress. There's a lot of formalization to be desired in his theory, but it's certainly very intriguing.

The best case scenario for Eric's theory in my mind is that he's going to fundamentally revolutionize the way that we think about geometry and higher dimensional spaces in fundamental and theoretical physics that we've ever done before.

And it's certainly an intriguing premise. So aren't there other theories that would at spacetime being, the spacetime metric being emergent from quantum mechanics?

Loop quantum gravity kind of does this. Loop quantum gravity redefines spacetime as a series of spin networks, but generally what happens is that the same metric pops out, the same metric that we used to measure the regular time arrow and the orthogonal imaginary time arrow.

Those same metrics generally pop out. There are different types. I mean, if you consider like, you know, something like, you know, like a solid state model of the universe, then sure, you know, you know, sort of like emergent spacetime as a result of that.

But as far as I'm aware, the geometry of those theories has not really been worked out as well as Eric's theory does. So I don't necessarily know if I would put most of those theories on the same level.

Do we already have something akin to something that comes after quantum mechanics that don't enhance more? I think Donald Hoffman was referring to something like that when he was discussing the collapse of time and space last Sunday.

So I would very much take Donald Hoffman's theory of spacetime not being a fundamental with a grain of salt. So I've read his paper on it, and I'll just put it this way.

It's one thing when a mathematical physicist can prove using higher dimensional geometric spaces that, you know, projection, that spacetime is a projection.

Another thing when a neuroscientist uses only like three pages of math and a Markov chain that, you know, that, you know, that spacetime is not a fundamental.

So I would take his theory with a very large grain of salt. I don't necessarily think that you have to believe that spacetime is a fundamental.

If Eric's theory is more formalized and is, you know, is subjected to a lot of rigor and passes through the peer review process, then we actually would have a theory in contention against string theory and quantum gravity that spacetime is not fundamental,

but very much wary of Donald Hoffman's theories about spacetime and physics. I do not think he lacks the proper mathematical background and rigor in order to back up his theory.

What about his mention of another framework beyond quantum mechanics? Do we have to be half that?

I'm not sure what he means by that. So he, in his kind of paper about this, called, like, a theory of perception, he basically argues that, like, he uses a bit of circular logic here and argues that any sort of understanding about spacetime and quantum mechanics

has to come from outside spacetime. But then within his own paper, he makes an argument using Markov chains and, like, dynamical systems, which are very much dependent on spacetime and, like, the notion of time.

So, again, his argument is not quite clearly considered. I'm very wary of this argument.

Yeah, but it's also, I mean, to do something to Donald Hoffman and work in progress. He has to have something already in shoes.

He was also vastly misinterpreting some of Nima's theories from what I could tell you. Nima's theories are consistent with quantum mechanics, and Donald was saying the opposite during his talk.

It's hard to understand. Another question. In quantum, the collapse of time and space is possible. That's something that can be fit inside the quantum framework, doesn't it?

Dependent on your interpretation of quantum mechanics, yes.

That's very, very interesting.

I mean, so, I mean, there are two kind of, like, the majority of people working in theoretical physics. And, Jeffrey, I would love for you to chime in this as well.

I don't know what the quantum, like, information or quantum computational system is. I assume you guys are using the Copenhagen interpretation because it would be somewhat useless for you guys to use an Everestian interpretation of quantum mechanics.

But generally, there are kind of two interpretations of quantum mechanics that are in contention here. One of which is the Copenhagen, which is that when you observe some sort of quantum mechanical wave, what you're actually doing is taking an observation of it and then sampling it from a certain distribution.

And, thus, you only see, you know, a certain, you know, position of that wave within a certain probability space versus the Everestian interpretation, which says that there is no such thing as a wave function collapse.

What you're actually seeing is one type of, you know, reality, whereas in another world, whereas in another universe, the same action has occurred but a different outcome when you observe that sampling.

So it's certainly possible for, you know, for you to have, you know, wave function collapses or there not to be a wave function collapse, but it's dependent on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that you're operating off of.

But for most purposes, most researchers, in theory, and I assume an experiment as well. I mean, I do a fair amount of experimental physics as well.

It would be very useless for us to use the Everestian interpretation or the many worlds interpretation as it's kind of known.

But the Copenhagen interpretation has kind of ruled supreme for the longest time. And that one is dependent on a probabilistic wave function that is dependent on collapse when you observe it.

So I would also comment. Well, we use the Copenhagen interpretation, like we'd say we measure the system and things like that.

I would say most quantum information theorists don't actually believe in, like, objective collapse theories.

We don't believe that there's, you know, nonlinearities that are happening. You know, if you ask the quantum information theorist what happens during a measurement, it's just like, oh, you're entangling your system with the rest of the environment,

and then you're throwing away those degrees of freedom and just looking at the system or just focusing on the system.

Which I guess you can call it like the decoherence program, but in my mind that is generally pretty compatible with the Ebertarian interpretation.

Interesting. I was not aware of that. But are you guys seeing it from a perspective of like purely quantum mechanics or like information theory?

I guess they're more information. I wouldn't say everyone's thinking about like the philosophical interpretations of what's being talked about.

But I mean, generally, if you think, I mean, if you look at what's going on during a measurement, you have some apparatus is being entangled with the system is trying to measure and that apparatus is also being exposed to a larger environment.

So, I mean, you can look at Zurich's quantum Darwinism and the emergence of like pointer states and things like that.

So he tries to derive the born rule from the rest of the pastures of quantum mechanics.

Can I ask you, Jeffrey? I really think there's three main types of theories. There's the decoherence interpretations like many worlds interpretation.

There's the collapse theories like the Copenhagen interpretation and there's hidden variable theories like Bohmian mechanics like David Bohm.

So I'm just curious, Jeffrey, what people are subscribed to in your field and what they dismiss.

I mean, there are other ones too. So there's Cubism as well. I don't fully understand Cubism. I think Copenhagen and many worlds are not that people are actually thinking about interpretations but just a practical way of thinking about quantum systems.

You know, pilot wave theory or probably Bohm is very beautiful like mathematics, but I mean, it relies on these extra non-local hidden variables.

So it's not something that's going to come up like naturally when just doing quantum research unless you're specifically looking at interpretations.

The objective collapse theories do have the nice aspect that they could be falsifiable, at least the ones that have entanglement between massive things,

if it's gravity that's causing the collapse, if you're able to create these entangled states between these massive enough states and you're not seeing collapse, then that would be a few of those objective collapse theories.

Yeah, I think I covered my thesis there, if I'll let anyone else. Yeah, the mathematics of de Broglie or Bohm pilot wave theory, if you want to call it that, are certainly very beautiful.

And it actually walks this very fine line between determinism and probabilistic mechanics as well, which makes it really nice.

But unfortunately, I think hidden variable theory, it's subject to something called Bell's inequality, which still hasn't been disproven.

So there was an experiment conducted by this guy named John Stuart Bell in I think 1964, which basically said that if you take measurements performed independently on two halves of a quantum entangled pair,

then the assumption that the outcomes that depend on hidden variables within each half implies that the outcomes within the two halves are correlated.

But unfortunately, he had found that when you take those independent measurements, you essentially get these inequalities because of the way that you can't really sample from the observations as directly as you would like.

So we got this thing called Bell's inequality and Bell's inequality is this somewhat inane mathematical formula, which you kind of, if you want to prove hidden variables are local and not global, which is what de Broglie,

you know, Bohm pilot wave theory is based on, you would need to disprove Bell's inequality and so far no experimental or theoretical observation has kind of managed to do that yet.

Also, if somebody wants to move the topic away from physics, please feel free to do so. I think generally physics people tend to hijack rooms, and I don't really want to do that right now.

Yeah, and Jess just pointed on that. It doesn't disprove non-local invariables as well and disprove local invariables.

I think de Broglie, Bohm, it was a non-local invariable theory.

Yep, I'd agree with that.

I had this kind of crazy thought.

What if we are living in a simulation and you know how every once in a while we'll discover a more kind of fundamental particle as our accelerators get bigger and bigger.

And it always seems like when are we going to find that ultimate particle, if ever. What if the reason we make advancements with detecting particles and we don't make faster advancements is that the supercomputer that the simulation is built on doesn't have the right memory yet and the right speed.

But as they upgrade the speed and the memory, it thereby gives us the ability to detect smaller and smaller particles because that gives us the ability to have like finer and finer resolution.

Just a crazy thought ahead.

That would be what I was talking about kind of before is the simulation would have to contain all the degrees of freedom in the universe. So I guess the situation you bring up there would be a compressed version that didn't include that resolution to be able to reach that.

I like that at some sort of anecdotal level, Chris, because certainly the universe I live in seems far more complex in 2021 than it was in 1970. So I think we're going to do something.

Yeah, but we are able to describe it better. And as we are able to describe it better, we acquire more power. To me, that's the measurement of how we are actually moving, if we are moving or not in the right direction, is that as we understand more, when we tell things more accurately, we also gain more power.

In this theory, or sorry, Amy, go ahead.

No, you're fine. Go ahead.

# Part 7

In this theory, Chris, would the simulation also be restricting like our ability to create larger reactors as well to get to those energies.

I was kind of thinking that maybe, yes, like maybe there's now I'm just totally like science fiction world because I'm not a physicist, but I was thinking that maybe the supercomputer programmers add some constraints to the simulation where they don't allow the conscious beings in it to like develop more complex machinery to

detect smaller particles or something like that.

I think I have like a video game analogy here. So like, I think this is like kind of an intriguing theory.

Because like, you know, if, if, if like, if you're playing a lot of like mobile games or whatever, if you're, especially if you're trying to build like a build your own country type thing.

Well, at the moment, you're trying to like upgrade your resources for a base. Sometimes you're running to like a time wall where it basically says that you can't like get this particular resource, you can't upgrade, upgrade this particular resource on like until after like this, this, this timer has counted down.

So I think there's probably an analogy in there somewhere of like, you know, until we're fine tuning our like our super quantum computer, if you want to call it that, to be able to make sure that you you believe the resolution that you get when you smash these two, you know, hadrons together or

whatever, we are putting a time wall on your ability to build resources or structures of a certain kind or upgrade them to a sufficient level, such that you can conduct experiments to see those things in the first place.

I think I mean, from porpoise perspective, we don't have the resources, we are the ones who don't have the resources, but we are acquiring them. So if we theoretically in quantum is possible that space and time collapses, I have a little mental exercise to see how we can see that happen.

If we achieve immortality, but for us to see space and time collapsing, we will need immortality.

And we're kind of getting there. So, so inside the simulation, if we are in there, we may actually have a way out on machine, machine that is generating us. And it seems we have the opportunity to do so because we are imagining, we are able to imagine ways for doing that.

So that's the case, the program is allowing us to imagine a way out.

I think that generally the biggest problem we run into when we're talking about simulation theory is, you know, I think we there's a very human centric framework to this right where we have to like kind of imagine things at a human scale.

But if you really think about it, if a civilization was advanced enough to simulate an entire universe, then our ability to anticipate the type of technology they would have would be, we just couldn't do it.

I mean, the general analogy I make is that, you know, if you told somebody who was only exposed to a technology like the abacus, and then you showed them a laptop, there'd be no deductive way that they'd be able to get from that abacus to a laptop.

And so I think we're very much in a similar position where we're at a very abacus stage of our technological development.

And if somebody would, you know, to even consider a technology that would be able to simulate an entire universe, there's no way that we could deductively make, I think, the leaps to get to something that advanced, given our current level of technology.

Yeah, that's a great point.

So were you talking about where did he go?

Nanotechnology, which is going to, did he leave?

I think he did.

You know, living eternally is not sure I would want to.

But if we are living in a simulation, we were discussing this a couple of hours ago, and I'd like to kind of reset the room and make sure that everybody kind of has a chance to talk.

We do have a couple of people on stage that I'd like to hear from.

Oh, it was Daniel, are you there?

Yeah.

Okay, he came back.

So Daniel, were you talking about nanotechnology for, for getting to the point where we will kind of bypass medicine?

Yes, there is this big question of how can we download our conscience to a computer?

I think that before we get to that point, we may be able to get to the point where we transform our biological brain with some additions, probably nanotechnology based into a kind of cyber thing.

So we are able to extend or brain replace parts of it. The example I was giving is we can add a retina that is able to decode, capture the whole range of light.

For processing that, we will need more neurons in the area where we process vision that will require an expansion.

As this is not most likely going to be organic based, but silicon based or something that is more durable, that may be the way we can achieve immortality.

And not having the problem of cloning or pouring conscious that is biological based into silicon or something else based.

And just you were not here when I was describing quickly how we can see time and space collapsing.

So just quickly, I think after we get immortality, what we would like to do is make sure we actually are able to make sure that immortality is for real.

That would mean expand or crunches all around the universe and link difference in all the instantiations through some kind of internet that allow us to be everywhere at the same time.

At that point, that will be actual immortality and at that point, what else will happen? Time and space will collapse everywhere at the same time.

And the way time collapses is that we have all the time to reconstruct or re-read or past and build or imagine a future.

So for all practical purposes, it will be the same thing. That's kind of how I can see that's happening and us being able to explore the quantum space, the pose for the dimensionality.

That was good. I'm going to head to bed, but thank you everyone for the great conversation.

Thank you.

Okay, do we want to hear from Christopher? Hi, Christopher.

Yeah, this topic is always interesting to me. I struggle to think about these things through all the stuff that everyone has skilled at, like all the math stuff and physics, all that jazz.

And so I respect that thinking, all the computer science stuff, I respect that thinking.

I just always struggle to explore, I don't know, I think this is an existential question in my opinion. So I just struggle to explore a way of existing a simulation through the lens of certain disciplines.

Because in letters and numbers and lines and zeros and ones, I understand some of these things on a basic level, but I struggle to connect the dot between hard sciences and a different way of existing or perceiving existence.

So I've done quite a bit of reading on these ideas of simulation theory and I've heard lots of people talk about if we're living in a simulation, we just struggle to wrap my head around it.

So maybe somebody has some more context they could give.

I think that was the purpose of the room, Christopher. It was exactly that same tension for a lot of us here.

It was just a social experiment. We're just really discussing thoughts and I had an idea, it's like, well, what if all of us talking about this is actually a progression somehow in the simulation that allows us to have or gain more information?

You know, like when we found the Higgs boson, dark matter, if we figure out what the meaning for dark matter is in our universe and what its purpose is, the event horizon, black holes.

We keep going down into these deep thoughts on things and maybe all of us coming together collectively and sorting them out is what evolution really is.

Just quickly going back to the idea of one of our conscious being able to expand to infinity and being able to eliminate time as we see it or to collapse time and space.

For that conscious, what we perceive as reality would be kind of an illusion.

So maybe the idea of simulation is the same intuition that we had before with saying in the Eastern tradition that the universe is actually an illusion and there is only one kind of unified, undifferentiated universe of conscious.

So maybe this idea of a simulation is a metaphor for something else and maybe the previous metaphor that we have that everything is an illusion may actually have been more accurate.

That happens, doesn't it? It's a possibility.

Daniel, before you were saying, though, that you felt that maybe we could gain such capacity that we could actually outrun the simulation or break out of it. Are you contrasting?

Is your latest thought somewhat contrasting with that?

Yeah, because if it's an illusion, if it's not a simulation but an illusion, then there's no, I mean, that does not allow us to escape. If it's an illusion, we can escape the illusion, which is to our work, much more than escape the simulation.

Can you explain just a little bit more about this idea of an illusion? Like, how for you could it be not real?

No, no, no, no, no. Not that we are not real is that our reality is different from what we thought it is.

So if you are a conscious that is already everywhere at the same time and there's no past and no future, you are unreachable.

Communication is almost impossible. It's not totally impossible, but you will see us living in an illusion.

You will say, hey guys, can you see that everything is just one thing, that there is not really differentiation, that at some point everything just becomes one at a time and it's basically collapse. It's just an illusion.

But I mean, there could be variability, right, to these super creatures that you're talking about, there could be a variability where they could potentially be able to be everywhere and know everything,

but at the same time hone themselves down such that they're able to, you know, get back down to more, you know, less sophisticated knowing, right, so that they may actually be prepared and contrast.

Yes, as much as we can collapse on our understanding and imagine flat life, but this is exponentially more complex, yes, but that would be possible.

And the other way of thinking about this is maybe that's why we can't find intelligent life in the universe, because if we are really worth that close,

if we achieve immortality and then our conscious becomes universal and past space and time, we will disappear of the known universe.

So, yeah, maybe we just jump there and there is no more about us and the universe will need another species to develop and achieve the same level where they just become one with the universe as we know it.

So, yeah, yeah, for me that is explaining now why we can't find a more advanced civilization, a more advanced civilization who will quantumize itself into infinity, into, yeah.

Maybe we just frame existence with the tools that we've developed, you know, as the toolmaking species on the planet and with the rapid race of computational power to the point that we can create amazing simulations and examine them.

It's probably a natural human response to define existence and creation and purpose with simulation as an example, and you know what, maybe this is the time that we crack the why we're here and what existence is about,

and maybe it's just a continuation on the pathway to find the right tool to crack the question.

Yeah, but what happens when we really crack it, see? At that point, there's no more questions, there's not more, I would say, instantiation, there's not more differentiation, it's just one thing.

And there may be no simulation, it has the flavor of a simulation, but it's just illusion.

But, you know, I had plenty, I had earlier on a few hours ago into this conversation, Daniel, I had come up with something like, you know, sort of tangentially related to what you were talking about.

I sort of suggested that maybe there was a limit to what we could know, or if there, you know, eventually we reach this limit where there's just like a hard limit and we just sort of have all the information and then from there we can basically just have, you know,

control over what there is around us and be able to manipulate sort of a little bit like what David was talking about, just be able to constantly create simulations to our liking.

I'd like to comment on that. This guy, hi everybody, thanks for a great conversation.

One thing that I think gets missed in conversations about the simulation idea is the head versus the heart.

So I think a lot of what we talk about is, you know, the mental idea of being in a simulation and what we would do if we learned everything about the universe.

You know, I think Daniel was saying something like, you know, would there be, we'd be sort of done and we could disembodied or be spaceless and timeless.

But I also like what has been said about the sense of illusion that I think we live in a disconnection from how the world really is.

So and it's our emotions that do that. We have, you know, we think we perceive the world as it is, but really we're perceiving this kind of testing ground for how we're going to respond to people at certain times and how we're going to deal with our emotions.

And I think that we don't really interpret the world as it really is.

So, you know, I think it's valuable to think about that if we wake up to the sense of illusion that there is or wake up to the sense of there being a simulation, we might actually just be more clear on what's really going on and be able to live life more fully.

But it's not like we would be done or anything like that. We would just really be more engaged at a deeper level with all of the things happening in life.

Yeah, that's another possibility. There is this fascinating idea that we on purpose are not able to see it as it is.

Because we are so far here to perpetuate our species, not to see things as they are, probably in our evolutionary advantage, not to see reality completely as it is.

For once, again, we know that we only hear certain spectrum of sound. We only see certain spectrum of light.

Nature could have given us more, but it's just efficiency, doesn't it?

Nature equipped us with exactly what we need no more, because resources are limited.

Yeah, the question is what happened when we are able to achieve a point of not imitation by resources.

Let's talk about maybe the possibility of simulation and illusion, in that the universe could be a simulation, but your interpretation of it could be an illusion, and you get to have both.

Yeah, but I have the feeling that the illusion perspective may be more accurate than the simulation one.

So let's say, again, we have both possibilities, doesn't it? Now our technology allows us to create simulations.

So we say, okay, yeah, that's what we had before. I mean, when we had clocks, we thought, oh, the universe is a clock.

Now we have quantum. We say, oh, the universe is a quantum something. All right, sure.

So we are saying now we have simulations because we are able to create our own simulations, but that may be just an illusion, and it has the flavor of a simulation.

Difficult to tell. I'm not sure how we can make the harder variations.

# Part 8

So this reminds me of the conflict between the idea of if you have people who argue that existence is primary versus people who argue that consciousness is primary.

It sounds like the position for illusion that I think in my favor is that your consciousness has a primary role and existence has a secondary role.

It's like an illusion of your consciousness, and therefore you're in the camp on creating reality with my mind or something, right?

And then the other position is that existence is primary and consciousness is just creating a flawed representation of existence,

and that would be more of the simulation argument that's what I'm sort of interpreting.

But where I stand basically earlier was that I was saying that if you get outside of your own mind and just look at how someone else's mind is making a flawed representation of reality

when you see someone who has a lot of delusions, why are their delusions not changing your reality for you?

And I think that just points to a simple and obvious explanation, which is that a person's understanding of reality is not primary over reality itself, that it's secondary,

that the human being has illusion and an illusion of the simulation.

Yeah, but we have agency. Again, we are being told, quote-unquote, created by the universe, but we can also create a star or universe to a degree.

I think putting a team in the universe seems to be possible.

Yeah, yeah.

Mika, is it Mika or Micah?

I usually say Micah.

Micah, sorry, thank you.

Can you point to evidence? It sounds like your question or your framing of it is stating that there is an objective physical existing world out there outside of ourselves as observers.

And would you agree with that? And what evidence would you say supports that or disproves the alternative view?

So my argument was that if you're only considering yourself and what you know, then you may not be able to make a deduction there.

But if you consider the delusions of another person or the delusions of an animal and making an error in judgment, and you can see that an individual brain's perception can be flawed and that when that happens, it doesn't overrule the reality that they're in.

And if your mind was superior to the reality that you're in, then your delusions would not have errors, right? Then your delusions would be truths.

But what about the dialogical possibility that is in between that we are creation and we are creators?

So it sounds to me like it's not possible to believe in a simulation because in your model of the world, if there's a simulation that means you can't be a creator of your life or something.

And so you are unable to say, well, a simulation could be primary because the only way I could be a creator of my life is if my consciousness is primary and the world is an illusion.

And I'm not stuck on that sort of axis. Whether you're creating your life or whether it's deterministic, it could be a simulation and whether you're creating your life or whether it's deterministic, it could be an illusion.

I don't believe that it's coupled, that you have to have the universe be an illusion to be a creator of your life. And I don't believe that the universe could also be a simulation and potentially could be a creator of your life.

In both situations, it could be that determinism is happening and that your participation in co-creating the universe with the universe is just a feedback loop sort of mechanism that you're a part of it but you're really not separate from the cosmos.

And you're not really making decisions that are separate from oneness with the physics of the cosmos. And the idea of you being a separate self that's making decisions that's creating your life that's separate from the physics of the cosmos itself is really just contradictory to Buddhist thought.

Okay, but if we leave the framework of simulation, maybe we shouldn't but because we are not in a simulation robot just quickly. So if we are in an illusion and this illusion is being created by something else, but I am also a participant on that illusion and as much as I am a participant of it, I am also a creator.

You're imagining a conflict between something else and yourself and what I'm saying is there's not two. It's not you versus something else. It's a co-creation between the one self that is both you and something else at the same time.

It's sort of like that we applied, we had spoken about this before Micah, where we apply the language and the reasoning to the variables of the universe so as to be able to gain a relationship to be able to put the relationships that it may itself may not be able to make for itself.

And then if we unify what we are able to reason about it with it, then maybe there is that co-cooperation.

I like that.

Are we leaving room for other folks to jump in here too or are there other folks that want to speak up?

Sorry, I just wanted to find, Micah, did that resonate with you, Micah? Yeah, totally. I like that a lot, Jeremy. That was really good.

Can you repeat that Jeremy, please?

That's a little late. It's three o'clock in the morning where I am here right now.

Same here.

I don't know. That might be a one time. We'll see. That's a long conversation. Me and Micah have been in this room for a few hours so we were sort of going back and forth about, and this sort of related a little bit with Don Hoffman with his talk a few days ago or a week ago about this idea of conscious agents and whether or not he's trying to be able to make it.

I know Josh had discussed why that theory actually has a lot of potential holes in it.

But just regardless, it was talking about this idea that there would be conscious agents that would sort of be sort of foremost in the theory and they would sort of go before time and space and time and space would be sort of adjoining.

Anyway, and so that these agents might somehow carry metacognition. I had been on the stage and I had asked them that.

He had suggested, yes, that these agents might be able to have the sort of ability to connect particles and forces in the universe in such a way to form almost a metacognition that allows them to gain some level of knowledge of each other.

And then what we're talking about is a variation on that, which is that maybe it's actually the human's job or any intelligent life or whatever creatures that are in the universe.

It would be our job instead of Don Hoffman's cognitive agents or conscious agents, it would be our job to be able to discover all the relationships as opposed to some other third party.

Yeah, I've opened up the room. So if you want to come up and ask a question, go ahead and raise your hand.

I have a comment around, you know, I think that there's this underlying assumption when we talk about a simulation that there's some other person creating the simulation and I've heard that mentioned a few times.

And I think it's worth talking about that because I don't think that's a necessary piece of the puzzle.

I think that it's possible to have a world which behaves like a simulation but is not run by another world which is running the simulation.

Because that's like adding a whole level of meta-existence that I don't think is actually necessary.

The way that it can work or could possibly work is much like a video game.

You know, if you're playing a video game with someone across the world, you have separate worlds, really.

You have your world on your computer that's being rendered for you and they have their world that's being rendered for them.

And the trick of the computer game is to make those worlds seem like the same world.

So the way it does this, through techniques like optimist synchronization is one technique where each computer is smartly, optimistically guessing what it thinks is going to happen next and rendering that for you.

But then it's also sharing relevant information with the other computer so that you can actually find out what is happening, although there's a delay because they're far away from you.

So the computer works really hard to try and synchronize these two systems so that it creates a virtual world that's seamless and seems objective.

But in that same way, I think that we can each be having our own subjective reality without postulating that there's an actual objective reality.

Aside from the stitched together mutual subjective realities that we have.

And as long as that's seamless and consistent between our observations, we're never going to guess that there's actually nothing as objective there.

And so in my research on this, I found that there's really no underlying way to tell the difference, at least at the surface level.

A shared simulation that we are all creating or an illusion that we are all creating and participating in.

Yeah, I think it aligns with a lot of what I've heard said here from you, Daniel and from other folks.

I brought up a similar idea earlier about, if you look at how No Man's Sky was created, it's a similar idea to what Sky was saying.

There's a really cool idea that I think is called the Holographic Principle.

You can look that up on Wikipedia, the Holographic Principle, or you can look up just basically the universe as a hologram and you'll find a whole bunch of articles that they talk about how...

The idea is that with an ordinary hologram, you have a 3D image that's encoded on a 2D surface.

But this time they're saying that maybe the entire universe is actually encoded on a 2D surface.

And that's also interesting because we mentioned earlier that people were saying that there's an article about the ability for the horizon of a black hole to the 2D surface to actually store holographic information.

There's an idea about the universe being a hologram and there's an idea about holograms being able to be stored on the 2D surface of a black hole.

Let's say that there's a black hole for every galaxy, and I don't know if that's true, but maybe every galaxy is some sort of hologram invaded from the horizon of every black hole.

And we're all basically holograms on a black hole.

So this is the subject of my research and it's pretty cool that you brought it up.

I have a paper that just came out called Spacetime Paths as a Hole, and it shows that it's in the internal quantum reports, if you want to check it out.

It shows that as we formulated it, quantum mechanics and the path integral of quantum field theory actually has these properties of holography.

And I think it's important to sort of back away from the idea that you need a surface like the surface of a black hole, like a physical surface,

or like some people imagine that the edge of the cosmos is like this two-dimensional screen that's projecting us as holographic people.

There's actually just this relationship.

The relationship underlying holograms is actually much deeper, which is a relationship between the frequencies or the frequency representation of things in the physical world.

And you can represent everything in the physical world in terms of its frequency representation.

And in that sense, the source of that hologram is really just all around us.

We're immersed in it. It's not like it's out there projecting onto us, but we're just immersed in this, what you could say, like a non-physical,

as Daniel was saying, a timeless, spaceless representation of the world, which is calculable all the time.

It's just a computation that we can do.

But the idea is that we're very much like a hologram.

And what makes a hologram interesting is that it encodes a physical reality just in terms of information.

So you can think of the fact that in quantum experiments, it's been shown conclusively that properties don't exist for objects before you measure them.

So there's no such thing as a property of an object except in relationship.

Like when we bump into something, it has the property of bumping into us.

But before we bump into it, there's nothing definite there.

And this just really aligns with the notion of a simulation, which is providing us information when we need it.

But it doesn't actually exist. It doesn't actually have a history of its own.

Or that could also be like a procedurally generated universe that's procedurally generated around the observer or the interaction.

And I think that, again, the way it's really interesting to think about No Man's Sky in particular is a procedurally generated universe inside a video game.

And just sort of like as a vague analogy.

But isn't all this based on the structure of vision?

I mean, really, the input power brain assimilates or assembles objects, depth and color and the emotions of color.

I'm currently working on a photography project.

I'm an artist exploring blindness through photography processes, experimental photography processes.

And what input data goes in through, you know, the photoreceptors can be flawed or marred or what you see I don't see or what you experience I would never experience.

Some of the images that I create, people will say, well, what is this?

And I say, what do you think it is? And then they say, oh, it looks like a landscape with a sea and a shore.

And I remember going to the beach as a kid, when in reality some other, that's not really what that object was when I photographed it.

But everybody comes from their own like a memory database, sensory database.

And I'm wondering how much is that is created through like a cellular level and how we can see one another as we see each other in color and shape.

And is it really just based on the structure of our vision and does all of this that we've been talking about, I know it matters.

But if you have low vision, you're legally blind and you bump into something or you're in a room and colors and objects don't really resemble a table or a chair or a bowl of cereal.

How we can get beyond that.

And in a sense, isn't everything input through our eyes really what we're talking about?

So I think, and I'd like to bounce this back to Sky in a second, but I think it's any interaction, any sensory interaction, any sort of measurement,

whether it's your eyes or anything else that is, anyway, I'll let Sky finish that.

Yeah, I agree with that.

# Part 9

Micah, right?

And yeah, I really like the reference to vision.

I use the example, I was going to say metaphor or analogy, but it's an example of images and vision.

Because if you can picture a photograph, I'm not talking about a hologram right now, just a regular photograph like the screen that you're looking at.

And if you want to decompose that, you could decompose it into pixels, right?

You can picture where every single pixel is.

And one pixel is white, another pixel is blue, and they're separate on the screen.

That's a reductionist view of things.

You're reducing the image down into its spatially separated components.

And every pixel, you can picture where it goes.

It has an XY coordinate on the screen.

But you can also equivalently break down any kind of image into patterns.

And these patterns in the basic case with the Fourier transform are just what are called plane waves, or just lines, stripes across the screen.

And you can take these stripes, and just like as if they were piece of points of data, each stripe can be laid down in just the right way, or set of stripes across the whole screen.

And they interfere when you lay one that's like vertical stripes at a high frequency and then horizontal stripes at a low frequency and at an angle of a medium frequency.

If you apply them in just the right way, just like you're adding just the right ingredients to a cake, and you mix them all together through this thing called a Fourier transform, you get out your original image.

And you can create any scene that you want out of this procedure from these basic patterns.

But what's amazing about this is you're not breaking it down into pixels, which are kind of reducing the space into the pieces where the sum of the parts is just no more than the parts themselves.

You're actually breaking it down into patterns that extend across the whole screen.

So this is the essence of wholism, where every part of the screen corresponds to every part of the patterns that make up the screen.

And if you want to change the whole image on the screen, you have to change a pattern that extends across everything.

And I think this is a really fundamental aspect of what we're talking about, of how a holographic universe can work and how space and time are break down in a certain way.

Hi, it's Ben here from the UK Sky.

I just wanted to say that what you just said there's not even the remotest bit purely theoretical.

That's exactly how JPEG image compression works.

If you have a lossless, if you turn the compression off on JPEG, you're doing exactly that and just storing the frequency space.

And then when you decide to compress your JPEG, you're just doing a little bit of quantization, losing a bit of information in the frequency space.

So that's pretty fascinating. Thanks for that.

MP3s as well, yeah, audio.

What do you do when, I mean, how this intersects with the other possibility that is built a 3D environment that represents these images that we're discussing, but with formulas behind, where everything is mathematical on the background?

Well, I don't think it's about building it. I think this is the way that the cosmos runs.

The propagation of, what I showed in my work is that the propagation of a wave function, which wave functions are what determine what a physical particle is, like an electron.

The propagation of these things behaves according to the same mathematics we're talking about with images.

So the world that we experience has, I guess I'm not connected.

Yeah, I cannot get what you are saying, but a pixel is a numeric representation on a map.

But if we do drawing, that is, we don't go to Photoshop, but we go to Illustrator.

Every time we do an Illustrator or a 3D graphic program has formulas behind, doesn't it?

How does it interact at all, if it interacts at all with your model?

Yeah, that's a good connection.

Imagine you're in Photoshop and you want to blur everything in your photograph, or you want to sharpen all the edges, or you want to make some kind of overall change.

What you would do is apply a filter in the frequency space.

So to blur everything, you could go to the outer edges of the frequency space and remove all the outer edges, and that takes away all the high frequencies, which means all the quickly varying portions of your picture.

So all the edges go away and become blurry.

And so you can make these changes to the entire picture with a very localized or specific targeted change with a filter in the frequency domain.

And so what I imagine is interesting about this in the physical world is if the physical world does behave according to the same principles, which we know it does, as Ben was saying, in image processing, for instance, in music processing.

If this applies to particles as well, like the physical nature of things, then there's a sense in which space and time are not relevant in this framework.

It doesn't mean they can be bypassed. It doesn't mean we can travel faster than the speed of light.

But it does mean that our conception of what is far and what is near could be flawed and that the size of the cosmos, being 13 billion light years across or whatever it is, is one framework.

But there's this other framework in which space and time don't even have any relevance and leaves a lot of open questions.

Sky, you were talking before about, you know, sort of the information exchange between particles, for instance, or particles and forces, right?

Do you want to elaborate as to what you, like how you imagine that?

Well, I'll say maybe in response to that, that we, I think it does come down to interactions. Everything that, there's this way of looking at things that is relational and quantum measurement and quantum interpretations and quantum mechanics that are relational,

meaning that it's, there's no objective, as coming back to what we were saying earlier, there's no objective world out there, aside from the mutual subjective world that we're each creating, that are also interacting.

And I don't think it comes down to conscious observers in this case. My personal stance is that all of interaction is this way.

Just the interaction between a pool cue and a pool ball is, we wouldn't say it's experiencing a reality because it's not conscious and able to describe that reality, but the same mathematics and physics would apply to this subjectivity there as well.

It's kind of, I like, because like, I've only been here for a minute, but like that started making me think about like the code with like, of other spaces. But if so, regardless of if we're living a simulation or not, if that is true, how could you just like benefit your actual like living life?

If that even is possible. You are whatever a simulation or not, or I am whatever I am a simulation or not, that was what I, that is what I am.

I think, I think it's possible to benefit from this. I'm seeing the world this way because in a way we could say that the simulation is really about, I think, you know, what kinds of emotional experience are we having?

How are we treating ourselves? How are we treating each other? And not, I'm not saying what the values should be, but that there are values and that we learn about our own values through experience.

And it's very much, I mean, if I could just summarize it, I would say, you know, the law of karma from Hinduism is maybe along these lines that if we, if we start to see everything that shows up in our, in our life as relevant in the simulation as if there's some kind of underlying path or usefulness that we can, we can glean from experiences.

I think it's, it's a shift in mindset that we can, we can actually benefit from what's going on instead of feeling victimized by it. It's not to say we have control over, over life or experiences, but I think there is a shift in mindset which might be relevant.

And I'll add to that that my research tries to put on a solid foundation, the idea of synchronicity and synchronicities are coincidences which show up in life that are not necessarily positive. I want to make that point, but that are useful and can be beneficial for growth.

Sky, Sky, have you looked at the last technology for video conferencing that NVIDIA has? No, I haven't. Okay, in order to maximize bandwidth and make video conferencing possible at low, when we think everywhere, NVIDIA generates a big map of the person who is talking,

send the image just one map to the person who is listening or receiving the communication and then begins recreating the interaction by animation.

So by doing so, they can change the angle from where the camera is representing the image in the receptor. So you may be, as we usually do, we have the camera on the right and we are reading or looking at the monitor or the other person on the left.

And our eyesight is not level to the middle of the camera. So this technique allows for the image on the other side to look at the person over there to the eye.

So it's like a real time deep fake where only the basic mapping of the movements are transmitted, not the whole deep map.

In the same way, if we have in Photoshop a face, a photograph of a face, and we draw the same thing in Illustrator or a 3D program, the vector-based version is much more efficient.

The photo can be 24 megabytes or whatever, and the vector-based can be 1 megabyte or less. It's much more efficient that way. How that maps with what you are doing, if it maps at all?

Daniel, it's Ben here from the UK. If I could jump in for two seconds just to let everybody know. I've just tweeted a very good two-minute YouTube office a bit more than two minutes, but a YouTube video I've had exactly that by a channel called Two Minute Papers, and it's fascinating.

And that method of not only straightening your face so you look like you're looking in the camera, but compressing the cool down to what is essentially just the audio, and you're on the other end reconstructs your face from the audio plus a small amount of other metadata, I think, is huge reduction in bandwidth sent, and really does raise the question of what is reality if you're looking at this completely reconstructed version of somebody.

And it's real-time, I think it is great. And it's real-time, also on the GP. Yeah, I did real-time deep fake that we can have more computers right now with an NVIDIA video card.

Yeah, amazing. And as I said, I just tweeted a link to that because I remember seeing that very good summary on YouTube.

The using I've had about simulation at one point, a couple of usings. One has been, I paused a video game I was playing with my son the other day, and when I paused it, I thought, hey, if we were in a simulation, then we as agents in that simulation wouldn't know if the game had been paused for any amount of time, at any point in our lives that the simulation that we're on could be being paused and resumed.

And indeed, the speed at which the simulation is being simulated could be increased or decreased, provided it maintains the synchronicity that people were talking about earlier to maintain the illusion.

So that's just amusing without really just amusing. And the other amusing I've had that's quite interesting is if you sit down to set up a space game on a computer, and you want a really ambitious game that goes from Ant to the universe,

and you've got some fundamental constraints, which is using two bit numbers, you've got a problem, because you've got a limit on the smallest thing you can have, you've got a limit on the biggest thing you can have.

And then the performance and machine puts limits on your frame rates, and it's fascinating that in physics, you have these concepts of the smallest size you can have at length, and the smallest time you can have,

which seem to be very strong correlates to things like frame rates of the simulation, the smallest meaningful time is the frame step, and the smallest distance is the smallest distance that your number system can represent.

That's just another amusing. And yeah, just a couple of thoughts there.

I'm just wondering if there's any other voices, female voices that want to depend on a lot of men talking here.

Hell yeah, hell yeah.

Yeah, we haven't heard from Ross Daniel.

I could add some value to what Ben said.

I jumped on earlier because there was a lot of talks about physics, and I wanted to bring up this idea, maybe coming from an epistemological lens, where when we talk about the possibility that we're living in a simulation,

the first thought that comes to mind is what if there is a reality that we have an experience or can experience, because I'll use this as an example.

For example, gravity is 9.8 meters per square on Earth, and so we have billions and billions and billions of data points to prove that.

But in some far off universe somewhere or in some other person's experience, gravity could actually have a repeatable data point that actually disproves that.

This is a falsification for science.

My thought is what if instead of the simulation that we're quote unquote talking about is just something that actually exists outside of the realm of what we physically experience and what we can prove right now.

So I just wanted to kind of get your guys' thoughts on that, especially those that are coming more from a scientific background.

Yeah, I appreciate that question.

# Part 10

I'll jump in if somebody else wants to.

I keep coming back to the emotional component here that we are.

We are experiencers of emotion and that our emotions play this really big role in how we interpret our world.

So I was going to connect that to your question around gravity.

For instance, gravity, we do know that gravity is only 9.8 meters per second squared on the surface of the Earth.

It changes even if you go to the mountains, and that changes depending on the size of the planet that you're on.

So there's a verifiability there.

But it's only verifiable under those conditions if you go to different part of the university to experience gravity according to general relativity, and it would just be whatever is the gravity in that particular region.

So I guess you're asking about replicability of some kind of measurement of being in the simulation.

Can we tell that and can we replicate the measurements or somehow share consistent measurements that indicate that?

Maybe for clarity, let's take some type of constant, maybe like the speed of light.

So if we were something like that, if we assume that there's some constant, what if there is a part of the universe that actually flies in the face of that constant that we take for granted?

So we can even say, oh, entropy or something, or some law of thermodynamics doesn't actually exist in this particular part of the universe.

So because in epistemology, you can have a million or a billion or a trillion data points that confirm some type of law of thermodynamics,

but something that can be verified that actually flies in the face of that actually would disprove that and then you would have to go into a new direction.

So that's maybe hopefully more of a clarification that I wanted to add.

If I could jump in there a second, I think we can learn a lot from extrapolating forward from how we make simulations today.

We increasingly sophisticated simulations we make in video games and assuming that any other intelligent life might follow a similar path.

It might follow a very, very different path.

But in those games, one of the things you do is you use parameters and it's a parameter on the world and you might, in a naive game,

you would put in the G that you're talking about as a parameter, a more complicated game, you would put in a different G called the Big G

and it would allow for the things that sky's talking about, like the different size and densities of the planets and all that.

But they are parameters that are baked in and any agents in the game, if they ever develop any awareness, would be able to discover potentially those parameters.

And the likelihood is that that parameter is the same across the entire simulation because it's just a simpler argument than saying that the parameter varies in different places.

The whole of cosmology is based on the idea that the rules of science are the same in parts of the universe and in the simulation they would be.

So I think we just operate on that assumption that those things are the same, those constants, those parameters are the same.

And unless we find, because you can't really make any progress in science, unless you do, in some regards, certainly in things like astronomy,

where you're looking out there to see what is, you assume that the laws are the same.

And if they don't turn out to be, you would see some discrepancies.

It's just that so far we've generally, I think, seen that the laws are similar in all the places we look.

It feels like parameters to make, so just a thought, I don't know if that helps.

Right.

I'm speaking.

Sorry, I didn't mean that right.

But that's what I'm saying.

I think that assumption is actually really important to not overlook.

It's something that maybe we want to take into consideration that the unknown unknowns out there could be the representation of something that we are living in a simulation.

Because you did mention, Ben, like, for example, you know, like computer systems and binary systems, we have, you know, certain numbers.

Like, for example, in JavaScript, you can't go past a certain number.

And you're saying, or like frame rates, you know, we can't go below a certain frame rate.

And then, you know, the way our computers work are like that.

So we have these constraints and my, you know, question again, it's more of a question or a thought is that there can be things that exist outside of the constraints of what we already know.

And I think that is definitely something that would be worth exploring, especially from that lens.

Something that can be interesting to think about, if you haven't really thought about physics in this way, is, you know, we tend to think of the boundaries of things like the boundaries of, what's the boundaries of the simulation.

While most people would think about some spatial boundary, like the edge of the known universe, 13 billion light years away.

You know, outside of this galaxy, there's other galaxies, beyond those galaxies, maybe there's some edge.

But if you really think about what's the natural boundary of the universe, it's a speed, it's the speed of light.

So we know that you can't go faster than the speed of light.

And it could be possible that the universe itself is infinite in size, but we know that it's finite or limited in the speed you can go.

And speed is just another, it's actually more fundamental than position, because speed takes into consideration the relationship between position and time, space and time.

So I think it's been really fascinating to rethink, you know, my framework about assuming that when we live in a physical universe, that the limits are spatial and rather shifting to say, well, actually the limitation that the cosmos has is that you can't go faster than a certain speed.

And that's like the boundary, the edge of the room is the speed of light.

That's a fascinating concept earlier, somebody talked about things like no man's sky or procedurally generated games.

You can have a procedurally generated world which is continuously procedurally generated, so that new stuff's being made up on the fly and the old stuff is being discarded where possible to save memory, otherwise you just eventually run out of memory.

In that ratio, where there's a lot of agents running around in a procedurally generated world that is generated on the fly, it sounds very similar to that.

You have a situation in which information can't be transmitted beyond a certain rate across that space because you've got memory limitations, etc.

So thinking of the universe as a procedural generation that's constantly expanding itself and perhaps discarding bits, that's the fascinating way of looking at things.

I'm done, I'm done.

Scott, are you saying that the universe would be as large as the speed of light has been able to basically reach in particular directions?

Well, I think you have to go a little farther than that because I think that, and this is speculative, okay?

But I think that I've never been fully convinced that we have the whole picture on the timeline of the cosmos to begin with.

The Big Bang is a decent and well-established conclusion drawn from certain experimental data that we have.

But I've never been comfortable with the idea that this very physicalist notion of the world exploded into being 13.8 billion years ago or whatever it is.

And then everything, you know, space and time expanded into the void, whatever that is.

And this might be illustrating my lack of knowledge of inflation theory.

But inflation happened in which space and time expanded fashion and speed of light.

And then somehow, you know, 13.8 billion years later or whatever it is, the universe is however big because lights have time to travel.

And what's beyond that, I think the model is lacking there.

So I think that that's why it's useful to think about, you know, I was talking earlier about photography and Adobe Photoshop.

What's true about Adobe Photoshop images is that the information that composes them is distributed throughout the picture.

That's what all those wave patterns do.

And that's really what a hologram is about, too.

You look at a hologram and you can see the image that you're seeing from all these different angles

because the information about all the relationships of all the buildings, say, if you're looking at a hologram of a city,

the information about the relationships between all those buildings is distributed throughout the picture.

So when you tilt the picture, you can see it from different angles.

So this notion of information is distributed throughout the system is really what I think is possibly the nature of our physical space and time reality,

in which case the sense that the edge of the universe is somewhere out there and we're in the middle of it doesn't really make any sense

or isn't the best way to look at it.

Skylight, that reminds me, of course, there's a difference between the age of the universe and the size of the age.

However, whatever we call the age, 13.8, whatever billion years old, it's of course much bigger.

It's like getting nearer, nearer 100 billion years in size.

Definitely worth meditating on that, maybe blowing up a balloon and watching the surface as it expands

and trying to get one's head around the difference between the age and the size.

It does potentially suggest that the universe's size isn't limited by the speed of light,

if you can get through, so that's pretty fascinating.

# Part 11

I'd like to say something.

Go ahead.

This is pretty awesome.

So I've definitely thought about this a couple of times.

I think what I'm going to mention is a little bit less scientific,

but if the universe is a display, however you want to say it,

it basically would mean that it's not actually that big.

In fact, space between the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy,

there would be no space if it's a simulation because it would just be a display.

And let's say you traveled in a spaceship from Milky Way to Andromeda,

you wouldn't actually be traveling anywhere.

The display would just move towards you until you reach that galaxy, for example.

If it's real, if the universe is actually physically three dimensions and real,

that means that the space between the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy is huge.

And if you took a spaceship there, then you're actually moving towards it.

And so I guess what I'm trying to say is,

initially that's scientific, it's just kind of a way to think about it

or a way to kind of meditate on it.

So in other words, if it's a display, that means you never actually walk down the street,

the street just moves around you while you're walking.

If it's real, then you're obviously walking down the street.

Being Easter, I also want to mention Jesus Christ

because a lot of the things Jesus said kind of are in line with this discussion.

He talked about being able to move a mountain if you have enough faith or walk on water.

When he was arrested, somebody's ear got cut off.

Jesus picked his ear up off the ground and miraculously put it back on the guy's head.

How is that possible? How did Jesus do miracles?

He either actually happened physically or it's just a display.

And Jesus just knew how to rearrange the display and do miraculous things.

One more thing I want to mention is, let me make sure I say the name of this correctly,

but it's called the, I'm sure some of you know how to explain this scientifically.

I don't understand it completely, but it's the double slit experiment,

which basically sums up looking at an object.

So if you, let's say there's a tree behind you, the particles in the tree have a certain pattern.

But if you turn around and look at that tree, the particles are aware that you're looking at it

and the pattern changes.

So this is scientifically proven. It's called the double slit experiment.

But that's pretty much all I have to say.

So we could speak about the double slit experiment and observation and waves and particles.

Those are good points.

So Ben, did you want to say something on that?

Well, thanks. I've just thought for a bokeh. The first half of what you're saying is there,

in games you cheat all the time.

So if it's inconvenient to render a bush, you put a billboard, it's a 2D transparent thing that looks like a bush,

and you turn it down so it faces the player, and you do that until you get too close to it

and then you load in a real bush because otherwise they might kind of catch this,

that it's all smoke and mirrors.

Smoke and mirrors tricks in games to try and maintain the illusion in a very artistic way

whilst minimizing the resources on the simulation.

So the idea that you, when you go to another galaxy, you're just looking for a portal,

it's really interesting to always come from that perspective, I think, and say,

if this was a simulation, how would it cheat?

And then it can help you simplify.

I mean, I think there are good astronomical reasons why we consider it to be a real distance between galaxies.

There's a massive interstellar gas that you can probably measure.

There are now interstellar objects, like a mura-mura.

There's a whole bunch of connections between reasons to believe that the property is free space between galaxies.

But the principle of saying, hey, if this thing was a simulation, how would it cheat?

How would it try and short-circuit things? How would it try and simplify things?

How would it try and fold a circuit? It's a pretty interesting lens.

So thanks for making me think of that. I'm done.

I just want to say, do you think there actually is space between things in the universe?

When you get in an airplane, are you actually physically traveling from LA to New York?

I'd like to tip on that. But Ben, do you want to answer first?

Oh, man. So yes, I do within the simulation. But if we're in a simulation, this whole conversation is kind of funny.

It's kind of ironic and funny from the outside, of course.

So I mean, yes, I do from my standpoint.

If I want to make a prediction and actually go somewhere on Earth or do something that affects my experience in a predictable way,

then yes, I personally would assume that there is space between us both in my guess.

Anyway, so it's going to go in.

So I don't think it's either or. I think that, yes, it's true that there is space in time in between events.

So the sun is eight light minutes away from us, and it takes light eight minutes to get here from the sun.

So if you look at the sun, you're seeing light that's traveled for eight minutes across, I think, what, 96 million miles or something like that?

Or what we call eight light minutes, because that's really the measure of space in astronomical terms.

But there's also a point that was made first by Gilbert Lewis, who is famous for the Lewis diagrams and chemistry originally.

But he was also a physicist and he studied light. He studied the photon.

He published a couple of papers and a couple in 1926 that came out where he pointed out this word virtual contact.

That light actually, the description of light is what we call a null interval, where it's the only thing that travels along,

that travels at the speed of light. It's really what a null interval is.

It's a separation between two events such that the space traveled is equal to the time traveled.

I'm not saying it exactly right, but the point being that when light travels, you subtract the time from the space it travels and you get zero for light.

Whereas for you and I, when we travel, it's always a different number, like a non-zero number.

And the point being that the two events of light leaving the sun and light hitting our eyes are not actually separate events for the light,

because the time and the space are essentially shrink down to zero in special relativity.

And we have to think about the actual connection between the emission of the light and the absorption of the light leaving the sun and hitting our eye.

So there is a sense in which light doesn't actually experience time and space at all.

Light leaving the Andromeda galaxy and heading to the Milky Way galaxy. Yes, it travels from our point of view who are observing it,

but to light itself, it doesn't actually evolve along that journey at all.

There is no journey, there is no time and space that's actually taken.

So this just poses a huge wrench in the idea of there's an objective world out there,

because even if you just consider light, which is like the most plentiful particle in the universe,

it doesn't actually experience time and space at all.

I use that word experience, which is anthropomorphic, but it's not too much about that at this stage.

That's so cool. They're both true. It is true. It is, isn't. It is, isn't.

Kind of at the same time. I kind of like what's the question with it.

I always like to think about like, even like how we talk about like metaphors or like the parameters or like what are the cheat codes.

I'm just like fun little ways of like explaining and understanding this stuff, because like we were talking about like wave length.

Like there's like a way that like I've kind of like traveled through my life and I've been able to just like pick up on like,

you should like synchronize not necessarily that they're always a good thing,

but some of the vocab, even if it's arbitrary, I've gotten from Clubhouse.

It's been really helpful. I was wondering if there's like any metaphors that you guys kind of like live by.

Just like even when we're talking about like the mindset kind of thing.

It's just like a good way that you guys kind of view it, even if it's not factual.

If I may add, I think I'm sort of certainly not qualified from the scientific background to answer your question.

Like one of the most interesting sort of pieces for that relates to this that I sort of use as a lens of it is Plato's allegory of the cave.

So I think that maybe you might want to check that out.

I think my understanding of that story or that piece has changed over time.

Maybe I should wait to ask my question, but at some point I was wondering and perhaps it violates the constructs of the conversation.

But I'd like to hear anyone's views on how this relates to, you know, how this sort of spirituality and religion relates to this.

And then also just in terms of life or death or an afterlife and those kind of things.

You know, I just feel like they're sort of important, but I'd like to hear everyone's views.

Descartes also talked about that.

I think it was when meditations or something like that.

I can't remember the exact title, but he talked about that too.

And you know, even the Matrix used a lot of his themes in there where, you know, some demon or something, you know, violates your senses and, you know, ruins your perception of what reality actually is.

And then, you know, how do we know, you know, and those kinds of things, a real fascinating read.

In Judaism, it's called the tycoon.

It's something that follows you through your life.

Here on this earth, it's a lesson that you have to learn and it continues to repeat itself until you learn that lesson.

Do you have multiple? Sorry, man.

I didn't hear you, excuse me.

So do you have multiple?

Multiple tycoons.

Yeah.

# Part 12

I think there's one main theme through your life.

But yeah, Ben was trying to say something.

I'm sorry, I interrupted.

I didn't think I was.

If I was, it was my name.

I think it was me.

Or someone, I don't know.

It's Phonesis.

My name's Joseph.

My actual name.

So I just, just to, is there a way, I'm just curious if anyone would want to simplify, like, is it as a universe and reality more likely to be a simulation or is it more likely to be actual, actually real?

And in a simplified way.

My answer is yes.

So yeah, the short answer, I think, is yes, the argument.

For example, Elon Musk and I were talking about is the first base reality argument.

So if you just imagine the universe grows, a whole bunch of intelligent life forms spring up at different places at different times.

And we're one of those, right?

So the universe has been around 14-ish billion years.

We've not been around so long.

What are the chances that we're the first intelligence to create simulations?

Because we have started creating simulations.

They're called video games at the moment.

And you can imagine those becoming more and more sophisticated to the point where they become useful for, if you can run a simulation of the past, then, and it rolls forward to the present accurately, then the simulation of the past might be quite accurate.

So if you wanted to know how cavemen live, you could create a simulation of the world of very, very high fidelity in those days.

Running forward to the day, check it, you go, oh shit, that's not how it turned out.

So you try again, you try again, and eventually it could fit today, and therefore you could have some confidence, there's still a lot of things that could go wrong,

but some confidence that your simulation of the cavemen was right and learned something about our past.

So I think intelligent beings will simulate their past and learn things about themselves and where they came from, their nature of existence.

But the chances that we're the first intelligence civilization to create one of those simulations, and hence the simulation of a bunch of agents, it just seems unlikely.

Why would we be the first base for reality?

Why would it not be that we are an agent in somebody else's simulation?

That's a thought that a lot of people have had, and it's just quite an interesting and simple one.

I don't know if it makes sense, but Joseph, that's...

I pretty much go your saying.

So for example, let's say heaven, which we're all familiar with, let's say that's a futuristic and advanced civilization.

That's where God is. God is obviously super-intelligent, so he created life.

He designed and built the universe, for example.

Yeah, in the game Ready Player One, that would be the... I can't remember the dude's name, but that would be the creation.

Okay, thank you.

The notion of reality, I think, is a word that we throw out there.

I'm not sure... I've given it a lot of thought, and I don't know what it means.

So I think it's useful to kind of wonder what we mean, how do we distinguish between something that's real and something that's not real?

Is a simulation creating something that's not real?

I mean, is it possible to live in a world which behaves like a simulation and yet have it be real?

And that's, I think, what the notion of the video game, and we were talking about earlier, where we know that particles in the real world

don't actually have properties, objective properties, before we interact with them.

So we can't, that calls into question what real really is.

Are they real? Yes, because when we interact with them, we get impacted by them.

We get hurt by them, or we feel them, or our devices measure them.

But they don't have a physical reality before we do that.

That's defined, that's well-defined.

So I think, in short, we should just really ask ourselves if we're going to say, you know, are we living in simulation, or is this world real?

But we don't even know what that word really means, so I don't think that's a well-defined question.

Well, to add value to that, you know, one thing we can do through maybe a philosophical process is,

instead of asking what is real, we eliminate what is not real.

So you ask yourself what is not real, and just do the process of elimination.

This is kind of fundamental of, you know, epistemology and everything like that.

And obviously it's an arduous, arduous thing.

You know, there's so many data points that we have to basically disprove,

and that's what science has been doing for, you know, our entire, you know, history.

So we're on the process of eliminating all the possibilities of what isn't, you know, going to be the fabric of a reality.

Yeah, I don't think we'll be able to understand that because, like, we're not at, like, computing power with our brains.

Like, I think, like, we're never going to be able to really answer those questions until we're, like, at that level.

Well, I guess the computer's good, but I just think it's just, like, that's the whole reason, because I know, like, math stuff.

I don't know, experiment's 3 a.m. right now, I'm not going to be giving any sophisticated answers.

Thanks, that was a good one.

You know, I'm reading here on Einstein's paper with the EPR paradox, which some people might have heard of.

This is a paper that put forth the idea of entanglement originally.

And they define, they say, every element of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory.

But they don't actually really define element of physical reality.

They leave that sort of as an obvious thing.

But I guess what we would say in the simulation is, the simulation is simulating the feeling of physical reality,

whereas, but it's not a real physical reality.

And I just don't think that there is a clear distinction between those two things.

Right, it's kind of like Schrodinger's gap, you know, he's kind of, like, alive and dead at the same time until we open the box.

That's an example of it, right?

I think it's fascinating. Sorry, Scott.

Well, how would you know that it was real or not?

You would measure it and you get some result, but that would happen in the simulation and it would also happen in the non-simulation.

Correct.

I'm just curious, like, if, you know, again, we're under the assumption that the constraints of what we're observing and how we're observing it and how we're measuring is going to be constrained by what we know as reality.

So, you know, an inch is, you know, X amount of distance, you know, the color of the cat is this or that.

We're, again, assuming that there's some constraint that we can, you know, replicate and rectify over time or whatever.

So, I'm always curious about, like, again, like you've mentioned, speed of light, you know, is there a part of the universe where the speed of light behaves differently or the speed of light actually covers a greater distance than what we know?

Is that an observable? Can we, you know, duplicate that?

And then, again, would it throw in every thing that we know and assume into question if we were somehow able to duplicate that and observe that the speed of light is actually different than how we know it now, as we know it now?

Rushing me, it absolutely would, and that would be super exciting, and I'm sure this whole bunch of physicists, scientists out there would be very scared, but very excited for that to happen.

But just remember the basic scientific process is that you make the assumption about the north of physics being the same somewhere else.

But that's only the first step. You then make some predictions, quite carefully make some predictions about what you would see if you did an experiment.

For example, you point a telescope out to the sky and you look at the light from stars and, you know, you look at the wavelengths and you put them on a chart.

But before you do any of that experiment, you can predict what result you would get if you were right.

And most often people aren't right, and they have to adjust their prediction and adjust their assumptions.

So those assumptions aren't tested, I just wanted to put out there. That is a bit important, just to understand that step, that you make a prediction and you test it.

And you hear about the successes, but a huge amount of the time people are toiling away, making predictions that turn out not to be the case.

I think on those lines, you know, people are often trying to, the first line of attack for a lot of people on physics is to say,

well, but maybe things can travel faster than the speed of light.

You know, maybe we can communicate instantaneously, maybe entanglement means we can communicate to people in other galaxies.

And I think personally from my experience in studying it, it's actually not very fruitful to try and, you know, tackle those fundamental laws,

because there's really no reason why we would think that they should fail and why we would want them to fail, theoretically.

There's no real motivation for that other than just saying, well, we may not be right, you know, of course we may not be right,

but I think there's really good reason why those laws can remain what they are.

And we can still discover whole new realms of possibility, like the question of whether we can quote unquote travel or communicate across galaxies

does not necessarily have to do with physically moving ourselves from here to there as fast as we can go.

Or getting in a spaceship and, you know, having generation upon generation passed by the time we get to the next star or the next galaxy.

I think that there are other ways to think about that we'll open up to, like we're learning more and more about information and what information is.

And so the more we can back away from physical representation of the world in our cognitive map inside our heads to an informational one,

I think the more options and flexibility we have and that's where the idea of assimilation really becomes handy.

# Part 13

Sure, for clarity, you know, I'm not arguing that, you know, we should just ignore the laws of physics just because there may be an outlier that can disprove them.

Like I'm not going to get in my car and assume that, you know, the laws of physics, you know, physics like don't apply to me just because at some outlier,

I might experience some outlier event that disproves physics, you know, of course it's still equal mass times acceleration,

especially if I get in the car in front of me if I don't stop on time.

I'm just saying, you know, again, we're, you know, talking about, you know, the simulation theory and stuff like that.

So I'm always curious how other people are approaching it, maybe thinking outside of the laws of physics as we know it, the constraints as we know it,

you know, time and space as we know it currently.

And if we can actually, you know, maybe posit something that would be outside of the realm of what we currently know.

Yeah, I agree with that. Go ahead and cut.

So then I guess that brings up like overarching, like what are some of these new schools of thoughts that like they don't have to be proven that just you guys generally find interesting.

Oh, you all find interesting.

Yeah.

I feel like that's where innovation really happens.

I like the dark forest theory, you know, I think that you may have brought up or somebody brought up.

You know, statistically, like, you know, the universe is so large and there's so many planets.

I mean, how could we not have life? How could we not have intelligent life?

How could we have not set, you know, over a long, you know, over long enough timeline and intelligent species is probably going to come up with some type of simulation to simulate their past.

So I think it's called the dark forest theory where basically all these different civilizations, you know, are actually in existence out there.

We're just all afraid of each other because, you know, we have the ability to blow ourselves up, blow each other up.

So everybody's just kind of hiding from each other.

And, you know, with the technology that you would have that could destroy a civilization and, you know, a snap of the finger.

You also have the ability to have technology that could, you know, cloud or disguise the civilization for another civilization.

So maybe we're not alone out there.

Well, interesting thoughts. But before we move on to what's basically the Fermi paradox, which is why haven't we seen aliens yet, which is another fascinating topic.

And I think it's relevant to the actual discussion.

There is just one other thing. There's a romantic idea that sometimes somebody will come along and discover that physics is wrong.

Well, yes and no. They will. And it isn't everything we know about physics has a limit that we're not aware of yet.

It's not that it's wrong. F never equals ma. There is no gravity.

Gravity for phantom forces in the same way centrifugal forces doesn't exist. But you can get on very well, imagining that there is gravity.

You can get on really well just using F equals ma until you can't, until you get into a situation where you need to nuance your argument.

And somewhat accuracy versus usefulness. The reason, you know, people still think that you can, yeah, you can get some sense of it by doubling it and adding 30.

Is that right? No, it's only right at one temperature.

Is it useful, as a pilot of an aircraft, trying to quickly work out within a small range of temperatures?

To fly on high to Celsius, double it and add 30 is a lot easier than doubling it, taking me off 10% and adding 32, which is accurate.

And this is the same as the physical laws. Newton's laws are wrong in all circumstances.

But when we learn more about them, we learn the boundaries of the limitations.

So it's not as if you can come along and say, well, Newton was wrong. Yeah, completely wrong about everything.

But still very, very useful. The enlightenment is when you realize the boundaries and the conditions in which it's not true.

So you say, oh, the speed of lights are constant. Well, I mean, it's not. It's a lot slower in glass than it is in air.

If you have a stride stick and a pencil in a glass of water or, you know, using a prism will show you that.

In fact, one of the reasons Starlink satellites can have nice low latency is actually quicker to send your internet signal through low Earth orbit through space than it is through optical fibers.

Quite a lot quicker. The light just travels faster. So you have to say the speed of light in a vacuum.

And then you've qualified it. And then until we realize the limitations of that, you put on another qualifier.

So rather than saying science fails, it's a question of continually wrapping it for more and more qualifiers

and understanding the limits of where what you currently know applies.

And also having the respect to realize that what you currently know will not apply somewhere like which quantum it is.

So that's just a differentiation.

Yes. So yeah, it's like the same thing. It's like, we have to vote how we have now with the parameters we have now.

Those are constantly changing. It doesn't mean they're not useful now.

Yeah, I want to throw it there too, just as a piece of thought. The research that I'm interested in is understanding time.

I think time is maybe one of the final frontiers because, you know, we have theories which use it pretty well,

but we actually don't understand it. And it's such a personal thing. We are all experiencing time.

So we sort of have a sense that we feel like we know what it is.

But if you look at physical theories, it's been really the biggest headache for physicists over the years over the development of physics.

And our best theories of physics still are not really complete on, you know, how time really works.

So an example of this, he may be thinking about cultures that have different notions of time, like the Aborigines in Australia,

or I think some Native American cultures that see time as circular or as spiral,

or in the Aborigines case they use the word the dreaming to emphasize that life is a dream,

that they experience life as a dream in which the past is not separate from the present.

But it's all a part of you. I have a visual in my head of the past being behind me,

the future being in front of me, and we sort of spatialize our conception of time.

But that's simply a way of trying to understand it, and it's not actually true.

And I think that it's a really interesting and fascinating place to study because it's so personal to our understanding of the world.

Yes.

Sunshine, would you like to chime in and say anything? Amy?

So I don't have a lot of background in this. I come at it more from a biophysics perspective, I guess.

What I'm really interested in is if we do assume that it is a simulation, then what are the things we could do to optimize our health,

let's say, knowing that it's a simulation. And one of the mentors I have who is a medical doctor,

but also looking at biophysics very closely, thinks for example that the sun is foundational to health.

If you think that that would be one of the inputs, then getting that input, these things that the simulation is offering to you

or that might be out there, is really important to health. So that's what I'm interested in.

Oh, hi. My name is Sunshine, and my background is in the study of consciousness, and this is a really, really cool discussion.

Thank you for inviting me to speak.

I actually was interested in a few things that were said earlier, and forgive me, I forgot who said them.

I think it was two different people. One was about light.

It was a simultaneous sender-receiver kind of thing, and it occurred to me how, I don't know how,

if any of you guys are familiar with the Buddhist concept of dependent origination, but it's sort of like things arise and they pass away

just sort of like this flow, and it kind of occurs to me that so much of what's going on with particles that can be into places at once

and all these things that seem really trippy to our heads, if we meditate on that, it seems like it makes sense to me,

and this actually ties into the overall theme of stimulation, and I was thinking that it's just a metaphor.

Our brains need metaphors, like everything's a metaphor, like language and even math needs to point to something to describe something else.

And then, forgive me, I know I'm going on lots of different tenders, but it reminds me also of Don Hoffman's theory of conscious agents theory,

which is basically saying, and apparently he has the mouth to back it up, but he's basically saying that life is a simulation,

and it's like the concept of objective reality that, you know, well, I think actually now I'm starting to confuse myself thinking about all these different things at once,

so this is a great discussion. I'll take a pause and let some other people speak, but like really, thanks so much, I really love this discussion,

and yeah, I'm Sunshine and I'm done speaking for now, thanks.

# Part 14

Thanks Sunshine, I just a quick, I love that question, how can you use the idea that you're in the simulation to make yourself more healthy,

so I was just thinking through that, so I'm currently doing a very basic reinforcement learning thing, a bit of fun,

which is getting little agents to win a flaky bird, it couldn't be any simpler, but it's designed to, you know, to compute a game of flaky birds,

and breeding thousands of little bird flying agents, and most of them are crap at it, and then some of them are good,

and the ones that are good, you agree with the other ones that are good, and eventually going very quickly,

actually the computer learns to play the game at a superhuman level, it's very, very simple, so that is, it's chosen to be as simple as possible,

but that's where I'm going to start teaching reinforcement learning, so you take a bunch of these birds,

you just give them random parameters, random behaviors, most of them just crash and die, a few of them, by luck, do okay,

at the game of jumping through the hoops in flaky birds, those ones are do okay, you're breeding quotes, you combine with other ones that are done okay,

making them very similar to each other, but with little changes, and through a process of evolution within seconds,

as it happens with a lot of computers, you've got this thing doing better than I can ever play, flaky birds, not that I'm any master at it,

the interesting thing about asking the question, if we're the real reinforcement agents in that game, what can we do to improve our health,

and by health, I mean, chances that you don't be one of the birds that crashes and dies, but the best thing I think that they could do,

unfortunately, they'd never have the mental capacity to see this for themselves, but let's imagine they did,

it's just copy their peers that are doing better than them, so take the attributes of the peers that are doing better than them and copy it,

so if somebody's healthier than you, fitter than you, smarter than you, faster than you, whatever you want more than you,

with a big pinch of software, if you take this property, maybe you'll knock other properties of your life out of balance,

there's a lot to be said, but just straight up, R&D, not research and development, but rip off and duplicate,

something that somebody else has done, take their weightings of their neural nets and implant them into your own,

which is what you do in conversations like this, or by reading books, or by studying other people's way of thinking,

you're kind of reconfiguring your neural net to be a bit more like that other person's neural net,

at least for the betterment in that direction, it may be worse somewhere else, you sit down and go studying,

because if you might get fat, so there's always going to be a wider implication, but that's just a thought,

that's something you specifically can do, is just simply train yourself, learn stuff, copy, mimic, rip off and duplicate,

so just some thoughts, Ben, I'm done. I'd like to add in there the appreciation for the idea of dependent origination,

which I had to look up, but then once I looked it up, I remember the idea, which is really similar to what we talked about

in science as well, around the non-existence of definite particles, different properties of things,

in the absence of actually doing the measurement, and this actually ties into how I think we can make ourselves

benefit from knowledge of being in assimilation.

Coming back again, and this time maybe more clearly, in my explanation of the importance of our emotional sense of things,

that I think that we live in a state of maybe confusion or delirium, or we're convinced by our reality,

I'd say we tend to be convinced by our reality, and part of what I mean by that is our emotional sense, our sense of self,

so if someone, like you could use the example of someone giving you a compliment, someone compliments your clothes,

do you say to yourself, oh, that's really nice, yeah, I guess my clothes are really nice, or do you say to yourself,

oh, I didn't put on a matching outfit today, that's nice of them to compliment me, but they're just trying to make me feel good,

that's not really true, so we might have a way in which we identify a certain way, and then somebody gives us a compliment,

and it doesn't really land on for us, because we can't really hear it, because we're already identifying with something different,

so I think that that is a way in which we have a cognitive map of ourselves and of the universe around us that doesn't reflect reality,

and that Don Hoffman would probably agree that our cognitive maps are not designed for reality, they're truth, they're designed for fitness,

whatever makes us able to survive longer, but I think that we can benefit from aligning our cognitive maps with reality,

and that's like Ben was saying too, learn from other people's perceptions of you, you know, someone gives you feedback,

and you can really see through their eyes how you are being perceived, that can be, not all the time, but can be helpful to decompose some of our

own self-perceptions that may not be accurate, I'll stop there, thank you.

And I would just say, aiming from my perspective, the way that I think about how we could, so I kind of take it as a foregone conclusion

that this is some sort of simulation, I don't know if that's the word, I tend to believe that we've consented to this experience,

and we're here for a reason to learn or to teach the observers, I don't know, but in terms of health, I think of it in terms of embracing

our natural reality and the natural foods and just consuming plants, and if we were to say animals, but in their truest form

and in their purest sense, I think that's good for health, and I could mention a couple of medical doctors that are of a similar belief,

but I'm certainly not qualified beyond what I've heard from them.

Wonderful, Sky, you put my way of saying, you know, borrow other people's stuff and be careful if it doesn't knock your life out of balance,

really much more deeply by saying, basically manage the meaning you give to things.

Kind of what I'm saying there, as you look at somebody else's observations, either you observe something else or something else observes you,

but you can put a step in between, which is choose the meaning you give to that thing.

So I think that's, and I really do believe we can do that.

I've had to do that, you know, mother that I love very much, but she's a complete narcissist and comes up with all sorts of weird shit.

So I've had to put a meaning filter in between the things she says to me and how I receive them in order to always hear,

you know, I love you, but basically I haven't got the man of facility to show it some of the time.

I literally can't, you know, she literally can't do it.

And that's fine when I understand that I've got an ability to put a meaning filter in between, it leads to much better relationships with my wife and my kids.

Really, it's really cool to be able to say, okay, well, that person's saying this to them, it's about them.

How do I want to interpret that?

But to do that rationally as well, you know, to try and do it in a way that's balanced and rational.

So I think that's really, that's really cool.

And when it comes to food, you know, things are so, so subjective, depend on you, depend on your genetics, et cetera.

So I mean, I think yesterday somebody was saying about some lady who'd lived 122 years old and she'd been smoking until she was 100.

And she was just going to live to 122 regardless.

Just had the genetics for it.

And so whether she ate a plant diet or whether she smoked and drank what she did her whole life doesn't really matter.

I think you can probably shift the odds by changing how you eat, et cetera.

But again, provided it doesn't make you miserable.

If you stress the hell out of yourself by beating yourself up every time you eat something you should need,

then I think that could probably do more harm than eating just eat the shit that you want to eat and be joyful.

I mean, it's just looking at it very holistically as to the whole, how does your whole being adapt based on the decisions you make emotionally more than anything else.

Because I think emotional health is just the most important.

My mum right now, she's got had a stroke, she's got atrial fibrillation.

She does ups and downs like that.

Did I measure her pulse and measure up all these different parameters?

I think her ups and downs are basically chronic horrible loneliness when she's on her own and got nobody to look forward to seeing.

She's miserable.

She's physically almost half awake.

And when she's got something to do and somewhere to go, she just miraculously jumps up and does it every time.

And it's becoming more and more evident.

It's nothing to do with her pulse, the bisophorol and her bloodstream or anything else.

It's just meaning and the desire to connect with other human beings.

It's so deeply important to her actual physical health.

It manifests in her blood pressure, in her atrial fibrillation and other things.

So yeah, pretty fascinating. Thank you.

I wanted to ask, maybe I could ask Guy or Ben a question.

And by the way, I posted a link to many of the interesting articles, including Sky's article about space time pass as a whole on my Twitter.

I just posted actually, there's a whole bunch of links and they're all inside one link.

So the link to black holes or a hologram is in there.

And if you fell into a black hole, what you might expect, holograms within holograms.

The theory that the universe is a hologram in five minutes, our universe could emerge as a hologram.

And then Sky mentioned that, you know, just talking about how a multiplayer video game can serve as an analogy of how the simulation might work for each observer.

So I linked a whole bunch of things to No Man's Skies.

You can see the idea of a procedurally generated universe that Ben was talking about.

There's someone mentioned, Josh mentioned loop quantum gravity and geometric unity.

So I put links there. The simulation hypothesis is a link there.

The John Balrid on simulation and illusion, there's a link to that.

Many worlds interpretation, there's a link to that.

Bell's theorem inequality, link to that.

The de Broglie and Bohm theory is a link to that.

It's all inside one link.

And if you look at my Twitter, you can get all these links.

So I'd save that for you guys.

But my question to Sky and or Ben is basically, so it came up that you could have a 2D slice of, you know, your perspective.

And that would contain what, the whole universe?

It reminded me of basically the idea of a four-year transform of the projection slice theorem.

That a two-dimensional slice, a four-year slice theorem in two dimensions states that the results of the following two calculations are equal.

Like basically the idea that a slice represents, a 2D image represents a 3D object from its center point.

I don't know if I'm explaining that correctly.

But yeah, so I just wanted to bounce it to you guys and I'll just mute myself.

Thank you so much, Micah.
