(electromagnetism)
do you know what a dissipative system is? it's a vortex, it's a human body, like the sun, the spiral galaxy, like the atom, what is the hand that sculpts dissipative systems? electromagnetism? gravity? spacetime? so why does the Sun seem to endorse Moshe? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ-kvw1fYXs

do you know what a dissipative system is? an atom?, the earth is one, the sun is one, even galaxies can be considered to be dissipative systems, http://vimeo.com/7736549

the sun is a dissipative system, and so am I, as above so below, as thy am, so I am.

I suppose dreams are like art, you can appreciate the surface beauty, you can decode them as psychological metaphors,

, some cultures saw them as future predictions, and I even read of a clever science experiment once where they deprived a rodent of it's dream state, while still allowing it to sleep, and they discovered that it didn't have fear, it walked around next to a cat with no fear. None of the usual instinct that cat's are scary. So a hypothesis is that dreams prepare us for day, giving our minds the information we need to steer clear of danger.

human life is a dissipative system, (a vortex) the same as all life, the same as tornados, hurricanes, same as cells, same as planets, same as stars, same as galaxies. Have you seen pictures of galaxies merging? yes it takes a very long time, and the same physics is at work on lovers

now I want to encircle all of my comments and put a "maybe" I'm not saying that's how it is, it's just an idea of how it could be

On second thought the monogamous pair might have far greater density of love than the groups of people who sleep around but never stick to anyone in particular.
