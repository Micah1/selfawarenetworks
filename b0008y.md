Collective Sensation of oscillating sensor transmitter

A memory is a state change. I mean, a stored memory is just a (physical) state change. So we have with tonic frequencies, that enable the brain to have a very regular brainwave state.

The brain is also a chaotic oscillator, but despite that there is a cyclic regularity of neural firing and that is the tonic brainwave pattern.

00:39

The brain's chaotic & harmonic tonic oscillations open the door for the brain to be actively receptive to changes in oscillation frequencies from spiking which creates decaying or resonating oscillations that ripple across the tonic oscillators.

00:53

Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)

A group is basically like all the neurons that are oscillating with that oscillatory pattern but you're gonna have some groups that are going to the interacting with other groups but they're not going to synchronize.

01:26

They're not they're not going to necessarily oscillate together in particular, perhaps in part because they can't, because the oscillation in one of them is too large to to be copied or absorbed by another and so maybe you have to have so oscillators have to be within a certain range in order to match each other's dissipative energy.

01:53

But there's a certain amount of

02:06

But (incompatible oscillators) can maintain a sort of orbital relationship. It's like they could have a sort of oscillatory orbit to the point that eventually there is some temporary alignment between two otherwise incompatible oscillators. Sort of like an eclipse. A momentary alignment that doesn't last, and doesn't come around often, and is mostly out of sync.

The two incompatible oscillating groups are eventually going to fire together at the same time before is pulling apart again and having completely different oscillation patterns or sequences.

It's like saying that eventually they're gonna link up for now they're in a different orbit.

02:48

So one will definitely go around a few times before it links up with the other and it could be because the other one is as much slower, right?

03:05

In that moment, you have the possibility for that one basically. That's the point when they

03:29

I know this is completely accurate.

The idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's a very short great duration between when something that happens to one is then perceived by all the others.

03:53

It's a collect the collective of all of the sensors. All the sensor transmitters is going to...

...because they're all sort of like close together in timing sequence it's like a sensor that is distributed over a larger area. Right? (With me so far?)

It's some you don't see the connections but they're acting like a single material that is sensitive. (Imagine distributed memory foam, where you press down on one part of the memory foam, and wirelessly another part of the foam is also depressed corresponding to its connection to the part you are touching)

04:30

They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 

05:06

The dissipated amount (of energy resonating from Action Potential Spikes into the tonic oscillatory fabric of the mind) is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective across the entire sensor. So it's multiplied in scale but it's basically a very consistent tempo spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away (over the entire brain & body)

05:29

But I suspect that it is sort of like, it has to be the same signal, right? But it's being just being multiplied in scale, so it's the same signal, but as it grows in size, it's dissipating (in energy).

05:52

So the pattern is growing in scale as it dissipates outward like a ripple in a pond the whole consensus but this is a collective sensation of this event happening. So there's like the ripple and then there's several several larger insides reports and the network is is recognizing all of them.

06:22

So it's like every sensation ripples throughout your whole being and there's a collective sensation and so that collective sensation is the perception of quality.
