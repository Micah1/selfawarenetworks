I make the point that chaotic oscillators can link up momentarily or periodically, and I make the argument that the dissipated phase difference is recognized by the whole collective of oscillating cells that are acting as a single sensor because of synchronized firing.

Title: Collective Sensation of oscillating sensor transmitter

A memory is a state change. I mean, a stored memory is a state change. So we have, with the tonic frequencies, it's very regular, it's very regular. There's a lot of regularity to the states. Well, the brain is chaotic, what I'm saying is like, there's a certain, there's a cyclic regularity. So the brain is a chaotic resonator, but in terms of brain activity, but the oscillation is, each oscillating group oscillates together at a relatively stable frequency. And groups that, so some of the groups, you know, a group is basically like all the neurons that are oscillating with that oscillatory pattern. But you're going to have some groups are going to be interacting with other groups, but they're not going to synchronize. They're not, they're not going to necessarily oscillate together, in part because, perhaps in part because, because they can't, because the oscillation in one of them is too large to be copied by another. So maybe you have to have, so oscillators have to be within a certain range in order to match each other's dissipative energy.

But there's a certain amount of, but they can sort of like maintain sort of orbital, it's like they could have a sort of like oscillatory orbit to where eventually two parts of, eventually they're going to fire together at the same time before splitting apart again and having completely different oscillatory, oscillatory sequences. Because it's like saying that eventually they're going to link up for, for, but because they're in a different orbit.

So the, so when they, like, so one will definitely go around a few times before it links up with the other. And it could be because the other one is just much slower, right?

In, in that moment you have a possibility for, for, you know, that one basically, like, that's the point when they,

I know it's, it's, it's completely accurate because the idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, I mean they're all like basically like in lockstep.

I mean there's a very short duration between when something that happens to one is perceived by all the others.

It's a collective of all of the sensors, all the sensor transmitters is, is going to, because they're all sort of like closely in sequence they're going to basically like, it's like a, it's like a sensor that is distributed over a larger area, right?

It's, you don't see the connections but they're acting like a single material.

It's sensitive, right? So they're also like a, a, a, a perturbation in, in a, I'm sorry, in a regular perturbation and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them.

So you're going to have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory signature by, by the dissipated amount.

And the, and so, um, yeah, so the dissipated amount is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective, across the entire sensor.

So it's multiplied in scale but it's, it's basically a very consistent temporal spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale across, across over the entire sensor array.

But I suspect that it is sort of like, it has to be the same signal, right?

But it's being, it's being multiplied in scale so it's the same signal but as it grows in size,

it's dissipating, um, so the pattern is growing in scale as it dissipates outward, like a pond, like a ripple in a pond, right?

So it's like a ripple in a pond, a whole pond sensor, but there's a collective sensation of this event happening.

So there's like the ripple and then there's several, several larger in size ripples

and the network is, is, is recognizing all of them.

So it's like every sensation ripples throughout your whole being.

Um, and there's a collective sensation and so that collective sensation is the perception of reality.

Oh, damn.
