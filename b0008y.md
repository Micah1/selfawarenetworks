Collective Sensation of oscillating sensor transmitter

00:00
A memory is a state change. I mean, a stored memory is just a state change. So we have with autonomous frequencies, you're very regular, is very regular is not a regular to the states. There's not. There's and there's of the brain is chaotic. But what I'm saying is like, there's a certain there is a, there's a A cyclic regularity.

00:39
And so they could ran into character resonator. But in terms of brand activity, the oscillations

00:53
They are each each oscillating group (binds?) together at a relatively stable frequency and groups that the. So some of the groups, you know, a group is basically like all the neurons that are oscillating with that oscillatory pattern but you're gonna have some groups are going to the interacting with other groups but they're not going to synchronize.

01:26
They're not they're not going to necessarily oscillate together in particular, perhaps in part because because they can't because then oscillation and one of them is too large to to be copied by another and so maybe you have to have so oscillators have to be within a certain range in order to to match each other's dissipative energy.

01:53
But the, but there's a certain amount of

02:06
But they can sort of like maintain a sort of orbital. It's like, it's like they could have a sort of like, also toy orbit to where eventually two parts of eventually, they're going to fire together at the same time before is putting apart again and having completely different oscillators also a tourist sequences because it's like saying that eventually they're gonna link up for for but because they're in a different orbit.

02:48
So the so when they like, so one will definitely go around a few times before it links up with the other and it could be because the other one is as much slower, right?

03:05
In, in that moment, you have the possibility for it for, you know, that one basically. Like, that's the point when they

03:29
I know this is because it's completely accurate. Because, so the idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can also get together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's very short great duration between one, something that happens to one is perceived by all the others.

03:53
There's it's um it's a collect the collective of all of the sensors. All the sensor transmitters is is going to The because they're all sort of like closely in sequence. They're going to basically like it's like it's like a sensor that is distributed over a larger area, right. It's some you don't see the connections but they're acting like a single material consensus.

04:30
Alright, so they're all also like a perfectation and and I'm sorry in a regular perturbation and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory, signature by the dissipated amount, and the and so,

05:06
Cat. So the dissipated amount is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collect across entire systems. So it's multiplied and scale but it's it's basically a very consistent temple spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away.

05:29
But I suspect that it is sort of like, it has to be the same signal, right? But it's being just being multiplied in scale, so it's the same signal, but as it grows inside, it's dissipating.

05:52
So the pattern is growing and scale as it displays our word like a pond like a ripple, an apartment. All right, so it's like a rip on a pond the whole consensus but this is a collective sensation of this event happening. So there's like the ripple and then there's several several larger insides reports and the network is is recognizing all of them.

06:22
So it's like every sensation ripples throughout your whole being and there's a collective sensation and so that collective sensation is the perception of quality.
