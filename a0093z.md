Note from Jan 04th, 2013
Some early ideas before I had the concept that the mind was a computational rendering from lots of tiny tempo-spatial phase differentials bound together with the principles of oscillation.

(cortex) Acausal pattern, a notion that transcends a specific place & time, a prediction of causes in the context of other concepts about the properties of the cosmos. = belief

I don't know if it's compression that needs to happen so much as a competition for resources that needs to happen. In brain plasticity, if you wear a blindfold for five days, your Occipital lobes (visual cortex) start working for other parts of your mind. Without the "Vision program" from your "eyes" these general processing units can start improving your ability to sense other things, like with your hearing and touching. Then when you take the blind fold off, your vision begins to come back, and it does so rapidly, because what you see (input from the eyes is the vision program) is demanding in terms of brain resources. So by virtue of it's non-compression it simply takes mental resources away from other senses. If all your senses were neatly compressed how could anything be conscious? What we are conscious of I believe are the non-compressed dominant patterns in our attractor loop.

"If the acausal pattern is validated by evidence, it's theory or fact, not belief." via Ian Neiges

Theory & Fact & Belief are all grades given to belief's aka predictions, predictions grading predictions. The grade that you give a belief does not change it's fundamental nature. When you have evidence you grade your belief as a fact, it's fundamentally still a belief, just elevated to a higher level of trust and respect because of empirical results.

"But, belief is an empirical submission not yet proved wrong by analytical methods and with high frequency of occurrences in statistical pattern recognitions in natural phenomenon" via Hayagreeva Acharla 

Reason, reflection, proof, and evidence must be observed, observation is the empirical process. On the one hand we are defining the Grade we assign to a belief, but neurologically speaking these beliefs, or facts, or theories may all be synchronized firing patterns, representing what has been learned overtime, through the empirical process of life experience, inclusive of the tools of reason, reflection, and the scientific method.

The difference between an "Apple" you see and "Two Apples" might be a few extra bunches of fired neurons to indicate that you have sensed "Two Apples" and not just one "Apple" The extra bunch of fired neurons of "Two" synchronizes by firing with the bunch of neurons that represent the pattern of an "Apple" Yet your mind receives it as one undivided concept. This is because all big concepts in your mind are like armies of smaller concepts firing together or together in a coordinated sequence.

"Mind is a dynamic[non-volatile flash] memory of conformal mapping of command| inference outputs, arranged in statistical grading order" via Hayagreeva Acharla 

no way, your memories are not stable, they are very volatile, there was a study where they had people write down their memories of the entire day that JFK died, and they did this the day after, and ten years later the same people were asked to write a story about what happened the day JFK died. Since almost everyone remembers what they were doing when JFK was shot (if you were old enough, just like almost everyone remembers what they were doing on 9/11) these people wrote a story about what they were doing the day JFK was shot only it was ten years later. Then the people who did the study gave these people their original stories from ten years earlier, and low and behold the stories totally contradicted what they had written, they looked at their own handwriting in disbelief, for their own hand writing was telling them what they thought to be a lie, a history that never happened, a day that had never taken place. You see in ten years their memories had subtly changed ever so slightly, that all the particulars of what had happened had shifted, the day was a different day. These people never noticed their memories changing.

The only reason human memory has some consistency is the overwhelming redundancy of stored memories, a lot of your memory can fail, and as long as a small percentage of it does not fail you can get it right.

"Here again not yet disproved submission, Mind: Mind is a dynamic[non-volatile flash] memory of conformal mapping of command| inference outputs, arranged in statistical grading order, over concomitant information inputs; information: scratch pad volatile memory of statistically recognised patterns in concomitant data inputs " via Hayagreeva Acharla

The mind is perhaps like a soft malleable plastic, not elastic, not concrete, not stable, perhaps a bit like play doh or clay.

Thought is delusion, thought is also awareness, awareness is delusion, thought awareness is a vortex like flow of expectation, a fiery attractor of brainwave activity, imprinted into the mind via the repetition of fired neural patterns, some patterns staring from chain reactions within, initiated by hungry cells, neurotransmitters, hormones, and some chain reactions initiated by external events in the ecosystem of the world. These are learned firing patterns, just like a dirt road that becomes very worn after millions of feed have trampled across it. These energy patterns in the brain's networks are doing their best to dissipate the energy being put into them, by spitting out the energy they get when their threshold has been reached, resulting in the progression of the brain's electromagnetic, blood, and chemical brainwave.

The result is the coordination of sequences that pile on top of one another and through neural dominance these forms become our memory expectations aka our sensory thoughts, the sequences of which are our words, and acausal notions that predict the causes of moving things, and the coordinate our own movements to create a highly complex coordinate path to nutrient rewards from the neurotransmitters in the brain, to the things we can find in the external world to eat, or love.
