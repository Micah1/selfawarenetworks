(conjecture)
It's my opinion that some of the leading neuroscientists have solved the essential corner stones what human level self aware phenominal consciousness is and how it works. I came to similar conclusions earlier this year only to discover just today that what I thought was going to my contribution to the topic is something that has already been previously discussed openly & in public by leading minds with other leading minds. Perhaps out of humility these leading neuroscientists are being rather quiet about the real profound impact of what they have found given the world shifting implications of their discoveries. Perhaps its humility or perhaps its uncertainty in the face of needing more data to validate their awesome hypothesis, and perhaps its the modern research culture of making small claims, and not making big claims, so as to not scare off investors from future research. Alas my book is more of conference with many exhibits, and a narrative that ties it all together. My research for this book is tracing the path through past research done by others. My contribution I hope will be a compelling narrative that ties it all together. However that only describes Cycle 1 of the book. Cycle 2 is about a new artifical neural network, and Cycle 3 describes next-gen nervegear -Micah Blumberg.
