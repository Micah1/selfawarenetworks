The inside cover of the back of the book
the joke that I make about reading a book about human consciousness is that everytime they get to describing the neurophysics of neurons and how that adds up to human consciousness they sort hand wave away the problem with an answer like "well neurons do neuron stuff" or "they spike, send their spikes, and then convolutional neural networks and then magic stuff we don't know about yet happens" or "quantum physics is a mystery so that's how consciousness works" or "all the information is squished together, like synchonized, like an orchestra, symphony, or bits of a soul" or "neurons make melodies because your ear vibrates with melodies" "or the universe is all conscious" and all these hand wavy answers exist to prevent you from going further with your questioning. They are plugs for your mind to stop you from looking deeper. In this book I am going to try out a possible and novel explanation for how the neurophysics of consciousness creates itself producing you from what could otherwise be considered a bag of meat, salt, and water.

From quantum particles to global brain activity to your entire body, to spacetime itself I am going to share a plausible prediction for how human consciousness might work.
