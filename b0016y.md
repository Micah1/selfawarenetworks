Exploring Consciousness, Body Swapping, and Self-Awareness

Anatoly shared an intriguing story about the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body. He suggested that a single consciousness could inhabit different bodies, much like selecting an avatar. These bodies could be resting in a sort of storage, waiting to be chosen for use today or for a week. The idea is that consciousness isn't necessarily tied to one physical form; it can separate from the body and connect to any form we desire.

Imagine having a selection of bodies that could even be 3D-printed based on stored designs. Artificial networks might invent new bodies, offering an infinite array to choose from. You pick the one you want, it's printed for you, and you inhabit that body—complete with downloaded memories and even the voice associated with it. This means you could essentially become that person, changing your way of thinking and interests as you wish.

This concept raises profound questions: Where does consciousness truly reside? Some believe they already know how to change their minds in any way they want. Everything we think is an oscillation—a vibrating pattern in our brains. Recognizing these patterns is crucial. For example, someone with an addiction has a recurring brain pattern linked to their addictive behavior. By becoming aware of this pattern, they can begin to regulate it.

This approach is similar to treatments for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Patients are encouraged to recognize that their actions are due to misfiring in the brain. Neurofeedback allows them to see real-time data of their brain activity during an OCD episode. By paying attention to this, they can learn to self-regulate. Expanding awareness gives us more agency and choice; understanding what we're doing and how we're doing it enables us to change our behavior.

Consider someone who habitually picks at their lips—a behavior they've had all their life. This action is tied to specific neural oscillations that repeat every time they engage in it. It's like their hands have a mind of their own. By becoming aware of this pattern, they can start to interrupt it. Techniques like meditation can help increase this awareness. In practices like Buddhism, sitting with awareness allows individuals to observe their patterns without judgment. Recognizing the electrical patterns in the brain associated with certain behaviors can make it easier to change them.

Returning to the idea of swapping bodies, imagine a community where people can change their bodies at will. Every time you meet someone, they might look completely different—a new stranger each time. This fluidity challenges how we recognize and relate to each other. Changing the mind is also complex. While some can easily adapt and accept new information, others are resistant, especially if it comes from outside their familiar circle or culture. They might not be tuned into the same reality, making communication difficult.

In essence, this exploration delves into the possibilities of consciousness transcending the physical body, the potential for endlessly customizable identities, and the power of self-awareness in transforming our behaviors. By understanding the patterns that govern our thoughts and actions, we can gain greater control over our lives and perhaps even redefine what it means to be ourselves.

Original Whisper Transcription:
So Anatoly told me this story. He said,
I just said that some existence, one consciousness, can have different bodies.
Body as an avatar and all these bodies just resting in the cup so some consciousness can pick anybody for today for a week.
All these bodies need some rest or generation power.
We can swap. We can change.
This is basically your computer.
Your computer that can separate from the body, right?
It's not necessary to be connected to the body, but it is able to select anybody that you want.
You have a selection. You can print any kind of body.
Because all the types of bodies are stored.
We have artificial networks that invent new bodies and you can pick from any of them.
So there's infinite amounts of bodies to choose from.
You pick the ones you want, they print it up for you, you get in that body, you're that person.
But you can download memories for that person. So you can become that person.
And the voice.
You can change your way, you can sort of let yourself in anyway.
Change your mind if you want.
Change your mind is most crazy the way you think.
And your interest is most crazy.
I believe it's already...
Where is consciousness?
I already changed my mind. I already do it.
Like I know how.
You know how?
Yeah, I know how.
I know how to change my mind any way I want.
Okay, so everything you're thinking is an oscillation.
It's a vibrating pattern.
Everything that your brain is doing.
In order to recognize it, it's making that pattern.
So it's kind of like you have to...
Let's say someone is addicted.
They have an addictive brain pattern.
They're recurrent over and over again in correlation with their addiction.
Okay?
If they can recognize that pattern and say,
this is what they do for people who have OCD.
They say, I want you to think about the fact that what you're doing right now,
that it's actually OCD.
And that means there's a part of your brain that's misfiring.
And when you can do neurofeedback and you can show people,
you see that on the data?
That is what OCD looks like.
Your brain is misfiring when you're having an OCD episode.
You're doing something weird, right?
And if you pay attention to that, you can self-regulate it.
You can regulate your own...
If you're able to become aware of how you're doing what you're doing...
It's important to be aware.
When you expand your awareness, you give yourself more agency, more choice, right?
When you expand your awareness of what you're doing and how you're doing it,
you're able to change what you're doing.
Look, I have simple thoughts, but I'm kind of always touching my lips,
like how do you say this?
Feel off?
It's like bad behavior, right?
And how could I change this?
Because it's like all my life, right?
What behavior?
Like, I'm taking skin off my lips and pulling out.
Okay, okay, okay, fine.
So, just realize that the reason that keeps happening is because
your cells are repeating the same oscillations over and over again.
Everything you do...
It's like my hands want it.
Yeah, it's the same...
You have...
You are experiencing the pattern in your real life.
There's a correlated pattern in your brain activity.
Like, do, do, do, do...
It's happening every time you're doing that thing.
And if you become aware of that, you're like,
oh, my brain is doing that thing again.
Then you can...
I can't feel it.
Yeah.
Well, you have to kind of like...
It's more useful to like...
It could be useful to like do neurofeedback,
like to go to a neurofeedback practitioner
and like watch, like pay attention to your own brainwashing.
Or look at yourself in the mirror.
What is...
When you meditate...
Satisfaction.
Satisfying, please.
Level.
It's the same...
It's the same principle as like,
like in Buddhism, like when you like...
If you sit with awareness, right?
If you're just aware of all your patterns.
Like to say you're really open, okay?
And you're sitting with all your patterns.
If you can notice that when you're doing something
like picking your lip,
if you can notice that,
you can notice you can think,
okay, there's some sort of electrical pattern
that's happening every time I'm doing this.
That makes me feel good.
It's in my brain.
That makes you feel good, right?
Yeah.
With it.
And you recognize it.
And you just think about it.
And the more you become aware of it,
the more you figure out how to turn it off.
You need to become aware of it to the point,
this is not serving me.
This is like,
you just got to keep thinking about it.
And you've got to grow your awareness around it.
It's called the action to perception cycle.
When you perceive something,
your perception of it...
What's your perception of it?
Like when you're thinking about something.
Perception is like,
I notice this is here,
therefore I am perceiving it.
If I notice something, I'm perceiving it.
If I don't notice it,
I'm not perceiving it.
Right?
For the second,
like now I'm perceiving it.
Because I notice it.
Right?
That's perception.
You get it.
Okay?
What was my question before all these other parts?
Like I said,
about...
for God's sake,
it's just...
Yeah,
it's just...
Oh, you were...
Okay, so you were saying that
people can have different bodies,
we were saying,
and then they could 3-print whatever body they want,
but you have different bodies
that you can choose from.
So a guy,
or you could be a guy one day.
What's interesting is that
you have experienced a goal
as your own community.
As a man.
That's something you want to be,
to try to experience that?
No,
I'm just trying to imagine.
So imagine some community that...
Oh.
Abilities like this always change your body,
and you're coming to your community,
and you're not recognizing each other.
Right.
Right?
It's like,
it's always a new stranger.
Right.
And if you...
Because if you can change your mind,
if you understand it,
you can change your mind.
Right?
But let's say,
so imagine like,
you have to like,
so then to learn to meditate
is hard for many people, right?
It's like,
there are some really excellent thinking,
but some people are fact resistant.
They, you know,
like they just can't...
They're at a threshold in their mental state
where they can't accept new information
from people who are outside their
sort of circle,
outside of their culture,
because they're just not
tuned in
to the same reality.
Right?
I got lost in my own museum.
I got lost in my trampot.
I was like,
what are we talking about?
Sorry.
I have my grandma blanket.
I am good.
You're good.
Okay.
Let me get my...
Let me get my bat in here.
That was yours.
Let me take my lighter.
You have your lighter.
Let's see.
Turn off my recorder.
