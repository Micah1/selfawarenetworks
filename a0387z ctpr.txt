(oscillat, decoherence, super position, electromagnetism, conjecture, observer, vector, dissipation) Now I'm really certain that my Quantum Gravity Equation Hypothesis is a brand new exciting idea that replaces the extra dimensions in string theory. The Kaluza-Klein theory of extra dimensions led to string theory.

The main conjecture is that all mass warps space at all scales, and that space that is unwarped is a photon, but that the energy of an ideal photon breaks down at random, resulting in warped space that expands in both time and area simultaneously.

At the quantum scale any and all particles, except ideal photons (the theoretically kind that has no mass and travels at C, in reality we don't know if real photons match our ideal of a photon, the photons that we do see might have some tiny amount of mass, and they might not travel at the speed of light perfectly, we may never know.)

In addition virtual particles, and virtual atoms that could exist exert a dissipative force on particles, its like if the threshold for the existence of a particle is almost met, but not completely met, then the virtual particle is dissipated instead, and its dissipation is what I think is the repulsive force in electromagnetism, and below threshold energy dissipation from virtual configurations (of almost particles) is probably the weak nuclear force.

The strong nuclear force, that brings together a positive proton with a positive neutron is something like orbital velocity, the two positive objects are out of phase, so they can slow each other down, get stuck together, almost like a planet orbiting a sun but different, because it's more like a kinectic orbit, not a literal orbit, the mass that each creates slows down time in the immediate vicinity, that is enough to curve space at the quantum level, and the curved space between the proton and the neutron is what keeps them close together, even as they are also repulsed by another.

It has been said that an electron's spin is intrinsic, the story goes that we can't describe the electron's spin as kinectic angular momentum or potential angular momentum, intrinsic meaning that it can't be separated from an electron, and that's true in one sense, but there is a state where the electron can be split into a spinon, a orbiton, and the holon (or chargon).

So an electron is a mass with charge with a spin, and if its spin is removed then its not an electron by definition, but, by the same token if an electron is not really a fundamental particle, it's chargon+an orbiton+a spinon, that kinds says that an electron really actually can lose its spin, so spin is not intrinsic to particles after all.

I think this means that we can actually think of an electron's spin as a kinectic angular momentum, one that is defined by the electron's relationship with the field that its in, or more specifically the electron's spin is about its last relationship with some other particle that it interacted with, be it a virtual particle, its emergence from a photon (it's split from it's anti-matter opposite the positron) it's interaction with a space warping atom, or its interaction with an observer oscillator, or is interaction with an electromagnet.

An interesting thing to think about it is that when an electron is in superposition, it's argued that it may have either an up or down spin, and that only by measuring the electron does its collapse into having an actual spin of either up or down, but when the states of superposition are described they are described as either up or down or both, but do we really know that the state of super position is not potentially also like the state of spin-charge separation, where there is no electron in super position but instead there is just a chargon (holon), an orbiton, and a spinon? Perhaps we can think of these components of an electron as like the super position state of an electron, and that the energy change from the measurement of that field is the catalyst for the emergence of the electron & specific spin. I'm arguing that by observing or measuring the field of space we are adding energy to the field of space and that is causing space to energize in response which results in the emergence of particles from virtual particles, by measuring we are pushing the energy threshold up high enough for "the collapse" of space or the convergence of space into particles.

This idea of quantum gravity replaces the extra dimension of string theory, because every mass, from an electron, to an atom, to a molecule is creating a traffic jam in the particle field, which causes particles to flow around it, which causes space to expand in time/space dimensions, these extra dimensions of time and space resolve themselves into the appearance of the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time, but at the particle level there is a gradient of time dimensions that we don't see with our eyes but that particles react to.

Think of it like if you have 1 dimension of time, in addition to a dimension of space, but its around an atom, then time around that atom is warped so that particles have to travel faster to go around it, but they also become more likely to go towards that atom, because if a particle could travel in any of 6 directions in normal space, up down left right forward and back, in a 3D vector field, every added dimension of time, created by an atom warping space, means that there is an additional change that the particle will move towards that object that is warping space, and that it has to have higher energy to avoid moving toward that object in a sense. Warped spacetime is creating extra dimensions for particles to travel. These extra dimensions are not curled up and too small to see.

In short the potential number of extra dimensions is every possible combination of mass, from the plank scale, the electron scale, the atom scale, and so on. Every particle combination, atom combination, virtual particle & below threshold virtual atom configuration is going to be space warping in a way that creates extra dimensions for particles to travel via time.

Superposition, at the particle scale things are moving so much faster relative to the human scale because mass/time is slowed by the space that is warped by mass/time

mass&time are the same thing

mass/time/amplitude / energy/space/frequency 

duration/length/topology/complexityconfiguration (information patterns) / space/dissipation/entropy/chaos
